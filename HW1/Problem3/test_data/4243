I say this especially, Commissioner, so that you can communicate to the Commission, and particularly to Mr Fischler, the fact that the common fisheries policy is one of the few areas of Community activity where until now very few steps have been taken in the creation of a genuine internal market.
The lack of action is related to the original conception of this policy.
The current Council Regulation No 3760/92 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture, provides for derogations in respect of the internal market, notably in Articles 6 and 7, which allow derogations from the principle of freedom of access to fishing grounds, so that Member States have the right of exclusive exploitation of their fisheries resources within a 12-mile coastal band, as well as a series of preferential fishing rights, through application of the 'relative stability' principle, which distributes national fishing quotas.
At the same time it lays down restrictions on exercising fishing activities in certain areas known as 'boxes' .
These restrictions on the principle of freedom of action, which were originally intended to be temporary restrictions, have been extended and will be in force until 1 January 2003 as a mechanism to allow certain Member States' fishing industries to adapt to the rules of free competition in an increasingly open and globalised market.
Over 20 years have passed and, as we are about to embark upon a general review of all aspects of the common fisheries policy which, for compelling legal reasons, must take place in 2002, it is now time, I believe, to examine whether the transitional period for adaptation to free competition provided for in the said regulation should be ended.
In my opinion, the fishing industry and the common fisheries policy should also be subject to derogations in respect of the internal market.
Therefore, the principles and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties should also be applied to fisheries, in other words, the framework of the common fisheries policy should be brought into line with the general legal framework of Community legislation.
Mr President, on behalf of our Group I should like to warmly welcome Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s excellent report.
As she said in her introduction, she has made the very wise decision to focus on what are the most critical issues for the creation of the single market.
I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes.
The first one is the need to address, within the Union, the impact of legislation on business.
It is particularly important that we ask the Commission to reinforce its activities, to ensure proper compliance cost assessment and to assess the costs on businesses of the new legislation.
I say to the Commissioner that we do not expect this to be done as an after-thought, after all the departments in the Commission have developed legislation.
It needs to be an integral part of the policy and regulation process.
He must make sure that from now on that a central objective is to help the internal market to move forward.
We were delighted to see a second point on the agenda at Lisbon.
Our committee and, indeed, our Group has been emphasising, since this new Parliament started last year, the need to encourage the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises across the European Union.
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s report emphasises a number of key points such as the need to make business formation cheaper and quicker and the need to remove some of the barriers preventing entrepreneurs from benefiting from the risks of putting capital into starting up new businesses.
I am disappointed to see that our Socialist colleagues are proposing that clause should be taken out of this resolution.
I can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow.
I invite colleagues to reject that proposal.
I conclude by confirming that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market will continue to press vigorously for the speedy completion of the internal market.
I give credit to all our colleagues, across all political groups, for the speed with which we have dealt with the electronic commerce directive this week.
I hope that is appreciated.
I hope it will demonstrate that we are prepared to work with speed.
I hope that, together, we can really make the internal market work as quickly as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel nothing but appreciation for Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s clear draft report.
It concisely outlines and highlights the key points from the Commission' s communication on the strategy to be followed for Europe' s internal market.
I would like to highlight some of these points.
The promised dialogue between the Commission on the one hand and business and citizens on the other is to be welcomed because the relationship between the Commission, the European Parliament and society should, after all, be interactive.
In order to keep pace with the present breakneck speed at which technology is developing, it is not only desirable but essential to keep the dialogue going.
So far, the average citizen has had insufficient insight into what drives the Union and what can be gained from European cooperation.
This is why information campaigns are essential. After all, Europe cannot afford to remain a remote spectacle.
Back to basics should be our motto.
The e-Europe initiative praises the use and expertise of Internet and multimedia.
This is very commendable indeed but, rather than just creating a frame, it is more important to give substance to education.
I would like to repeat the words of the French President spoken at the official opening of this Parliament building and I quote: "We must create a citizens' Europe in which each individual gradually comes to see that he or she has a role to play.
We have a duty to build this great common house in which each individual nevertheless feels at home. A house in which everyone lives together, in a spirit of solidarity, but in which each individual retains his or her identity" .
In order to meet these objectives, the residents need to get to know and get a feel for their house, or rather their home.
In order to build a genuine internal market, we should, more than anything, concentrate on promoting the interests of small and medium-sized businesses.
To this day, there are still too many obstacles. Companies' competitiveness and dynamism depend directly on a regulating climate which is conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship.
Finally, I can only echo the need for SLIM.
Legislation must become simpler and must be written in a clear language.
Superfluous legislation should be withdrawn.
It would therefore be beneficial to draw up a scoreboard of laws which have been abolished.
Mr President, I would like to speak on a point of order.
During the debate, Mr Harbour referred to an amendment tabled on behalf of Mrs Berger and myself - Amendment No 2, paragraph 22(2).
If I am not mistaken, Mr Harbour said that he was opposed to our amendment.
I believe that there has been a little confusion.
In the Spanish version which I have there is no problem.
The amendment is based on the German text, which causes some concern because it refers to the issue of share options.
I imagine that in the English text which Mr Harbour has there is no problem either.
The Spanish text simply says "remove the barriers imposed on entrepreneurs capitalising on company value through the issue of share options on the stock exchange" .
If this is the correct text, there is really no problem, in which case I would withdraw that amendment and simply ask for the German version to be adapted to what is said in the Spanish text.
Mr President, many thanks for giving me the floor regarding an issue which is very dear to the Commission as a whole and myself, in particular, namely the new strategy for the internal market.
To begin with, I would like to extend my warm thanks to Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for the ardent support she has shown for the set of measures proposed by the Commission.
The Commission feels confirmed in its intention thanks to this important vote of confidence coming from this Parliament.
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has mentioned three topics.
First of all, she stressed the importance of the internal market as a forum in the world, which is essential for the competitiveness of European industry and the European service industry, and she is absolutely right, of course.
This is, in fact, echoed in Mrs Berger' s remarks, who stated that the internal market is not an old hat one can simply take off, the internal market is and will remain essential to European competitiveness as a forum in the world.
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s second remark highlights a number of inconsistencies.
According to her, sometimes one does not know where one stands.
This would be a serious shortcoming if it were true to this extent.
Needless to say, the Commission attempts to establish internal consistency between rules, but it is, of course, possible for rules to be in conflict with one another in certain areas.
If this were the case, then the Commission would be more than happy to rectify this situation.
I would like to thank Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and the other Members for their comments regarding specific inconsistencies between rules. This will enable the Commission to do something about this.
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s third remark concerns the change in culture.
This is an important yet very difficult topic, which predominantly refers to the availability of risk capital, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has also pointed out.
There happen to be bankers in the risk capital industry who believe that Europe has the money but lacks the entrepreneurs.
In other words, according to these bankers I spoke to recently, the bottleneck is not so much due to the availability of capital as to the availability of entrepreneurs. This is tied in with the economic culture.
I happen to disagree with these critics.
Responsibility lies with both camps.
The bottleneck is the result of both the availability of risk capital, especially the cost of risk capital, but we are also, of course, lacking the sufficient entrepreneurship.
This is down to Europe' s economic culture which still instils in us the belief that bankruptcy will stay with a young entrepreneur for a long time, while in the United States, as everyone knows, bankruptcy is taken far more lightly.
I hence agree with Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi that something needs to be done to breathe new life into Europe' s entrepreneurial culture.
Moreover, I suspect that in the light of developments, which are termed the "new economy" , an increasing number of, mainly, young people, young entrepreneurs, will be encouraged to start up a business.
After having expressed my thanks once again to the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, I would now like to move on to remarks made by Mr Berenguer Fuster.
According to him, the Commission should have more political courage, especially in the fiscal domain.
My response to Mr Berenguer Fuster is: should the Commission have yet more political courage?
What the Commission is trying to bring about is already so hard to achieve.
That does not just pertain to the topic that was under discussion earlier this evening, namely the coordination of taxes and tax legislation regarding pension contributions.
It also concerns the taxation package formulated by my predecessor, Mr Monti.
Moreover, during the discussion of the previous topic, Mr Lipietz remarked that he, and probably his group too, is not prepared to further liberalise the provision of financial services if the package, also known as the Monti package, is not adopted.
I would like to oppose such reasoning which has no foundations in the real world.
It would be an example of cutting off your nose to spite your face, if Parliament or the Commission were to say that they refuse to make further attempts to integrate the financial services if no progress were made in terms of the taxation package.
This would not be the right attitude, in my opinion.
Although Mr Berenguer Fuster has not said this in so many words of course, I would still like to take the opportunity to stress this point.
I ask Mr Berenguer Fuster if he would like the Commission to have yet more political courage?
We are already struggling to achieve what we have proposed.
I would like to see the Commission achieve what it has proposed to do first and then take it from there.
Mr Berenguer Fuster has also said that a great deal still needs to be done in the field of financial services.
And he is right, of course.
Mr Berenguer Fuster is undoubtedly familiar with the action plan for financial services which was adopted on 13 May 1999 and which includes 43 objectives.
We are in the process of achieving these, at least we are in the process of achieving those objectives that need to be achieved this year.
I am hoping, on behalf of the Commission, to make certain proposals regarding pensions, for example - we discussed this topic a moment ago - but also regarding the opening up of markets for postal services, regarding the public provision of goods and services, public tendering etc., before the summer recess. We are truly active in the field which is dear to Mr Berenguer Fuster.
I would now like to comment on a remark made by Mr Medina Ortega.
He said that at present, there is a risk of state monopolies being replaced by private monopolies.
I would like to assure Mr Medina Ortega that this is, of course, by no means the intention.
Replacing a state monopoly by a private monopoly only makes matters worse.
This is certainly not the intention of this Commission.
What the Commission does intend to do, however, is to add substance to the decisions taken by the European Council at Lisbon, namely to free up the markets for gas, electricity, transport and postal services a lot faster.
The Commission is trying to flesh this out and this also means that those state monopolies need to allow for more competition in the fields I mentioned a moment ago.
But, I repeat, the prospect of replacing state monopolies by private monopolies is something which we do not exactly relish.
I would then like to come back to the remarks made by Mr Harbour, who, like Mr Beysen and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, was absolutely right to highlight the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and the costs related to running these businesses.
The Commission is aware that, for example, the costs involved in establishing a business or a small business over here far outstrip the costs in the United States.
To give you an idea of the cost difference, it takes an average of five days to set up a small or medium-sized business in the United States.
In Europe it takes far longer, even as long as five months, a ratio of 1 in 30.
This is, of course, directly reflected in the cost.
If we then talk about culture, and I am addressing Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi once again, we need to try to do something about these establishment costs of small businesses very quickly, because otherwise we will naturally come off second-best in the competitive battle with North America.
Finally, I would like to turn to Mrs Berger as I have already responded to Mr Beysen' s remarks concerning small and medium-sized businesses.
I have quoted what Mrs Berger said earlier about the hat which you cannot simply take off.
I like this metaphor because it is true that European citizens have the feeling that this internal market is already in place. They take it for granted and do not give it any further thought.
This could not be further from the truth.
The internal market is far from complete.
We must - and the Commission does, in fact - work on it week in week out and defend it, because the internal market is subject to constant pressure, and the Member States fall back into old, protectionist habits which we need to fight.
Mrs Berger was right to refer to directives which remain in the Council.
We are all familiar with examples of directives which remain in a vacuum for five, ten or even fifteen years because they are not adopted by the Council.
Let us hope that this will change.
If you will allow me to highlight one aspect of it: we all hope, of course, that the difference of opinion which is keeping Spain and the United Kingdom divided over a well-known rock in the Southern half of this continent, will now be resolved.
I read in an article in a Spanish newspaper that the issue is moving in the right direction. This would actually unblock half a dozen directives.
We are all waiting for this moment.
To sum up, on the subject of Echelon, I can assure Mrs Berger that this is completely unrelated to the internal market and does not form any threat to it whatsoever.
Mr President, this concludes my remarks.
Could I once again express my appreciation to the Members of Parliament and the rapporteur, in particular, for the important vote of confidence which we received from Parliament regarding the new strategy for the internal market?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
2001: European Year of Languages
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0099/2000) by Mr GraÃ§a Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision: European Year of Languages 2001 [COM(1999) 485 - C5-0278/1999 - 1999/0208(COD)]
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr GraÃ§a Moura for a splendid piece of work and for the energy he has put into drawing up this report.
I should also like to thank the Council for being so accommodating and the Commission for the role it has played as mediator, especially just recently.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support initiatives which may create greater awareness of the value of linguistic diversity in the European Union.
It is important that the EU' s citizens should be encouraged to learn foreign languages early on in school and also throughout their lives.
A knowledge of languages is important, for European languages are of great significance to European culture and civilisation, and people need good language skills in order to be able to find employment in EU countries other than their own.
The programme for the European Year of Languages offers a splendid basis for providing information about the many different opportunities there are for learning foreign languages, and it is important.
Mr GraÃ§a Moura' s proposal includes the 11 official EU languages, together with a number of other languages recognised by the Member States, including Irish and Luxembourgish.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party also thinks that the programme should include other languages which are actually used in the various Member States, for instance Catalan in Spain and Frisian in the Netherlands.
Finally, in the programme for the European Year of Languages, consideration is also given to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, something which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party consider to be crucial to all EU programmes.
On behalf of the Group, I can recommend supporting this programme.
Mr President, needless to say, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent and exquisite work.
I would like to make a few minor observations regarding a European campaign which intends to teach Europeans languages from other communities.
We are all convinced of the usefulness of this exercise, of course.
But the thing that often goes wrong with European campaigns - and fortunately I have not been around long enough as a politician to be unaware how the ordinary citizen reacts to this - is that, very often, they are nothing but an attractive front, pretty to look at but insubstantial.
I would therefore like to think that this campaign will offer something different, and that, more importantly, consideration will be given to why it is so hard for people in Europe to learn languages, and at what stages in their lives they are able to learn languages.
I come from a bilingual country myself and I have met some people in that country who never learn the other language, despite the fact that they attend language classes, sometimes for twelve years, and are still unable to speak another language.
This is a terrible observation to have to make.
I therefore hope that in the course of this year of European languages, research will be carried out into the best language teaching methods and, more than anything, how Europeans can be encouraged to learn the language of the other Europeans using a modern and appealing method.
Mr President, after I too have congratulated the rapporteur, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, who has done such a good job that it won the unanimous support of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I would like to focus my attention on just one point, namely that in addition to the human, cultural and political advantages, the need to learn more than one language is also of considerable economic benefit.
The report also highlights the findings of all the experts: having a good command of one' s mother tongue and learning classical languages, especially Latin and classical Greek, makes it easier to learn other languages.
I would also add our own mother tongue to the equation.
This great truth emerges from a fact rather unknown to most, that in the English language, for example, there are at least 75 000 words of Greek origin.
I repeat, 75 000 English words derive from classical Greek.
There are a similar number of words in the French language that derive from Greek, and the same is true of most other modern European languages.
It is also certain that Latin is just as important for most European languages.
The English sage, Francis Bacon, said that knowledge is power, so knowledge of the basic languages from which our modern European languages derive improves our general knowledge and reinforces European civilisation, which, besides its humanitarian value, is also a weapon for our survival and prosperity as Europeans in a globalised economy.
Besides, the contemporary German professors, August and Werner-Karl Heisenberg, have characterised both classical and modern Greek as the mother and nurturer of human civilisation.
I believe that revival of the teaching of Latin and classical Greek in middle education will also provide a cultural shield for the younger generations against the onslaught of the generally levelling effect of the American cultural message, so that only its positive elements are preserved.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur.
The European Year of Languages is important and worthwhile.
All the languages of Europe are equally valuable and worthy of respect in terms of culture.
It could be said that the people who speak the same language share the same mentality.
The mother tongue is not merely a tool of communication, it is in fact more than anything else, it is thought itself.
Language is the most peaceful way of communicating.
Independence is language and language is independence.
The Kurds are a nation with no land or borders of their own, kept together only by language.
Language is a powerful force.
It is the most important bond for a nation.
Large countries, and many smaller ones too, often tyrannise others through language.
It is a means of occupation.
The legislation regarding language in my country is among the most liberal in the world.
We have seen how two different foreign languages have twice been proclaimed the official language; only at the beginning of last century did our language, Finnish, become the official one.
That is why we have guaranteed the important status of minority languages.
The multilingual nature of the European Union is thus a source of wealth.
At the same time it is also the right of each citizen in each Member State.
The multilingual nature of Europe must be preserved after enlargement too; there are no obstacles to this.
It is wrong to think that a multilingual environment is costly and ineffective.
Translation is not costly; it is the most effective practical instrument of peace.
Mr President, in addition to congratulating the rapporteur, I would like to highlight in this debate that the idea for this celebration originates from the Council of Europe, an institution with a particular sensitivity towards the cultural and social aspects of the old continent, which, with its initiative of increasing the knowledge and use of more languages by Europeans, hopes to promote understanding and tolerance and bring citizens closer together.
When we speak of European languages, let us not forget that this does not only mean the official languages of the Member States.
In Europe, many other languages are spoken, some of them thousands of years old such as Euskera in the Basque Country or Gaelic, whose origins have been lost in the mists of time, and others such as Catalan, Galician and Alsatian, which is spoken right here in Strasbourg.
This initiative should also benefit all these other regional and minority languages, and the bodies created by the Member States to organise participation in the European Year of Languages must also include representatives of these other languages, which are also European, and which are the essence and lifeblood of the wealth of our unity in diversity.
Furthermore, the learning of languages leads to an awareness of our cultural diversity and contributes to the eradication of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, which forms part of our Community objectives.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and, at the same time, the rapporteur, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, for having permitted so many amendments, many of them open to broadening the scope of the Year and extending it to rural areas and the least favoured areas.
However, I would also like to express certain concerns with regard to the economic restrictions.
I would recommend that many projects be allowed since it is clear that cultural projects attract a lot of investment from Autonomous Regions and private initiatives which we cannot afford to lose.
I would also ask, in this era when emotions often take precedence over good sense, that we do not support projects which are aimed at exclusion and the use of language to support positions which often seek to cause divisions between people, when the objective of this programme is to unite people.
I would also like to see the European Union begin to take great care of languages which have no country, maternal languages which often have no school and no teachers; languages which are spoken throughout Europe, which no state accepts and which will never become official.
I am referring, for example, to Ladino and Yiddish.
These languages furthermore do not have any media of their own.
Of the 150 languages which are spoken in Europe, we should make a list of those which are only transmitted from mothers to their children, which are only spoken in a domestic setting and which, currently, with the invasion of the media and with the official use of languages in schools, will have very few years to live.
I would like this European Year of Languages to be opened up to them as well and that a space be made for them so that they may be considered in any other future programmes which may take place.
Mr President, I should like to address my remarks on languages to my fellow Members, of course, but also to our interpreters, who enable this Parliament to function, to the rapporteur, of course, not for his work as rapporteur but because he is also a poet in this Parliament and, moreover, as I have discovered, one who speaks my mother tongue perfectly.
What better rapporteur could there be?
When one is a new Member of the European Parliament, as I am, one finds oneself dealing with all sorts of things: chocolate, end-of-life vehicles, the qualified majority, dried beans, Spanish lentils, anything and everything.
Then, suddenly, one finds that one is going to have to deal with something that gives Europe its historic and cultural depth, namely its languages.
And when one looks back at the great periods in history, and I am thinking here of the Renaissance, that great age of trade and commerce, what remains of that era today are the cultural achievements, the artefacts of our heritage, and thus will it ever be.
In terms of languages, Europe has known times when a single language predominated: Latin, and also French.
Now it tends to be English.
So what are we to tell our fellow citizens for this year 2001.
Let me just briefly mention a few points.
Firstly, that European unity may not mean linguistic unity.
Next, that every language is deserving of respect and deserves to be promoted and defended.
This is applicable to any amount of things: monuments, objects, you name it.
Why should it not be the case for mankind' s best and most lasting achievement, i.e. his method of communicating with his neighbour?
And then, all languages are learnt within the family first of all.
This is why we call them "mother tongues" , and no State, whatever it may be, may have the direct, indirect, explicit or implicit goal of destroying one of its mother tongues, or of allowing it to disappear.
Furthermore, finally, without linguistic diversity, there is no Europe, because this is also one of the few, and perhaps the only, parliament in the world which operates in eleven languages, to the extent that occasionally we speak in this House for the purpose of being interpreted and not to be heard in the original.
It is up to us to construct this dialectic of European unity and its linguistic diversity.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Youth
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0100/2000) by Mrs GrÃ¶ner, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the Community action programme for youth [C5-0116/2000 - 1998/0197(COD)]
Mr President, I am very pleased to add my support and my group' s support to this report.
This report had a long gestation period.
But the fact that we are still here so early in the morning is a tribute to the rapporteur' s work on this programme and, indeed, that of the Commissioner and the Portuguese presidency - which has shown itself to be committed to youth, to the voluntary service and to education in its broadest sense.
The report we have ended up with now is more closely targeted, with an emphasis on social protection and, as the rapporteur has said, a more flexible approach than in earlier reports.
We also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance.
We will always ask for more money.
The budget is not enough.
It is perhaps Parliament' s role to ask for more.
But we can be pleased with the outcome.
We can be sure that whatever money we have in this programme will be directed at youth and will, in the long-term, be money well spent.
I agree with the rapporteur that this money and this programme will ensure that the efforts are targeted not just at some small sections of society but, as the Commissioner said in a previous report, at all sections of society.
We must look to those who will benefit most and those who are in greatest need and who might otherwise be socially excluded.
We are delighted that some candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe will benefit as well.
We can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report.
In seven years' time we will look back at the youth of today who will have benefited from this report and be pleased that this was the beginning of real progress.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs GrÃ¶ner for her splendid work and for the personal, almost passionate commitment she has shown in preparing the present report.
I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for contributing to our at long last achieving a good result.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support those initiatives which give young people in Europe opportunities to acquire knowledge, skills and qualifications which will help form the basis of their future development.
The strength of the programme is, of course, that, by means of cross-national exchanges, it encourages young people to contribute actively to further European integration.
It will also lead to understanding of the cultural and linguistic diversity within the European Union.
I also think that the programme will ensure that the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded will continue to be propagated.
Through increased communication between young people in Europe, the programme will indirectly help combat xenophobia and increase respect for human rights.
Finally, the Community' s action programme for youth also gives consideration to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, something which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believe to be of crucial importance to all EU programmes.
I would recommend that we support this programme.
Mr President, I also commend the report and thank Mrs GrÃ¶ner for the excellent effort she has made.
It is a very good report.
Youth is the sector in our Community that is so often ignored.
Indeed in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport it is the "Cinderella" sector of funding, as with sport.
We hope that imbalance will be redressed.
The insufficient commitment to youth affairs from the Council, when the European Parliament was calling for EUR 980 million, shows, in my view, this grave disparity and the lack of commitment on the part of the Council to a very important sector.
The danger, in this regard, with the changes that are proposed, of combining two programmes - Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service - is that several good parts of both those programmes might be lost.
I hope that does not happen.
We should include the best parts of those excellent initiatives in whatever programme we formulate in future.
The new Youth Programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries.
That is an excellent initiative.
The bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite Europe.
The agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that I welcome.
When more funds are needed, budgets should not be cast in stone but be flexible so that they can be amended in the best interests of the deserving needs of youth.
What more deserving cause could there be than supporting youth in the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to join all those who have congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs GrÃ¶ner, who has produced an excellent report, full of commitment, on behalf of young people.
In her task she has enjoyed the very strong support of the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
I offer them my thanks for their work.
The Youth programme is crucial to the European Union, as you have all already said, because it is a unique programme, in which all young people, without distinction, can participate.
I would like to reassure all Members who have spoken about possible sanctions.
In the Youth programme and in the way it is implemented, there will be no sanctions against anyone, and that includes young Austrians, who will not be discriminated against.
The programme has ambitious objectives, which are essential to the development of the idea of European citizenship.
This programme will encourage and consolidate the continuation and development of innovative actions at Community level and will help to improve the quality of the action undertaken on behalf of young people.
It therefore represents a useful instrument in assisting a policy of cooperation and will contribute to the process of European integration.
In addition to ensuring that the programme is effectively implemented, I wish to make a commitment before this House that I will encourage a process of structured and regular cooperation with Member States, in order to work towards drawing up action plans that are up to the task of the challenges, and without which the programme would be less effective.
Mr President, I wish to take this opportunity to talk about the youth policy of the future.
In fact, I stood before you for the first time last September.
I spoke of the White Paper on the European Union' s youth policy, which is a priority.
I would now like to clarify the role of this White Paper and the role of political catalyst that youth policy must play in the future.
I hope to prepare the White Paper on the basis of broad consultation with the different parties concerned and when I say the parties involved I mean above all young people.
That is why, at the Youth Council on 23 November last year, I proposed to the Member States' Ministers for Youth that they hold national meetings of young people during the first half of 2000.
This proposal was very warmly received by all the Member States and these meetings are being organised at the moment.
Most Member States have already set dates for them and most of them have also assured me that these meetings will be open, with the participation of all possible parties including, of course, Members of the European Parliament.
These meetings must allow young people to play an active role and to assert their aspirations, their expectations and their opinions, but also their recommendations for political action in the areas that affect them.
The various national meetings will culminate in a huge European meeting which will be held at the beginning of October, under the French Presidency.
At the same time as consulting young people, the Commission hopes to consult those responsible for youth policy at national level.
The Commission hopes that these national authorities will be able to incorporate into their contributions the opinions and expectations of local administrations, which play a considerable role, I believe, in youth policy.
In order to achieve this, the Commission will be holding bilateral meetings with Member States, followed by a discussion seminar with youth leaders.
We will also rely on the various studies on young people, which will be financed under the Youth programme, and the study, already underway, on the status of young people and the situation of youth policy in Europe.
Lastly, I would like to include the European Parliament in this exercise.
The cooperation methods still have to be worked out, but I can assure you as of now that you will be invited to take part in the European meeting of young people and that I will keep you informed on a regular basis on progress in this matter.
To conclude, I would like to emphasise the fact that the consultation process, particularly with regard to young people, will not be a one-off exercise, because the publication of the White Paper will constitute the second stage of this dialogue with the parties involved, and this is a dialogue that I would like to see established on a more permanent basis.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a considerable amount of work to be done, but it is exciting.
As many of you have pointed out, we are not working for politics here, but for the future of our Union, and I hope that the debate launched by the publication of the White Paper will enable us to strengthen our capacity for joint action in order to implement a genuine strategy for developing the talents of these 80 million young citizens in the European Union, towards whom we have a great responsibility.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Before the sitting is closed, I would like to thank the interpreters for their generous cooperation this evening, since we have exceeded the time allotted.

Principles for recording taxes and social contributions
The next item is the report (A5-0073/2000) by Mr KnÃ¶rr BorrÃ s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation clarifying Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 as concerns principles for recording taxes and social contributions (COM(1999) 488 - C5Â­0220/1999 - 1999/0200(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing here today a subject of an extremely technical nature, of the type which, at first sight, appears to refer purely to issues involving the adoption and transposal of procedures and terminology within the European Union, which is the political framework to which they are to be adapted, as is the case with certain instruments in the statistical field.
We are all aware, or at least I think we are, that it is important that statistical data is not only reliable, that is, obtained scientifically and rigorously, but also, above all, comparable.
This is particularly true with regard to the shaping of the European single market, a context in which we require statistical data which is comparable and equivalent between the different Member States.
I would even go so far as to say that this is even truer, if that is possible, in view of the enlargement of the European Union, a process in which the availability and comparability of information, particularly statistical and economic information, must be treated as absolutely crucial.
I do not intend to dwell on the qualities of ESA 95 - the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts - nor on the progress which it represented in relation to the previous 1979 system, an issue which I spoke about in the House at the time of my report on the proposed Council Regulation amending the Regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure.
What should really be underlined is that, in my view, we must firmly support a Commission proposal which, essentially with regard to an issue as serious as the budgets of the Member States, is inclined to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than criteria such as the amounts due in the field of taxes and social contributions.
It is common knowledge, or should be common knowledge, that there are occasions when administrations may record, as due, amounts which they will never collect, however many analyses of collectability are made, and this therefore leads to what is tantamount to a concealed falsification of the public deficit.
This is a serious issue which has been debated.
We should remember that in the Parliament of a Member State there was also a great argument between one of the candidates for the presidency and his opponent, and current President, in which the candidate, Mr Borrell, rightly condemned widespread use of the criterion of income which, since it had not been duly corrected, in reality amounted to a concealment of the deficit in the public accounts.
Ending this type of practice requires clear principles, as the Commission proposes, which in addition allow, very correctly in my judgement, for the calculation of income with the option of using amounts collected or the amounts recorded in a tax document.
This course of action by the Commission, which some people attack because in short they believe it does not once and for all end the practices of concealing deficit, in no way intends to distort the assessment of the amounts in the national accounts but, on the contrary, to arrive at the same figure in two different ways.
One, in my view the more correct way, or at least the more academic way, is the criterion of income, with the corresponding provision concerning collectability, set out in paragraph (a) of Article 3 proposed by the Commission, and the other, set out in paragraph (b) of Article 3, is the criterion of cash receipts adjusted to take account of the time difference between the activity and the cash tax receipt at the end of the financial year.
Both calculation procedures should inevitably lead us to the same figure, which will be the outcome of the tax in that financial year.
I would also add that there is no other accounting method which would correctly record revenue in a budget.
On the other hand, it is obvious that the option to use either of the two methods offers the advantage of a speedier adaptation on the part of those who choose one or other of the systems.
Therefore, I consider that the Commission proposal regarding the treatment of taxes and social contributions in the accounts is both the most correct one and, from every point of view, is effective in view of the possibility that it can be applied immediately.
Nevertheless, we believe that, in order to encourage Member States to gather statistical data, even aggregated data, concerning taxes on products, Article 3 of the Commission proposal should deal with this issue by establishing a similar mechanism for recording and adjusting such taxation.
I therefore take a favourable view of the proposal and I congratulate the Commission.
I would like to repeat that the proposal rightly stresses that we should give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the taxes and social contributions due in the Member States, and allows these two methods of calculation, which make it possible for the systems used by the Member States to be adapted.
A study of the Commission proposal shows that the treatment of taxes and social contributions should indeed follow the two proposed methods.
Finally, I would also like to stress that, consistent with our opinion that the Commission proposal is more an amendment than a clarification and that, moreover, it affects basic concepts, instead of using the procedures under Article 2(2) of Council Regulation 2236/96 of 25 June 1996, for the adoption of changes to the methodology intended to clarify and improve the content of ESA 95, use should instead be made of the introduction procedure set out in Annex A of that regulation.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you, and also the Commission, for your help.
I would be grateful if you could please keep strictly to your speaking time, as our timetable is very tight.
Although Commissioners can, of course, talk for as long as they wish, I would ask them to help me in this regard as well, so that we can finish on time.
Mr President, a Europe that is functioning properly needs transparent and comparable statistical material on its Member States, not least with regard to recording taxes and social contributions.
We have rightly reached agreements in this respect in the European system of national and regional accounts, ESA 95.
On closer examination, it now appears that the information recorded on taxes and social contributions is not as precise as was hoped because it does not always correspond to the amounts actually collected or collectable for a particular assessment year.
The aim of the proposal under discussion is to refine the recording procedure by applying a correction factor both to cash data and data evidenced by assessments and assessment registers.
The PPE-DE Group agrees with the Commission proposal in this regard.
Two questions still remain, however.
In view of the fact that the proposal effectively contains an amendment to the ESA 95 Regulation and that is implicitly acknowledged by the fact that we are applying the codecision procedure, it does seem logical to grant the Member States a transitional period.
The Member States also need time to adjust to new rules.
We have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the PPE-DE Group and would ask our colleagues in the House and the Commission as well to support this amendment.
A second question to the Commission concerns the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs regarding VAT as a basis for calculating the third source of own resources.
I should have liked to hear the Commissioner confirm whether the Commission is indeed drawing up a proposal to amend Article 8 of the ESA 95 Regulation to the effect that all the Member States will, in the future, have an adequate legal basis to use ESA 95 for the calculation of the third source of own resources, that is to say, VAT. I should like a reply from the Commissioner and also, of course, a response from the Commissioner to our amendment.
Mr President, the Commission' s initiative on presenting this regulation intended to unify the principles for recording taxes and social contributions is very appropriate.
In order for the accounting methods of the different Member States to be homogenous, as the rapporteur has pointed out, they must use the same criteria.
It is true that, in accounting terms, both the cash receipt criterion and the income criterion can be allowed, but it is also true that the former allows for less juggling of the figures intended to distort the true accounts situation of a country.
In short, the cash receipt criterion makes it more difficult to indulge in that accounting trickery which used to be known euphemistically as 'creative accounting' .
It is true that the use of those systems has allowed, for example, certain countries to fulfil the Maastricht criteria, but it is also true that their abuse can distort the picture of a country' s true accounts.
As you know, accounts which do not offer a true picture can be called anything but accounts.
The income criterion, if it is not corrected, for example, by means of the obligation to make provision for non-payment, is an inadequate criterion.
The rapporteur mentioned a debate which occurred in Spain which, in short, resulted from the government claiming ESP 750 000 million in 1997 as social security income, which was theoretically owed but which was clearly never going to be collected.
Thanks to this manipulation of the accounts, to this 'creative accounting' , the deficit criteria for joining the first phase of economic and monetary union were complied with.
Obviously, this juggling of accounts will not be possible if the Commission' s proposal is approved.
It is perhaps for this reason that the Spanish Members from the PPE Group have presented certain amendments and have tried to delay the approval of this report.
It is not a question of revising now what was done in the past.
Ladies and gentlemen, what is done is done.
It is a question of demanding, from now on, greater rigour; it is a question of demanding that accounting figures reflect the true picture of a country' s accounts.
We therefore approve of the Commission' s proposal but we do not approve the PPE' s proposal, which is intended to delay the entry into force of this regulation, or the amendments of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which, since it considers that the regulation amounts to an amendment rather than a mere clarification, in reality delays its entry into force.
Ladies and gentlemen, if rigour in accounting is demanded, it should be so from the outset.
Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Mrs Thyssen for her gesture and for her defence of the amendment we are presenting.
I also wish to thank and highlight the patriotism of Mr Berenguer and Mr KnÃ¶rr. This patriotism is consistent because ESA 95 was adopted by the Socialist government, to whose party the former belongs.
Having said this and leaving aside accusations which are truly libellous at the moment, I would like to defend the idea of an extended transition period of two years.
Anybody who knows anything about accounting and who looks at this text with open eyes will know that this implies a profound change in the basic concepts and the data on the resources of the institutional sectors which affect financial companies, non-financial sectors, public administrations and private individuals.
This change is a complicated change.
As any expert knows, the estimations in accordance with ESA 95 require breakdowns which affect no less than 60 accounting categories.
Secondly, this profound and complex change must be done in a gradual way.
As Mrs Thyssen has pointed out, changing and adapting the accounting rules requires a certain amount of time.
At the end of the day this would lead to a fair change because a sudden change would prejudice those States which have adopted the criterion of income, in other words, those which have, to a greater extent, complied with the regulation which entered into force in 1999.
We are being asked to change a regulation which entered into force a few months ago.
The PPE-DE' s amendment asks for the change to be introduced gradually.
Mr President, I think we would all agree that, if we are to run the Community properly, we need a high-quality statistical base within the Community and the applicant countries.
There has been a broad welcome in the House for this proposal and the apparent ability to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the more notional contributions which may be due.
This is certainly a step forward.
It seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit.
So far as the transition period is concerned, many of us will have sympathy with the need for some form of transition because, clearly, if you amend the regulations in such a way that you move from a system which is being used over a long period of time to a completely new system some time will be required.
However, I hope that the countries of the Union will not use this as an excuse, if it is passed, but seek to implement the new system as rapidly as they can - in other words, two years should be regarded as an exception and as a maximum rather than as the normal ration for the job.
On the treatment of taxes and social contributions, I agree with the rapporteur that this is a relevant way of doing the calculations and that we should take a favourable view of the criteria which the Commission intends to set because of the way in which priority is given.
Overall, this is a useful step forward.
I welcome the commitment of the Commission.
I hope that we can work together and see this translated into Community law with suitable adjustments as soon as possible.
Mr President, this debate confirms the Commission' s opinion that we need to provide for the most comparable and transparent statistics possible, since they are essential for the definition of certain basic lines for our actions, and particularly that we need finance to be clarified with regard to its legal formula.
By proposing these amendments, the Commission intended for the recording of taxes and social contributions within the ESA to be carried out according to equivalent methods and, therefore, that there be no differences in approach between the different national public administrations.
This proposal is basically of a technical nature and is intended to fill the current legislative vacuum which allows for differing interpretations depending on the position adopted by each Member State.
The Commission is very happy that our proposal has received broad support and is happy with the report adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I will comment on shortly.
However, I firstly wish to thank especially the rapporteur, Mr KnÃ¶rr BorrÃ s, for his work, which, on this complex and technical issue, has offered us great support.
The rapporteur stresses in his report that the objective of the proposal is to arrive at the same figure, regardless of the statistical sources used, and in reality this is our objective.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has approved eight amendments and the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 without any difficulty.
There is a ninth amendment, presented later, which I will also comment on.
The Commission would prefer not to maintain Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6.
The aim of these amendments differs from that of the regulation.
I understand that, insofar as certain elements of the regulation are amended, we could also discuss the model for calculation of VAT used to determine own resources, but we are talking about a radically different problem.
In response to the concerns of the PPE, I would say that, when asking for the withdrawal of these amendments, logically the Commission must commit itself to presenting a proposal at some point to introduce that amendment, which is absolutely coherent, providing for more correct figures, which we hope will be used in the future to calculate the basis of the contribution to own resources.
We hope that this approach will lead to a resolution of the problem raised.
With regard to Amendment No 9, the issue has been studied by the directorate-general of ECOFIN and by Eurostat and, having analysed the problem in detail, I can tell you, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo, that, in principle, exceptions, in statistical terms, must only be allowed where a Member State is not technically capable of providing data.
This has been the case, for example, with the exceptions allowed for certain Member States within the ESA 95 regulations.
We are therefore talking about a technical problem, of not having the capacity to provide data.
In the case in question, there are no technical difficulties to justify that exception, and the regulation has been substantially amended throughout its negotiation to give it more flexibility, in such a way that, in our opinion, all the difficulties raised by the different Member States can be resolved within the margins of flexibility which the regulation allows.
This is the reason why the Commission does not consider Amendment No 9 to be acceptable.
If everything that has been said here can facilitate a convergence of the positions of both Parliament and the Commission, and if Mr KnÃ¶rr BorrÃ s and the PPE can withdraw the amendments I have mentioned, we believe that this would allow us to make progress with the adoption of the text which will, without doubt, be positive in terms of clarifying future accounts.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
COM in bananas
The next item is the report by Mr Dary (A5-0093/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 on the common organisation of the market in bananas (COM(1999) 582 - C5Â­0277/1999 - 1999/0235(CNS)).
, rapporteur. (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the Commission' s proposed reform of the COM in bananas, seeking to replace the current system by 'tariff only' , were implemented as it stands, it would lead to the disappearance of ACP producers in the short term and Community producers in the medium term.
At the Seattle Summit and then at the Davos Summit, the people of Europe have been able to observe the inability of the WTO to reconcile financial priorities with their own priorities, which are living conditions, working conditions and the quality of the goods they consume. They would not appreciate it if their representatives not only called those values into question today, but actually went further and reneged, in passing, on the Union' s commitment to its ACP partners.
The banana issue is a perfect example of the difficulties the Union is experiencing in establishing the European model the institutions evoke so often.
In that connection the 1993 COM complied with four essential objectives: ensuring the free movement of bananas in the single market while maintaining reasonable prices for consumers, respecting the Union' s commitment to the ACP countries, maintaining Community preference for Union producers like Martinique, Guadeloupe, the Canaries, Madeira and Crete and, finally, respecting GATT obligations.
Under constant attack since its adoption, this regulation eventually led to several WTO rulings against us, the latest in April 1999.
Always quick on the draw, the United States immediately drew up retaliatory trade measures against Union countries.
To comply with the WTO, the Commission is proposing to go over to a 'tariff only' formula, that is, eliminating quotas and introducing a flat rate tariff at an unknown level.
As we know, this system has already been attacked by the majority of operators and producers from all geographic areas.
We are right to question the grounds for an approach which involves changing the rules of the game in midstream, forcing producers to rethink their production plans and marketing forecasts. That has led us to identify reforms complying with the rules of international trade, but not just dictated by it.
The stakes are high.
Since 1993, the position of the Community producers has been constantly deteriorating.
The same applies to many ACP countries, traditional suppliers.
It is impossible for these producers to maintain fair competition with the great producers and operators in the international network.
We should also remember that over 60% of the bananas consumed in the Union come from non-ACP third countries.
It is not a question of practising protectionism, but rather of protecting the permanence of a certain method of production.
It is not just the banana we are trying to defend, but a whole production network, which entire regions often depend on to survive.
The margin of manoeuvre is technically narrow, but the choice of a reform model is political.
We need to know what our objectives are.
As I see it, the first priority is to defend the European model at the international level.
That is certainly the position the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development unanimously adopted.
Here I would like to thank all my colleagues very warmly for their effective cooperation on this issue, and Mr Westendorp and Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n for their excellent work too.
As there are no objective reasons for choosing 'tariff only' , I propose to retain the first option in the Commission' s proposal, the 'transitional' option, and implement it without moving on to 'tariff only' , but with a review of the operation of this reformed COM at the end of a ten year period.
The ACP/European Union Partnership Agreement for Development, which replaces the LomÃ© Convention, provides for a ten-year transition period for the ACP countries, to allow them to conform as closely as they can to WTO rules.
Why should it be any different for bananas?
I also propose ensuring that the level of quotas will not increase the oversupply already noted, and finally, aware that the third quota will henceforth be open to all, I propose increasing the minimum preferential access rate for ACP products to EUR 300.
In any case, accompanying measures are essential to ensure the permanence and viability of Community and ACP production.
I have some suggestions: regionalisation of aid, so as to correct the discrepancies observed between the various areas of Community production, establishment of a cyclone compensation measure, a marketing aid to re-establish the balance with the distribution network for dollar bananas, special support measures for organic production and finally, an acceleration of aid provision.
I hope Parliament will follow the line proposed by the Committee on Agriculture, but we also need the understanding of the Council and the Commission.
Of course, this is not a codecision procedure and the Commission, naturally, can reject all our amendments. At a time when a code of good conduct is being set up between Parliament and the Commission, is it judicious to fail to take account of our opinion, and is it reasonable for either the Commission or the Council to neglect the opinion of the people we represent?
Ladies and gentlemen, as we now have a new report before us and a new team here in the Chamber, I must repeat what I said at the beginning.
I would like to ask for your help in making sure that we finish by 11.30 a.m., as that is when voting time begins, and we cannot overrun.
So I would be grateful if honourable Members could please keep to their speaking time, and I would also ask the Commission to help out here, although they can of course talk for as long as they wish. That way we can finish on time.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
(ES) Mr President, I will be very brief. I simply want to say that, when the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy received Mr Dary' s report, after a detailed examination of the problems facing the banana industry, we came to the conclusion in our committee that the solution proposed by Mr Dary met the absolutely fundamental conditions for its success.
Firstly, with regard to the international obligations of the European Union, not only towards the ACP countries, but also within the World Trade Organisation.
As you know, the European Union has been condemned for its regime of granting licences for this product, but has maintained the viability of the quota regime proposed by Mr Dary.
In fact, in the Commission' s current negotiations, it appears that the main suppliers would prefer this system.
On the other hand, this is the system which best defends the principle of multifunctionality of agriculture, protects the European Union producers, also protects the developing countries, with whom we have a very special relationship, is sensitive to the protection of fundamental social regulations and the protection of the environment and, lastly, it is the system which best obeys the principle of consumer protection.
For all these reasons, my committee voted in favour of Mr Dary' s draft report.
Mr President, we all want to see the end of the 'banana war' , but the immense complexity of the problem deceives no one.
Clearly the banana has become a political issue, with the dispute symbolising a certain conception of world trade, of a Europe which stands by and defends its decisions, its specific political nature and its commitment to the countries of the South.
So on this issue - I know - the Commission' s task is not an easy one.
It is torn between contradictory positions and I understand the difficulties encountered in trying to reconcile the various interests.
But while I share the desire to put an end to a trade war which is poisoning transatlantic relations, this cannot be done at any price, abandoning without compensation the principles of justice and solidarity which guide the action of the European Union.
I, for one - and there are many in this Parliament who feel the same - refuse to see Europe dictated to, even indirectly, by a handful of multinationals with colonialist attitudes and anachronistic social behaviour.
I am sorry, too, that we have not fought for the retention of a specific quota for the ACP countries which alone guaranteed them access to the market.
But the rapporteur' s proposal is satisfactory because it defends the quota system and rejects any automatic move to an exclusively tariff-based regime.
So I thank him and I also thank Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n for putting the committee' s point of view.
Of course, the ACP countries know they must adapt to world trade.
But let us give them time.
Let us give them enough time, let us give them the means to produce their plants themselves, let us help them build their greenhouses.
Let us encourage organic farming and, in ten years, believe me, the price of African bananas will have fallen to the level of dollar bananas.
They will then become competitive.
If we impose the brutality of an exclusively tariff-based regime too rapidly, bananas are going to taste incredibly bitter to thousands of small African producers.
Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on whose behalf I speak, broadly supports the report by Mr Dary and, in general, rejects the Commission' s proposal.
The European Commission has made this proposal supposedly in a spirit of consensus but, frankly, having analysed it at length with the best will in the world, I cannot find a single reason to accept it.
I take comfort in the fact that I am not the only one.
The Commission' s proposal has not been well received by anyone, neither by the Community producers, nor by the ACP countries.
It seems that the Council cannot easily accept it. Parliament does not like it either.
What is even more serious however is that not even the United States like it.
In this proposal, the Commission not only renounces the defence of Community interests and the interests of the ACP countries but has also, in my opinion, abandoned the minimum degree of neutrality required.
The World Trade Organisation condemned the system of licences in force, which must undoubtedly be modified.
However, the Commission proposes many other things. It proposes removing any type of quota, and I would like to ask: does it intend in the future to remove the system of aid to producers?
Has the Commission decided to begin the reform of the common agricultural policy with a reform of the COM in bananas?
After bananas, will other sectors fall?
When will we stop protecting Austrian white wines, for example,?
This clearly remains an open question within the WTO.
However, after the experience of Seattle, I suppose that we should have learnt something from the point of view expressed by the developing countries and, especially, in this case, by the ACP countries, with whom we have commitments and obligations to fulfil.
It is in defence of our obligations and commitments to the ACP countries that the amendments have been presented on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking for our 'shadow' rapporteur, Mr Vatanen, and I would like to mention that this is now the fifth time since 1993 and the introduction of the common organisation of the market in bananas that the WTO has considered the Community rules to run counter to international trade regulations.
The banana controversy is a good example of how hard it is to reconcile the interests of the fifteen Member States, the Union, the ACP banana producing countries, European consumers and our trading partners.
I congratulate the Commission for striving to reach a compromise that has regard to the various interest groups.
It is right that the European Union should bear responsibility for seeing that European agricultural producers, including banana producers, earn a sufficient income.
It is not right, however, that the EU and businesses operating within its territory should suffer annual losses of around EUR 400 million because of trade sanctions by the USA and Ecuador, which are a result of our violating the GATT agreement with regard to banana imports.
I would like to express my concern regarding the consequences of Mr Dary' s report for trade policy.
To adopt the report as it is could result in a strong reaction from our trading partners, as it does not even include the possibility of talks to ease access to the market.
There is strong evidence that some Latin American countries will refuse to accept import quotas - at least not without the prospect of better access to EU markets.
For this reason, I would appeal to you to support Mr Chichester' s Amendment No 38, which states that if the EU does not abolish import quotas it will at least indicate its intention to start official WTO talks on the future distribution of import quotas.
The Union has lost the banana dispute in the WTO four times already and it cannot afford to lose a fifth time, for three reasons.
Firstly, the continuation, despite the bans by the WTO, of the EU' s import quota system, which has been found to be discriminatory will lead to the continuance of trade sanctions costing hundreds of millions of euros.
Secondly, if our trading partners receive permission from the WTO to even disregard intellectual property rights, the costs of sanctions will be enormous and could cause long-term damage to EU businesses.
Thirdly, continued breaches of the regulations will hurt our image internationally in matters of trade, which might weaken the case for the European agricultural subsidy model.
This, meanwhile, would have very serious consequences for the whole of European agriculture.
It is high time we showed ourselves to be credible and mature trading partners, as waking up to the realities of the present will accord with our real interests in the long term.
Mr President, the WTO has challenged our Community regulation on bananas several times and each time we have had to redefine the content of this COM and suffer the burden of the fines imposed on us as reparations for damage caused.
It is certainly not easy to find a balanced response which would satisfy our four objectives, which are: supplying consumers at reasonable prices, guaranteeing a future to our Community producers, honouring the Union' s commitments to ACP countries and, finally, at the same time, presenting a case which cannot be attacked by the WTO.
However, in the light of these four concerns, Mr Dary' s proposal is entirely apt, at least that was the feeling of Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in unanimously supporting it, a quite exceptional occurrence for such a sensitive subject.
In fact it seems to us that the choice of maintaining the import quotas plus preferential tariffs for the ACP countries for ten years, instead of six, would make it possible to plan for the future of Community and ACP producers, who face a form of competition tantamount to social and environmental dumping.
That we are seeking elimination of any automatic movement to 'tariff only' should not be regarded as downright rejection of the measure.
Our intention is to let the situation develop in a way that is economically and socially tolerable for our producers and those of the ACP countries, without damaging the openness of our market.
So the European Union certainly has arguments to present to the WTO, so that this time our approach is recognised as valid.
Of course, the Union may have difficulty determining the quotas in the immediate future, but is that exercise any more difficult than agreeing on adjustments to the customs tariff in the 'tariff only' hypothesis?
For my part I am convinced that the approaching start of the next WTO cycle should mean we can handle this issue positively in a more global context and for that I am counting on the Commission' s determination.
Mr President, it is high time that we resolved this complex and long-standing issue once and for all.
As we all know, there are many competing claims - the claims of ACP banana producers, Community banana producers, EU businesses which have been hit hard by US sanctions, the EU's role and standing in the WTO and, of course, the rights and interests of European banana consumers.
It will not be possible to satisfy fully all these claims and therefore we have to accept a compromise.
The Commission's proposal is a compromise between those who demand an immediate move to a tariff only system and those who wish to ignore the WTO rulings and stick with the flawed regime as it is.
That is why the majority of the ELDR Group supports the Commission's proposal to continue a tariff-rate quota system for a transitional period before moving to a definitive tariff only system.
The Dary report, on the other hand, is premised on the somewhat unrealistic notion that we can ignore rulings from the WTO altogether.
It gives complete priority to the concerns of EU banana producers over the equally legitimate concerns of innocent EU businesses in other sectors suffering from arbitrary US sanctions.
Most strange of all, it risks complicating matters so much further that the Commission, as stated in its proposal of November last year, will be obliged to move directly to a tariff only system. This would be exactly the opposite of the objectives of those who support this report.
I have also heard that during the vote, which will take place either today or tomorrow, some may advocate referral back to committee.
This would be an undignified act of foot-dragging which would do nothing to address the long-term issues at stake.
We need stability for European and ACP banana producers and EU consumers.
That can be done by rejecting this report and supporting the Commission's compromise proposal.
Mr President, the common organisation of markets in the banana sector has allowed this sector, which is fundamental to the sometimes fragile economies of the ACP countries and the outermost regions of the European Union, to function.
Less than seven years have passed since the entry into force of the COM on bananas, and the Commission is now proposing a profound modification of its operation.
Furthermore, this has been preceded by disputes within the World Trade Organisation which have generated uncertainties and which have led to difficulties in its correct functioning for Community producers.
For us, a transitional period until 2006, as proposed by the Commission, is not acceptable, and we should wait at least until 2010 before deciding on possible reforms.
On the other hand, an exclusively tariff-based system is not coherent with the achievement of the objectives of the COM, given that it does not guarantee access to the market or the survival of the Community and ACP producers.
The Commission proposes a quota of 353 000 tonnes and a possible increase in the event of a rise in demand.
Given that the additional tariff quota is not consolidated, its quantity should be capable of being adapted to Community demand, not only in the event of an increase, but also in the event of a decrease.
In any event, we should safeguard the Community preference and prevent any marginalisation of Community production.
Lastly, special attention should be given to the development of the situation of the Community and ACP producers, who are already in a vulnerable position and will be even more so in a context of intense and open competition.
The Commission must carry out a report in advance assessing the consequences of the application of any modification of the system in order to provide the due compensation for its negative effects on prices and incomes as a result of the increase in the global income in question.
I would therefore, Mr President, like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr Dary.
We support his report.
He has been generous with the amendments of the different political groups.
Furthermore, I hope that the Commission will send a clear political signal which will take account of his points of view.
Mr President, the reason we are having to express our opinion on a draft for the banana COM yet again, for the fifth time since 1993, is the relentless attacks on the Community regime by three large American multinationals. They dominate the world market in bananas and the WTO backed their interests after an appeal was lodged by the United States, which is also imposing very heavy unilateral sanctions on a series of our companies.
But, in fact, almost 60% of the 4 million tonnes of bananas consumed annually in the European Union are supplied not by Community or ACP producers, but by Latin American third countries where the American companies run vast plantations under production conditions characterised by scant regard for social and environmental concerns.
In traditional ACP countries and Union countries, which already have only a minority share of the European market, bananas are grown in small production units, usually family concerns, and in areas where there is no real possibility of alternative occupation.
So they represent an essential element in the balance of the economic and social fabric of these fragile territories.
After having driven the Ivory Coast to despair to allow five multinationals to lower their production costs to the detriment of cocoa producers, are we now going to grant three American multinationals the exclusive right to the world market for bananas, including the European market, ruining our own producers and those of our ACP partners into the bargain?
Are we willing to sacrifice production which means life or death to some of our territories for peace at the WTO?
Unfortunately, that certainly seems to be the route the Commission has chosen, with a short and dangerous transitional system and an exclusively tariff - and uncertain - formula as from 2006, which would imperil both ACP and European production and put the Community banana market under the control of a few large operators, able to set the profit margins through the commercialisation of dollar bananas.
So the Commission' s proposal is in line with neither the interests of Community and ACP producers, nor the long-term interests of European consumers, because it actually encourages the emergence of a far from competitive market situation.
That is why it has been unanimously rejected not only by our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but also by the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and the French Parliament.
So I hope our Parliament will follow the Committee on Agriculture, and the European Commission will feel obliged to make new proposals to us, more in accordance with European interests and our cooperation with the ACP countries.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, seven out of every ten bananas eaten in Europe come from Central America via three multinationals, all with reduced customs duties of EUR 75 per tonne instead of EUR 850.
We are giving the United States a marvellous present there!
Well, it is not enough!
The United States wants more.
Technically, what does it want?
It wants the end of import licences, because the B licences give Community bananas and ACP bananas priority sales over dollar bananas.
But, most of all and politically, the United States actually wants the monopoly of the future Eastern European market for their multinationals.
What is Europe doing to face that challenge?
It is divided and getting bogged down.
We are divided from our German friends.
Indeed, because of the ancient links with the 1945 German diaspora to Latin America, Germany has eaten 100% dollar bananas since 1960 - though at first they were 'armband' bananas.
So much so - it is an open secret - that the three American banana multinationals put their banana butter on SPD and CDU parsnips.
But we are also getting bogged down in technical proposals.
Thus the Commission proposes, before surrendering totally to the United States, a six-year transition period when, in essence, there would be three quotas, including the ACP quota and the dollar quota.
From 2006, there would no longer be anything but a common customs tariff which would have equal impact on the bananas of the poor of Africa and the bananas of the rich, the multinationals.
We could undoubtedly challenge that, and our excellent rapporteur, Mr Dary, does challenge it.
He proposes that the respite of six years be extended to ten years.
Another four years, Mr American executioner!
And we have tabled amendments too.
We call for regionalisation of aid, because Guadeloupe is further away than the Canaries; quarterly payment; cyclone compensation; the maintenance of the ACP quota; historical guidelines for imports, instead of first come, first served.
Well, all that is very fine, but the battle is elsewhere.
The battle is for Community preference, first and foremost.
We have to choose: either the Canaries, Madeira and the Antilles - or Chiquita.
It is regional policy that is at stake.
Do we want the outermost regions which depend 100% on bananas, like the Canaries, to survive, or do we want Dole and Chiquita to accumulate more wealth?
It is cooperation policy that is at stake.
We have to choose: either Africa and the LomÃ© Convention, or the WTO.
We have to choose: either Europe' s social policy and human rights, or the multinational slave-drivers who produce with social costs totalling 8% instead of the 42% social costs in the Canaries, Madeira or the Antilles.
This is about protection of financial interests, because when OLAF disputes a few centimes of Members' taxi expenses yet is not interested in the annual present of two billion dollars from Chiquita, there is a problem.
The United States was found guilty of two billion dollars' worth of fiscal fraud and it has changed nothing.
When the United States alters its policy, we will discuss the mere 191 million for bananas.
When the United States stops cheating for the benefit of Boeing, Kodak, Cargil and Ford, we will discuss bananas.
In the meantime, we need long, global, political negotiations.
We must talk about Iraq, Echelon, Serbia; put everything on the table.
Sanction for sanction, retaliation for retaliation.
The banana is a moment of truth. Europe can either surrender or stand up and be counted.
There is a saying that bananas can be eaten from both ends.
Does Europe want to stand up or be eaten from both ends?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must put an end to the tug of war over a system that complies with the WTO Agreement.
The EU has not exactly covered itself in glory in this almost endless debate.
I respect the Member States' efforts to protect their banana producers against a considerable loss of income, but such considerations cannot justify persistently refusing to comply with agreements under international law.
It should be our objective to create a market organisation consistent with the WTO dispute settlement body' s proposals as soon as possible, chiefly in the interests of companies which, because of the introduction of the COM in bananas, have been forced to accept financial losses which have threatened their very existence.
This is also in the interests of those who have been hit by the punitive tariffs imposed by the United States.
No one should underestimate the adverse impact of export restrictions of this kind on the economies of export-oriented countries, and above all on related jobs.
This is an area where some Member States are indulging in protectionism at the expense of others.
We pay subsidies to banana producers, we have to grapple with punitive tariffs, and we have to pay excessive banana prices in our supermarkets.
Those Member States who want to continue with these restrictions have to recognise that they are partly to blame for the current situation, because they have quite simply forgotten to make structural changes in the field of banana production.
The lack of competitiveness of EU banana production cannot be allowed to justify a refusal to accept uniform and non-discriminatory access to the European market.
Mr President, Commissioner, it falls to me to summarise the problems of the COM in bananas in just a few minutes.
That is a considerable challenge and one which makes no sense unless we understand what is really at stake in this issue. It has been a source of conflict for at least a decade, both at the trading level - between the operators - and at the institutional and international level.
The reason for that is simple.
The banana is now one of the great basic human foodstuffs and control of the trade clearly has a geostrategic dimension.
This is a tropical fruit marketed in the Northern hemisphere and its distribution is also a fundamental part of North-South cooperation.
The real question we face is whether or not the European Union can succeed in organising, within its own market, a juxtaposition of flows from the producer regions of Europe, the ACP countries and Latin America.
Today we are debating a proposal from the European Commission which, by providing for an automatic swing towards tariffs, will lead to the ineluctable disappearance of production in European regions, which currently represents 25% of our market supply.
Such a development would be contrary to the actual purpose of regional policy and the common agricultural policy - the two pillars of the European Union - and we do not want that under any circumstances.
So we must resolutely set the prospect to one side by adopting the Dary report. I congratulate and thank Mr Dary.
For those fundamental reasons, and to protect the interests of consumers on the European market by maintaining a juxtaposition of flows from the Union, the ACP countries and third countries, in the context of genuine and sustained competition based on an adequate number of operators, we ask you to accept all the proposed amendments.
Failure on this sensitive banana issue would be an admission of weakness on the part of the European Union and would represent a very strong and rousing signal, exploited by all opponents of the common agricultural policy to oppose the social, family and multi-functional agricultural model.
It is our duty to preserve everything the Union stands for, especially on the eve of its enlargement.
Mr President, the defenders of the interests of the multinationals in this Parliament have not studied the subject of bananas properly.
They have not studied it properly because they talk about the multiple decisions of the World Trade Organisation and Community violations of international law.
In fact, so far the World Trade Organisation has only declared two extremes incompatible with international commercial law.
The first is the partnership system which linked the importing of non-Community bananas with that of Community bananas.
Community regulations on bananas were modified to comply with that decision.
The second refers to the incompatibility of the exemption in favour of ACP countries within the Community system.
In other respects, the Community system is wholly in accordance with community rules, international law and the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
The problem is that in this case the Commission has been more papist than the Pope and, as Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n has pointed out, more in favour of free trade than the multinationals themselves.
In other words, at the moment the Commission wants to throw out the banana with everything else - it wants to throw out the baby with the bath water. It does not remain within the strict limits of compliance with our international obligations, but it is taking a political decision which would lead - as Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n pointed out - to the dismantling of the whole of our Community agricultural policy.
The Dary report, the Westendorp opinion and the FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n opinion ask the Commission to adapt so as to conform to international law, not to go beyond what it is laid down by the World Trade Organisation, to negotiate and, furthermore, to take account of the fact that, if we give in on this point, we are going to give in on other more important points, such as the maintenance of social and environmental policy requirements on a global level, which is how we stand internationally.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Commission' s proposal on the reform of the banana sector is negative, unacceptable and disastrous for the agricultural sector in the outermost regions and the ACP countries affected by it, which, of course, supply 40% of the Community market.
I have put this so strongly because, if implemented in the terms which have been laid out, it would lead to the sinking of the economies of thousands of families who live off this very special activity on Community islands such as the Canaries, Madeira, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Crete, not forgetting the producing areas of the ACP countries.
It would therefore lead to social and economic deterioration in regions which are already least favoured and suffering serious and permanent difficulties with their development, with horrendous difficulties in terms of conversion and which are vulnerable to the uniform and homogenous commercial measures which are taken at international level.
In my opinion, the European Commission has given in to such measures, incapable of recognising the regional agricultural reality and diversity of the countries of the Union and the need for a genuine policy of solidarity and cooperation with the ACP countries which, until recently, were colonial territories of countries which now form part of the Union.
Therefore, it is a good thing that the Commission is receptive to the report by Mr Dary, who I congratulate, and the amendments tabled, which are intended to achieve the following: correct the imbalances created by globalisation and persuade the Commission to be sensitive to the problems of banana-producing families, not to submit to imports with single customs tariffs and to fight where necessary to maintain, for a reasonable period, its commitment to the citizens and the agricultural organisations involved. These organisations make up one of the most vulnerable sectors of very special regions of the Union and the ACP countries, with the accompanying social, economic and environmental repercussions.
For many of us, bananas are a national issue, since they are related to our history and our culture.
Mr President, it is important for this House to approve Mr Dary' s report, as the Commission proposal to introduce a tariff only system for banana imports by 2006 is unacceptable.
The flat-rate system that the Commission intends to introduce would cause producers in the outermost regions of the European Union, such as Madeira and the ACP countries, to go bankrupt.
Furthermore, the fiasco at the last World Trade Organisation meeting demonstrated that the WTO is in no position to meet the expectations and demands of the public and of consumers in certain respects, such as product quality, environmental protection, training, social conditions and worker protection, as is evident from the report.
If our policies are to be consistent with our declarations of support for the ACP countries and for the development of the outermost regions of the European Union, we cannot allow agriculture in those regions and its future development - in which the production and export of bananas play a major part - to be squeezed by waves of dollar bananas from the large plantations that banana multinationals own in Latin America.
It is against this background that we are supporting most of the amendments in the report, which we also contributed to. I have in mind in particular the call for a transitional period of not less than 10 years, and which should not imply a move to a tariff only system, as the Commission should assess the impact of the new situation on prices and on the income of banana producers in these regions, so as to ensure that compensatory aid can be adjusted, based on the principle of guaranteed income for producers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the long run, we cannot swim against the tide of free and fair world trade with the common organisation of the market in bananas.
We ourselves also have to observe the rules that we signed up to when the WTO was founded.
By infringing them and thus triggering sanctions, we are already blocking access to the major US markets - and also increasingly to Latin America' s markets - for whole sectors of our economy.
We will be jointly responsible for large numbers of lay-offs in these sectors if we as the European Union do not change our stance.
That is why we - and I am now speaking on behalf of a significant minority in the PPE Group, which could be a majority the next time - support the Commission' s position.
Following a transitional period, a tariff of EUR 275 per tonne is to be introduced for bananas from third countries, from which bananas from ACP countries would be exempt.
This will protect the essential interests of the ACP producer countries.
However, the Achilles' heel of the Commission' s proposals is the lack of sufficient protection for the interests of banana producers within the European Union, essentially in the peripheral regions and the overseas departments.
They are up in arms about this omission - particularly our French colleagues, and I assume the same applies to Portugal and Spain.
Commissioner Fischler, things are not as the officials in your directorate-general perhaps claim - and I would also like to address this comment to Mr Lamy.
The arrangements for EU banana producers are not as good as they might be.
There is still a need for a political compromise here.
The structural measures envisaged in Title III of the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas need to be considerably strengthened.
If we made just 10-20% of the total punitive tariffs of EUR 400 million, that is to say EUR 40-80 million, available as agriculture budget appropriations, instead of diverting it for other purposes, we could help our banana producers a great deal.
I call on the Commission to improve the structural measures and so open up the way for a compromise which is fundamentally in accordance with your proposals.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to present my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr Dary, because he has chosen the path of resistance and not renunciation on this complex issue.
Indeed, we find the Commission' s new proposal unacceptable, because it makes unacceptable concessions to the multinationals of Latin America.
Is there anyone in this Parliament unaware of the role played by these multinationals in financing American campaigns?
Is anyone here unaware that the food safety conditions involved in the production of these bananas are dubious to say the least, and the social conditions are dominated by total disregard for the rights of men, women and children?
Who can ignore that by bending to the diktat of the United States - under cover of the WTO - the European Union would throw 35 000 of its own nationals in the Canaries and over 30 000 in the French overseas territories out of work?
Because, ladies and gentlemen, adopting a 'tariff only' system after a transitional period of six years, as the Commission proposes, would truly condemn our producers to failure and despair.
That is why, like Mr Dary, I urge the maintenance of quotas and I oppose automatic passage to the tariff system, because, for my part, I refuse to sacrifice our producers in Martinique or Guadeloupe on the altar of a liberalisation beyond all regulation.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us make no mistake, if Europe surrenders on the banana issue today, it will surrender on sugar or rum tomorrow, and the next day it will have to abandon its social model and its development policy.
That is why I want to tell Commissioners Fischler and Lamy, in all seriousness, that, while I understand their legitimate desire to put an end to this dispute, they cannot do it at the expense of the poorest citizens in the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the banana regime of the European Union has already been condemned four times by the World Trade Organisation.
After the United States, Ecuador has also now obtained permission to take retaliatory action for an amount of USD 200 million.
Let us not forget that such punitive measures serve absolutely no purpose at all for our banana producers, but have extremely negative effects on European industry and employment.
Therefore, we cannot afford to be condemned like this again.
We must now come to an arrangement as quickly as possible that complies with the rulings of the WTO, with the promises made to the ACP countries and which is in the interests of our producers and consumers.
That is not easy, but the present system is untenable.
We must, therefore, urgently find and accept a compromise and a more liberal attitude.
In view of the fact that the Commission proposal, in my modest opinion, meets these requirements, I shall support it.
Commissioner, I too remember the European Union introducing a regulation in 1993 on the organisation of the market in bananas, so as to ensure protection of outlets and income for Community producers and to guarantee the exports of the ACP countries to the Community market.
Although they do not produce a single kilo of bananas, the United States has complained to the WTO about the Community banana import regime.
Their one aim was to defend the interests of their great banana companies which are effectively ravaging Latin America and which already dominate over 70% of the world market.
In 1999, the WTO panel, orchestrated by the United States, condemned the Community' s import licences system.
The Commission has submitted to that verdict by amending the market conditions to end up with a 'tariff only' system in 2006.
The implementation of this new regulation, which actually goes beyond the WTO ruling, would call into question the distribution of Community and ACP products and would aggravate an already fragile social situation, especially in the French Overseas Territories where the selling price of bananas had already fallen below 3 francs in 1998 and was less than 2 francs in 1999.
I am glad the Committee on Agriculture has rejected not only the amendments championed by the intermediaries of the American multinationals, but also the Commission' s proposals.
I entirely approve of the Dary report which opposes the automatic move to a 'tariff only' system and which defends the principles which presided over the establishment of the common organisation of markets, especially Community preference.
By adopting the Dary report, we will be sending the Council and the Commission the clear signal that our Parliament is determined to defend the interests of Community and ACP producers, to make the WTO recognise that the preferential agreements constitute development aid instruments.
Our vote will also express our rejection of any compromise with the United States that would sacrifice the Community and ACP producers to the profit of the dollar banana.
Mr President, I would like to start by putting some questions to the Commission in the person of Commissioner Fischler.
Why is it that for the banana trade you are advocating pure and simple liberalisation with effect from 2006, whereas in the case of meat, milk and cereals, which absorb 68% of EAGGF Guarantee Section resources, you refer to the special characteristics of European agriculture, as the Commission did in Seattle?
Surely it is unacceptable to be applying two different sets of criteria.
Is the Commission not guilty of double standards here?
Are bananas the poor relation of agricultural production in the European Union?
Should the European agricultural model not be used to safeguard banana production in the European Union which will certainly be threatened by the liberalisation being proposed?
Is there also a plan to liberalise trade in meat, milk and cereals?
Will the Commission yield to the more radical approach adopted by the United States at a time when the Americans are significantly increasing their support for agriculture?
Is no attention being paid at all to the fact that bananas are the main agricultural product in four outermost regions which are amongst the 10 most disadvantaged regions in the European Union?
What is the relevance of Article 299(2) of the Treaty, which provides for special treatment for the outermost regions, to the proposal to amend the Regulation on the COM in bananas?
The multi-functionality of European agriculture, which is a key aspect of the European agricultural model I have already mentioned, needs to be reflected in this reform, since in Madeira, for example (the region that I represent in this House) the environmental aspect of agriculture is as important as, or even more important than, its economic aspect.
If banana production were to cease on the island of Madeira, it would represent an enormous environmental catastrophe as well as a serious loss of income for thousands of families.
Furthermore, as we saw in Seattle, the new round of WTO negotiations should be a genuine development round.
For this reason, we can justify giving priority to bananas produced in the European Union and in the ACP countries when we reform the common organisation of the market in bananas and this would be perfectly legitimate.
And it is only by maintaining import quotas that we can achieve this objective, which is perfectly compatible with World Trade Organisation rules.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, banana production has a special significance in certain less developed countries, signatories to the ACP agreements, island regions such as Crete, and, in particular, outermost regions such as Madeira, the Canary Islands, Martinique and Guadeloupe.
We are not talking about fully developed regions in the centre of Europe which have countless alternatives when faced with changes in market conditions, and where the common agricultural policy invests most of its resources.
For this reason it is not possible for us to accept radical changes in the Community' s trade policy in this field unless we take full account of its regional impact and unless we take the necessary measures in this field in terms of economic and social cohesion.
The Lisbon European Council instructed the Commission to present as quickly as possible practical measures aimed at implementing the Commission' s report on the application of Article 299(2) in relation to the outermost regions.
Agriculture is absolutely vital to many of these regions, which are hoping that the Commission will act swiftly and decisively to maintain regional conditions for agricultural development.
Mr President, I believe that these Commission proposals will mean that a number of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries will go out of business.
That will lead to poverty and even more deprivation.
Yes, we have to simplify the system.
It is far too complicated at the moment.
But I believe those countries need time to diversify properly and that is why I would agree with a ten-year transitional period.
Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte, who produce in Latin American countries, have not seen their production levels go down since 1993.
Their access to the market has not gone down since 1993.
All they want to do is get more access to the market at the expense of the ACP countries.
Yes, we have to find a solution.
Producers in the UK are being held to ransom by the USA.
We must not let ACP countries go to the wall just to save companies in the EU.
This is not just about bananas; it is about trade with developing countries overall.
I am quite aware of the inconsistencies in the common organisation of the market in bananas and associated relations with the WTO.
It is difficult to take into account the various requirements and follow a policy which will favour the weakest parties and supply a high-quality product at affordable prices.
Having said that, it is not that I do not think it is possible, as put forward in the Commission proposal, to adopt, as of 2006, a system which does not impose quota restrictions or tariffs on ACP countries or any other countries.
Postponing this until 2010 would not make much difference, although that would undoubtedly give us more time to find less damaging solutions.
The Commission' s proposal is too similar to the proposal of the Council of Ministers, which does not consider it necessary to allocate part of the budget to a policy of cooperation and protection of the Community' s primary producers in accordance with WTO negotiations.
Rather than adapting to the WTO system, we should endeavour to reform it without giving in to blackmail by US multinationals which make a profit out of exploiting poor countries.
We are all aware of the illiberal acts of these multinationals, which are destroying and corrupting both people and the environment.
The challenge should be to reform the WTO.
The Seattle Summit and the huge public demonstrations made the need plain.
We must reform the WTO, without adversely affecting development and protection policies for poor countries, small producers and craftsmen, but, as per the Dary report on facilitating access to the market for fair-trade organisations in order to invest in environmentally-friendly and socially viable farming practices.
This should be the European Union' s policy.
Mr President, I speak from three perspectives.
That of external trade, where I believe the European Union should uphold progress towards a liberalised world-trade order; that of industry, European industry, where jobs and industries are at threat from sanctions and they are innocent victims of these sanctions; and I speak from the perspective of a UK Member of this House who is tired of receiving letters of complaint from companies whose business and whose workers' jobs are at threat from the sanctions through no fault of their own.
I regret various aspects of this Dary report.
I have to say that this timescale of ten years is wholly unrealistic and unreasonable.
I regret the attempt to cling on to quotas and to interfere with trade in that way.
Of course, I also regret proposals for higher rates of tariff, which is another intervention in trade.
The amendment, which has been put down in my name and others, calls for a negotiated settlement of this dispute, which is World Trade Organisation compatible.
That is essential.
We have been down this road several times now and innocent companies and jobs are at risk and being threatened as a result of our failure to come to grips with this situation.
I support the Commissioner's efforts.
He has a difficult task.
I have to say that I cannot think of anything more reasonable or pragmatic or sensible than the amendment which a number of colleagues have supported me in submitting.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like many of my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party, I reject the Dary report, but there are also some amendments that seem very reasonable to me.
I have in mind above all Amendments Nos 33 and 34.
Amendment No 33 calls for financial support for ecologically sound farming in third countries also.
Amendment No 34 calls for fair trade bananas to be supported regardless of their country of origin.
By the way, I think it is a shame that the Greens are not taking part in this debate and also highlighting these aspects.
But through these two amendments this House is clearly indicating that it also wants a global approach, and there are certainly small producers who behave in an exemplary fashion, not only in the traditional ACP countries and in the EU, but also in Latin America and in the non-traditional ACP countries.
In Ecuador, 60% of banana producers are small producers with less than 20 hectares, and they are suffering from unjustifiable discrimination.
The world is not just black and white, as some people would have us believe, and the Latin American countries have been quite justified in their complaints to the WTO about our common market organisation.
That is why contradictions exist within the Dary report, which, on the one hand, advocates a global approach and support for fair trade bananas throughout the world, but, at the same time, continues to create difficulties of this kind for small producers in Latin America.
I consider fixing the quotas for ten years to be a step in the wrong direction, and I believe that the Commission was already going the right way before this.
To my mind, they could have moved rather more forcefully towards liberalisation, but they were going in the right direction.
I would of course be delighted if Mr Chichester' s amendment, which I have also signed, were to be accepted, but I would like to tell Commissioner Fischler that even if this amendment is not accepted, Amendment No 5, which was accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, will give him the remit of coming up with a workable compromise acceptable to the WTO.
That is why I believe that the Commission will, in any case, have a mandate to negotiate, including a mandate from Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am not going to enter into a discussion of the Dary report, nor discuss its fundamental points, but I do wish to say that the official position of the PPE Group is in support of the entire Dary report.
That is the official position.
Commissioner, your proposal does not accord with the objectives nor resolve the problems being suffered by the banana industry and politically it is not worthy of our producers. Mr Schwaiger recognised this a moment ago.
Nor does the Commission' s proposal comply with our international commitments.
However, the most serious problem is that, immersed in difficult negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, we are showing publicly, in black and white, where our weak points lie.
Therefore, Commissioner, I ask you to listen to this Parliament - not simply to hear us - and to take note of the directions indicated in the Dary report and the opinions of the two competent committees.
This Parliament is sending you a very clear political message, unanimously from the committee responsible in this area, and I hope that this House will support it by a majority. Judging by the great political sensitivity which you have always shown, I am sure that you will understand that message.
Furthermore, I am sure that you will find a viable route in the direction indicated.
Therefore, Commissioner, act politically, find a solution and listen to this Parliament.
This is not the time to fail to take account of this House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you, Mr Dary, for your wide-ranging and appreciative comments on the Commission' s proposal to amend the common organisation of the market in bananas.
By way of introduction, I would like to stress that the Commission takes a positive view of the principles behind many of the amendments, such as the system of historical references for the allocation of quotas.
In fact, these reflect our discussions with the WTO complainants and the ACP producers.
However, the Commission believes that we should not amend our proposal at this delicate stage in the discussions, and I therefore have no alternative but to reject your amendments.
I would like to give my reasons for this rejection area by area.
The first area is the deletion of references to a tariff only system and an automatic move to such a system after a certain transitional period.
I will make no bones about it: the main objective of our proposal is to bring the COM in bananas into line with WTO rules.
The most important part of the proposal is the introduction of the tariff system after a certain transitional period.
On the other hand, this requires agreement with interested parties on the management of tariff quotas during the transitional period.
The Commission firmly believes that your wish to replace the tariff system with a permanent tariff quota system will only lead to renewed attacks in the WTO.
In addition, I would like to point out that the proposal already includes a request to the Council to empower the Commission to enter into negotiations under Article XXVIII of the GATT, so there is no need to refer to this in the regulation.
The second important area is the issue of managing tariff quotas.
The Commission is attempting to negotiate with the principal suppliers about allocating tariff quotas on the basis of historical references.
It would not be advisable to additionally define the individual options until these discussions have been concluded.
Furthermore, with regard to the demand that the tariff quota administration system should not have an adverse effect on operators and producers already present on the market, I must say that if we have to modify the whole COM now, there can be no guarantee that things will stay exactly as they were.
That really would be demanding the impossible.
Our discussions have also covered other alternatives for managing quota C. However, the Commission believes that it would not be appropriate at present to modify its proposal for auctions in relation to quota C, because auctions of this kind are, in any case, a reliable method of allocating licences.
The third area, which relates to quotas, is the extension of the period for maintaining the quota system to at least 10 years.
The Commission considers that extending the period in this way would reduce the credibility of the central theme of our proposal, which is that the COM in bananas should be brought into line with the WTO rules as soon as possible.
As we explained in the explanatory memorandum, the quickest way to do this is through the tariff system.
The Commission has proposed the transitional period because it gives time for producers within the Community and in the ACP countries to prepare for the new system.
Furthermore, if we moved automatically to a tariff only system, there would be no point in having an interim review or an appraisal at the end of the transitional period.
With regard to the tariff preference for ACP countries, the Commission believes that EUR 275 per tonne is sufficient to secure access to the Community market for these countries.
A higher preference would also lead to renewed attacks in the WTO.
If the higher preference limited Latin American countries' access under quota C, this could be interpreted as if we wanted in practice to introduce a special ACP quota.
I shall now turn to the special support measures for our own producers in the European Union.
As I have already said, the principle aim of the Commission' s proposal is to bring the COM into line with the WTO' s final ruling.
The final ruling does not affect our intra-Community support system.
Furthermore, I would like to point out that this is a deficiency payment system, which means that it has a built-in guarantee.
If prices fall, subsidies automatically increase.
My last point is about measures giving equal access to organic and fair trade bananas.
There are already horizontal measures in place guaranteeing equal access for organic bananas from third countries and organic bananas from the Community.
In addition, the European Union can grant subsidies for the production of organic bananas under the agri-environmental measures envisaged in the development plan for rural areas.
Measures to support sales of organic bananas can be financed under national and regional programmes.
Fair trade bananas would also come under the horizontal measures for fair trade, which, I hope, will soon be adopted on the basis of a Commission communication to this effect.
As you know, this communication is not just about fair trade bananas, but about fair trade in general.
In addition to the possibilities I have just mentioned, it is also possible to provide support for developing production of organic bananas and also of fair trade bananas in the ACP countries under the Regulation establishing a special framework of assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas.
The Commission is grateful for the wide-ranging discussions that have taken place here today.
Even if it feels unable to accept Parliament' s amendments because of the current international situation, I must say that the whole dossier has been handled very constructively and comprehensively in the various committees that have contributed to the Dary report and in the recent hearing held by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
I shall suspend the sitting until the President arrives.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)
Vote
Madam President, at the appropriate moment, I would ask you, pursuant to Rule 161(1) of the Rules of Procedure, to request that the rapporteur and the Chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control explain their position in relation to the coherence between the explanatory statement and the resolution that we are voting on.
Madam President, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, Chairman of the Socialist Group, also directed a comment to me.
Last Monday we did indeed have a wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the admissibility of this question, and on whether, as chair of the committee, I should make use of Rule 161.
Almost every member of the committee spoke on this.
I myself have several times looked into the connection between the resolution, as it now appears in the compromise, and the explanatory statement, which reflects the rapporteur' s position and is her responsibility.
I established the connection, and I said in the clearest terms that the language in the explanatory statement before us is very harsh.
Nevertheless, I do not think I should comment on the style and choice of words in a censorious way, because I would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement.
As I see it, there is a factual connection and I therefore decided not to reject this explanatory statement and informed the committee accordingly.
Madam President, I tabled this amendment, along with 37 colleagues from the European People' s Party, because I was appalled at the way the media had exploited the explanatory statement which, as everyone should know but obviously does not, is the responsibility of the rapporteur and in no way commits the House.
I was struck by the contradiction in tone between the explanatory statement and the content of the resolution. They are radically different.
That is why I tabled this amendment.
Having said that, I think you are right, Madam President, to declare it admissible because the vote this amendment involves is not a vote for or against the explanatory statement, but is simply intended to highlight the distance between that explanatory statement and the resolution.
After the explanations given by both Mrs Stauner and Mrs Theato, who has stated publicly in the clearest possible way that the explanatory statement is only the responsibility of the rapporteur and in no way commits the House, I consider the amendment no longer necessary, and that is why I am withdrawing it.
Madam President, I would like firstly to point out that the rapporteur has not mentioned what is laid down in Rule 161(1) which - and I quote the French version - says explicitly: "... l' exposÃ© des motifs doit Ãªtre conforme au texte de la proposition de rÃ©solution..." [the explanatory statement must accord with the text of the motion for a resolution].
I understand, after the chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s explanation of the basis of the question, that her explanations should be recorded in the Minutes, not only for parliamentary purposes, but also for the purposes of any possible use of this explanatory statement.
Therefore, bearing in mind that the rapporteur has not spoken on this fundamental issue, I understand that the amendment still makes sense and the Group of the Party of European Socialists accepts it.
In other words, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, you will take over Amendment No 5, on behalf of your Group, pursuant to Rule 139 of the Rules of Procedure.
Is that correct?
Yes, Madam President, and furthermore, I would be grateful if, on such a sensitive issue, the rapporteur could speak on the basis of the question, as she is required to do.
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I shall support Mr BarÃ³n Crespo' s proposal.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, I have not specifically reiterated this point, but I am sure you will realise that when I was drafting both the resolution and the text of the explanatory statement I was very acutely aware that they needed to be in accord with each other, and I have really searched my soul about this over the last few weeks.
I did not think it was necessary to say this again explicitly, but if you wish I will gladly do that.
I like to think that I am sufficiently conscientious and intellectually able for you to assume that I would have considered this long and hard, and that I am happy to take responsibility for this and to face all the consequences that you seem to be threatening me with.
on Amendment No 5

Madam President, just so that things are clear, I withdrew the amendment because I considered it unnecessary, but as it is being voted on I obviously support it and I invite my friends to do the same.
After the vote on Amendment No 5
Madam President, although some people are pleased at the decision that has been taken, this creates a very dangerous precedent.
Whenever, in future, there is an explanatory statement which some in the House do not like we have established that every time we will be able to vote against if we wish to do so.
Madam President, since an explanation of vote has already taken place, I believe that this vote is important because it puts a stop to the temptation to write intolerable political pamphlets in relation to Parliament' s resolutions.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0089/2000) by Mr RÃŒhle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on postponement of the decision concerning discharge to the Commission in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1998 financial year (COM(1999) 227 - C5Â­0003/1999 - 1999/2004(DEC)); on granting discharge to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, Dublin, for the 1998 financial year (C5-0150/2000 - 2000/2094(DEC)); on granting discharge to the European Centre for Vocational Training, Thessaloniki, for the 1998 financial year (C5Â­0149/2000 - 2000/2093(DEC)); on granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1998 financial year; Section IV - Court Of Justice, Section V - Court Of Auditors, Section VI - Part B - Committee of the Regions (SEC(1999) 414 - C5Â­0008/1999 - 1999/2166(DEC); on postponement of the decision concerning discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1998 financial year: Section VI - Part A - Economic And Social Committee (SEC(1999) 414 - C5Â­0008/1999 - 1999/2166(DEC))
before the vote
We had a problem when we had to prepare the voting list, which was that we could not find the amendment tabled by the Greens, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for point 5.
I do not know whether it is possible to have it read out so that we have the chance to adopt a position on it.
Yes, I am afraid that will delay our work a little, Mrs Frahm.
I will try to be as clear as possible in taking the votes.
(Parliament adopted the two resolutions and three decisions in successive votes)
Report (A5-0092/2000) by Mr Khanbhai, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on granting discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) for the 1998 financial year (C5-0153/2000 - 2000/2077(DEC))
(Parliament adopted the two decisions and the resolution in successive votes)
Report (A5-0097/2000) by Mr Kuhne, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge in respect of implementation of the general budget for the financial year 1998 - Section I - European Parliament/Ombudsman Annex (SEC(1999)0414 - C5-0008/1999 - 1999/2051(DEC))
before the vote
Madam President, there are two amendments tabled to Mr Kuhne's report which propose to postpone discharge for Parliament.
These amendments make reference to the Secretary-General.
If either of these amendments is adopted, will you, as President of Parliament, assume full political responsibility for their content and take the consequences if the demands set out in them are not met by the deadlines.
Mr van Hulten, as President, I take responsibility for declaring these amendments admissible.
I am not expressing an opinion on their content.
Parliament has not yet voted on them.
The problem facing me is whether they are admissible or not.
I am telling you that I sincerely and honestly believe, after examining the position, that these amendments are admissible.
If they are voted through they will obviously be implemented, like everything else we vote for.
on Amendment No 4
Madam President, we have an amendment before us which allegedly sums up the substance of two observations by the Court of Auditors very concisely.
If you think it is necessary, I can read out the full wording of these observations, although personally I would prefer not to.
I just wish to say that I am opposed to this amendment, because I really do not think it serves any useful purpose for us to include tendentious summaries of official documents in our parliamentary documents, even if said summaries are tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
on Amendment No 1 from the Greens/ALE Group
Madam President, Point 6, on which we have to vote in this amendment, stipulates a deadline of 15 May.
If we were to accept this, we would be contradicting a paragraph that we agreed earlier.
Earlier on, under Paragraph 10 of the proposal for a decision to be precise, we agreed that we wished to see options for buildings management and a financing plan, taking into account the situation on negotiations, by 1 July.
We have already agreed on this, and this was also unanimously agreed in committee, because we accepted that this was only possible if we took account of the situation on negotiations.
If we were now to set a deadline of 15 May without taking account of the negotiating situation, we would not only be agreeing to something which it was agreed in committee simply cannot be done, we would also be contradicting something that we have already agreed upon.
I therefore appeal to the Greens to withdraw this point, failing which I would recommend that you vote against it, so as to ensure consistency with the rest of the decision.
Madam President, we will not, of course, withdraw this point, because it is at the heart of our amendment.
This is about calling on the administration to present an action plan by 15 May describing exactly how improvements can be made.
We do not want a list of measures, that can come later.
There is nothing contradictory at all about this.
We are talking about a concrete action plan setting out how quite specific improvements in procurement, buildings and human resources policy can be achieved, and I call on the House to vote for this.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Report (A5-0095/2000) by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on granting discharge to the Commission in respect of the decisions on clearance of accounts of the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF for the 1993, 1994 and 1995 financial years (C4-0128/1998) - C4-0372/1998 - C5-0167/2000 - 1997/2167(DEC))
(Parliament adopted the decision and the resolution in successive votes)
Report (A5-0079/2000) by Mr Casaca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 723/97 on the implementation of Member States' action programmes on control of EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure (COM(1999)0169 final - C4-0225/1999 - 1999/0091(CNS))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0086/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the European Parliament's proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS))
on compromise Amendment No 224
Madam President, this is a compromise amendment which was negotiated among groups and then, of course, examined by the various groups last night.
Our Group supports this compromise amendment with, however, the exception of one word: "plus" - "plus proportionnelle".
Presumably the English version is "more proportional".
We cannot accept that word.
However, under the Rules, it is not possible to ask for a split vote on a compromise amendment.
I note that if Amendments Nos 100 and 101 were both to be adopted, it would come to exactly the same text as this compromise amendment, except for the problematic word "more".
As I know that colleagues in other groups had exactly the same problem with this word, I would suggest to friends and colleagues that it might be appropriate not to accept the compromise amendment but to vote instead in favour of both Amendments Nos 100 and 101, which are compatible, and that would achieve precisely the result desired by many people.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
But I have to apply the rules.
A compromise amendment has been put before me.
Mr Brok, could you respond to Mr Corbett' s remarks, and say whether you agree to change the compromise amendment?
Madam President, we would like to keep the compromise amendment.
I put the question to Parliament.
Are there any objections to our putting this compromise amendment to the vote?
I thought that was the case.
Madam President, I think it is fair that it be put to the vote.
However, my Group and many others will vote against it in order to support Amendments Nos 100 and 101, which will achieve almost exactly the same effect with the slight improvements.
Yes, Mr Corbett, but I have to ask Parliament if there are any objections to my putting the compromise amendment to the vote.
Madam President, this amendment has been tabled under the Rules of Procedure and it should be voted on accordingly.
If it is rejected, we can then switch to the rules suggested by Mr Corbett.
That is the simplest approach.
Let us have a vote on the amendment, and if it is rejected, we can proceed as Mr Corbett has suggested.
Excuse me, Mr Brok, Rule 130 of the Rules of Procedure is very clear.
It says that if there are any objections to putting a compromise amendment to the vote, the President of the European Parliament must leave it to the wisdom of the House.
I am only following the Rules, just as I should.
(Parliament decided not to put the compromise amendment to the vote)
on Amendment No 118 from the Greens/ALE Group
Madam President, there seems to be a lack of correspondence between the different linguistic versions of Amendment No 118.
The French version simply refers to "les autoritÃ©s compÃ©tentes", whereas the English version refers to "the competent devolved authorities" which, in English, has a more significant meaning.
We established our voting lists in favour of this amendment on the basis of the French version.
However, I understand that the original version is, in fact, the English one, in which case, unless the word "devolved" in the English version can be removed, I will recommend my Group to vote against this amendment.
Madam President, the French text takes precedence.
Right, thank you for making that clear.
on compromise Amendment No 227
Madam President, your services were informed yesterday that we would not sign this compromise amendment.
on Amendment No 174 from the PPE Group
Madam President, we wish to request a split vote, first on the term "four-fifths" and then on the rest.
Actually, a split vote on the original text is scheduled, that is, if the amendment is rejected.
Are you withdrawing this amendment, in which case we will hold a split vote on paragraph 29?
Is that right, Mr Brok?
Madam President, if we were to do that here, we would not need to present the oral amendment on Paragraph 29.
So it would be easier to do that here.
So what you want, if I have understood properly - and I also want to check with the rapporteurs - is for us to vote on paragraph 29 with an oral amendment.
Is that right?
Madam President, I have the highest regard for Elmar Brok, but in this case he is mistaken.
The only point of the compromise amendment was to add the word "continuing" in English or "anhaltend" in German to "serious" , which is "schwerwiegend" in the German version.
That is the old text.
We have not agreed on the four-fifths majority, so it is just too late for this now.
We cannot split this again now.
If the amendments are withdrawn, I will take the vote on the original text.
Now, on the original text of paragraph 29, I believe I had a request for an oral amendment from one of our rapporteurs.
So I will give him the floor to present his oral amendment and then we will have a split vote and roll-call vote on paragraph 29.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, if you would like to present your oral amendment, Parliament will decide.
Madam President, the oral amendment consists of adding the word 'continuing' to the second part.
That is clear.
Are there any objections to putting this oral amendment to the vote?
Madam President, this interesting idea simply takes up in oral form the compromise amendment that has just been rejected.
It is not really in order with our normal procedure.
Are there twelve Members against putting this oral amendment to the vote?
(More than twelve Members rose to oppose the vote on the oral amendment)
Madam President, I would like to say just one thing to the Group of the Party of European Socialists. It has subsequently voted against or withdrawn its name from all the compromise amendments that it had signed, without informing us of this.
I do not think that this is a reasonable way to do business or how we should treat each other!
Madam President, I must refute what Mr Brok said.
A number of compromises were made and we respected those compromises, except in two cases where there are problems, as we sometimes find when we take compromises back to our various groups.
I proposed a solution in both cases.
In this case, we informed your services yesterday that we would not be signing that compromise amendment.
Thus, it should never have been tabled in our name.
It may have been a compromise between the ELDR and the EPP Groups, but it was not a compromise which we signed.
before the final vote
Madam President, I would like to make a political declaration on behalf of my Group in relation to an issue which I believe has left a nasty taste in the mouths of all the groups in this House: the vote on paragraph 3, on the composition and distribution of seats in the European Parliament.
My Group will vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report, but I propose that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in its wisdom, be charged with the task of finding a solution to this issue, because it is enormously sensitive throughout this House.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
I warmly congratulate our two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen.
(Loud applause)
Mr President, I would have been tempted to follow the example of Mr Cox and abstain from the vote on Mrs Stauner' s report, but, in all honesty, I have to say that before I left to come to Strasbourg, some pensioners asked me what I was going to do here.
When I told them that my tasks included voting on the postponement of discharge, which we are discussing today, they asked me to remind the President of the House that the pensioners and their party, which I represent, consider that expenditure takes up too great a part of the European Parliament' s budget. They therefore call for expenditure to be halved and the resources freed up in this way used to increase the pension funds of the 15 Member States, which have been in serious difficulties for too long now.
- The Liberal Group today supported the amendment tabled by Jean Louis Bourlanges of the Group of the European People's Party, which called for the resolution to be separate from the explanatory statement.
By way of explanation, consider the following quotes:
"One might conclude that the Commission had decided in some fields to draw a veil over and forget past events.
The Commission has sought to distract the public attention from unresolved internal problems in the present by making glib and bombastic promises for the future."
"The Commission apparatus which wielded excessive power even under President Santer has now become even more powerful; moreover it is all too often dominated by coteries".
By any standards these comments are excessive, unfair and, in the context of the discharge procedure, wholly unsuitable.
On the final vote on the resolution we were faced with three choices today: to vote in favour, to vote against or to abstain.
We chose to abstain and this requires explanation.
To vote in favour of the Stauner report is to vote for postponement of granting discharge which, all things considered, we believe should be granted now.
As we explained in the Budgetary Control Committee, our preference was to vote "yes" to reform but "no" to visiting on this Commission the sins of its predecessors.
In the Liberal Group we have been consistently in favour of many of the elements in the Stauner report such as access to documents - it is a duty of the current Commission to provide access to documents.
But the political question remains - is this the moment and is this the issue for an apparent public stand off between Parliament and the Prodi Commission?
We think not.
If we do not vote in favour of the report it is because we want to indicate a preference to do business on reform now rather than later because we believe, on the evidence to date, that this Commission is a reformist Commission.
Voting against the report would merely have the effect of sending the report back to the Budgetary Control Committee without a clear expression of what happens next and by what means.
We are against such an approach.
So we have chosen to abstain.
This is a motivated abstention rather than an indifferent one.
Our Group preference was to have voted to grant discharge while promoting reform which we accept is also the view of the European Commission.
Unfortunately, today's choice did not allow for such an option and so we have chosen to abstain.
The French Socialist delegation has voted for Mrs Stauner' s report postponing the granting of discharge for the financial year 1998, because it resulted from a compromise by our political group with the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
This resolution reflected the desire of the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to break the deadlock over Mrs Stauner' s proposed report in the committee, but also in the European Parliament, which was putting our institution' s relations with the Commission onto a defiant footing.
The French Socialist delegation is glad a majority was achieved to pass Amendment No 5 highlighting the slippage between the resolution put to the vote and the explanatory statement.
By that vote, Members have reaffirmed that only the rapporteur is responsible for the explanatory statement.
The proposed report Mrs Stauner submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control caused consternation far beyond the members of the committee itself.
Indeed, the proposed document bore little relation to the discharge procedure, which is about approval of the accounts for the financial year and the propriety of the expenditure.
The resolution put to the vote in Parliament today presents a catalogue of reasonable demands and recommendations to the Commission.
The postponement and the response time given to the Commission allow it to answer the questions from the Committee on Budgetary Control within the set time.
They leave the Committee on Budgetary Control sufficient time to prepare a report which will rule effectively on the implementation of the 1998 budget by the Commission.
- (IT) The delegation of the Democratic Left to the European Parliament, of which I am chair, voted against the Stauner report on the 1998 discharge because it does not agree with the basic line taken.
The report does not focus on the Commission' s actions during 1998, to which the discharge relates, pursuant to Article 205a and Article 206 of the Treaty and Article 89(5) of the Financial Regulation, but is lingering over alleged cases of fraud, most of which occurred in the early nineties during the terms of previous Commissions.
The Prodi Commission has undertaken a vast reform, which is necessary in order to modernise the European civil service and to reorganise its structures in preparation for the many challenges which it will have to face over the next few years.
We, too, are convinced that reform of the budgetary control and programme management procedures is essential, for these systems have proved to be inadequate.
Indeed, it is necessary to ensure not only that past cases of fraud cannot be repeated, but also, and above all, that the level of management errors identified by the Court of Auditors in its annual report is greatly reduced.
In any case, it is not by attempting without fresh proof to reopen disciplinary proceedings which have now been concluded that we will achieve a thorough, effective reform of the Commission.
It should be recalled that 80% of Community funds are managed at national level, and improving the financial management of the European Union budget could not therefore be contemplated without the cooperation of the Member States.
Furthermore, we fear that behind this unjustified vicious attack lies an attempt to use such incidents to undermine and sabotage not just Commission actions but the work of the European institutions in general.
We cannot therefore support the perpetrators of these schemes, and, for this reason, we voted against the report.
Kuhne Report (A5-0097/2000)
- (NL) In view of the inadequate management with regard to the buildings and personnel policy contracted out, as mentioned in the Kuhne report and in the report by the Financial Controller, we are of the opinion that discharge to the European Parliament in respect of the implementation of the 1998 budget must be postponed.
The European Parliament must operate the same high standards with regard to its own management as are required of the Commission.
We are convinced that discharge can only be granted to the European Parliament in respect of the implementation of the 1998 budget, provided that specific measures are taken to buck this deplorable trend once and for all.
We are very much in favour of a specific action plan through which such mismanagement can be prevented in the future.
Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen Report (A5-0086/2000)
Mr President, I would like to underline that no one in Parliament will agree with every single item and every single paragraph of this important report.
That is clear.
The overall message that we are giving to the IGC is that this Parliament wants the IGC to be ambitious, to think long term and not short term and to address all the issues that need to be addressed if a Union of nearly 30 Member States is to be able to function effectively.
We have put a large number of suggestions on the table.
Clearly, not all of them will be taken up in the form which this Parliament has advocated.
But we know that.
We think it is right that the IGC should look at these issues, look at them seriously and come up with appropriate solutions that will enable the Union to work.
My Group, as you know and as BarÃ³n Crespo has just said, has some reservations on particular points.
They relate, in particular, to the composition of this Parliament, where unfortunately attempts to reach a compromise position fell down at the last minute.
We must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this House.
I am confident that we can do that.
We were very near to a compromise agreement.
We should be able to crack this one.
We are happy to vote for the report, given the circumstances, and with the reservations I have just described.
Mr President, I have voted against this report.
I say this with regret.
I have voted against this report for almost the same reasons that Mr Corbett has voted in favour.
I have the same objectives: an ambitious Intergovernmental Conference which deals with the real issues and looks to the long term.
I believe that this Parliament is sending a confused message to the Intergovernmental Conference through this resolution.
Reading it will not give a true idea of the message that Parliament wanted to send in relation to this Intergovernmental Conference.
Therefore, Mr President, while I am in absolute agreement with many of the things said in the resolution, I disagree with many others and regret, for example, with regard to an issue as important as the Court of Justice, that the resolution essentially fails to provide for the necessary reform of this institution, nor does it provide suitable clear guidelines in this respect.
For all these reasons, I regret, once again, to say that I have voted against.
Mr President, we are opposed to the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report because it proposes an integrated, centralised, rigid model of Europe, which is the opposite of our Europe and which can only block enlargement.
We find three points in this report particularly harmful.
The first is the federalisation of the institutions, by making qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament the general rule, introducing transnational European elections, and strengthening the powers of the Commission in an attempt to turn it into a European Government.
The necessary but unacknowledged counterpart of all these measures is the marginalisation of the national democracies.
The second is making a constitution out of the Treaties and adding a restrictive European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, gradually subjecting the peoples to texts which go far beyond them and which will be imposed on them, without any of them, individually, being able to escape that.
Thirdly, the totalitarian drift of so-called European democracy, with the introduction of mechanisms, in particular making the application of Article 7 of the EU Treaty more flexible so that a Member State can be suspended, mechanisms, then, which will give a handful of leaders authority to operate a thought police across the continent, even against peoples expressing themselves democratically, as in Austria.
One of the most controversial points that arose during the debate was the contradiction between the anticipated proliferation of Members of the European Parliament because of enlargement, and the ceiling of 700 Members the Treaty of Amsterdam has imposed on our Parliament.
That limit was chosen to make the European Parliament resemble a national one, but all it does today is set the countries against each other, as none of them will accept a reduction in its quota of Members, and that is understandable.
The Europe of Nations Group proposes putting an end to these conflicts by breaking through the ceiling of 700 Members.
Why not a European Parliament of 1000 Members?
It could work in variable geometry formations and its originality would have a powerful impact on the imagination.
Mr President, I shall endeavour to explain myself clearly.
I voted against this report and I was not alone in doing so.
We did so with conviction on behalf of the European regionalists of the ALE.
We form part of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but by taking this position we wanted to express our disillusionment over what is being discussed here today.
This agenda is, of course, too restricted.
Europe is very ambitious when it comes to enlargement, which is a good thing, but it is not ambitious enough to provide a real democratic structure that emanates from the regions and the people.
We regret that all amendments that serve to incorporate this dimension into Europe have been rejected.
We have had to conclude that, contrary to our expectations, the power of the large states will increase and the power of the European Parliament and the possibility of our regions being represented within it, will decrease.
We therefore hope that the IGC will prove successful in getting vigorous reform under way.
We had to vote against because we do not fully identify ourselves with the structure of this democratic Europe.
Mr President, like many others in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have voted against this report for many reasons, but above all for three reasons.
