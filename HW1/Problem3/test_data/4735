Womenâs organisations should therefore give their input for the analysis of the trends in the fisheries sector and the development of a strategy for its sustainable development.
Women and their representatives are also encouraged to participate in the regional advisory councils, which are the cornerstone of the âgovernanceâ pillar of the reformed common fisheries policy.
For instance, womenâs associations already have a seat in the North Sea RAC, which was the first to be created as a result of the common fisheries policy reform in 2002.
Women are also represented in the North Western Waters RAC.
Finally, following the conference on the role of women in fisheries organised in January 2003, I am pleased to inform you that the Commission is planning to organise another conference on equal opportunities in 2006.
This conference will take stock of the situation of women in the fisheries sector and reflect on ways further to improve the situation and make further progress.
I hope that the views of this Parliament will also find reflection in the proceedings of the conference.
In conclusion, I would like to underline the Commissionâs determination to attribute great importance to equal opportunities in our policy.
However, in order to make equal opportunities a reality, all policy-making levels need to take responsibility: the Commission, and national as well as regional and local levels.
Your own commitment to this objective will assist in keeping and furthering the importance given to equal opportunities at all levels.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, and I would like to join with the rapporteur and the Commissioner in saying that the role of women in the fisheries sector should be better recognised.
Although just 3% of people employed in extractive fishing are women, women do participate actively in all the other activities relating to fishing.
As a result of their invisibility, many women working in the sector do not enjoy social and economic rights.
We would therefore call upon the Commission, together with the Member States, to take the necessary measures to guarantee fully the rights of these women.
We also agree that they should have access to professional training, to funding and to credits under the same conditions as men.
It is also necessary to increase the participation of women in decision-making processes, and therefore a recommendation from the Commission to the relevant bodies so that they take the necessary action in this regard would be very positive.
It is essential to help womenâs organisations and networks, and we therefore welcome the Commissionâs commitment to carry on actively supporting existing ones and the creation of new ones, since they are absolutely essential tools for the exchange of information and for good practices.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must not end without mentioning in particular shellfish gatherers, the majority of whom are women of over 50 years old whose health suffers directly as a result of their work and who in many cases do not have the right to unemployment benefits, to health services or to job security.
We cannot allow groups such as this to carry on with so little protection and, as a member of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, I would call for greater recognition of the work of women in the sector and that we provide solutions to the problems resulting from this work without delay.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as a representative in this Parliament of a European region in which the presence of women in the fishing sector is extremely high, including in the extractive sector, through activities such as shellfish gathering, I would like to thank MrsÂ Attwooll for her report, which stresses an extraordinary formula that will re-evaluate the role played by women in society and allow them to take more advantage of the different possibilities that are opening up to improve their training, their degree of specialisation and their future prospects.
I am proud to be able to say that, over recent years, the fisheries authorities in my region have paid particular attention to the role of women, promoting â and indeed calling urgently for â the creation of associations and unreservedly supporting the integration of those associations into the existing networks, and arranging international forums and conferences to strengthen them and create new ones, with a view to the exchange of knowledge and experience amongst women from all parts of Europe.
The results are spectacular, particularly with regard to making women themselves more aware of the economic and social importance of their work, moving on from seeing their role as one of supporting the family economy, which had traditionally fallen to them, to demanding the compensation to which they have a right as workers: better salaries, social benefits and training.
The report by Mrs Attwooll accurately illustrates the role that they have played and the role that womenâs networks may yet play in this field and calls upon national administrations and the Commission to continue providing and intensifying their support.
For all of these reasons, our political group supports the fundamental points of this report and hopes that the plenary of this Parliament will support it as well.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my agreement, as shadow rapporteur for this report, with the words of the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll.
I believe that we can see from reading this report that womenâs networks play numerous roles in fishing areas and could play a greater and better role in the future.
It is important to make the extremely important work carried out by women in this sector more visible and thereby to ensure that these activities are better valued and remunerated since, in many cases â as has already been said â women work for nothing and sometimes without any social protection.
We still have a long way to go.
The report also acknowledges the effort that the Commission has already made, holding the Conference on the role of women in the fisheries sector in 2003.
We eagerly await the conference scheduled for 2006.
There is still a lot to do, however.
I am therefore pleased to have noted a change of emphasis on the part of the Commissioner, and this is very necessary for women in the fisheries sector.
I believe that the measures that the Commission must take in order to support these networks must be aimed in four directions, which are indicated in the report: information, funding, representativeness and training.
A more exhaustive report must be produced.
I agree with the rapporteur that the report on womenâs networks does not impress us very much.
An exhaustive report must be drawn up, which accurately reflects the situation of the existing networks, and their development must then be monitored.
Funding is required, since these networks are playing, and can play in future, more and better roles of public interest, from economic, social and also ecological points of view, and they therefore deserve funding instruments.
The training that the Commissioner mentioned is needed.
Aware of the important work done by women in the fisheries sector, the Commission should promote the education and training of young people in these activities so that they can take over this work in the future.
As has already been demonstrated, certain situations provide examples, such as the situation of the shellfish gatherers.
I therefore believe that we must support organisations of women that form around networks, so that they can achieve and consolidate better living conditions.
I would like to announce that my Group is also going to support Mrs Attwoollâs report.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to add my warm thanks to Mrs Attwooll for her work, her report and the way in which she has put the womenâs networks in Europe on the map.
I am also indebted to the Commissioner.
It is not the first time that he displays great social concern in the fisheries sector.
I should also like to thank him for the way in which he wants to actively involve all social strata within the fisheries industry.
Why is that so important?
There are three points why it is vital that the scope of fisheries is widened to include factors other than economic ones.
What is apparent to me from the shrimp crisis in my own region, and the role that VinVis has played in this, is that the womenâs network has contributed towards a solution, and I have to conclude quite simply that it is very much to be welcomed that the fisheries sector is being broadened socially speaking.
I am also delighted that this network has now been given its rightful place in the regional advisory council for the North Sea.
It is of particular importance, though, in the area of training, social position, and economic impact on the fisheries industry.
If I consider the high fuel prices and a number of other factors which certainly have social implications within the fisheries industry, then I consider it to be a good thing that the womenâs network, VinVis, but also other organisations, are given their rightful place.
In that respect, I was also very taken with the hearing which the rapporteur organised in July that involved a large number of womenâs organisations, and I think it would be good if activities of this kind were also organised by Parliament and the Commission.
I would once again like to thank the rapporteur for this report and I hope that the Commissioner will also follow up the recommendations.
His response in this respect creates reasonably positive expectations to this effect, and I hope that we politicians will also ensure that all social strata within the fisheries industry are given their rightful place within the sector.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like in turn to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for the exceptional work which she has done in her report.
We all know that women engaged in coastal fisheries are at a disadvantage, because their work in this sector is classified as supplementary work rather than as a profession.
What is missing is the recognition of their work, at both a legal and social level.
We need to support and to safeguard the social and economic rights of women in all sectors of the fishing industry: equal pay, pension rights, social security and access to public health services.
We need to step up efforts to implement policies which support initiatives to create women's networks throughout the European Union, especially in remote island areas.
The development of these networks should not be based merely on voluntary or one-off actions.
These networks must be institutionalised so that their role in the areas in which they develop can be strengthened and they can act as advisors and experts on the councils in their areas.
As far as the full application of the principle of equal treatment and equal opportunities in the fisheries sector is concerned, I consider that we have fallen a long way behind.
I think that the time has come for a bold decision, so that the contribution of women to the development of fisheries and of economic life in general is recognised.
Let us not address women's networks merely with sympathy and understanding.
Let us turn them into an important tool, which will promote fisheries policy, sustainable development and respect for the environment, ecosystems and man.
Â Â  â Mr President, all the previous speakers recognised the need to maintain fishing not only as an economic activity but also as a social and, one might say, a cultural activity.
The traditional role of women in fisheries and the various modern forms of participation in the women's job market by areas with fishing activities were certainly strengthened decisively following the Commission conference in 2003 and the start of networking of this specific category of workers.
We cannot but welcome the initiative by the Committee on Fisheries and, more importantly, by the excessively modest Mrs Attwooll, in drafting the report.
I, in all events, as shadow rapporteur for my party in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, thank her for including most of my committee's comments.
All that remains, therefore, is for us to trust that the Commission will help at the new conference in 2006 to integrate a pan-European network of women engaged in fisheries.
Not only the European Fisheries Fund but also the Structural Funds and other programmes, such as FEMMES and LEADER, can become tools for special actions, in parallel to educational development and the development of professional skills, the development of adaptability, research programmes into the impact of restructuring in the fishing and farming industries, innovation in production and the promotion of consumption with environmental awareness and respect for biodiversity.
It depends on these actions as to whether or not young boys and girls remain in fishing areas, so that traditions, with valuable, long-standing practices, can be maintained with new technology and can bring about added value for the European Union.
However, added value will also come from maintaining everything provided for in Council Directive 86/613 and I would ask you, Commissioner, to address its extension to the fisheries sector.
The application of the principle of equal treatment of men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, including agriculture, and protection during pregnancy are important sectors and the Gender Institute being set up will have a role to play with special research into the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I should like to extend warm thanks to Mrs Attwooll for managing to pinpoint exactly what the role and significance of women in the fisheries industry can be.
The work of women is often invisible, and MrsÂ Attwoollâs report helps at any rate to bring it into the light.
The fisheries industry is a heavy industry, one with regrettably long working hours and also dangerous work.
More women on the ships can help improve working conditions there.
Work that is too heavy or dangerous for women is often detrimental to men too.
In many sectors, it has turned out that, as soon as women joined their ranks, the working conditions improved.
Greater involvement of women in the safety of ships is essential to make actual progress in this area.
A concern for sustainability is something else we can expect from women and womenâs networks.
Sustainable fishing is essential to provide future generations with fish.
Sustainable catching methods with minimal bycatch and sound monitoring are essential.
The quotas will be laid down this month, and it is very important to take the scientific recommendations into consideration; if not, future generations will be fishing behind the net, something of which women often bear the brunt.
It may be time to adopt fresh policy, to experiment with fish reserves for a few years, to put fish reserves on the map, or to give fish stocks the chance to recover.
The maritime strategy that is now being prepared is an appropriate time to hold the discussion on this.
I would invite everyone to involve women in particular in this discussion in all countries.
Women often trade in, and buy, fish.
The viability of sustainable fishing is dependent on the full involvement of consumers, as also on the introduction of quality marks that guarantee quality and sustainability.
It is good to involve women in this as much as possible.
In short, like Mrs Attwooll, I have great expectations where women are concerned.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the rapporteur again for her report.
I would also like to thank all the speakers for their remarks, for the determination they have shown on the subject of equal opportunities for women in fisheries, and for the proposals that they have made to the Commission.
On womenâs networks, let me state again that the European Fisheries Fund aims to support networking and the exchange of experience and best practice among organisations promoting equal opportunities.
The European Fisheries Fund will also provide for educational and social needs in the fisheries sector, with particular emphasis on women.
Womenâs networks in fisheries are already benefiting from Community funding under programmes such as EQUAL, and certainly this funding will be enhanced with the entry into force of the European Fisheries Fund.
The focus in the fund on young fishers will also help in the field of equal opportunities.
An important milestone in the reform of the common fisheries policy was in the field of governance through the creation of the regional advisory councils.
I can only express the hope that womenâs organisations will take up their place in the regional advisory councils in the same way as they have already done in two out of the three existing regional advisory councils.
Participation in such governance fora will see benefits for equal opportunities at various levels.
On the point raised with regard to shellfish gatherers, I would like to point out that they benefit from assistance from the FIFG under the Spanish operational programme.
I trust that such funding may also be requested by the Spanish authorities under the European Fisheries Fund and I am confident that the Commission can continue to support such activities.
In fact, such an example can certainly be promoted further.
In conjunction with the Commissioner responsible for equal opportunities, I will do my utmost constantly to underline to Member States the importance of promoting equal opportunities in the fisheries sector.
As I stated before, there will be another conference in 2006, following the conference of 2003.
The purpose behind that conference is to take stock of the situation concerning equal opportunities in the fisheries sector and then to consider what further initiatives can be taken in conjunction therewith.
I look forward to Parliamentâs constructive contribution to that conference.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Mrs Stihler (A6-0340/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea [COM(2005)0117 â C6-0131/2005 â 2005/0045(CNS)].
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Member for her report on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea.
The funding proposed by this regulation will be an essential part of the fisheries financial perspectives package for 2007-2013.
Next to the European Fisheries Fund, this regulation represents the legal basis for most other expenditure allowing the continuation of the common fisheries policy and, based on the Commissionâs original proposal for a financial perspective, it will cover more than EURÂ 2.5 billion worth of spending in the seven year period from 2007-2013.
The proposal aims to provide a more transparent and simplified framework for the execution of Community financial interventions.
It is geared towards improving the effectiveness of financial interventions in the field of control and enforcement, in the area of data collection and scientific advice, in the strengthening of the governance of the common fisheries policy, and in the area of international relations and the Law of the Sea.
Let me now turn to the amendments proposed in the report before us.
The Commission can accept AmendmentÂ 1 and will continue to do what is possible within its competence to work towards ensuring the sustainability of the resources in third countries.
Whereas the Commission is in agreement in principle on the substance of AmendmentÂ 2, it has difficulty accepting the form of such an amendment.
The proposed amendment could have the effect of restricting the scope of what is designed to be a broad and general paragraph dealing with the crucial aspect of control capacities of third counties.
Furthermore, the Commission plans to concentrate on developing common objectives with third countries, rather than prescribing to them detailed means as to how to get to those objectives as different countries have different needs.
Amendments 3 to 8 should be considered together with AmendmentÂ 17, since they quote objectives which were already covered in the Councilâs conclusions of 19Â July 2004, regarding fisheries partnership agreements.
However, the legal provisions of this regulation are not the right place for policy statements.
The Commission therefore considers that a reference to these conclusions in the recitals of the proposed regulation, as proposed by AmendmentÂ 17, is the most appropriate way to include these aspects and can therefore accept AmendmentÂ 17.
As a consequence, the scope of AmendmentsÂ 3 to 8 will be covered through this recital.
Since the Natura 2000 network falls under the Communityâs environmental policy, the Commission cannot accept AmendmentÂ 9 in a regulation which exclusively concerns the common fisheries policy.
The Commission will, however, ensure coherence of the common fisheries policy with environmental objectives.
For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept AmendmentÂ 10.
In the framework of fisheries partnership agreements, the Council conclusions referred to earlier require coherence between the objectives of the CFP and the objectives of other Community policies such as environmental objectives.
The Commission appreciates the support the Committee on Fisheries has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate towards the regional advisory councils.
The proposed AmendmentÂ 11 clearly sets out the desire of the Committee to see the role of the regional advisory councils facilitated through indefinite funding.
Whereas the Commission is willing to explore options for funding beyond the currently prescribed five-year period, a commitment cannot be made at this stage since this would not be in line with the current regulation that has established the regional advisory councils, but this request can be reconsidered in the first evaluation of the functioning of the regional advisory councils three years after their establishment.
On the cost of commissioning scientific advice, the Commission is already paying independent and credible bodies to deliver the scientific advice.
RACs are welcome to highlight to the Commission any need for scientific advice.
However, the Commission reserves its right to decide on the justification of such a request on a case-by-case basis and will lead the process of obtaining this advice.
Although the Commission is in agreement in principle on the substance of AmendmentÂ 12, it has difficulty accepting the form of such an amendment.
The proposed amendment could have the effect of restricting the scope of what is designed to be a broad and general paragraph dealing with the objectives for fisheries partnership agreements.
Value for money is just one of the principles mentioned in the Council conclusions of 19Â JulyÂ 2004 regarding fisheries partnership agreements, and it should not be highlighted individually to the detriment of the other principles and objectives defined in the Council.
The Commission has difficulty in accepting AmendmentÂ 13.
Most of the aspects mentioned in the amendment are covered either by the Council conclusions on fisheries partnership agreements, or by the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.
The Commission agrees on the substance of AmendmentÂ 14, but not on the form.
In principle, the Commission agrees to provide summaries and aggregations of the collected data on request or for specific needs, but it is not planned at this point automatically to issue this data in the form of a periodic publication or report.
AmendmentÂ 15 cannot be accepted by the Commission, as fisheries partnership agreements are in essence based on a commercial relationship.
The third country is responsible for and sovereign to spend its revenue under the agreement, in whole or in part, in support of its fisheries policy for the purposes jointly agreed in a common approach with the Community.
The parties will jointly review the results obtained by this policy.
However, in this context, the Commission cannot impose financial audits or on-the-spot checks on third countries without their agreement.
For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept AmendmentÂ 16.
Each fisheries partnership agreement contains provisions on the payment of funds, as well as on the use of the share of these funds foreseen for the fisheries policy of the third country.
On the basis of indicators and benchmarks, both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and, where appropriate, will make the necessary adjustments.
As regards its national budget and financial administration, however, the third country is sovereign.
As said before, the Commission can accept AmendmentÂ 17.
Concerning AmendmentÂ 18, the Commission welcomes the support from Parliament to reinforce the budget for the common fisheries policy in the course of the negotiations on the 2007â2013 financial perspective.
The proposed regulation, by definition, can be adopted only once the financial perspective has, hopefully, been agreed.
Therefore, adding a recital, as proposed in this amendment, is probably obsolete.
The Commission agrees on the substance of AmendmentÂ 19, but not on the form.
Small-scale fisheries, as part of the catching sector, are already included as RAC members by virtue of the RAC decision.
Thus the Commission already promotes their participation in RACs as full members.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank all colleagues for their support so far for my report.
This report replaces a number of existing legal measures which provide the basis for current funding beyond monies provided by the European Fisheries Fund.
This is in line with the policy of achieving better regulation and simplification of legislation.
It sets out objectives for: expenditure, rules for eligibility of expenditure, the level of the Commission contribution and control measures.
The key areas covered are: control and enforcement, data collection, scientific advice, governance of the CFP and international matters.
The total budget foreseen for 2007-2013 is EURÂ 2Â 625 million, although the actual amounts, as the Commissioner has said, will depend on the EU budget negotiations.
On control and enforcement, the aim is to improve the control of fishing activities in order to combat those fishing activities that are damaging the conservation of resources within and outside Community waters.
This is to be achieved by providing Community financial support to Member States to reduce weaknesses in their fisheries control programmes and by assisting coordination of control measures, particularly via the Community Fisheries Control Agency.
Within the area of data collection and scientific advice, Community support will allow for the collection and management of the data needed to evaluate the state of fisheries resources and the fishing industry within and outside Community waters. This will assist the Member States to establish multiannual, aggregated and science-based data sets which incorporate biological, environmental and economic information.
In the area of governance, the goal is to ensure the involvement of stakeholders at all stages of policy development up to and including implementation.
In the area of international relations and the law of the sea, Community financial support is given for the conclusion of fisheries agreements with third countries, including partnership agreements, and participation in international organisations relating to fisheries or the law of the sea.
This area is allocated the lionâs share of the budget â EURÂ 1Â 592.5 million, of which EURÂ 1Â 522.5 million will go to fisheries agreements.
In addition, some money has been allocated to technical and administrative assistance, including related staff costs.
However, although the sums allocated by the Commission have been increased in committee, MEPs expressed concern that the allocation would not cover all the tasks required.
These have been increased by enlargement and the need to collect data on the new seas â for example, current data on the Black Sea scarcely exists.
Uncertainty over funding â not least as we await a new EU budget â poses the question of whether more funds can be made available, and if so, how they should be allocated.
If more funding is not available, then the question of whether funding is appropriately allocated by this proposal arises.
The creation of RACs is a vital and most welcome development. They will play a key role in the management of the CFP.
However, we need to ensure that the RAC areas are adequately supported.
They are unlikely to generate sufficient resources of their own after the start-up phase and, indeed, the operating costs are certain to increase after the start-up phase, as the RACs and their working groups â the North Sea RAC already has four of them â progressively generate and implement new projects in support of management guidance to the Commission.
Even in the start-up phase, the level of support to the RACs from the Commission diminishes progressively and steeply and continues to do so, year on year, as the RAC itself is expected to become increasingly self-supporting.
Moreover, the secretariats of the RACs have only limited capacity to seek alternative sources of funding, notably from Member States.
There is only limited opportunity â or justification â to pass the burden of cost on to the stakeholders â members of the general assembly and executive committees â especially as individual stakeholders â such as NGOs â seek to be involved in several RACs simultaneously, which incurs significant resource costs.
It is vital to press for finance to be available for RACs beyond the initial five-year period.
The financial support for the collection of data on the impact of fisheries on the environment in relation to adopting an ecosystem-based approach is also important.
Almost 60% of all the money goes on international fishing agreements, and it is only right that we make sure this amounts to value for money and is a fair development.
Expenditure on agreements should be eligible for Community financing only if it has been recommended as value for money under an evaluation report on the relevant agreement.
It is also important to develop control capacities of third countries to ensure sustainable fishing monitoring and control of fishing activities.
If cuts need to be made in the Commissionâs indicative budget, savings should be found from the international relations area, the largest budget area.
I thank colleagues for their support and urge them to support this report tomorrow, and I wish everybody a Happy Christmas.
Â Â  . â Mr President, although this is a premature discussion, since the financial perspective has not yet been approved, I believe that we should approve MrsÂ Stihlerâs report as an anticipatory measure, but I would like to make several comments, some of which coincide with those of the Commissioner.
Firstly, we do not agree with the rapporteurâs statement that, in the event of a reduction of the appropriations laid down in the Commissionâs proposal, they should be taken without any justification whatsoever from the heading corresponding to fisheries agreements, despite the fact that the rapporteur appears to have forgotten that the majority of these funds are now intended to meet the costs of development aid, and not the commercial part of those agreements.
Furthermore, the usual clichÃ© of linking the funding of fisheries agreements to prior cost-benefit analyses is not practical at this stage.
Firstly, the and studies carried out by the Commission for each protocol show that the agreements are still bringing benefits that are greater than the cost to the European Union and, at the same time, due to their new status as association agreements, we need to take account of other parameters which cannot be measured by means of a mere cost-benefit analysis.
Secondly, neither do we agree that Natura 2000 network measures should be funded by means of CFP funds.
In this regard, I would refer to what this Parliament said in the BÃ¶ge report on the financial perspective.
Finally, and with regard to the regional fisheries committees, I do not believe that there is any justification, for the moment at least, for extending the period for their funding laid down in Community legislation, particularly when the majority of the RACs are not yet operating, since less than half of those planned have been set up.
The logical thing is for the RAC to be an instrument that will eventually be self-funding, if it is as useful as we hope, and not to become an additional burden for contributors, particularly within a policy for which the financial contribution is always below the minimums.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would more or less follow on from Mrs Fragaâs last sentence.
I do not know why it is precisely the common policy with the least funds that is most besieged by requests of all kinds.
In this regard, although I am genuinely grateful for the work of the rapporteur â as she knows â I feel obliged to make a series of comments, or rather discrepancies, in relation to the text that has been approved in committee and on which we are going to vote tomorrow.
I am referring specifically to Amendments 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13, on which I shall comment briefly.
Within the context of this Regulation, and aware of the beneficial consequences of international agreements in the Communityâs regions in terms of employment, I understand the Commissionâs position on this issue.
Maintaining employment is a specific objective that nobody questions.
To set this objective without specifically mentioning the Community, as Mrs Stihler does, could be a mistake.
It is a laudable desire, but it does not fall within the scope of the CFP and furthermore it does not seem to me to be a realistic objective.
With regard to data collection for Natura 2000, proposed in Amendment 9, I believe that it should be financed by means of funds intended for the environment policy â as I have always said â and not by means of the CFP.
Those of us who deal with the CFP know that through this policy we are paying for other obligations laid down within other Community policies, as demonstrated by the increasing economic weight of development cooperation within the fisheries agreements.
Furthermore, when, in Amendment 12, Mrs Stihler proposes the criterion of providing value for money as a determining factor in fisheries agreements, I feel obliged to ask what kind of value for money she is referring to.
Value for money for the third country?
Furthermore, Mrs Stihler, I believe that, if we work on the basis of this criterion of value for money, I do not know whether we will be able to implement the cooperation policy to which I have just referred, and to which you yourself refer.
I genuinely do not know whether or not you, as rapporteur, have given this criterion of value for money, which I find so difficult to understand, sufficient thought.
I accept the two amendments presented by Mr Guerreiro, as well as Amendment 17, presented by Mrs Stihler.
Â Â  . Mr President, on this occasion I would like to offer very genuine and heartfelt congratulations to the rapporteur and thank her for her support for the ALDE amendments.
These largely related to the issue of international fisheries agreements.
I have to say, Commissioner, I was rather disappointed by your response to them.
We do not deny the importance of these agreements, but we believe that if we are expending European taxpayersâ money, whether for targeted assistance or in relation to fishing rights, we should know exactly how this money is being expended.
AmendmentÂ 16 in particular was crafted very carefully to get over the international legal difficulties in that respect.
We are talking about fisheries partnership agreements with obligations on both sides.
If we do not have this information, if we cannot evaluate what is going on, how can we decide whether we should renew them when the time comes?
There are serious concerns about what is going on in some third-country waters.
Only last week, the Environmental Justice Foundation published a report on illegal fishing in Guinea and its links to the European Union.
A telling statistic cited in the report is that Guinea is losing over 34Â 000 tonnes of fish every year to illegal fishing, worth an estimated USDÂ 110Â million.
The EU fleet is only one of several implicated in this, but it is implicated all the same.
It seems to me that this one example demonstrates why it is crucial that care is taken with regard to the EUâs fishing agreements, ensuring that the Union is helping to improve governance in third-country waters, but also addressing the urgent need on all sides to step up the quality of monitoring and enforcement.
Several of the amendments in this report would help the Union move towards more responsible fishing agreements.
On a slightly different topic, the ALDE Group welcomes AmendmentÂ 11 proposing that funding for the operating costs of regional advisory councils should not be restricted to the first five years.
As the Commissioner has said, they are the cornerstone of the governance of the revised common fisheries policy.
Â Â  . â I should like to highlight an issue that was raised in the debate in committee.
The funding provided for in the Commissionâs proposal will not enable us to achieve the objectives set out in this regulation, such as the financing of control and enforcement measures, conservation measures, data collection and improvement of scientific advice, governance, international relations and the Law of the Sea.
The financial resources for this important common fisheries policy instrument must be increased, in light of the enlargement of the EU and the more ambitious objectives that have been set out.
Yet no such increase is forthcoming.
The British Presidencyâs proposal is just another in the series of cuts being made to the 2007-2013 Community budget.
Accordingly, we have tabled a proposal for an amendment stating that the global financial envelope for fisheries, and specifically for this proposal for a regulation, is woefully inadequate if we are to address the economic and social crisis facing the sector and to meet the needs arising from the 2002 review of the common fisheries policy, and proposing adequate financial resources for the fisheries sector.
That being said, given that, in our view, it is of key importance that fishermen be involved in setting out and implementing the common fisheries policy at every level, we have also tabled a proposal that support should be provided for setting up or promoting representative associations of small coastal fishing, far and away the most important part of the sector, and that such fishermen be involved in decision-making processes in regional advisory councils.
Lastly, I wish to say that the regulation continues to be guided by the idea that the sole factor in conserving fisheries resources is to reduce fishing activities at EU level, disregarding other determining factors.
As far as we are concerned, the primary objective should be to promote sustainable modernisation and development in the sector.
It is also essential that the balance of fisheries resources be maintained so as to guarantee that fish supplies to the public are not interrupted, jobs are not lost and fishermenâs living and working conditions are improved.
Â Â  . Mr President, the common fisheries policy affects the UK more than many other Member States.
A UK minister in the late 1940s once remarked that Britainâs economy was safe for years to come because, he said, we live on an island of coal, surrounded by fish.
The coal is still there, if we care to use it, but the fish have almost gone, due to the disaster that is common fisheries policy.
Designed to conserve fish stocks, this misbegotten scheme has reduced some species to near extinction.
Among the most depleted are the plentiful stocks once found in the North Sea and Irish Box, up until 1973 the exclusive province of British fishermen who looked after the fishing grounds and reaped a rich harvest.
Then we joined the common market and the CFP, and now these seas are a marine desert in the making, if not already so.
Fair shares for all under the CFP, do I hear?
If so, why does Britain have lower quotas in the waters around our shores than some other countries from further afield?
And what does it profit anyone to fish our waters out?
Too many boats taking too few fish is the cry.
Just so.
Under the CFP vast fleets of trawlers from countries previously excluded are rapaciously fishing these grounds to extinction, while fertiliser factory ships vacuum up vast quantities of marine life on the seabed, destroying the bottom of the food chain.
How could any sane person devise the CFP scheme of quotas resulting in fish caught in excess being thrown back?
Do you not know that the discarded fish are dead when they are thrown back?
Do you not know that for some species the annual weight of useless discards is as much as the weight of the fish legally landed?
Compare that to Norway and Iceland who both refused to join the EU: their fish stocks remain plentiful and their fishing industries flourish because they look after them, forbidding discards.
Meanwhile, the British fishing fleet has sunk to less than a quarter of its previous size.
Destruction of the fishing industry means that the fishermen are out of work and on benefit. It means that fishing ports are in terminal decline, so structural funds are poured in.
It means that the social and economic fabric around the ports declines, while the EU claims to be combating this particular misery.
If you think this is a purely British complaint, think again.
The fishing industry is a factor in the UKâs GDP to which contributions to the EU budget are geared, and that comes on top of the destruction of a priceless natural resource.
And so, another Christmas goose reduces its output of golden eggs!
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, these are difficult times for Europe and the economic crisis has not gone away.
The EU must now focus on how to manage and distribute its budget accordingly.
In order to pursue a sound, sensitive and sustainable strategy, we need to have tools at our disposal allowing us to take appropriate action, in line with what I believe were the wishes of all of us.
This proposal for a regulation establishes a framework of measures for the purposes of implementing the common fisheries policy, complementing the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), which we debated in the Chamber some months ago.
As I said of the EFF at the time, it is crucial that the funds earmarked for these regulations be consistent with the actual needs of an integrated fisheries sector within an enlarged Europe facing fresh challenges.
Although I welcome the Commissionâs efforts to make the financial agreements under the common fisheries policy (CFP) clearer and more coherent, I must express my displeasure at the mismatch between the professed objectives and the funds set aside.
Given that objectives following the EUâs enlargement need to be more ambitious and farther-reaching, I feel that it is inappropriate to impose a 6.3% cut on this financial instrument.
I wish to highlight the fact that 60% of the budget of EURÂ 2Â 625Â million, spread across four main operational objectives, has been set aside for international fisheries agreements.
The strand relating to partnership agreements on fisheries is vitally important on account of its prominence in the budget.
This report maintains the consistency between the conclusions of the recent Fisheries and Agriculture Councils regarding the new CFP and the EUâs international relations, and this strikes me as being of paramount importance.
Lastly, the setting up and maintaining of regional advisory councils (RACs) are key to the new CFP.
It is therefore vital to ensure not only that funding is available to cover the start-up costs of the RACs, but also that the councils remain viable.
To this end, the Commission must clarify more clearly to what extent all areas relating to the RACs are to be funded.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, fishingÂ âÂ just like agricultureÂ âÂ is not an economic sector like any other.
Fishing contributes to improving quality of life at European level and to protecting the coastline and the environment.
In many cases, small-scale fishing even helps to bolster tourism.
It is worth emphasising that the fishing community plays an important role.
The job they do with such passion is demanding, tough and dangerous and their income is dependent on too many uncertainties.
Often in debt, and subject to the continually rising price of diesel, fishermen and their families live with the fear of not being able to make ends meet and of losing their jobs.
Throughout its existence, the common fisheries policy has failed to relieve their fears.
On the contrary, it has contributed to the loss of thousands of small-scale fishing jobs and to the social insecurity of fishermen, without achieving convincing results with respect to the conservation of resources.
What is worse, this policy has often given the impression of being subject to the law of the lobbies, who are more interested in cultivating their media images and in chasing subsidies than in making a serious effort to protect the environment.
That, Commissioner, is why fishermen are fed up with continually being suspected of being the criminals of the sea, by a European Commission that, in contrast, is far too lenient on the real pirates of the sea, by which I mean flags of convenience.
Commissioner, contrary to the prejudices of your learned assembly of scientists, nobody is more committed to conserving fishery resources than fishermen.
It is their livelihood, their heritage and the future of their children.
They have had more than enough of a situation in which quotas for fishing days and catch sizes, often laid down without a real scientific basis and traded any old how between the States, are involved in establishing fishing zones.
The Commission must not continue to favour fishermen of one nationality over those of another.
Everyone must be on an equal footing within Europe.
It is true that your text represents a certain amount of progress in the field, in setting as one of its formal objectives the involvement of all stakeholders, but you will forgive me for describing it as vague and timid.
We cannot save fishing and fishery resources without the fishermen and their professional associations and trade unions.
Fishermen, through their representatives, must be truly involved in all decisions affecting them.
The Union must also provide financial aid to the Member States to help them protect their territorial waters against illegal fishing.
I am thinking in particular of the territorial waters of the outermost regions of the EU.
Insofar as there is a real problem of funding a fair, sustainable and bold European fisheries policy, we must not forget that one of the threats to resources comes from pollution caused by maritime transport.
The system of flags of convenience is behind this pollution.
If, therefore, we can point the finger at those responsible for this ongoing ecological disaster, we will be in a position to launch a really ambitious policy.
Â Â  .
Mr President, first of all I would like to say that funding has in fact been increased under this instrument. This is due to a number of reasons: enlargement, new technologies, broader scope of data, the new control agencies and the establishment of the regional advisory councils.
On the latter point, I wish to say, as I said before, that the Commission is willing to consider the funding of the regional advisory councils during the review to be undertaken after the third year of their operation.
With regard to the extent of the funds, were more funds to be made available the Commission would surely not complain.
However, in reality we will hopefully have a 150% increase in control and enforcement, a 160% increase in data collection and scientific advice, a 110% increase in governance and a 120% increase in international relations.
If all goes well, there will be an overall increase of 130% if one compares the 2000-2006 financial period and the 2007-2013 financial period.
If there is a reduction, we have a cushion to some extent, so we do not have to deduct from any one specific heading.
If there is going to be a drastic cut, all headings will be affected linearly.
We will know hopefully before the end of the week what the situation is going to be.
So far, from the indications we have, the cuts envisaged under the financial perspective as regards fisheries are relatively small, especially in the second instrument, and hopefully it will stay that way.
On the international agreements, the Commission believes that the proposal strikes the balance between internal and external policies, between international agreements and conservation, control and governance.
At this juncture I wish to highlight that the allocations to the various areas are only indicative and based on current forecasts.
Adjustments for each programme will in any case be submitted and adopted every year in the annual budgetary procedure.
I would like to pick up on the point made by MrsÂ Attwooll with regard to AmendmentÂ 16.
Since these are commercial relationships, the monies often go directly to the treasury budget as part of the budget of the state.
However, we intend to strengthen our dialogue with the Commissionâs development services, to enhance the effectiveness of these monies in these countriesâ general development objectives, in particular in the fisheries sector.
With particular reference to the fisheries partnership agreements, I need to underline that each fisheries partnership agreement contains provisions on the payment of funds under the agreement, as well as on the use of the financial share foreseen for the fisheries policy of the third country.
On the basis of indicators and benchmarks, as I have said before, both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and where appropriate will make the necessary adjustments.
With regard to the remarks made by Mr Clark, I cannot agree with his assertions.
The lower stocks of fish are the result of year upon year of uncontrolled over-fishing and not of the common fisheries policy.
That policy, through its measures, seeks to address the need for balance between the availability of stocks and the fleets that target them.
Finally, the point on coastal fisheries and small-scale fisheries is better addressed under the European Fisheries Fund, which will hopefully be adopted early in 2006.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on
- the report by Paulo Casaca (A6-0339/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2004/465/EC on a Community financial contribution towards Member Statesâ fisheries control programmes [COM(2005)0328 â C6-0273/2005 â 2005/0136(CNS)]; and
- the oral question to the Commission by Philippe Morillon (O-0111/2005 â B6-0344/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on Community sanctions in the fisheries sector.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, there is increasing agreement between scientists, researchers and environmental NGOs that sustainable fishing requires a stable, long-term link between fishermen and their environment, and between this economic activity and controlling and sanctioning predatory practices.
In her excellent paper on the functioning of a fisheries association in Cangas, in the Spanish region of Galicia, Dora Jesus noted that when that particular fishing community enjoyed exclusive fishing rights in the area, or, more precisely, when it took on the rights and duties of owning natural resources and began to manage its own primary control and sanction systems, it succeeded in recovering stocks of goose barnacle and in making the species ecologically and economically sustainable in the area covered by the association.
Sadly, the EU has opted for a diverse policy, of enormous variations between fishing rights.
Europe is exclusively responsible for granting those rights and, for some species, they are determined for virtually the whole of Europeâs sea area, yet control and sanction systems are left to individual discretion.
The funds and take-up rates proposed by the Commission to support investment in fisheries control by the Member States have been cut to EURÂ 32Â million in 2006, a small amount given the responsibilities awarded to some regions and Member States.
Furthermore there is no Community assistance for controlling and monitoring the CFP.
In this connection, I should point out that Portugal, for example, accounts for little more than 2% of Europeâs population, but over 50% of the area covered by the European Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs).
What is more, the Azores region alone is a bigger EEZ than that of any Member State, even though it only has 250Â 000 inhabitants.
In this context, the waters off the Azores have only been controlled once since they were liberalised on 1Â AugustÂ 2004, in spite of the fact that many dozens of external vessels have been detected by the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) in this EEZ during that time, and that there have sometimes been two dozen at once.
This is in stark contrast to the numerous inspections carried out on the traditional Azores fleet by the regional, national and Community authorities, on land or not far offshore.
In the absence of any kind of VMS, there is still, as we have just said, no effective protection against unregistered fishing boats and, indeed, legally registered boats, in the poorest and outermost areas of Europe.
The reason why the VMS is functioning so incredibly badly is because of a number of derogations from key areas, and because the high-seas control system is so inactive and ineffective.
At a conference on Maritime Policy and European Sea Strategy held last week by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in Ponta Delgada, we learned that around 150 different species have been found in the waters off the Azores, many of which are native to the area and some of which can live for literally thousands of years.
These include dense black coral forests, some more than two metres in height.
The value of these corals and other deep-sea organisms to our heritage will be seen over time and it is widely acknowledged that they have huge biotechnological potential.
Whilst it is true that bottom trawls and bottom gillnets have been banned in the region, it is difficult to ascertain whether these bans have been effective, when the Community has done little or nothing to monitor, control and protect these European treasures.
The announcement of the Commissionâs proposed maritime strategy gave us all hope that we would see some changes in this state of affairs, but to our great dismay we discovered that this proposal envisages zero Community financing.
In other words, it advocates the same approach as before, whereby everyone in Europe can enjoy maritime resources, whereas the responsibility for protecting those resources falls entirely on the people who live in the regions in question.
As regards maritime security and environmental protection, in the Azores we are currently facing a tragedy of enormous proportions.
A huge container vessel carrying a number of containers with dangerous chemicals, and flying a flag of convenience, has run aground on a reef designated a site of Community interest as part of the Natura 2000 network.
In spite of the various packages, in the wake of the and the , and despite the creation of the European Maritime Safety Agency, Europe still does not have the capacity to respond either to these disasters, or to tragedies arising from unsustainable fishing.
We therefore feel that a European Coast Guard must be set up as a matter of urgent priority, whereby fisheries control would be integrated with other sea control operations and fisheries would be opened up to the entire European fleet; an effective, modern and harmonised system of control and sanction.
The liberalisation of access to waters is totally unacceptable unless these requirements are met.
Otherwise there can only be one outcome â Europeâs natural maritime heritage will fall into rapid decay.
Â Â  . Mr President, the issue of sanctions is of some urgency.
A level playing field is essential to giving fishermen faith in the fairness of the common fisheries policy.
Without that faith it becomes much more difficult to put well considered and effective management tools in place.
The Commissionâs latest report on behaviour that has seriously infringed the rules of the common fisheries policy demonstrates once again how uneven the playing field currently is.
In 2003 there was a range within Member States of between 24% and 100% of the infringements that were actually followed by a sanction.
Average finds for the same offence also vary considerably between Member States: for example, for keeping prohibited fishing gear on board, between EURÂ 451 and EURÂ 9Â 000; for unauthorised fishing, between EURÂ 375 and EURÂ 8Â 379, and for falsifying data, between EURÂ 98 and EURÂ 132Â 056.
Over three years ago my own report on infringements urged the Commission âto examine the possibility of introducing a uniform system of minimum penalties across the European Union ... to strengthen fishersâ confidence in the fundamental principle of equal treatment, which implies objective criteria for classification and rating, as well as for infringements and penaltiesâ.
I accept that it is agreed minima to which we look, as there must be some room to align the penalty to the value of the catch and to penalise repeat offences more seriously than first offences, but I believe that we need greater uniformity in both the level of penalties and the type of penalties and procedures involved.
Members of the Committee on Fisheries would be grateful for the Commissionerâs answer to our question, bearing in mind that the preliminary statement should be clarified to the fact that what it is stating is that 86% of all offences are currently covered by administrative sanctions and 14% by penal ones.
We would be grateful for the Commissionâs view on the issues that we have raised.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries for its report on this proposal from the Commission.
I am pleased to note that the committee has given a favourable assessment to this scheme, which is aimed at improving the Member Statesâ control capabilities, and that it fully supports the extension of its validity for a further year.
I also note that the committee is favourable to financing, under the Community budget, administrative arrangements with the Joint Research Centre with a view to developing new technologies in the area of control, and to the financing of studies on control-related areas, to be carried out at the Commissionâs initiative.
The committee has, however, tabled seven amendments to the proposal.
I regret that it is very difficult to accept any of the amendments, mainly for formal reasons, which I would like to explain.
AmendmentÂ 2 proposes a change to the time limit for the presentation of national programmes.
We would like to keep the existing date of 31Â January, as the submission of requests early on in the year will allow the Commission to adopt a decision granting the financial contribution in the first semester.
This will, in turn, ease the planning requirements for national administrations.
It should also be noted that the national administrations are already fully aware of this time limit.
On AmendmentÂ 3 and the related AmendmentsÂ 1 and 6, the Commission shares the committeeâs view that these expenses should be financed under a different heading.
This can be done through a budgetary arrangement.
However, it is not possible to finance these two new actions if they were not foreseen in the legal text.
The Commission deems that this proposal is the appropriate legal text to introduce them and cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.
In AmendmentÂ 4, the committee asks the Commission to establish criteria in order to allocate grants when the amount of request exceeds the available appropriations.
The Commissionâs policy is to allocate grants only when the need for investment has been proven, namely through the national report on control activities, irrespective of the overall amount requested.
Establishing criteria will introduce some rigidity to the selection of projects and could entail a risk that grants will be given for projects that are not of general interest.
This amendment cannot, therefore, be accepted.
Amendment 5 refers to the contribution rate for the most expensive items, i.e. patrol vessels and aircraft.
Increasing the rate to up to 75% of the eligible expenditure will reduce appropriations for other actions.
The Commission considers a rate not exceeding 50% to be appropriate, as a general rule, for all kinds of investment.
It cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.
Finally, the Commission cannot accept 7, since at the end of 2006 most of the projects will not yet have been completed, meaning a report on the decision will be of little use.
I should like to recall that the Commission will present a report on this decision to the European Parliament by 30Â June 2008 at the latest.
Concerning Mr Morillonâs oral question to the Commission, may I say that I fully share the view that sanctions, including in the fisheries sector, must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offences committed.
They must also effectively discourage any further infringement of the same nature.
Moreover, sanctions should be non-discriminatory between nationals and non-nationals of Member States.
We cannot achieve compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy without creating a level playing field across the European Union for all fishermen.
With a view to promoting transparency and to encouraging the application of adequate and dissuasive sanctions against those who commit serious infringements, the Commission publishes an annual communication on serious infringements to the rules of the community fisheries policy.
The Commission has published four of these communications so far.
In its comments on the tables annexed to the communications, the Commission stressed the need to reduce existing disparities regarding the level of sanctions imposed across the Community.
On the same communications, the Commission has also declared its preference for the use of administrative procedures and sanctions when dealing with breaches of the common fisheries policy rules, since they are imposed in a swifter manner and are more effective.
The Commission believes that a sanction, such as the suspension of an authorisation to fish, decided by the administrative authority and entering into force immediately, subject to the possibility of a judicial review, is a stronger deterrent.
The choice, however, between a penal or administrative procedure lies with the Member State.
In conformity with ArticleÂ 25(4) of Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2371/2002, the basic regulation on the CFP, the Commission intends to present in due time a proposal aimed at harmonising at Community level sanctions for serious infringements.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, fisheries control is an important factor in sustaining the sector.
In view of the need to recover certain at-risk fish stocks, support for the Member States must continue in such a way that they can meet their obligations to control, monitor and inspect fisheries activities in the areas under their jurisdiction.
The strategic discussion of 2001, when control strategies were among the most important axes of the Green Paper of that year, led to the Fisheries Control Agency being set up in April 2005, and this may yet, in my view, herald a new era.
Although this agency organises and coordinates the control and inspection activities carried out by the Member States, it has not taken the Member Statesâ powers and obligations away altogether.
As we await a decision on the financial perspective and the new Community framework for 2007-2013, these amounts are as yet unknown and as such Decision 465/2004 should be extended.
I wish to congratulate my compatriot Mr Casaca on his excellent work as rapporteur on this issue.
Commissioner, despite your remarks, I feel that the amendments made to the original text are indeed appropriate; they would help strike a better balance and make the text more consistent with what it is actually trying to achieve.
Nevertheless, although I lend my wholehearted support to this document I should once again like to draw attention to the fact that it remains extremely difficult, from a financial point of view, for the Member States to implement all of the desired measures.
The Commissionâs 2003 communication and reports of non-compliance with the common fisheries policy (CFP) are evidence that much remains to be done.
In order to ensure that the Member States honour their commitments to comply with the rules laid down by the CFP the Commission must continue to support its commitment to control and inspection.
Â Â  . Mr President, there can be no doubt that Decision 2004/465/EC, on a Community financial contribution towards Member Statesâ fisheries control programmes, has helped to improve both control structures and the provision of funding for controls in the individual Member States, and to make the flow of information more efficient.
It has also made it possible to confer greater powers on EU inspectors in the field of monitoring and control.
Control programmes are always and everywhere regarded as a nuisance, and often as discrimination, by those who have to undergo the controls.
It is an unfortunate fact, however, that controls on fishing activities under the common fisheries policy are indispensable, as we have learnt from experience.
The success of any legal framework depends on the effectiveness and ease of controls on compliance with the rules it lays down.
It goes without saying that the measures carried out in the framework of these control programmes cost money, and that the necessary funding should accordingly be provided for them.
We therefore support the rapporteurâs proposal to extend the period of validity of Decision 2004/465/EC by one year.
This would safeguard the Community financial contribution towards the fisheries control programmes at least until the end of 2006, even if the budgetary environment changes.
We concur with the rapporteurâs assessment of the amendments outlined by the Commission in the proposal for a decision, and we should also like to thank him.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the author of the oral question and Mrs Attwooll for presenting it, particularly as she is missing her groupâs Christmas party this evening by being here, which shows her true dedication.
The question of sanctions and whether they are criminal or administrative is very important.
Obviously nobody within this House would condone a breach of the regulations or rules.
It is appropriate that we are having this debate as a joint debate with the Casaca report, because the whole issue of fishery control measures and what is required is one that not only can deliver more environmentally and economically sustainable fisheries; it can also give certainty to many fishing families, so that they can continue to live their lives in the way that they have enjoyed up to now.
However, outside the question regarding the effects on stocks and stocking levels, and the new rules and regulations with regard to fishing effort and everything else, there is a further layer of bureaucracy which has a direct impact on the fishermenâs ability to make a living.
Commissioner, you have stated on a number of occasions that you have a preference for administrative sanctions as against criminal sanctions.
There has also been the question of giving certainty with regard to some form of uniformity: not a harmonisation but a uniformity of sanctions and penalties as they apply across the Member States.
Mrs Attwooll mentioned some of the divergences in her presentation.
I would like to give you a few more figures from the last Commission report received relating to fisheries offences.
There were 1Â 785 offences in Spain; 1Â 641 of them were dealt with by administrative sanctions.
There were 1Â 579 offences in Portugal; three of them were dealt with by criminal sanctions.
Out of a total of 26Â offences in my own country, Ireland, 20 were dealt with by the criminal courts.
The average fine in Portugal was EURÂ 491; the average fine in Spain was EURÂ 2Â 126. The average fine in Ireland was EUR 11Â 978, which under proposed new legislation to be introduced next year will increase to EURÂ 220Â 000.
Obviously, there must be some fairness and equity with regard to the way that these fines and penalties are imposed.
Ultimately, it is up to the Member States to put in place the legislation to transpose properly the ideology behind the fisheries regulations and directives.
There must also be equity and proportionality within that sanction regime.
There must be a preference towards administrative sanctions rather than criminal sanctions.
There has been some talk recently in certain quarters that the Commission was considering taking action against Ireland for failure to implement new legislation, which is currently going through the national parliament in Ireland.
Indeed, officials from your own office, Commissioner, recently met representatives of the fisheries committee in the Irish Parliament, as well as meeting members of the Committee on Fisheries here in the European Parliament, to discuss the issue of criminal sanctions and administrative sanctions.
I hope these rumours of so-called financial sanctions to be taken against Ireland are untrue.
I hope that tonight you could encourage us with the legislation that exists in Malta, where for a small offence, a small sanction applies â administrative only.
For a larger offence, a larger administrative sanction applies.
For a serious offence, a criminal sanction will apply.
For a continuous offender, then there should be the most rigorous enforcement of criminal sanctions.
But there is no equity or fairness when a logbook offence in one country leads to a fine of only EURÂ 96, whereas in another country this could lead to the confiscation of boat, catch and gear.
There must be proportionality.
Â Â  Mr President, I am somewhat intrigued by the background giving rise to the oral question before the House.
Since 1999, countries that obey the rules have been honouring Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1447/1999, which required proportional, effective and dissuasive penalties with regard to serious infringements of the common fisheries policy.
It is no surprise to find that the United Kingdom is at the top of the class in its dedication to meeting the Commissionâs demands, whereas some of those countries that speak the loudest about their commitment to the European project â such as Spain and Germany â are among the main defaulters.
The latest figures of serious CFP infringements are â as we have heard â those published by the Commission for 2003.
They show that the average fine in the United Kingdom was almost EURÂ 78Â 000 whereas the EU average was a mere EURÂ 4Â 500.
On the serious matter of falsifying records, the UK average fine was EURÂ 132Â 000 while in Germany it was a derisory EURÂ 98 â but EURÂ 98 more than in the Republic of Ireland which, according to those official Commission figures, had no penalties to declare in 2003, although it belatedly admitted that it had 103Â serious infringements!
Wherever the last speaker conjured up his figures, he certainly did not conjure them up from the published Commission figures.
It is not without significance that only when a red-faced Dublin Government published proposals for penalties to deal with this issue that, at the behest of Irish MEPs and others, this oral question was raised.
Let me make it clear: I see merit in equitable and proportionate penalties across the EU, but I am less than impressed by the fact that, so long as the fishermen of the United Kingdom were bearing the brunt of punitive action, nobody cared.
But once one of the free-wheeling states is asked to pedal, then there are cries for equity, for fairness and for a level playing field.
The disparity that has been in operation for years has a practical detriment for those states that have been complying.
Take the situation in the Irish Sea, where most of the fishermen from my country, Northern Ireland, have to compete to fish.
There, we compete with fishermen from the Republic of Ireland, whereas the Northern Ireland fisherman for years has been subject to those draconian UK penalties.
Indeed, at present, some Ulster fishermen are awaiting trial in Liverpool Crown Court.
Yet, for years it seems that their southern counterparts have had the benefit of flouting the rules without serious penalty.
Think what that does to competitiveness.
Every time the Northern Ireland fisherman goes to sea, he has to factor in the risk of savage penalty if he seriously infringes the CFP, but, according to the Commissionâs figures, the Republic of Ireland fisherman in the same waters has no worries at all.
Until now, his government has not seemed to bother about serious infringement.
So, by all means, let us have parity of treatment, but let us understand the detriment suffered to date by those who, for years, have kept to the rules on pain of savage punishment.
How, Commissioner, is that historic wrong to be righted?
You said tonight that you very much favour administrative sanctions.
If that is so, would you now publicly support and encourage the United Kingdom to discontinue its present prosecutions?
That would greatly help.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate, as I believe it gives us the chance to raise the difficult degrees of sanctions imposed on the fishing fleets in different Member States of the European Union.
We have heard from various Members about the disparities in fines and controls in Member States, which I do not have enough time to address now.
In the United Kingdom, draconian measures have been introduced.
Now draconian measures are being proposed in the Republic of Ireland.
As the previous speaker said, the British Government has had these implemented perfectly from day one, as it always does, while everybody else lags behind.
There is nothing new in that, however, and we should not be surprised at it.
Our fishermen and farmers, and many other industries, have suffered this state of affairs, whilst the situation in other states barely compares.
The result of this European Directive, implemented by the Member States, is a total disparity among the Member States.
This is unacceptable and unworkable.
Like the previous speaker, I come from Northern Ireland.
A very small off-shore fleet operates in Box 7A in the Irish Sea, subject to the draconian rules imposed by the British Government.
They are now going to be facing the draconian rules introduced by the Republic of Ireland Government.
At times they fish in those waters and there is great cooperation among the fishermen in those areas.
However, that is of little use to the fishermen if, as the previous speaker says, they find themselves before the courts.
This is the type of directive that brings the European Union into total disrepute in the Member States, as there is no semblance of a level playing field.
You talked about a level playing field.
It does not exist.
There should be proportionality and equal treatment.
I realise that there is no easy solution.
You know that yourself, as you recently visited Northern Ireland.
I understand that, but I believe the Commission must urgently review this entire issue of sanctions in the fisheries sector.
Let me make it clear. I believe we require sanctions and controls.
There is no question about that and we are not advocating anything else.
However, we must be realistic and they must be able to be implemented, unlike these present and unacceptable proposals.
As the fishing industry goes to Brussels next week to look to its future and fate on tax and quotas, this is the type of problem they do not need to face.
I would like to leave you with one point, if you will allow me.
I want to put one question to the Commission. It does not help us to stand in this House tonight and trade insults with each other, about what this or that Member State does.
In the long term, we need each Member State to respect each otherâs position.
You said you were going to harmonise sanctions.
So when are you going to come forward with the proposals?
Â Â  â Mr President, I listened to your speech, Commissioner, with enormous interest, and, with the greatest of respect, I should like you to clarify your highly ambivalent position on Amendments 2 and 6, which were repeatedly supported by the Commission in the clearest terms, both in the Committee on Fisheries and via email.
It was on the basis of this explicit support that we jointly drew up the budgetary amendments with the aim of adapting these very amendments â 2 and 6 â and now you tell us that the Commission does not support what it has been saying all along it supports.
It would appear that there have been some confusing messages on this matter, and I should like you to clarify matters, Commissioner.
Otherwise, I shall have a great deal of difficulty in working with the Commission in future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by saying â on the previous point made by Mr Casaca â that when preparing the allocation of grants, the Commission examines the requests submitted by Member States, taking into account the needs and efficiencies of each Member State, as they result mainly from the national programme and from the earlier report on control activities, which each Member State must transmit to the Commission.
Priority is given to those investments which are deemed more cost-effective, bearing in mind the general interest in achieving a high level of control throughout the Community.
Therefore, priority may change over the years and be different for different Member States.
I totally agree with Mr Kindermann that control and enforcement is a cornerstone of the effectiveness of the common fisheries policy.
I am committed to continuing to strengthen control and enforcement activities.
The establishment of the control agency this year will certainly make an important contribution in this area.
On the points raised by Mrs Attwooll, Mr Crowley and other speakers with regard to the whole question of sanctions, let me say that the main trend, as published in the communication, shows that the total number of serious infringements has varied considerably from one year to another â from 4Â 180 in 2000 to 9Â 502 in 2003.
It is difficult to know if this increase in the infringements detected means that the rate of detection of serious infringements is improving or if the number of infringements committed has increased.
One notable element of progress with regard to deterrence is the fact that the average amount of fines imposed has increased from EUR 1Â 757 in 2002 to EUR 4Â 664 in 2003 â that is an increase in one year of 165%.
However, the fact that fines imposed in 2003 amount to only 0.004% of the value of landings in 2002, makes us think that fines remain too modest to represent a real deterrent for rule breakers.
Having said that, this is a general statement, and one would have to look into the various subsectors and offences with regard to which these fines have been imposed.
Some conclusions from the previous communications are, firstly, that there are substantial differences between the average penalties applied â as a number of Members have made clear tonight â and that the amount of penalties remains too low to represent an effective deterrent against non-compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy.
Regarding whether criminal procedures or administrative procedures are the best option, Article 25 of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2371/2002 foresees that Member States are to take appropriate measures against responsible persons when the common fisheries rules have not been respected.
Member States can prosecute infringements through criminal or administrative procedures, provided that these measures are effective and proportionate to the seriousness of the infringements.
The Commission cannot otherwise interfere in the choice of the instrument by individual Member States. This could touch upon the sensitive issue of state sovereignty.
Having said that, I repeat that it is the Commissionâs view that administrative procedures â and thus administrative sanctions â are preferable.
They are preferable because they can be imposed swiftly by an administrative authority, as this does not require the lengthy process involved in establishing liability before sanctions can be imposed in criminal proceedings.
They are less expensive than judicial proceedings.
Non-criminal sanctions can be swiftly imposed and have been seen to be more effective than more severe penal sanctions.
For instance, an administrative sanction, such as suspension of a fishing permit, may be an effective way to encourage compliance, as it can be applied quickly.
I regret that the majority of Member States do not use this tool more often.
The sanction â be it criminal or administrative â must be tailored to the seriousness of the infringement.
Mitigating or aggravating factors include: a negative impact of the violation on fisheries resources or type of fish; previous conduct of the violators; repetition of the same infringement; and the estimated economic benefits deriving from the infringement.
The Commission has launched a consultation process on improving the quality of data collected and reported and the analysis of this data, in order to compare the situation between Member States.
Furthermore, the Commission intends to propose a catalogue of sanctions to be imposed in cases of serious infringements, for adoption by the Council, as foreseen in Article 25(4) of Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2371/2002.
The catalogue should help to increase the level of sanctions and contribute to the establishment of a more level playing field.
This catalogue is scheduled to be presented by the Commission in the second half of 2007.
As I have already said, the discrepancies are, therefore, large and our preference is for administrative sanctions, since they are more effective and can be implemented quickly.
In reply to a specific point that was made, I would say that our proposal for the harmonisation of sanctions for serious infringements will be published in 2007.
We hope that this will create a more level playing field and, at the same time, address the issue of proportionality.
With regard to the last point, which was raised by Mr Casaca, concerning AmendmentsÂ 2 and 6, I apologise.
The information that I have is that these amendments were not supported in committee.
However, I will look into this and contact him tomorrow before the vote.
Â Â  â The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by MrÂ Morillon (A6-0385/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out, for the period from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles [COM(2005)0421 â C6-0321/2005 â 2005/0173(CNS)].
Â Â  . Mr President, before I outline the Commissionâs position on this dossier let me first extend my gratitude to the Committee on Fisheries, and especially to its Chairman and rapporteur Mr Morillon for his excellent work carried out within the very tight deadlines.
As you are all aware, the Commission procedures have delayed the finalisation of this proposal.
The Commission is endeavouring to prevent similar delays occurring in the future.
We are currently undertaking internal consultations to see how best to overcome the delays which result in very short timeframes being given to the European Parliament to consider the reports.
I hope to be able to report to the Committee on Fisheries on possible solutions in the near future.
In the meantime I want to apologise to the rapporteur for the very tight deadlines he had to work within, and I personally commit myself to discuss with him and to search for and find a solution with regard to the future modus operandi.
On this dossier I would like to say that we informed the Seychelles authorities of the delay in the adoption procedure at an early stage.
The Seychelles authorities have shown great understanding.
As the honourable Members are aware, the Community has a long-standing relation with the Seychelles in the fisheries area.
The first fisheries agreement with the country dates back to 1985 and this is one of the most important tuna agreements in financial terms.
It is also the cornerstone of the network of our tuna agreements in the Indian Ocean.
This new Protocol is the first one that fully reflects the new partnership approach.
Both parties subscribe to a political dialogue on fisheries issues and in particular the fisheries sector policy defined by the Government of the Seychelles.
More than one third of the financial contribution has been earmarked in support of the Seychelles fisheries policy.
In line with this desire, the Commission has had a joint committee meeting in April and two technical meetings in July and September 2005 with the Seychelles authorities in order to start the political dialogue on the establishment of a multiannual sector programme to support the development of responsible fisheries in the Seychelles.
This work includes the establishment of annual and multiannual objectives, the distribution of a part of the financial compensation, the aims to be attained and criteria and procedures to be followed, in order to allow for an evaluation of the yearly results obtained in accordance with ArticleÂ 7 of the Protocol.
In this manner, both parties are firmly committed to responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in the Seychelles waters.
The new Protocol covers a six-year period from 18Â January 2005 to 17Â January 2011.
It grants fishing opportunities for 40Â tuna seiners and 12Â surface longliners and foresees a financial contribution of EURÂ 4Â 125Â 000 per year.
The Protocol is of mutual benefit to both parties.
I shall now turn to the amendments.
On AmendmentÂ 1 we fully share Parliamentâs concern and appreciate the speedy procedure undertaken notwithstanding the short time-frames given to them.
As I said before, the Commission informed the Seychelles authorities of this delay at an early stage.
The Seychelles authorities have shown great understanding and have accepted to receive the payment of the financial compensation for the first year of the agreement at a later date.
As I have stated above, the delays in the transmission result mainly from the nature of negotiations, but also because of the length of time involved in internal procedures.
In view of this and of my commitment to find a solution, I seek the rapporteurâs understanding of our inability to accept this amendment.
On AmendmentÂ 2, as stated in ArticleÂ 7 of the Protocol, it is up to the coastal state, in agreement with the Community, to decide on the way the financial contribution will be used in support of its fisheries policy.
It is therefore the responsibility of the Seychelles authorities to identify the main priorities of their fisheries policy to be implemented with the assistance of the Fisheries Protocol.
Therefore I am unable to accept this amendment.
As regards AmendmentsÂ 3 and 5, the Commission is entirely in agreement with their spirit.
However, the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information, in line with both the current interinstitutional arrangements and in particular with the framework agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament.
The Commission therefore considers that these amendments are not really necessary, if my information is right.
AmendmentÂ 4 cannot be accepted by the Commission.
May I recall the basic Community provisions concerning the mandate of the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Community.
The Council has authorised the Commission to negotiate fisheries arrangements between the Community and the Seychelles.
Against this background, the periodic renewal does not require a new mandate each time.
There is no need for a new mandate, given that the existing mandate covers these negotiationsâ objectives.
On AmendmentÂ 6, the new Protocol does not contain any targeted measures but a support to the Seychelles fisheries policy â Article 7 of the Protocol âpromoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in Seychelles waters.
We fully share the concern to keep the EP informed on the various aspects of the implementation of the Protocol.
However, the Commission already complies with the transmission of such information in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements.
Therefore the Commission considers that this amendment is not really necessary.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, you have already outlined the contents of the partnership agreement and explained to us that it is one of the first â if not the first â to be negotiated by the Commission as part of the new philosophy agreed by the Council in July 2004.
I am sure General Morillon will be pleased when I convey to him your commitment to trying to find a resolution to the problem of timing.
The Committee on Fisheries would like you to think again about your acceptance of amendments.
We had the final proposal submitted to us on 18Â October this year, 14Â days after the deadline for first payment.
I accept that you had already spoken about it with officials in the Seychelles and they were very understanding, but this again was nine months after the agreement was due to come into force.
We appreciate the exigencies of negotiating a new type of agreement but we on the Fisheries Committee feel that we want to be kept better informed about what is going on.
We also want to have some kind of input into the kind of agreement that is being reached, hence the emphasis that the financial contribution must be used for the development of coastal populations living on fisheries.
I revert to the point I made earlier this evening that we are now talking about fisheries partnership agreements in which both sides acquire rights but also take on obligations.
There is a feeling on the part of the Fisheries Committee that we want to know what is going on, we want the Commission to submit a report to us and to the Council on the application of the agreement and on the conditions under which it was implemented, and to include a cost/benefit analysis.
If we do not have that kind of information, when it comes to renewal, how can we give a considered opinion on the merits of the new agreement?
Please, Commissioner, with regard to our amendments, I would be very grateful if you could see what the Fisheries Committee is trying to achieve in this respect: fuller involvement of the European Parliament, not an attempt to take over the Commissionâs negotiating mandate, but to have a real input into what is being decided.
It is European taxpayersâ money that is involved.
We are sure that the Commission is doing its very best to ensure that it is put to good use, but we are part of the budgetary authority.
We would like to be reassured that we can have the observation and control, which is part of our mandate.
Please, Commissioner, think again about those amendments.
I am sure that the Members of the Fisheries Committee and General Morillon, in particular, would be most grateful to you.
Â Â  . â Mr President, thank you very much for your words, Commissioner.
I believe that the Fisheries Agreement with the Seychelles demonstrates clearly that the objectives of this Community policy are in very good health, despite the criticisms from some quarters, and that this kind of protocol is still essential in order to maintain competitiveness and employment for the Community sector, while it is increasingly involved in the promotion of more responsible fisheries systems outside of Community seas.
The activity planned for 40 seiners and 12 long liners will enable the Seychelles to benefit, as has been said, from more than EUR 4 million per year, of which 36% will be intended to support their fisheries sector.
If we add the contribution of shipowners through various elements, however, such as advances for licences, levies, taxes, provisions and the salaries of island seamen, this figure rises, as indicated in the Commissionâs assessment report, Mrs Attwooll, to between EUR 17 and 20 million, since, furthermore, Victoria, which is the base port for the whole of the tuna fleet in the Indian Ocean, creates great wealth for the Seychelles.
In view of this, Commissioner, I believe that this is the time to demand that the Commission give better treatment to shipowners, through the implementation, once and for all, of agreements of a regional nature, which prevent unnecessary multiplications of certain aspects that appear in all of the protocols of the region, in this case the Indian Ocean, such as the need to have an agent in each country, or to take on board seamen in each coastal State and also observers for each of the protocols, while, through rotating systems, all of the countries could benefit equally without leading to ridiculous and indiscriminate increases in costs for shipowners.
For some time the Commission itself has recognised the need to establish this kind of agreement for fleets that fish within a single area, and I would therefore call upon the Commission, together with Community tuna shipowners, to work to take steps forward that can bee seen as significant in this area.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall comment very briefly on this agreement, since it is very late and this is not the time.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for what he has said, because I believe that his views largely coincide with my own, and everybody in this House is well aware that I am one of the Members of this Parliament who are very pleased every time that a new fisheries agreement is signed.
The EEC/Seychelles Fisheries Agreement is the most significant tuna agreement that the European Community has reached with a third country, and, as I believe some Members have said, it is the cornerstone of the Community fleetâs activity and presence in the Indian Ocean.
So it is not that this agreement is important in itself, which it is, but also that it has many not just economic, but also geostrategic, implications, because the Seychelles, and specifically the port of Victoria, are an obligatory stop-off point for our fleet operating in this ocean, both for unloading and for docking and provisions.
Nevertheless, Commissioner, though I am happy about the signature of this agreement, I feel I must criticise the slowness and delays with which the procedure has been applied in this case.
The first payment of financial compensation â and I believe that this has also been mentioned â should have happened in September and, at that time, the formal consultation of the European Parliament had not even arrived.
Our internal procedure must be carefully reviewed, so that we can identify our deficiencies and put them right, because it is not logical for our fleet to be fishing as a result of the good will of the third country.
The delays only reduce the European Unionâs credibility in the eyes of other powers such as, in this case, Japan, which are much quicker to fulfil their obligations.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Court of Auditors recently remarked that 90% of EU activity is open to fraud.
So, we come to the award of fishing rights to the EU fleets in waters around the Seychelles.
A loophole exists in these agreements, whereby EU fleet owners have been known to complete a trawlerâs fishing to gain full hulls, and then declare technical problems.
They are then allowed to replace this trawler with a new one on the same licence, so they get two trawlers full for the price of one.
It does not stop there: they repeat it time and again, on the same licence, citing this bogus technical problem several times over â and one wonders why fish stocks are depleted!
The second half of this scam is to declare âzero catchâ, so there are no EU contributions to the country in question, and deprivation becomes acute.
People from several African countries say that everyone knows the huge fraud taking place in their waters under these EU agreements.
On top of that, we have the new Seychelles agreement, following the agreements for Martinique, Madagascar and the Cape Verde Islands, agreed and approved in this House within the last year â and may I say, to the shame of this House.
Modern, big EU trawlers force these local fishermen out of business, landing catches at prices with which they cannot compete.
A good slice of the economy of a third world country is destroyed, all because EU fleets, due to their reckless rape of their own seas, now move on to other targets.
I note that Commissioner Borg disagreed with me in my last speech, saying that the problem was over-fishing, which is precisely what I said in my own comments.
It is not long before the new waters around these islands are fished out.
The EU trawlers then move on, leaving a deeply wounded economy: fishermen out of work and waters deprived of stock, so that the locals cannot restart properly.
And the EU says it wants to help the third world!
Â Â  Mr President, I must confess I rise to speak in this debate feeling a sense of anger, not least that it is 11.35 p.m. and many of us have missed our Christmas parties, but because we are here debating the eighth renewal of the fisheries agreement between the EU and the Seychelles, which would normally be considered a matter of simple routine.
This agreement, as other speakers have said, was due to enter into force on 18 January 2005.
EU fishing vessels have been fishing continuously in the Seychelles' waters since January 2005.
However, the Seychelles Government has not yet received a single euro, as we have heard.
We are taking their fish without paying them a cent.
We must remember that the Seychelles was one of the countries affected on 26Â December last year by the tsunami.
As we know, it was the fishing communities that were hardest hit by that disaster.
Here we are, in the European Union, exacerbating the problem by allowing our distant-water European fleet to fish in their waters, yet a year later we still have not paid them one cent.
How is it possible that this protocol was not submitted to the European Parliament until mid-October 2005, 10Â months after the commencement of the agreement and two weeks after the first payment was due?
The second instalment under this agreement is due next month and yet we are here at 11.40 p.m. still debating the text of the protocol, all our amendments to which the Commissioner has rejected.
What are we doing here?
Are we here simply to rubber-stamp a Commission proposal when there is not even the slightest hint of humility, of acknowledgement of this delay and acceptance of the Fisheries Committeeâs amendments?
The Council says it is anxious that Parliament should deliver its opinion as soon as possible.
The new protocol was signed by the two parties on 23Â September 2004, and yet the Council did not request that Parliament should be consulted until 14Â October 2005, more than a year later.
I am well aware of all the internal procedural problems.
I am well aware that we have to seek 21Â different translations of all these protocols, but we have been aware of these shortcomings for a long time.
Steps should have been taken to ensure that this process was speeded up.
This situation is intolerable.
It is grossly unfair to fish in the waters of the Seychelles or any other country while withholding payment from them.
We have to ensure that this never happens again.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, with regard to the four amendments that have been tabled, I repeat that, concerning acceptance or otherwise of AmendmentÂ 1, which is to a recital, it would not give any added value.
I undertake to discuss this with the president of the Committee on Fisheries and with the committee itself, in order to find some solution on a permanent basis, so that the situation can be resolved, hopefully, once and for all, and the Fisheries Committee will have sufficient time to make its necessary evaluation and give its advice on the proposed agreements accordingly.
Concerning AmendmentÂ 2, as stated in ArticleÂ 7 of the Protocol, it is up to the coastal State, in agreement with the Community, to decide on the way the financial contribution will be used in support of its fisheries policy.
It is, therefore, the responsibility of the Seychelles authorities to identify the main priorities of their fisheries policy to be implemented with the assistance of the Fisheries Agreement.
Therefore, the scope of AmendmentÂ 2 would run against such a right exercised by the third country with which such agreements are negotiated, although we try to influence and have indications within the parameters of the agreement reached on the uses of the funds.
Certainly, the development of coastal populations living on fisheries is an area which we try to impress upon the States concerned and which should be given top priority.
On AmendmentÂ 3, we fully share the concern to keep the European Parliament informed of the various aspects of the implementation of the Protocol.
The Commission already complies with the transmission of such information in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements.
However, I will look at ways and means to improve this communication and discussion process with the European Parliament.
I cannot, however, commit myself here and now to accepting the amendment before I assess the full implications on the resources available at my DG, with the increased responsibilities that we have, without any increase in the number of people.
This task was a problem â we are speaking about some 30Â agreements â and I need to carry out an assessment of what this would imply before I can give positive commitments.
I will certainly try to find ways and means whereby we can improve this process and hopefully have that included in future agreements; once we include it in one, it will become a standard feature in all agreements.
I need to underline that I must be certain that if we undertake commitments, we will be able physically to fulfil them.
The problem that we have faced so far lies in the length of the internal procedures, the consultations at an early stage with the Member States, and the translation requirements that have increased considerably â MrÂ Stevenson made reference to that.
We hope to find a solution in the short term and I will be discussing it with General Morillon in January, so that we can work out a solution which I hope will be acceptable to the Fisheries Committee and will not have a repeat of such occurrences, which are embarrassing to the Commission and leave the European Parliament without real time to effect its rightful functions.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  Written Declaration No 52/2005, by David Martin, Neil Parish, Peter Skinner, Terence Wynn and Robert Evans, on rising international concern over the farming of bear bile in China, has been signed by the majority of Members of this Parliament.
In accordance with Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to the institutions named therein and will be published, indicating the names of the signatories, together with the texts approved on 17 January 2006.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on behalf of all the authors to thank everybody in this Chamber who has signed this declaration.
It has received cross-party, cross-nationality support and it will now go forward to the Commission and the Council.
I think it is something the Chinese Government will really take notice of, because I believe bear farming in China must be brought to an end.
I thank everybody for their support and I hope this will go forward with great vigour.
Finally, I would like to wish you all a happy Christmas.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am asking for the floor under RuleÂ 145 on personal statements, which allows me to speak for up to three minutes; I will not take that much time.
MrÂ President, the verbatim report of Tuesdayâs part-session has only just been made available to us, and it has brought to my attention a personal attack made against me by a man who, until then, I had believed was presiding over the sitting courteously and impartially.
I am referring to the vice-president of the sitting in question, who saw fit to interrupt me and to take sides regarding the background to my dispute with the French Government.
His reference to a historical fact âÂ the tragedy of the Struthof campÂ â even shows that he is completely ignorant of the ins and outs of this tragedy, and of the most recent work of historians on this subject.
The president of the sitting also saw fit to make a comment following one of my colleaguesâ speeches, even though it contained no personal attacks and no insulting comments.
In all of my considerable parliamentary experience, I have never seen a sitting president act as arrogantly as MrÂ McMillan Scott and I find it deeply regrettable.
Â Â  Mr President, I was indeed in the Chair when Mr Gollnisch made an explanation of vote.
He had his full time, I did cut him off and I did make a remark concerning the case that he had raised, in a personal capacity.
I suggest that the House might like to read what I said, because I think they will agree with me and not with Mr Gollnisch.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as is customary at the start of the vote, the general rapporteur presents some technical corrections.
As I do not wish to break with this tradition this year either, allow me to outline some such technical corrections.
I should like, however, to begin by expressing my thanks, because this job has been difficult but, at the same time, extremely satisfying.
I therefore take this opportunity to warmly thank all my colleagues from the Committee on Budgets, its chairman MrÂ Lewandowski, the political groupsâ coordinators and staff, and the Secretariat and all its members, above all the administrator who made certain that I received the constant, loyal and expert assistance of Richard Wester, assistance that tied in well with the meticulous expertise of my assistant, Annalisa Gliubizzi.
My thanks go to all of you too, beginning with MrÂ Borrell, who closely followed all the stages of the procedure, and in addition, of course, to all my fellow Members, who made their own contributions via ideas and proposals, and who I hope today will also use their vote to contribute to a positive outcome, honouring me with their trust.
Ladies and gentlemen, this truly represents a positive outcome, a sign of a trend that is being reversed, the credit for which goes to all the institutions, but â and I say this with a real sense of pride â above all to our Parliament.
I hope that this outcome opens the minds of those who still do not wish to recognise how costly a non-Europe would be.
The technical tasks to be performed are as follows: firstly, following the adoption or imminent approval of a number of legal bases, we should release the appropriations placed in reserve for a series of budget lines.
I should like to make it clear that this is only technically possible for those budget lines on which an amendment tabled by Parliament already existed.
Where that is not the case, we call on the Commission to put forward a proposal for a virement as soon as possible.
The lines in question are 02 01 04 04; 04 01 04 05; 04 05 01; 04 05 02; 04 05 03; 09 03 01; 11 07 01; and 24 02 02.
Secondly, the section of Amendment 209 relating to line 19 08 02 01 â on the MEDA Programme â is approved in the sum of EURÂ 25Â 056Â 550.
This amendment is covered by the vote on Block 1.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, following these technical corrections, I propose we proceed to the vote and I also take this opportunity to give you all my best and warmest wishes for the festive period.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would just like to concur with Mr Pittella and thank all those who have worked on producing the budget for 2006, and to agree with Mr Pittellaâs statement that a fine result has been achieved and that the 2006 budget is one that serves the interests of the European Union.
I also have one technical correction, which concerns Amendment 193 of Part 11, in connection with the European Court of Justice.
Due to technical problems the notes are missing there, but the text of the note is as follows: âA 3.6 per cent reduction has been made in this part in connection with staff posts: five new staff posts in the IT sector (four B3 posts and one C1 post) and 16 staff posts for Romania and Bulgaria (ten A7 posts, two B3 posts and four C1 posts)â.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to say that, if this amendment were to be rejected, then we would go beyond the ceiling agreed on with the Council and we would therefore have some procedural problems.
I am therefore relying on my fellow Membersâ sense of responsibility.
Â Â  Alright, that concludes the vote.
Normally we would now issue the explicit agreement of Parliament and the Council on the procedure for approving the budget and the maximum rate of increase.
But the Minister is not here yet.
We shall therefore continue voting on other things and we shall return to it later.
Please be courteous towards the British Presidency.
We shall continue with the vote and meanwhile the Minister will arrive.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this really is a minimal adjustment, just to make it clearer that the letter of amendment is consistent with number two â the agreement made between Parliament and the Council â but it really is an adjustment to the form, which does not in the least affect the content.
Mr President, I appreciate that the speed with which we vote sometimes leads us to make errors, which we believe are made when there is no call for abstentions, which are a political position that must be recorded.
Stating simply âforâ and âagainstâ naturally reflects the result of the vote, but it does not reflect the particular result of certain votes, as has happened in this case, where we have wished to express various abstentions.
Â Â  We shall carry on voting and we shall continue with the Schwab report.
But could somebody from the Secretariat please verify where the Council is.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise under Rule 145 to make a short personal statement following the remarks made by the Presidency in a debate yesterday, which I find unhelpful and not positive at all.
Whilst I am not of the governing party of the UK, I find it very demeaning that the Council is not here this morning.
I, and my friends and colleagues from Britain, do not want that kind of discourtesy to be thought of as normal, at least in this Chamber.
Â Â  Let us say that it has been a rather sophisticated use of Rule 145.
Â Â  Mr President, if we cannot be respectful in listening to one another, there is hardly any reason to be here.
I rise under the precedent of Rule 145.
I would like to inform the House that the Council left their building over an hour ago, the traffic in the vicinity of Strasbourg is extremely bad and it is not the intention of Her Majestyâs Government to slight this House or its Members.
I am told that the government representative is five minutes away.
I beg the Houseâs indulgence.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to begin by apologising to Parliament for arriving here late this morning.
The reason for this is simply that I was told there was an entirely different timescale.
Because of that I arrived at what I thought to be on time, so I genuinely apologise to all Members of Parliament for that misunderstanding.
Certainly, had I been aware of the correct timing, I would have made sure, as a matter of courtesy to Parliament, that I arrived on time.
So I genuinely apologise for that misunderstanding.
I am pleased to note that the agreement reached between our two institutions, following negotiations at the conciliation on 24Â November and the trialogue on 30Â November has now been included in the 2006 budget.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that some small differences remain between us concerning the classification of expenditure in the budget and that the Council reserves its rights entirely in this respect.
However, I am pleased to confirm that the Council can accept the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, MrÂ Lewandowski, the two rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Dombrovskis, and the Commissioner, MrsÂ GrybauskaitÄ, for their constructive cooperation in establishing this budget.
Let us hope this is good news in terms of the delicate negotiations that are taking place as we speak in relation to the financial perspective.
That will be in the interests of the European Union and its relationship with the people of Europe.
I thank you very much for the work we have done together to make the 2006 budget possible.
Once again I apologise for the misunderstanding which caused me to arrive late this morning.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for its statement.
Before moving on to the signature of the budget, please allow me to point out that the budget that we have just approved for 2006, in terms of commitment appropriations, represents 1.09% of gross domestic product for the 25 countries of the Union.
In a few hours time, in Brussels, we shall examine a budget for 2007-2013 which proposes an average of 1.03% for 27 countries of the Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues for that very warm endorsement of my report, which marks a major step forward in the rights of disabled people and passengers of reduced mobility.
It is a tremendous vote in favour.
It was interesting that there were six people who decided to vote against it, but through the joys and wonders of technology we were able to name and shame them.
I am sure the House will welcome the fact that the way Parliament voted means we will be able to get an agreement at first reading.
All 25Â governments and the Commission have indicated that they will accept all the amendments Parliament has passed.
In thanking colleagues, allow me to mention that people will also welcome the fact that this is a major achievement under the British Presidency.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to confirm that AmendmentÂ 9, calling for the sum of EURÂ 40Â million to be increased to EURÂ 80Â million, has been withdrawn.
I would like not only to confirm the withdrawal of the amendment, but also to take responsibility for it.
The Committee on Development had adopted this amendment unanimously and I am very grateful to the members of that committee for their clear-sightedness and their support.
The Council, however, has refused to accept even the slightest gesture towards the ACP countries, despite the position and positive actions taken by the UK Presidency, to which I can bear witness.
The Commission, for its part, was not willing to budge an inch.
The system, blocked due to this Parliamentâs budgetary debate, did the rest and dealt the final blow.
However, for pressing schedule reasons, MrÂ President, this regulation absolutely must be adopted at first reading.
We have therefore accepted our responsibilities and withdrawn AmendmentÂ 9, which was calling for EURÂ 80Â million.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am forced, for the reasons I have just outlined, to ask you to vote on this report, and to do so in line with your votes on the budget.
However, in order to send a message to the ACP countries that some of us here have not forgotten them, I request that my name be deleted from the text, and I have a proposal for my fellow members of the Committee on Development, and for them alone: make a final, symbolic gesture by voting ânoâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would just like to request a purely formal correction to paragraphÂ 6 of the draft compromise resolution, reinstating the final phrase of the final clause starting âin order toâ at the end of the first part, in other words after âAssociation Councilâ, in order to reproduce the text on which we reached agreement.
I would also request that, where the text simply refers to âthe summitâ, we add âthe WSISâ in brackets, to be consistent with the rest of the resolution and in order to avoid confusion if isolated paragraphs of the text are quoted.
I would like to end by thanking the members of the various groups who were willing to extend the scope of this resolution to the conclusions of the summit.
I must stress how important this resolution is now that the Sakharov Prize has been awarded and given that we in this House emphasised yesterday that freedom of expression â a fundamental right â and freedom of the press must be a part of all our activities, particularly when we have agreements with partner countries.
Â Â  . â () Before we proceed to the vote, I would like to propose two more or less technical amendments.
In paragraph 3 of my report, in the phrase âapplicable to all three categories set out in Article 87(3)(a)â at the end of the first line and the beginning of the second line, I would like to delete the word âthreeâ, so that the text would then read âapplicable to all categories set out in Article 87(3)(a)â.
I would also like to propose another amendment to the paragraph, or to Amendment 31, which is essentially of a technical nature as well, but I will probably do this when we vote on this paragraph.
Â Â  . â () In the last line, or in the last sentence of this paragraph, I would like to change the words âtoo brutalâ (âprÃ­liÅ¡ brutÃ¡lneâ in Slovak) to the words âvery significantâ (âveÄŸmi vÃœznamnÃ©â).
So, the aim is to change the wording from âtoo brutalâ to âvery significantâ.
Â Â  Mr President, the ALDE Group would like to suggest an oral amendment to Amendment 9, so that it reads: âWhereas international terrorism poses one of the greatest threats to society within the EU and to those valuesâ.
If that oral amendment were accepted, then we would support Amendment 9.
Â Â  Mr President, we would like to suggest an oral amendment to take out the word âNATOâ, which we thought we had taken out in the negotiations anyway. There has been a misunderstanding.
It should not be there.
In which case, I propose that the split vote would be unnecessary, because the text would read: âincluding facilities pertaining to military bases such as...â.
So we should take out the word âNATOâ, which would enable us to vote on the recital as a whole, without the split.
Â Â  Mr President, I should just like to make a point about linguistics, something that colleagues will be interested in.
The word âtransportationâ is an American word; the English word is âtransportâ.
Bearing in mind the nature of the report, we ought to have it in English.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to propose, through an oral amendment, a merger of AmendmentsÂ 14, 12 and 5.
This concerns the very important but also sensitive issue of adoption in Romania.
We want to propose to the Romanian Government that it settle a number of cases that are still pending, as a consequence of a moratorium on international adoption, proposed in the past by this Parliament.
It is an important oral amendment.
I will read it carefully so that everybody knows what we are voting for: âNotes with satisfaction the improvements made by Romanian authorities in the area of the protection of children and urges the Romanian Government to settle the cases of applications for international adoption made during the moratorium of June 2001, ensuring that all cases are examined in light of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Romanian law on the legal status of adoption, with the goal of allowing inter-country adoptions to take place, where justified and appropriate, in those special casesâ.
Â Â  Mr President, over the past few days, I have received questions from other groups about the wording of Amendment 2, which was tabled by my group.
Moreover, a separate debate has been held, and a vote taken, on one aspect of this subject, namely the allegations of the existence of CIA camps in Romania and elsewhere, and also on the need for an inquiry into these allegations.
I would therefore propose that, in this amendment, we confine ourselves to the position of this candidate Member State and any incorrect actions on its part.
We can do this by adding âallegations of the existenceâ to the English version and deleting âbut also to undertake informal investigationsâ from it.
I assume that, in this way, the objections to the original text would be removed.
Â Â  Mr President, I have no desire to hold up proceedings, but, as this is the last vote at which Members will be present in large numbers, I would like, on behalf of my group â and, I take it, also on behalf of all Members of the House â to thank the services most warmly for preparing the difficult votes that we have had over the past year.
They have done a splendid job and made our work easier.
We want to wish them a happy festive season and ask them to be just as helpful next year too.
Â Â  Mr President, I would just like to point out â not least for Mr Swobodaâs benefit â that this is not the last vote today.
I think it is a pity that he is departing so soon for his Christmas holidays and would be happy if he were to hang around for a bit longer.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  . We have maintained that ACP sugar reform compensation should be at the level of EUR 80 million not EUR 40 million.
We are also opposed to open-ended CFSP funding without adequate justification.
- Rejection of draft EU budget 2006 (RC-B6-0642/2005)
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the agreement on the 2006 budget, reached between the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
The EU budget must primarily be used to create full employment in Europe and to help bring about sustainable social, economic and environmental development.
We particularly welcome the fact that our repeated demands for investment in the Lisbon Strategy, including more money for student exchange programmes and for the EUâs research and development programme, have been listened to.
The payments in the agricultural category are lower than those originally proposed, and we think that this is fair.
There is too much in the way of direct agricultural aid, and this leads to inefficient agriculture that damages the environment and widens the gap between rich and poor in the world.
We cannot, therefore, support wordings that regret the cutbacks in agricultural aid decided on by the Council.
Â Â  . The UKIP MEPs are voting for the rejection of the Draft General Budget, not because they support an increase in the budget, but on the principle that the UK should take its own decisions regarding funding priorities and not contribute to the EU budget.
Â Â  In the vote on the budget, the Social Democrats have voted in favour of block 1, involving a strengthening of central budget headings for research, development etc. It must, however, be stated, that the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament cannot support the EUâs contributing financially to the spread of nuclear power, either within or outside the Community.
Â Â  . I voted for this amendment NOT to support an increase in the budget, but because I do not wish any monies to be spent by the UK, which should rather be spent in fulfilling bilateral agreements.
Â Â  The June List is voting against all the proposals entailing further increases in costs.
It believes that each EU budget should be limited to 1.00%.
On budget issues, Parliamentâs role should be limited to determining priorities within the budgetary framework proposed by the Council.
Instead of accepting the Councilâs first proposal concerning the level of the budget, Parliament chose, at first reading, to table amendments increasing both payments and forthcoming commitments.
As a consequence of these proposed increases in expenditure, there were new negotiations with the Council.
Unfortunately, the Council accepted certain increases in expenditure in the course of these negotiations.
In spite of all this, Parliament chooses again to propose new increases in expenditure in the run-up to the second reading.
This development is extremely regrettable and shows the importance of not increasing the European Parliamentâs influence.
Â Â  I voted against because of the explanatory statement concerning growth and Turkey.
I am opposed to short-term growth and in favour of Turkish accession, not the other way around.
Unfortunately, I could not therefore support this proposal to reject the budget.
Â Â  . The UKIP MEPs are voting for the rejection of the Draft General Budget, not because they support an increase in the budget, but on the principle that the UK should take its own decisions regarding funding priorities and not contribute to the EU budget.
Â Â  . I am voting in favour of rejecting the budget, not because I am in favour of increasing it, but because I do not wish for United Kingdom funds to be spent in this way, or in any way by the European Union.
Â Â  . British Conservatives support the general direction of the 2006 budget, particularly approving of increased support for the Lisbon objectives and maintaining the overall budget level at 1.01% GNI.
However, we urge more radical reform of the overall budget.
Â Â  Regarding letter of amendment No 1, the Danish Liberal Party does not believe that the destruction of foodstuffs is appropriate.
However, the problem is aid for production, not aid for destruction.
The amendment concerns the effects of the problem, but does not tackle its cause.
Regarding letter of amendment No 2, the Danish Liberal Party wishes to solve the problems of famine in developing countries, but believes that doing so requires a far more serious and coordinated effort than that indicated in this proposal.
Regarding letter of amendment No 3, the Danish Liberal Party is opposed to aid for the export of live animals, but the amendment will not solve this problem.
The wording is also fairly unclear.
Regarding letter of amendment No 6, the Danish Liberal Party supports reform of the reimbursement of travel expenses, so that all reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded.
Such reform has, however, already been decided on with the new Statute for Members.
Moreover, the amendment could not be implemented in practice.
Overall, MrÂ Bondeâs amendments have to be characterised as ill thought-out.
Â Â  We Moderates wish to develop and modernise the European Unionâs budget.
That means that we are looking for less in terms of subsidies and more in terms of investment in what is required by a modern economy and global competition.
We also wish to strengthen the EUâs ability to be a strong international partner in pursuit of freedom, peace and security.
As it currently stands, the budget is outdated and lays too much emphasis on agriculture and on subsidies to the old Member States to cover expenditure that those countries themselves should be able to meet.
Aid from Structural and Cohesion Funds should in the first place go to the new Member States and the poor regions.
In the light of this, we have sought an end to export subsidies and aid to tobacco cultivation and have sought to phase out agricultural aid.
However, we wish to increase aid for research and development, as well as efforts to promote security and the development of the Neighbourhood Policy.
The EU needs a budget, and we are therefore voting in favour of the proposal, even though we believe that it needs to be changed in significant ways.
Â Â  .
The 2006 budget is the last one in the 2000-2006 financial perspective and also the last one before the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
I have three brief comments: the share of the total budget given to agriculture and rural development is now only 43%, which gives the lie to the United Kingdomâs argument that the CAP is too expensive.
Next, whatever the European Parliament and the Commission may say, the budget is steadily increasing unchecked: payment appropriations have increased by 5.4%, which is more than all the national budgets.
Finally, the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council is the result of a shameful bargain negotiated behind the backs of the European citizens: the Council got what it wanted on the CFSP; in exchange, Parliament has kept its priorities: culture, youth, ecology and federalist propaganda.
The only ones not satisfied by this budget are the European taxpayers, who are seeing their taxes increase to pay, amongst other things, their countriesâ financial contributions to the European Union.
In 2005, France paid EUR 16.7Â billion.
What will it pay in 2006 in a Union of 25 Member States, which expect better?
Â Â  . I shall use this explanation of vote as a way of reflecting on the negotiations and agreements on Community budgets.
1.
There have until now been more contradictions than anything else in the Council.
Running scared, the political forces and major economic interests at the root of so-called âEuropean integrationâ sound their warnings of the consequences of disagreement between the so-called âpowerhousesâ of the EU.
A second crisis, following the resounding ânoâ votes delivered by the French and Dutch people to the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ, would intensify the feeling that the path that they tell us is the only one to follow lacks âcredibilityâ.
This is why they are calling for âagendasâ to be harmonised, not least at the World Trade Organisation.
2.
It does not matter how much Parliament glosses over its complicity in the systematic reduction in the Community budget in recent years â surely this reflects the commitments made by the right-wing and social-democrat forces in the Commission, the Council and in every EU Member State â but the (cold) figures are there for all to see.
Overlooking its previous proposals, and throwing consistency out of the window, Parliamentâs proposal for 2006 is virtually equivalent to what the Luxembourg Presidency proposed for 2007-2013.
Experience has taught us that this story is far from over; after all, Parliament has a habit of lauding today what it found unacceptable yesterday.
Â Â  . Unlike the ongoing negotiations on the financial perspective, the EUâs budget for 2006 gives Parliament some cause for satisfaction.
By keeping payment appropriations at 1.01% of EU GNI, Parliament has achieved a slight increase on last yearâs figure.
The real plus point here, however, and the reason for my full support, has been the increased funding made available for a range of programmes that impact directly on the lives of Europeâs citizens, such as LIFE and SOCRATES.
A further reason to be pleased was the increased budget for initiatives in the area of research and support for SMEs, which are crucial if we are to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
As for structural actions, I agree with the idea of not raising the amount of future funding to the new Member States until there has been an improvement in the rate of use of the current funds.
Lastly, by adopting this 2006 budget, Parliament will be sending out a highly symbolic message for the ongoing debate on the next financial perspective 2007-2013.
If the perspective is not adopted before the end of the British Presidency, it will be the 2006 budget that will act as the basis for negotiations on the next annual budget, using the so-called âduodecimalâ system.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur again for an excellent report, while also pointing out that I believe that an error has crept in to the vote, since we should have voted on Amendment 24, moved by Mrs Lichtenberger from the Group of the Greens/Free Democratic Alliance, which would have included the automatic 60% mark-up on the infrastructure charges.
Apart from that, I am well satisfied with the report.
Â Â  . The report before us concerns the charging of heavy goods vehicles.
It is an issue of great importance to the proper operation of the internal market.
As matters stand, there are quite a few different models for road charges in the European Union, a state of affairs that can bring about a distortion of competition.
Road tolls may be justified, enabling charges to be levied to cover environmental pollution and wear and tear on the roads.
In todayâs vote, the June List has chosen to support quite a few of the amendments in the report.
We believe that heavy goods traffic is an important part of the internal market.
We also believe that environmental problems are cross-border in character and that there is thus added value in dealing with these issues at EU level.
Â Â  â () The reason I voted for the report is that it improves on the Commissionâs proposal whilst also eliminating discrimination and ensuring equal rights for all people travelling by air.
This regulation is the first time that legislation has specifically dealt with the transport of persons with reduced mobility who are put at a disadvantage due to disability, age or for other reasons.
I appreciate the fact that the single market in the area of air traffic services will serve all citizens equally and ensure that passengers are not refused air transport on the grounds of reduced mobility.
The approval of the report sends a positive signal from the European Parliament to the disabled, and I feel that it will make a nice Christmas present for them as well.
Â Â  . UKIP fully recognises the desirability of improving conditions for handicapped people, particularly in some states on mainland Europe.
However, we reject the notion that improvements should be carried out under the competence of the Commission.
This should be the sole prerogative of democratic national states.
Â Â  . I voted against this proposal NOT because I wish to hinder persons with reduced mobility but because,
a) this should be left to member states to make appropriate arrangements
b) current law requires the airline to make provision, to require travel agents and booking firms do so will place an intolerable administrative burden on them, will seriously confuse the area between the agent's responsibility and the airline's, and will raise costs, and is probably against EU law.
Â Â  . This report is a welcome addition to the ongoing debate on the rights of passengers with limited mobility.
As a person with a disability, I have experienced both the best and the worst of treatment as a passenger, and should like to emphasise that, in most cases, the service providers try to achieve the maximum efficient service.
However, there are times when particular airline rules, or, indeed, the attitude of a captain, can have a very negative impact on the travelling experience.
The most important aspects of improving the service relate, in my opinion, to the training of personnel, as well as clear and coherent guidelines for operators across the sector.
Also why not ask the passengers rather than assuming that their needs will be known?
I welcome the common agreement from the Commission and Council on this matter and congratulate the rapporteur on his ability to garner the House.
Â Â  . According to non-governmental organisations, this is the first Community-level regulatory instrument specifically geared towards the 50Â million or so disabled persons in the EU.
The purpose is to ensure that disabled persons (as Parliament proposed) and persons with reduced mobility have access to air transport.
The regulation before us establishes rules to protect and to provide assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility travelling by air.
This will be achieved by protecting them from discrimination, and by ensuring that they receive assistance at departure, transit and arrival airports, which should be provided at no additional cost to the passenger.
Further initiatives include a range of measures to inform disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility of their rights.
We welcome the idea of training ground staff and flight crew, and of ensuring that the necessary infrastructure and aircraft are in place for the service to be provided.
We voted in favour of this initiative.
Â Â  Â Â Having worked with the disabled community for many years, I should like to give the following explanation of vote.
Disabled persons and persons whose mobility is restricted due to disability or other conditions, such as old age, still have the same rights as other citizens.
This also holds true when they travel by air.
Blind and deaf and dumb people should be included in this group too, since they need appropriate access to information when they travel.
It would be wrong to ask disabled air passengers to pay additional charges.
A proposal should be made to include these costs in the general expenses of the individual carriers.
After all, we are not talking about huge sums of money.
There should be a guarantee that the needs of disabled persons will be met throughout the EU, regardless of which airline or airport they use, and assistance should be provided at each stage of their journey.
Examples of such assistance include help when moving around the terminal, boarding or leaving the plane, collecting luggage or transferring to other flights, and the provision of a wheelchair with an attendant at the check-in counter.
It would be advisable to ask carriers to install appropriate devices that make it easier for disabled persons to board and leave planes.
Designers of passenger planes should also ensure that features such as gangway width and toilet size are tailored to the needs of persons with restricted mobility.
On top of this, a uniform EU-wide system must be put in place for the provision of assistance to disabled air passengers.
This should include the development of service standards that are mandatory in all Community airports.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate MrÂ Evans on his important report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air, to which I lend my full backing.
I particularly welcome all of the amendments aimed at introducing an integrated service to facilitate access to air transport for disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility, at no extra cost to those passengers.
Given the impact that this regulation will have on the air travel market, and the objective that the EU has set itself, this proposal should indeed take account of the difficulties experienced by people with reduced mobility, but should also take into account the difficulties of all those in need of guidance, communication or written assistance when they travel.
Â Â  . I voted enthusiastically for the Evans Report, because I believe it is a significant contribution to anti-discrimination policies for people with disabilities who want the freedom to fly without hindrance.
Â Â  . UKIP fully recognises the desirability of improving conditions for handicapped people, particularly in some states on mainland Europe.
However, we reject the notion that improvements should be carried out under the competence of the Commission.
Â Â  . â The objective that the Council and the European Parliament have set themselves in this field, namely the principle of an integrated service to help passengers with disabilities and reduced mobility to access air transport, is not only laudable but indispensable, because there was an urgent need for action.
There is currently a striking disparity in situations and treatment, whether with regard to access to airports or in terms of the assistance provided by airlines and airports.
Be it the lack of a seat for a companion to sit next to the person with reduced mobility, the lack of medical equipment on board and on the ground, such as electric wheelchairs for example, or the lack of disability awareness training for airport staff, it is obvious that the principle of equality for all passengers is not respected to the same extent in all airports and by all European airlines.
I am also pleased to note that the efforts that must now be made by the various airlines and airports must not entail specific supplementary charges for disabled people or those with reduced mobility.
It is the least we can do.
Â Â  . I applaud this report and am delighted by the size of the majority it achieved in this house.
Many of our citizens think that disability issues have been resolved because legislation in many of our countries has been in place for years.
That is just not the case, the reality on the ground often does not match the aims of the legislative framework, and further urgent action is very necessary to ensure that all our citizens have access to travel.
This is a good news story of the European Union taking action where Member States have not, and I am very very pleased to support it.
Â Â  . It is not the business of the EU to run airlines.
If recommendations of this kind are to be internationally effective the measures must be enforced by the body overseeing airlines, not the EU who like to dictate on all subjects, including the rules of football!
Â Â  . I fully recognise the desirability of improving conditions for handicapped people.
However, I reject the notion that this should be done, by the EU on behalf of any one, let alone sovereign Nation States.
I also reject the notion, implicit within this that agents booking any travel arrangements should bear the contractual responsibilities and liabilities of either party
Â Â  . I consider the ongoing reform of the sugar regime to be unfair on two counts:
1 - First for the European producers themselves, because there is a risk that the big multinational companies that consume sugar, such as NestlÃ©, will be the principal beneficiaries of the reform.
The smaller producers, on the other hand, could suffer from the 31% reduction in the guaranteed price.
2 - Above all, though, this reform is unfair to the poor sugar-producing countries.
Once again, they are the ones who have to pay the price.
The figures speak for themselves.
European producers can count on a package of EURÂ 1.5Â billion in compensation and EURÂ 4.2Â billion for restructuring the sector, while the ACP countries currently have only the prospect of EURÂ 40Â million.
This amount is obscene.
In the Committee on Development, we proposed EUR 80Â million.
MrÂ Lehideuxâs report aims to soften some of the pernicious effects of the reform of the EUâs sugar regime, by proposing:
- to make the aid complementary to the other financial instruments of EU development policy,
- measures to diversify the economies of countries that are highly dependent on sugar, such as the islands of the Caribbean or Mauritius.
Â Â  The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted in favour of the report, because it is crucial to devise accompanying measures for the Sugar Protocol countries.
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament must, however, express regret about the fact that the agreement on the 2006 budget, entered into between the budget authorities, does not make it possible to increase the aid to the Sugar Protocol countries, as the proposed level of support has to be regarded as inadequate.
Â Â  The June List welcomes the reform of the EUâs sugar regime and finds it encouraging that this sector is being adapted to the market to a greater degree.
We are critical of the EUâs export subsidies to domestic sugar producers and welcome the fact that it will be possible for sugar to be traded under fairer conditions in the future.
Through advantageous agreements, the ACP countries have had special access to the EUâs market.
The new organisation of the market for sugar will thus have consequences for certain ACP countries.
The change to the organisation of the market is, however, necessary and is in the long-term interests of all the parties.
The European Parliamentâs rapporteur recommends that significant economic adjustment aid be paid to the ACP countries.
We wish to emphasise that such measures would scarcely guarantee that necessary restructuring would be carried out.
We are looking for clearer strategies and priorities in terms of what the financial resources are specifically to be used for.
Otherwise, there is a significant risk that the restructuring necessary in the long term will not be implemented to the degree that is to be desired.
Â Â  . As we have previously stated, we object to the premises on which the reform of the Common Market Organisation for Sugar is predicated.
It is being used as a bargaining chip by the EU to obtain benefits in the trade in industrial goods and services, and is a further example of the liberalisation of the worldwide farming trade, a phenomenon that promotes competition and concentrates production into the framework of the international division of labour.
This policy penalises small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the most economically developed countries.
It also leads to monoculture, the concentration of holdings and the abandonment of farming by millions of country people in poor and developing countries, which in turn undermines their food sovereignty and safety.
This report aims to improve upon some of the Commissionâs proposals for the signatories to the Sugar Protocol, yet falls a long way short of what is required, because it does not even question, let alone reject, its basic premise, namely its liberalising approach.
The reportâs main proposal is to offset the âserious social, economic and environmental consequencesâ that the âadjustment processâ will have on these countries.
To sum this up in one sentence, the losers will be the farmers and food sovereignty, whereas the winners will be agri-business and the major distributors.
Â Â  .
The Lehideux report is a catalogue of good intentions with no concrete results, apart from EURÂ 40Â million of financial support in 2006.
The 18 ACP countries, signatories to the Sugar Protocol, export 1.6Â million tonnes of cane sugar a year to the European Union at the EU price.
The Councilâs decision to reduce the price of sugar by 36% over four years will result in an equivalent reduction in their export earnings.
The WTO is dealing a harsh blow to countries as poor as Swaziland and Malawi by forcing the European Union to reform its sugar sector on the basis of a complaint by Brazil.
As the ACP countries have quite rightly said, the reform is too fast and too extensive.
In reality, the only winner will be Brazil, the top worldwide exporter of cane sugar, which will take advantage of this situation to increase its share of the export market to the detriment of the ACP countries.
At a time when the WTO is discussing the development round, this is a very poor example for the European Union to give to Africa, even if the âeverything but armsâ initiative is an attempt to disguise our divisions and our egotism.
This reform of the sugar regime will increase their poverty, with all the consequences you can imagine in terms of immigration.
Â Â  . I support this report because it reaffirms the Councilâs conclusions that the EUâs bilateral fisheries relationships should graduate from being access agreements to being âpartnership agreementsâ.
Such a move will contribute towards responsible fishing in the third country concerned, and ensures fishing opportunities for the EUâs distant fishing fleet.
The agreement in question safeguards fishing opportunities for around 52 Community vessels, including five Portuguese surface longliners.
I welcome the fact that this agreement is an instrument that will protect fisheries activities and jobs in fishing fleets, and the fact that it upholds the general principles for preserving fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy.
Â Â  The June List believes that the EU should immediately cease concluding fisheries agreements with third countries.
The common fisheries policy has led to many European waters being depleted of fish and to irrevocable damage to sensitive marine environments.
The fisheries policy also has devastating global consequences.
The fisheries agreements concluded by the EU with third countries generate short-term income for the countries concluding the agreements.
In the longer term, the agreements lead, however, to the depletion of fish stocks and make it difficult for local fishing industries to develop.
Only a limited amount of the compensation paid out goes to the local population.
The agreements should be paid for by those countries or fleets that choose to make use of these agreements.
The fisheries agreements should not be concluded at all within the framework of the EU.
The report contains a positive amendment to the effect that the financial contributions should also be used for the development of coastal populations dependent on fisheries for their living (Amendment 2).
The report as a whole emphasises, however, that the agreements are of benefit both to the EU and to third countries.
We do not share this view and have thus voted against what is being proposed on this matter.
The position that we are expressing through this explanation of vote constitutes the attitude that we have adopted on principle where this issue is concerned.
The explanation of vote will thus apply to future matters of a similar kind.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of the Fisheries Protocol because it guarantees fishing opportunities for the various fleets of the Member States operating in Seychelles waters until 17Â JanuaryÂ 2011, including five Portuguese surface longliners.
The renewal of this protocol is an important factor in guaranteeing the survival of Member Statesâ surface longliner fishing, a section of the fleet that has been severely affected by the crisis in the fisheries sector in recent years.
A case in point is Portugal, where the number of vessels has dwindled year on year.
Nevertheless, even taking account of the fact that this new Protocol will last for six years, and bearing in mind the take-up levels of the fishing opportunities on offer, we must highlight the reduction in the number of surface longliners and the increased cost of licences, which we feel is unjustified.
This will lead to higher equipment costs and thus a loss of income.
It should be highlighted that there is a proposal to increase the cost of licences to EURÂ 1Â 000 for surface longliners over 150 grt and to EURÂ 750 for surface longliners less than 150 grt.
Â Â  . I voted against this report because the Fisheries Agreements in practice merely export our own disastrous fisheries policy to the rest of the world.
The Common Fisheries Policy is untenable, illogical and has been an unmitigated disaster.
More so, in our Union of 25 it will collapse under the weight of its own contradictions.
We need to ensure that EU decision making is logical, the Common Fisheries Policy is not and puts those of us who are pro-European in the unenviable position of having to explain such an illogical and disastrous policy to our increasingly rightly sceptical electorate.
Â Â  . I am, of course, pleased that the fishing agreement between the EC and the Seychelles, the first agreement negotiated within the framework of the Partnership Agreements, has been extended.
This agreement is an opportunity for all and beneficial to everyone:
- It will give Community vessels transparent and managed access to the fishery resources of the Seychelles;
- In return, the financial compensation paid by the EU will be a great support to coastal populations, by assisting in the development of certain vital economic sectors, such as the processing industry and port services.
- I would add that the agreement allows for the option of increasing the financial compensation paid by the EC depending on catch volumes.
That is why I support this report unreservedly.
The only fly in the ointment now is the lack of consideration given to the European Parliament.
It is not right that we had to wait for almost a year to receive the text of the Protocol, for administrative and technical reasons.
I hope that, in future, the European Parliament will be more involved in monitoring this agreement throughout its lifetime.
Hopefully that is not just pie in the sky.
Â Â  . In light of the difficulties experienced by businesses and ship-owners involved in fishing in third countries arising from the gap between the expiry of one protocol and the entry into force of its replacement, I feel that the Commissionâs proposal should be adopted as quickly as possible.
I also agree with the rapporteur, however, that a more stable solution needs to be found than the one in the Commissionâs proposal, a solution that would preclude the need to use a range of provisional procedures that cause problems for Community operators and the fisheries sector in the third country.
The time that elapses between the signing of the Protocol and its adoption by the Council must be made shorter, in such a way that both provisional application and the advance issuing of licences become no more than a last resort.
Â Â  . We regret the fact that our proposal in support of increasing the global financial envelope for fisheries was rejected.
This rejection is typical of the inconsistency of both Parliament and the rapporteur; both acknowledge that the budget falls short of what is required if we are to address the economic and social crisis facing the sector, and yet despite the fact that it is one of the key issues in the report before us, it is not being increased.
We are very pleased, on the other hand, that our proposal aimed at funding measures to promote or set up small-scale coastal fishing representative associations, and to ensure their involvement in the decision-making process of the common fisheries policy was adopted.
This proposal was in line with the outcome of the public hearing on this section of the fleet held by Parliamentâs Committee on Fisheries.
I should like to point out that there are aspects of the current regulation on which we have reservations, due to their ramifications for the sovereignty of Member States. Examples of this include the role of the Community Fisheries Control Agency, and the rapporteurâs proposal to set up a framework agreement as regards the fisheries agreements with third countries.
We therefore opted to abstain.
Â Â  . I believe this report is a well balanced and thoughtful response to EU fisheries policy, which is why I supported it wholeheartedly.
Â Â  . I would like to thank all colleagues who have today voted for my report.
The overwhelming support for Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) sends a clear signal to the European Commission that these organisations require funding after the transitional period.
RACs allow local stakeholders to have a voice in decision making which affects their local interests.
We must now call on the Commission to come forward with clear proposals to help RACs.
Aid to Georgia
Â Â  . The extension of financial aid to Georgia is a practical demonstration of the EU reaching outward to our near neighbours with real assistance.
