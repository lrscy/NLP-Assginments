The issue is, therefore, one of our top priorities.
Mr President, the Commissioner's commitment on this issue is not in doubt at all.
The Commissioner will be aware of the letter that the President-in-Office of the ACP sent in May 2003 to the chair of the TRIPs Council, raising a number of issues.
I believe it was a very good letter and one that covered the issues and concerns very well.
The letter, however, refers to the EU proposals, and says that the EU is making an unacceptable attempt to restrict the ACP's use of compulsory licensing.
It also mentions the references to the WHO and so on, with which the ACP countries are not happy.
They are not happy with any suggestion that seems to deviate from the Doha Declaration, which sets no limitations of this kind.
The application of the agreement on national emergencies is something the ACP and other developing countries are not happy with.
Commissioner, I know that you are making every effort to bring the opposing sides together, but are you not putting yourself in danger of being seen as deviating from the content and understanding of the consensus which was so valiantly achieved in the Doha Declaration?
In the letter, the ACP countries ask whether there is a straightforward and easy way to implement a solution.
Do you think, Commissioner, that it is at all possible for you to answer the ACP and say 'yes, it is possible for us to find a solution and implement it with reasonable ease'?
I would like, first of all, to reassure Mrs Kinnock that I have no deviationist leanings of any sort, in particular with regard to the December compromise, which I was partially responsible for putting together.
I presented this proposal to consult the World Health Organisation, should this prove necessary, in January because I believe that the Americans are not on board on this matter.
The US pharmaceutical industry considers that the arrangements in their current form still contain a number of loopholes and has no confidence that the system is going to be used for the purpose for which it was put on the table.
A similar position is held by the developing countries, which also lack confidence and feel that the pharmaceutical industry in general will take every opportunity to take all the credit, as it has done, in their opinion, over the last few years.
The diagnosis is, therefore, clear.
What we have on the table is a text with which we agree. The Americans do not agree with it because they do not have confidence in the system.
We must consequently raise the level of confidence in the system on both sides and this is what we are working on.
This must not be done, however, to the detriment of the compromise which is on the table on the subject of the diseases mentioned - a compromise which is in place and which we do not wish to go into now - or to the detriment of countries that could benefit from the measures set out in the agreement because they do not have their own pharmaceutical production capacity.
The Perez Motta compromise, as the technical jargon has it, is the one on the table and this is the right approach.
We simply have to increase both sides' level of confidence in the system.
Question No 36 by Juan JosÃ© Bayona de Perogordo (H-0399/03):
Subject: Unfair competition from goods imported from China
In the course of 2001, China greatly increased its exports of ceramics.
The continuing existence of state-owned companies and the selling off of stocks from others which have already closed account for the fact that Chinese production prices are very low.
Although the country still has limited export capacity, the EU's trade deficit is steadily increasing on account of unfair competitive practices, the most serious of which is the copying of EU ceramic products which are then labelled and sold as having been 'made in the EU'.
Is the Commission planning to take action in order to prevent this type of fraud in the export of ceramics from China?
Are any negotiations being held with the Chinese authorities with a view to improving the terms and conditions under which Community businesses may secure access to a market in which, despite China's membership of the WTO, there are still major sources of discrimination and obstacles to investment?
I will respond very briefly to Mr Bayona de Perogordo's question.
This matter is not very complicated in technical terms, but the question raises two separate issues: the first is the increase in imports of ceramic products from the People's Republic of China and the second, a problem of potential fraud with regard to the origin of these products.
Where our imports of ceramics from the People's Republic of China are concerned, it is true that in 1994 quantity limits were applied to imports of this nature, and to tableware or kitchenware in particular.
In the meantime, China joined the World Trade Organisation and, in recognition of this fact, it was decided to phase out these quantity limits, which will, therefore, disappear completely at the end of 2004.
In 2001 there was an increase of just over 10% in imports of these products to the European market, whereas in 2002 there was a slight fall in numbers.
Consequently, our markets are not being permanently flooded with these products.
I now come to the second part of your question, which concerns problems relating to fraud.
We have adequate instruments in place for combating fraud and we are prepared to make use of them.
As I have already told European industrialists who have expressed concerns similar to yours, we would need more precise information on what these industrialists and you seem to consider to be fraudulent actions.
The details are missing.
Mr Bolkestein's services will study your additional information so that together we can work out whether an inquiry should be opened.
Mr President, I am glad that the Commissioner sees the solution to a problem which concerns many European citizens and in particular the Spanish Ceramics Association in such simple and straightforward terms.
I am actually delighted with the assessment you have made.
With regard to the evolution of imports I agree completely, not so much in terms of fraud, because if you are saying that you have the appropriate mechanisms for combating it, I do not understand why you are waiting for the citizens of Europe to tell you what these fraudulent practices consist of, since I imagine that it is for you to take the initiative in this area.
I do not believe, however, you have answered another part of the question on the measures the Commission would be prepared to take to promote the penetration by Community industry, by Community companies, into China.
I believe that you agree with many European citizens and, amongst others, the ceramics industry, that the current situation is a fraud, causes harm and constitutes a threat for the future.
My question is whether you agree with these citizens on the need to take measures to defend trade, to stimulate research and development and to promote penetration into the Chinese market.
We must make clearly separate two issues.
First of all, either suspicions of fraud about the products' origins are justified or they are not.
This can quite easily be checked and investigated.
We are doing so in a number of areas and once again, Mr Bolkestein and myself, as well as our services, work together on many such matters.
What we need, in order to commit resources which, as you know, are scarce despite the considerable efforts of the European Parliament to give the Commission additional means, is to have sufficiently precise information, rather like a unit that is given the task of investigating fraud in the police force.
Give us more precise details, then.
Secondly, with regard to export opportunities in the ceramics sector, which is still a significant sector in a number of Member States, these do not depend on specific Community policies.
Also on this subject, if our ceramics exporters, whose quality is recognised throughout the world found their access to the market of one third country or another obstructed because the countries concerned were not applying the open arrangements accepted bilaterally or within the World Trade Organisation, we would then set in motion the means available to us to help out our exporters.
Mr President, my question is supplementary to that of Mr Bayona.
I agree entirely with his arguments and I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he would be prepared to adopt the following five measures: firstly, to show the utmost commitment to anti-dumping cases, bearing in mind that Chinese companies are subjected to much less stringent parameters and levels than European ones in the fields of employment and the environment; secondly, whether he is also prepared to show that utmost commitment to anti-fraud measures, bearing in mind that, at this moment, it is possible to import without a mark, in any European port, Chinese goods which have a label in that port; thirdly, to strengthen research and development so that European companies can face up to Chinese competition; fourthly, to promote the entry and establishment of European companies in China, in view of the fact that, as the Commissioner knows, despite the fact that there has been a tariff restriction, entry tariffs in China depend on the port and the importer; and finally, whether he is prepared to set up an observatory to provide better knowledge of the practices which discriminate against and harm European industry.
Very briefly, with regard to the fight against dumping and fraud, as I have said, we do have procedures in place.
These procedures are transparent, regulated and precise and if we have the necessary details, with which the industry must provide us if we are to launch an inquiry or investigation - known as 'complaints' - we can take action.
This must be done in the correct way, because we have to respect the rights both of the plaintiff and of the country against which a complaint is lodged.
These are possible approaches, provided, of course, that we have the necessary information.
With regard to problems in accessing the Chinese market, we are entirely willing to discuss these with our Chinese partners.
I hold such discussions in other areas and if there is a need to do so in this specific area, I will say 'yes', provided that I am given the necessary information.
As far as research and development is concerned, the issue does not really fall within my remit and with regard to the monitoring centre, I would advise industry professionals to look into this matter themselves.
They are better qualified than we are to gather the necessary information and to decide when to convey this to us.
I have a great interest in this question, both as the Member representing the region of Stoke-on-Trent in the United Kingdom and also as the deputy chairman of the European Parliament ceramics industry forum, which has had a dialogue with both Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Bolkestein.
I should like to ask Mr Lamy if he would comment on the issue of marks of origin, and confirm that the proposals being considered by Commissioner Byrne to require ceramic articles coming into contact with food to bear traceability marks showing the factory that they are made in - to trace any problems with toxic materials that may be in the articles concerned - would not in any way contravene existing WTO obligations.
As he may be aware, Commissioner Byrne's services are actively considering this proposal at the moment and are having discussions with the European industry about that type of marking.
There have been disturbing cases where articles from China have been found to contain levels of toxic materials that are significantly above the limits laid down in the European Union to safeguard human health.
The industry would be very grateful for his confirmation that the proposals would not contravene any existing trade legislation.
These issues of marks of origin are complex and we are discussing them in a very general way.
They involve on the one hand a trade component, which is not covered by the question on the subject of ceramics and the work of my colleague, Mr Byrne, and on the other, a health component.
The latter area involves more than just the problems of managing trade flows or the comparative advantages that some countries have. In this area, the World Trade Organisation's 'SPS' agreement, ( Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures ), gives us, as Europeans, the opportunity to adopt the necessary measures to protect the health of our consumers.
In order to be adopted, these measures must meet the requirements for advance notification, transparency and justification that the SPS agreement and the case-law in the field have established on several occasions.
Accordingly, if the conditions are transparent and clear, and if the scientific evidence justifies the need for a particular protection measure on the grounds of health, the SPS agreement allows trade barriers to be put in place, and quite rightly so!
On a point of order, this may well delay other questions: Mr Zacharakis was not here when his question was called and, according to the rules of the House, it should lapse.
Mr Bolkestein and Mr Byrne will each speak for 20 minutes and we have to finish before 7 o'clock, so I would ask you to continue, as the rules require, with Mr Bolkestein's section.
Mr Purvis, we are going to allow each of the Commissioners their 20 minutes, which will mean a delay of 12 or 13 minutes in the timetable of this Question Time, which has already begun late.
But I had committed myself, having changed the order of Mr Zacharakis's question, to that question being replied to today at the end of questions to Mr Lamy.
We must respect that commitment.
I would ask the other Commissioners' forgiveness.
This in no way jeopardises their respective turns of 20 minutes.
If I have understood correctly, this issue concerns an incident that occurred in airspace between Greece and Turkey.
The Commission does not have specific information on this incident, beyond what has been reported in the press.
With the cautiousness that this type of statement requires, we believe that this incident must be seen in the context of the dispute between Greece and Turkey over the Aegean Sea.
We hope that this issue of national airspace, as well as that of territorial waters and the continental shelf - over which these two countries, to my knowledge, have been arguing for some time now - will be resolved in the course of the meetings taking place between the Greek and Turkish authorities.
With regard to Turkey, as a country that is applying to join the European Union, it has given a commitment to meet a number of criteria and the Commission recalls, in response to your question, Mr Zacharakis, the principle of what is called the peaceful settlement of border disputes.
This has always been our approach, in line with the criteria set out in the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council of 1999.
We also made this issue a specific priority for the review of the partnership for Turkish accession, which was adopted in May 2003.
Accordingly, as on other matters requiring progress on the part of Turkey, we will closely follow developments in this matter and will present a detailed assessment in the periodic report that we are due to publish at the beginning of November.
Mr President, Commissioner, please excuse me for not being present when you called my question.
I had to attend another Parliamentary meeting.
I would like to answer Mr Zacharakis very briefly by saying that, to my knowledge, despite the most strenuous efforts of Mrs de Palacio in this area over several years, we have still not quite established a non-segregated Community airspace.
To my knowledge, therefore, we are dealing at this stage with Greek airspace.
Secondly, the Helsinki conclusions do indeed contain a reference to the need for Turkey to find peaceful solutions to possible border disputes with its neighbours, and we know that borders exist on land, at sea and in the skies.
Thirdly, preliminary negotiations are taking place between Turkey and Greece on this type of issue.
Their content is not made public, which I feel demonstrates a basic sense of caution, especially in the run-up to the electoral period.
Fourthly and lastly, we will take into account, as I said a moment ago, the overall progress made by Turkey in the areas specified at Helsinki when we pronounce on this matter both this year and, of course, next year.
.
The Swedish Minister for Equal Opportunities has indicated to the Swedish Parliament the readiness of her government to consider modification of the Swedish law on abortion so that the Swedish authorities would cover the costs of an abortion, not only for Swedish nationals and people residing in Sweden, but also for nationals from other Member States who have an abortion in Sweden.
The Commission would point out that Member States are free to determine to whom they wish to extend financial coverage for the cost of medical treatment.
Accordingly, there is nothing in Community law that would prevent the Swedish Government from amending its legislation in the manner proposed.
I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer, but I still think he is leaving the basic question unanswered, namely that of mutual solidarity and of conduct towards each other in the European Union.
Is that mutual solidarity not in this way undermined?
It is, of course, inevitable that the Member States' different laws and values will make themselves felt in different forms of legislation.
What is, however, unique and serious in this case is that it entails subsidising, for foreign citizens of other Member States, an activity that I specified by name in my question, that is illegal in a number of Member States and that involves inviting citizens of other EU countries to engage in an activity that is illegal in these EU countries.
My follow-up question is as to whether that would not undermine solidarity with, and mutual respect for, each other in the European Union.
.
May I stress that the Commission is of the opinion that such an amendment to Swedish legislation - which has not yet taken place: it is an amendment proposed by the Swedish Government - would have no direct impact on the legislation of existing or future Member States.
Indeed, the Commission is of the view that the changes in attitude within some Member States regarding issues such as abortion are driven by public opinion rather than by external factors.
The reflection of this is the fact that the legal regimes on abortion in Member States are still very divergent, as indeed the Member who has just spoken will recognise.
Whilst it is illegal in one Member State, it is legal in others - subject, of course to varying restrictions.
In short, the fact that in some Member States, such as Ireland, abortion is against the law, does not mean that, if the Swedish Government were to pass the amendment I described, it would not be allowed to extend benefits to whoever it liked.
It is within the competence of the Swedish Government to take a decision on that, and the extent of benefits allowed under Swedish legislation would, as I said earlier, have no impact on the legislation of a country where abortion is forbidden, such as Ireland.
Question No 39 by Antonios Trakatellis (H-0398/03):
Subject: Use of a mathematical formula in awarding public contracts: distortion of the rules of competition
Recent newspaper articles discuss the intervention of the Commission which has called on the Greek authorities to postpone awards of public contracts until the curious system for awarding public contracts on the basis of a mathematical formula has been modified. The same publications claim that this formula has cost the Greek economy EUR 800 million.
According to the Commission's answer to my previous question on the use of a mathematical formula in awarding public contracts in Greece (H-0097/03)
.
The Commission has examined with due attention the issue of the application in Greece of a mathematical formula to be detect abnormally low offers in the context of public tenders.
Following a request from the Commission the Hellenic authorities notified the relevant national legislation in January 2003.
While proceeding with its assessment the Commission received a new complaint on the same matter, which gave a better picture of how the whole system of the mathematical formula is applied in practice, since the latter complaint did not concern the legislation in abstract, but made reference to concrete examples of its application.
On the basis of this new information, the Commission services addressed a letter to the competent Hellenic authorities in late April 2003, asking them to take a position on specific issues raised in relation to the compatibility of the Hellenic legislation and practice with Community public procurement legislation and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice.
The Commission services have very recently received a request on behalf of the Hellenic authorities to extend the time given to them to reply to this new letter until 30 June 2003, in order for them to give a comprehensive answer on the whole issue and in view of certain changes that they envisage concerning the relevant legislation.
The Commission services have granted this extension and now await the answer of the Hellenic authorities.
Once they receive this reply and the changes that the Hellenic authorities propose to their national legislation regulating the mathematical formula for identification of abnormally low offers, they will come to a final assessment of the compatibility of the system applied in relation to Community public procurement legislation.
The formula in question is so complicated that even Greek experts have great difficulty in understanding how it works.
Commissioner, thank you very much for your answer.
I would like to ask you whether it is your preliminary assessment that this mathematical formula really is compatible with Community law.
I cannot see why the Greek authorities proceeded, as you said, to change the law, as the Greek Parliament already has the capacity to deal with this.
I would like, therefore, to have your preliminary assessment.
Also, although this was a formula for avoiding very low offers, it had a damaging effect on the overall assessment of public works, owing to the very small percentage of the original amount intended for the public works concerned.
.
In response to these last two questions by Mr Trakatellis, I should like once again to reaffirm that the Commission has not yet finalised its assessment, but it has raised some issues of the compatibility of the Hellenic system with regard to the possibility given to the tenderers to justify their low offer.
If that were not the case, the Commission would not undertake this work.
I cannot say more than this.
May I say to Mr Trakatellis that fortunately I, personally, have not had to investigate this formula since apparently, as I said earlier, it is so complex that even the Greek experts have difficulty in understanding it.
Question No 40 by Elly Plooij-van Gorsel (H-0402/03):
Subject: Principle of 'fair compensation'
Directive 2001/29/EC
. (NL) Mr President, I can confirm that the principle of 'fair compensation', as described in the directive, is a new concept, to be distinguished from the right to receive fair remuneration, indicated with the term 'copyright' in the context of reproduction for private use.
As is indicated in the directive, the concept of fair compensation offers Member States a considerable degree of flexibility or freedom of judgment when they decide on the form, the modalities or the level of fair compensation regulations.
However, pursuant to recitals 35 and 38, Member States that apply copyright meet the condition that fair compensation must be in place.
Relevant legislation implementing the directive need not necessarily contain a specific reference to the principle of fair compensation.
In accordance with the directive, Member States are obliged to ensure that fair compensation is in place for three of the exceptions to the reproduction right listed in the directive.
First of all, there is the exception of reproduction for private use.
This is the exception with most relevance for copyright, because usually, rights are levied with regard to reproduction for private use of sound and audio-visual material.
The second one pertains to the exception for reprographics or photocopying and the third one relates to transmissions in some social institutions such as hospitals or prisons.
It seems probable that the Member States that had levy systems in place in the past, will continue to allow reproduction for private use in combination with levy systems and that they will also apply these to certain digital products.
It is true that the different systems continue to result in differences in application with regard to carriers or equipment to which they apply and/or the amounts claimed, including the differences in application to digital carriers.
This is due to the fact that the EC legislator ruled against a higher degree of harmonisation during negotiations about the directive.
As far as analogue copying for private use is concerned, the directive acknowledges that it is unlikely that the existing differences will have a major impact on the development of the information society.
With regard to digital copying for private use, the directive underlines that due account must be given to differences between digital and analogue copying for private use, and that in certain cases, a distinction must be drawn between them.
At the same time, it must be stressed that the directive does not require Member States to abolish copyright, or to take a stand for or against copyright in comparison to digital rights management systems.
Mr President, Commissioner, although I am grateful to you for your extensive and clear response, I am nevertheless left with a problem. At the end of your intervention, you draw a clear distinction between analogue and digital copying, whereby the former would not be harmful to the information society, while the latter would.
As far as I know - and I have been involved in information society legislation for years - we in Europe specifically do not draw a distinction between digital and analogue, in the sense that legislation must be technology-neutral.
So I am a little taken aback by your statement.
Moreover, I am surprised that the directive does not tend more towards harmonisation, particularly because your offices initially indicated that it would do so.
Where fair compensation is concerned, it is important to establish whether the rightholder is actually being adversely affected, whether any technological protection measures are available and whether any other payment is made to the rightholder.
This is why I think that it is regrettable after all that Member States are not required to adapt their legislation in the sense that only fair compensation is granted.
.
(NL) Mr President, I can well imagine the disappointment felt by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, but, as I have indicated before, the legislator - which thus includes the European Parliament - was of the opinion that far-reaching harmonisation was not desirable.
This is how the legislation process went and there is nothing we can do about it now.
However, I do understand why Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is disappointed.
It might have been preferable to apply a higher level of harmonisation but this is not how it was decided.
Allow me perhaps to correct the Commissioner on one point: Parliament would probably have wanted to see a greater degree of harmonisation where the current directive is concerned.
I have, however, a question for those of you responsible for the internal market.
You said that existing differences in levy systems were of no significance.
I believe that we need to investigate this area specifically with the internal market in mind.
Are the differences in the levy systems between the countries of Europe of any significance?
Do they impede the internal market and lead to distortion?
I believe that our examination of the trend we have in Europe should start specifically from the perspective of a functioning internal market.
I believe it would be important to obtain an account of the ways in which fair compensation or fair remuneration have developed.
What are the facts of the case?
Above all, I wish, however, to say to you, as Commissioner with responsibility for the internal market, that I believe that the differences in levies affect consumer behaviour and create unequal conditions of competition.
.
Let us see how all this works in practice.
As Mrs Thors and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel know, the directive has not been transposed in the legislation of all Member States.
The Commission hopes that this will soon be the case.
It may be that a more significant degree of harmonisation would have been better for the internal market.
But as I said earlier in reply to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, unfortunately that is not the case and we have the directive that was approved by Council and Parliament.
So let us see how this works in practice and how quickly the whole system of digital right management is put in practice in Europe.
If Mrs Thors would then like to ask the Commission for further investigations and analysis, the Commission would be more than willing to oblige.
The issue is important and essential aspects of the internal market are at stake.
Question No 41 by Patricia McKenna (H-0362/03):
Subject: Rapid Alert Notifications
Will the Commission publish an annual breakdown of the 'Alert Notifications', 'Informations', 'Addition to Alerts' and 'Addition to Informations' issued between 1992 and 2003 by food product and country of origin, deviating the brand name, supermarket or company involved?
Will the Commission indicate how it will publish such information and the timeframe involved?
If the Commission is unwilling to publish such information, will it please explain how such unwillingness could be deemed to be in the public interest?
.
The regulation on general food law, which entered into force in February 2002, contains new provisions as regards the rapid alert system.
With a view to increasing transparency according to Article 10, the Commission published for the first time a report on the rapid alert system for food and feed for the year 2002.
We will do so for each subsequent year.
However, we cannot apply the food law retroactively and go back as far as 1992.
The publication of this annual report was, however, only the first step.
In addition, since the end of May 2003, the Commission has published, on the Internet, summary reports containing information on all notifications received on a weekly basis.
These reports contain information on the type of product and the problem identified, the origin of the product and the notifying Member State.
The rapid alert system defined in Article 50 of the regulation is designed primarily as a tool for the rapid transmission of information amongst competent authorities in cases where a risk has been identified and measures have already been taken by the notifying Member State, such as withholding, recalling, seizure or rejection of the products concerned.
The quick transmission of information allows all other Member States to verify immediately whether they are also affected by the problem in question, or to ensure that a product rejected at one point of entry does not enter through another place.
It also ensures coherent and simultaneous actions by all Member States.
In cases where a product is still on the market and should not be consumed, the authorities of the Member States are in a position to take all the necessary urgent measures, including providing direct information to the public.
In addition, the information collected by the rapid alert system is used by the Commission.
For example, my services use the information to set priorities for the Food and Veterinary Office and to propose measures such as suspension of the placing on the market, suspension of imports or any other emergency measure under Article 53 of the regulation.
The Commission also uses this information to assist third countries.
When products subject to a notification originate from a third country, its competent authorities are systematically informed in order to enable them to correct the problem at source and prevent further cases.
It is true that, according to Article 52 of the Food Law Regulation, the Commission does not publish trade names and the identity of individual companies in the regular rapid alert summaries.
However, where emergency measures are taken by Member States or the Commission, in the light of the analysis of the risk posed by the alert, such relevant information on the products concerned by the action is made public.
The RASFF is used both to take actions to prevent further occurrence of food-related risks and to react immediately to such related risks in order to provide consumers with safe food.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for that information.
In relation to trade names and individual companies it is very important that a vague system of alerts is in place which allows the consumer to make a choice.
Does the Commission not agree that if a product or food producer causes an alert then it is both in the consumer's interest and indeed in the interest of the open market that this information should be made public?
I would like to ask the Commissioner a question concerning the 2002 rapid alerts.
Apparently, 26% of rapid alerts in 2002 were caused by fish.
What is the breakdown of these alerts between farmed fish and wild fish?
The consumer has a right to know if farmed fish cause a disproportionate number of rapid alerts.
Is DG SANCO taking any specific action to address this problem?
Does the Commissioner have this information on him now?
It would be very useful to have this information on the breakdown as regards fish.
.
In further response to Mrs McKenna's question, firstly, I would not characterise our system of alert as being in any way vague.
It is very targeted and the purpose of the exercise is, as I am sure she will appreciate, to transmit as fast as possible the relevant information to the competent authorities of all Member States, so that they can make a rapid response and take rapid action in relation to the risk that has been identified in respect of any particular food or feed in question.
What is important here is public health, rather than some kind of naming and shaming.
I would like to emphasise that once the rapid alert has been made and responses have been taken, and if it is shown that it is a genuine problem from which consumers need to be protected, the Member States in question, where there is a risk - and it is for them to determine this - will immediately inform their own consumers in their Member State.
That is their responsibility under the rapid alert system.
In those circumstances it would be appropriate for them to then identify, for instance, trade names or companies which would assist consumers to make the appropriate response.
However, bear in mind that the rapid alert system is designed to allow Member States to react quickly and to remove, for instance, foods from the market.
In addition to that, if it is necessary on further reflection and further analysis of the information that has come from the rapid alert - which is activated under Article 50 - that an emergency procedure under Article 53 is necessary, this would be something which could again be done at Member State level or, indeed, could also be done by the Commission.
In those circumstances, the relevant information that would be made available would include the information that you referred to relating to trade names and companies, etc.
I want to emphasise that the rapid alert is designed for a specific purpose, which is to transmit information as fast as possible, even in circumstances where all information may not be available.
The important issue here is to identify the risk to the public to which the Member States must respond.
I believe, in those circumstances, we have struck the correct balance.
In relation to the second part of your question concerning the figures for 2002, I do not have the specific figures to hand relating to the breakdown between farmed fish and wild fish, but I am sure this kind of information is available to my services.
I will seek to ensure that it is made available by them and transmitted to you in the normal course.
.
The Commission proposal addresses the acknowledged need for urgent reinforcement of the current rules for identification and registration of sheep and goats, in particular in view of the experience acquired from the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease crisis.
In its resolution on foot and mouth disease of December 2002, the European Parliament stated that the Commission should as quickly as possible submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/102/EEC so as to improve the identification of pigs, sheep and goats.
According to current legislation sheep and goats must be identified with an eartag or a tattoo linked to the holding.
The keepers must keep an up-to-date register on the holding, and the competent authority must keep an up-to-date central register of holdings.
The main new elements of the proposed system are individual identification, double eartagging to ensure that identity is retained where one eartag is lost, and the introduction of a movement document.
Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases.
The introduction of a reinforced system will have a positive impact in case of outbreaks of major animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, allowing the rapid identification of the source of infection and limiting the further spread of the disease.
Furthermore it will allow accurate tracing of animals in the framework of the animal disease eradication programmes financed by the Community.
Finally, such a system would assist in reducing fraud.
The technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied.
The Commission launched a large-scale pilot project - the IDEA Project - in 1998.
The final report of this project, which included sheep and goats, as well as bovine animals, was completed in 2002.
However, the implementing measures required for the proper introduction of the system of electronic identification on a Community scale have yet to be fully developed.
The proposal therefore provides for further guidelines and procedures to be adopted through the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with entry into force of obligatory electronic tagging foreseen for 1 July 2006.
I am well aware of the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States.
The proposal therefore includes options, which would allow: Member States to defer the identification of lambs up to the age of 6 months, where sheep are kept under extensive farming conditions, for instance in Scotland - to which the questioner referred; Member States to apply simplified identification arrangements to young lambs, up to six months of age, intended for direct slaughter.
The options decided upon will influence the likely costs to the farmers of introducing the new system.
The estimation of the costs of introduction of the reinforced system on a Community-wide basis has to take into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States.
In the absence of precise information on movements and other parameters, the estimate has to be based on the general structure of the various production systems.
On this basis, the overall costs of the reinforced system are estimated to vary between EUR 1 for traditional eartags to EUR 3.7 for electronic identification per sheep per year.
I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities.
But these efforts in my opinion and in the opinion of the Commission are both worthwhile and necessary.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is aware of the extreme impracticality of the manual tagging of individual sheep, and its maintenance for a further two years.
Has he ever seen an auction market?
I am sure that in his home country of Ireland the situation is the same as in Scotland, where you have thousands of sheep going through in one day and each individual sheep has to be inspected and tagged as it goes through.
That will add days to sales for only for two years' worth of savings.
Could he not and has he not considered doing this on a flock basis, as opposed to an individual sheep basis, for this two-year period of time?
.
In answer to the supplementary question from Mr Purvis, let me say that I, the Commission and my advisers have considered the possibility of herd tagging.
I raised that question specifically with them.
The answer they gave me - and it seemed credible - is that the system of herd tagging you suggest does not have the same degree of security in circumstances where you may have an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease or similar.
Also, for the reason that you identify in your supplementary question, in these markets that we see in Scotland and in my home country of Ireland as well, herds arrive, they are sub-divided into other herds, they are separated so that the chance of following a particular herd number and getting the information that you need in the case of an outbreak of disease is diluted to a considerable extent.
In fact, it eliminates the opportunity of following a particular animal that may be carrying that particular disease.
In those circumstances, the only alternative available to us was to come forward with an individual identification tag system.
I acknowledge this will last for an interim transition period until electronic tagging comes into play: it is scheduled for 1 July 2006.
I have to say to Mr Purvis that there are many people calling for this system of tagging for the reason that I have identified.
Member States want it, even the Member States that have large sheep populations and trade a lot in sheep, both within the Member State and across borders.
For those reasons, the degree of support that exists in the Community for this proposal is strong.
Therefore, in the light of the need to protect animal health and for other reasons it seems necessary to come forward with that particular proposal.
Finally, I should again draw attention to what I said a moment ago: the Commission has taken into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in Member States and the proposal includes options which Member States may decide to apply under certain circumstances.
For instance, for animals kept in extensive farming conditions and in free range, the age of tagging may be extended from one month to six months of age, but, in any event, before leaving the holding of birth.
Also, for animals intended for slaughter before six months of age, the identification code may be the code of the holding of birth and the month of birth.
Under this system, instead of each individual animal, groups of animals with the same identification code are recorded in the holding register and the movement document.
That is a measure that was introduced in the legislation in ease of the kind of farming that I know exists in some remote areas in Scotland and, to a very large extent, meets the case that you have put forward in trying to respond to the concerns that you address.
Where the animals are obviously over six months of age, then, of course, individual tagging must take place for the reason I have already identified.
Question No 44 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0378/03):
Subject: Irresponsible rise in cases of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or 'Mad cow disease' in Spain
The EU Scientific Committee indicated as long ago as June 2000 that Spain was a high risk country for BSE, while the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture described the report published by that body as 'irresponsible' (all of which was the subject of various Parliamentary questions I submitted in 2000).
In recent months there has been a sharp increase in the number of BSE cases in Spain and that number is still continuing to rise.
Does this not indicate that the 1996 Community ban on bone meal for ruminants has not been correctly transposed in Spain?
.
The Scientific Steering Committee has classified Spain as a GBR III country, having confirmed cases at a lower level.
The upper limit of this level is an incidence of 100 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months.
The BSE incidence in Spain has been increasing since the beginning of 2002.
The incidence is, however, still well below this upper limit of around 45 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months, and it is not increasing rapidly.
Therefore, the classification of Spain by the Scientific Steering Committee still remains valid.
In the first quarter of this year, Spain reported about 50% more BSE cases than during the corresponding period last year.
At the same time the number of cases decreased or was stable in all other Member States, except Portugal.
Compared with other Member States, Spain has a rather high rate of young animals born in 1997 and 1998.
The feeding of ruminant proteins to ruminants is considered to be the main source of BSE transmission to cattle.
Therefore, the Commission imposed a Community-wide prohibition of the use of mammalian proteins in ruminant feed in 1994.
It is, however, evident that this ban was not fully enforced at that time, since most of the BSE cases reported today were born after 1994.
Meat-and-bone meal continued to be allowed in feed for non-ruminants, and thereby ruminant feed was contaminated in feed mills and during storage and transport.
Another source of transmission was cross-feeding of feed intended for non-ruminants to cattle on mixed farms.
Shortcomings in the implementation of the feed ban were observed throughout the Community.
To put an end to the transmission of BSE the feed ban was extended to the use of all animal proteins in feed for all farmed animals at the beginning of 2001.
Other measures to reduce the transmission of BSE are improved rendering standards - which came into effect in early 1997 - and a ban on the use of so-called BSE risk materials in food and feed, which became effective in October 2000.
The current Community legislation should, if rigorously implemented, be sufficient to prevent new animals from becoming infected.
BSE cases will, nevertheless, continue to appear in Spain, as in other Member States, for a number of years because of an incubation time of four to six years or even longer.
That is why it is important to maintain current safeguards, in particular the removal of specified risk material.
Commissioner, in the course of that very technical and diplomatic reply, in which you were so careful not to cause alarm, I believe I heard you confirm between the lines that Spain has in fact been failing to comply with that prohibition laid down in Community legislation since 1996.
The increase in mad cow disease which has taken place in Spain as well in recent years - and your words also confirm this - is the result of the fact that the then Spanish Minister, Mr Arias CaÃ±ete, who denied that Spain was at risk - and the Scientific Committee did state this - was not complying with the Community legislation, and this is the reason for this proliferation and increase in mad cow disease.
Commissioner, is this confirmed non-compliance by Spain of the Community legislation on the prohibition of meat-and-bone meal not reprehensible?
Is this non-compliance not reprehensible?
Your reply can only be yes.
There is no social alarm, but it is non-compliance with the legislation which has made Spain the leading country in terms of mad cow disease in recent years.
.
In response to the supplementary question, let me say that the Commission does not know the exact reason why the number of BSE cases is still increasing in Spain and not in other Member States, with the exception of Portugal, as I mentioned earlier.
Possible explanations, in addition to shortcomings in the implementation of the feed ban, are introduction of the removal of specified risk materials in Spain only at the end of 2000 and a higher than average exposure to infected meat and bone meal in the 1996-1998 period.
It should be stressed, however, that the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office has carried out missions in Spain in order to verify the correct implementation of the Community provisions with regard to the control and eradication of BSE in 2001 and 2002.
Shortcomings are still being detected.
Spain has also informed the Commission of a number of breaches of the feed ban detected in 2002.
The number of breaches is very small and below the average in Member States.
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 45 to 78 will be answered in writing
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
recommendation for second reading (A5-0191/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 2000/13/EC as regards indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs (15514/2/2002 - C5-0080/2003 - 2001/0199(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs KlaÃ);
report (A5-0216/2003) by Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners (COM(2002) 662 - C5-0577/2002 - 2002/0274(COD)), and
recommendation for second reading (A5-0201/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/22/EC concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists (14502/1/2002 - C5-0079/2003 - 2001/0132(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Olsson).
. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, consumers have to have adequate information about the content and composition of the food that they buy.
This is true not only as regards what we were talking about this afternoon; it also applies to ingredients.
What it says on the outside must be on the inside, no more and no less.
Changes in society over the past twenty years have also left their mark on our eating habits.
Who, nowadays, peels their carrots and potatoes themselves?
Many do not have the time to do it, while all too many have forgotten how to cook or never learned in the first place.
This also resulted in profound changes to the food industry, with complicated processing methods and new ingredients giving rise to finished and half-finished products capable of being prepared quickly and simply, but with ignorance about them breeding uncertainty.
Numerous recent health warnings have made the need for information even more urgent, to which one must add the substantial increase in the number of food allergies.
People suffering from food allergies rely on the proper listing of what a product contains.
We have now reached second reading stage, and the greater part of the Commission proposal is made up of the Common Position, which limits the number of derogations and takes on board most of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading stage, notably the regular revision of the list of allergenic substances and of the way in which it is to be interpreted, the inclusion of celery and mustard in the list and the mandatory indication on the labels of preparations of sauces or mustards of ingredients amounting to less than 5% of the end-product.
I still see the table of allergenic ingredients as the most important element in this directive.
The list is to be drawn up on the basis of the latest scientific findings, revised on a regular basis and updated where necessary.
At second reading stage, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted three amendments, all of which have the same objective in mind, that of removing the requirement to include on the label processing aids manufactured from substances on the list of allergenic substances, but no longer present in the end product and thus not liable to trigger an allergic reaction.
Checks must be carried out to establish if a product is still allergenic if, in the course of its production, a processing aid was used that was allergenic in its original form - protein is one example - but which has lost its allergenic character as a result of the food production process, or which is either no longer present, or present in a modified form.
Those who legislate are to establish that this is the case before requiring labelling.
Processing aids have been in use for decades, including in the production of wine and beer.
They undergo change in the course of the fermentation process and are naturally precipitated or filtered out.
It is therefore a matter of certainty that they are no longer present in the wine or beer that is eventually produced.
Allergies have hitherto been unheard-of in this area.
As a wine-grower myself, how am I to explain to my fellow wine-growers or to my customers that labels must in future bear the legend 'made with eggs'?
Wine is a pure and clear product of nature, clear and golden in the glass.
No research has been done into allergic reactions to it, as nobody has ever heard of there being any - so why this new requirement for labels?
Politics, however, is about doing what is possible, and so I have, with the Commission and the Council, arrived at a compromise making it possible for evidence to be brought within a fixed period of four years.
The first point to be made here is that substances in connection with which a study has been notified to the Commission are provisionally exempted from being indicated on labels.
The second is that, if the study demonstrates that these substances have no allergenic effect, they will continue to be exempted from the labelling requirement.
I ask the Commission - and you, Mr Byrne - to confirm to me that further new studies can be commissioned and notified up to nine months after the directive's entry into force, and that exemption from mandatory labelling will apply for a full four years.
This is important if we are to have studies of all types.
This new directive gives consumers certainty.
Only 2% of ingredients are not required to be included on the label, as against the former 25%.
For the first time, there is a list of allergenic substances that must always appear on the label, and we will produce scientific evidence in order to ensure that labels state only what is contained.
We are thus avoiding the possibility of excessive labelling making the list of foods allowed to allergy-sufferers ever smaller.
I think we should take this sensible approach of compromise.
Thank you very much, Mrs KlaÃ.
I would remind all my fellow Members of the rules of the game.
Each one of us really must keep to the speaking time allotted to us for our speeches this evening, since our work will take us until almost midnight.
I shall endeavour to bang my gavel as required in order to let you know that your speaking time has elapsed.
I will then ask you to conclude very speedily.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to begin by referring briefly to the report by Mrs KlaÃ in order to support the compromise amendment relating to the official list of ingredients which must appear in Annex IIIa within two years.
I am doing so because there are products such as casein, egg albumin or fish glue which have been used for centuries in the production of wine and beer and which figure amongst the oenological practices laid down and permitted by Regulations (EC) Nos 1493/1999 and 1622/2000 and, above all, because there is no scientific evidence that they act as allergens in the final product.
Why do we have to place them under suspicion by subjecting them to labelling?
The Council and the Commission must accept Parliament's view of this problem.
Having said this, I will move on to my own report.
I would firstly like to sincerely thank the Commission, the Council and the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Lund and Mrs Paulsen, for their excellent cooperation in reaching compromises which may allow us to approve this proposal for a directive at first reading.
My main concern during the production of this report has been that the food additives included in it should not only represent technological progress but they should not pose any risk to health nor cause misunderstanding amongst consumers.
The compromise amendments we are presenting to plenary, together with the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group (Amendments Nos 19 to 32) are the result of this concern that we all share.
Framework Directive 89/107/EEC on additives, in its Annex II, specifies that 'all food additives must be kept under continuous observation and must be re-evaluated whenever necessary'.
However, in view of the existing concern about the use of polysorbates, of the ruling of the Court of Justice of 20 March 2003, on the maximum doses of nitrites and nitrates, and the declaration of the Scientific Committee on Food of 4 April 2003, on derivatives of parahydroxybenzoic acid, two new paragraphs for Article 2 are being presented by means of Amendment No 21.
The intention is that the Commission should review the use of additives E 432 to E 436 (that is, polysorbates), E 251, E 252, and E 249 to E 250 (which are nitrates and nitrites) and that, before 1 July 2004, the conditions of use for parabens, from E 214 to E 219, should be revised.
With regard to biphenyl, orthophenyl phenol and sodium orthophenyl phenol, which will now be classed as plant protection products, the Commission's intention is to include them in the future in the legislation of pesticides, removing them from Directive 95/2/EC.
We agree with this and our only desire is that a legal vacuum should not be created, as indicated in Amendment No 21 and Amendment No 4 of the report which was approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We are also concerned that additives may be introduced into foods by means of additives in flavourings which are not required to be labelled.
We are therefore presenting Amendment No 22 to restrict its use to the minimum necessary in order to guarantee the quality and safety of the flavouring when it has no technological function in the food.
Otherwise, these flavouring additives will have to be labelled.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that it is very important that we make consumers aware that thanks to the legislation on additives and the work of the Scientific Committee on Food they can enjoy adequate food safety and food products which are suited to their needs.
These days our cities are increasingly large and industry needs more and more new additives and this makes our lives easier when it comes to consuming cooked or prepared products.
I would like once again to thank the Council, the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to reaching these important agreements.
Mr President, Commissioner, it looks as if, this evening and tomorrow, we shall be able to solve the issue of the views to be taken of hormones and their use in connection with animal rearing in which there is a dispute between the EU and the United States.
I shall address this issue in three ways.
Firstly, I wish to express my gratitude; secondly, I wish to explain why I do not like the compromise; and thirdly, I wish to explain why, in spite of everything, I support the compromise.
I want to address a very big thank-you to everyone who has contributed: to the Commission, the Council, the committee secretariat and all my colleagues and fellow MEPs in the committee - the shadow rapporteurs - who have been of very great help to us in reaching this solution.
It really is, of course, the case that we do not want these hormones, especially oestradiol 17? which is used, for example in the United States, as a growth stimulant.
We do not want them in our food and nor, for that reason, must we of course use them in such a manner that they may end up in our food.
In that way, we should be more credible in our negotiations, for example within the WTO, with the United States.
If they are used as growth stimulants, then they are clearly present in our food.
They involve a health risk for human beings and are carcinogenic.
If we use them therapeutically in the rearing of agricultural animals, there is also a risk of their being present.
That is what we do in the EU, and it undermines our credibility and our opposition to these hormones.
That is why, in principle, they should really be comprehensively banned in these contexts.
If we had banned them completely, as proposed by our committee, it would have been almost possible to exclude them from the market. There would then have been no danger of their being used in the wrong way.
The committee was in agreement - as was Parliament, mainly, at first reading - about proceeding in this way.
This is, however, an issue that needs to be solved.
Even if I had full support for my desire for a total ban, I personally realised that it might be sensible to try to reach a compromise.
I therefore contacted my fellow MEPs in the other political groups and said that we should perhaps try, for the fact of the matter was that the Council said that it wanted to retain the substances for three reasons: firstly, to induce rutting in cattle, which is the most important area of usage; secondly, for foetus maceration and mummification, also mainly in the case of cattle; and, thirdly, for pyometra in cattle.
Of these areas of use, the first is the main one and the other two of relatively little importance.
The latter two are, moreover, relatively important from the point of view of animal protection.
Animals suffer if they cannot be given this medicine in the present situation.
Even though there are alternatives, they were not believed to be accessible throughout the EU.
My proposal, which became our proposal following contact with the other political groups, was that we should propose to the Council that the substances be kept for the purposes of the two less important areas relating to dead foetuses and pyometra.
The Council accepted this, and we shall now be able to do away with use of the substances for inducing rutting, something I consider to be major progress.
There will certainly be a transitional period, but then they will have been dispensed with.
In the final proposal, we now say, moreover, that the second use too should be reviewed, and perhaps that too could be removed after a certain period.
I see this as major progress, and we can thus perhaps solve the problem.
I am extremely pleased that we in the committee have been able to unite in supporting the proposal, and I hope that this will also be the case in the vote in the Chamber tomorrow.
We shall therefore be able to phase out the main use and thus strengthen our hand in the dispute with the United States.
I therefore want to reinforce this compromise, which is certainly weaker than what Parliament previously put forward but is still sufficiently sound for us now to be able to find a solution to the problem.
. Mr President, I welcome this joint debate, which covers three important legislative dossiers on which we are close to agreement following constructive interinstitutional dialogue.
I will address each dossier in turn.
I would like to thank the three rapporteurs, Mrs KlaÃ, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez and Mr Olsson, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for their hard work on these legislative dossiers.
I will start with Mrs KlaÃ's recommendation for second reading.
The adoption of this proposal on foodstuffs labelling legislation, to which we are very close, will be of great benefit to consumers.
The common position represents a balanced compromise, including the majority of the measures proposed by the Commission, whilst restricting the scope of exemptions.
It also reflects the European Parliament's wish to increase the accuracy of the information on foodstuffs labelling.
The common position includes - either word for word or in substance - Parliament's four amendments as set out by the Commission in its amended proposal.
It also takes into account most of the other Parliament amendments on three important points.
First, the flexibility in the ingredient listing and the exemptions from the obligation to indicate the components of certain compound ingredients will apply from 2%, rather than the 5% initially proposed.
Second, the review and update of the list of allergenic ingredients to reflect scientific advances.
Moreover, when the list is updated, ingredients may be removed if there is scientific evidence to show that they are no longer allergenic.
Third, the addition of celery and mustard and their derived products to the list of allergenic substances.
However, one question is not completely settled.
There is no available scientific basis that demonstrates either that the derivatives of certain allergens are still allergenic, or that they are no longer likely to cause adverse reactions.
Thus the question arises: should we require mandatory labelling of those derivatives?
The common position includes mandatory labelling, but states also that these substances could be exempted in the future, should scientific evidence provide justification for such action.
I share the view of the rapporteur and the committee that this might not be the best solution, but I do not agree with that suggested by Amendment Nos 1 and 2.
Indeed, Amendment No 1 states that, for alcoholic drinks, derivatives should be labelled only if they are present in an amount which scientific research has shown may cause allergic reactions.
This is not acceptable because science only provides evidence that allergens and their derivatives cause allergic reactions.
No scientific data are available on what residual amount of a given allergen may trigger an allergic reaction.
Furthermore, the amendment would be impossible to implement and the burden of proof is reversed.
It is for the manufacturers to provide evidence that the specific allergen derivative they use is not likely to cause an adverse reaction in order to be exempted from indicating it on the label.
Amendment No 2, in its first part, is identical to Amendment No 1, but concerns foodstuffs other than alcoholic beverages.
It also expressly exempts the processing aids used in alcoholic beverages from labelling, while these are not covered in this paragraph of the common position.
It is, therefore, not acceptable.
Amendment No 3 requests the Commission to adopt, before 1 January 2004, following an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority, a list of derivatives that should be considered as non-allergenic.
This goes in the right direction but, in addition to the unrealistic deadline, it is not acceptable as such because only studies conducted under the responsibility of the industry, on specific allergens' derivatives used in specific circumstances, could be considered and submitted for an opinion from the EFSA - for example, fish gelatine used as clarifying agent in beer.
That is why only Amendment No 4, which constitutes a workable and reasonable compromise, can be accepted.
I will now turn to Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez's first reading report.
In December 2002 the Commission adopted a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners.
The main objective of this proposal is to adapt Directive 95/2/EC in the light of recent technical and scientific developments and to ensure the functioning of the internal market, a high level of protection of human health and the protection of consumers' interests.
To this end, the Commission proposes to authorise a new food additive, to withdraw the authorisations for the use of some food additives, to revise current authorisations and to harmonise the use of food additives in flavourings at Community level.
In particular, on the 'use of food additives in flavourings', the proposal is in the interests of consumers and industry as it would achieve harmonisation of this sector at Community level.
A package of compromise amendments has been tabled, following close contact between the various institutions.
COREPER has marked its agreement to this compromise package, to which I gladly add the Commission's support.
I will now turn to the last of the legislative dossiers, Mr Olsson's second reading recommendation on hormones.
I very much welcome the progress made.
The debate on hormones has proved to be as delicate as the hormonal balance controlling the physiological functions in living creatures.
As you know, the Commission initially proposed to prohibit the use of oestradiol in the light of advice that this endogenously produced substance is a carcinogen.
Parliament supported this.
However, intricate discussions in the Council - which took more than two years, spanned four presidencies and included two extra background reports - have demonstrated that prohibiting oestradiol is not as straightforward as was first imagined.
Member States have drawn attention to the significant difficulties likely to arise from a prohibition, in particular the distress that this may cause with respect to animal welfare and the reorganisation of stockbreeding.
We therefore had to reconsider, by asking ourselves: what are our objectives?
They are, firstly, to protect consumer health and, secondly, to achieve compliance with WTO requirements.
According to the Commission's analysis both objectives can be achieved with the compromise proposed today by the rapporteur, Mr Olssen, and his colleagues, to whom I offer my sincere thanks.
The adoption of this text with Amendment Nos 17, 18 and 19 would result in a significant reduction in the use of oestradiol.
Moreover, it clearly distinguishes the three remaining uses from the use of oestradiol for growth promotion.
It will, therefore, allow the Community to implement its international obligations in the context of the World Trade Organisation.
Therefore, I look forward to the debate on these interesting and important issues.
Mr President, Commissioner, it will be no surprise to you when I say that I would of course have preferred it if the three fine amendments adopted - admittedly by a small majority, but adopted nonetheless - in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had been made use of.
Things being as they are, and politics being the art of the possible, I would, however, like to make it plain to you that this House cannot be expected to co-decide on a European directive that demands that winemakers and brewers should indicate on the bottle label that these beverages were produced using fish and eggs.
That, though, would have happened had we approved the Common Position without the amendments tabled by our rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ.
To her I would like to extend the warmest thanks for her tireless efforts at bringing to the light of day a well thought-out directive, one that will of course ensure that, where potentially-allergenic ingredients - and I say ingredients rather than processing aids - are present, that presence is required to be indicated on a label.
Wine and beer, however, do not contain such allergy-triggering ingredients.
There is no doubt that their manufacture and processing involves the use of traces of processing aids described in Annex IIIa as having allergenic potential, these being isinglass and egg derivatives as clarifiers and fining agents.
They help in technical processes such as filtering.
The crucial difference from conventional additives is that processing aids are removed after use, and things that are not present in wine or beer do not have to be declared on the list of ingredients.
That is the solution that this House adopted at first reading.
I am convinced that the ministers responsible would, if they had known what is at stake, have followed this House's wise and far-sighted lead and would have put a proper Common Position before us.
We know for certain that the presence in the end product of traces of the aids used cannot be scientifically demonstrated, even though, in such small quantities, they are unlikely to trigger allergies.
Until such time as that is sorted out, there must be no labelling of such a nature as to mislead consumers, arouse unwarranted fears and do indefensible harm to major sectors of industry.
That is why our approval of our rapporteur's compromise motion represents the outermost limit of what we can tolerate, and beyond that we cannot go.
Commissioner, as you did not give Mrs KlaÃ an answer, I will ask you once more: is it indeed the case that studies may be submitted nine months after the directive enters into force?
This is something that must be clarified now, or else the rapporteur will have to speak for another few minutes.
Mrs Lulling, you were allocated two minutes by the sittings directorate, and you have talked for three minutes and 26 seconds.
In the absence of your fellow Member, Mr Goodwill, your speaking time was extended to three minutes, but not to three minutes 26.
You will understand that I am obliged to be very firm, unless I want everyone to go to bed at 2 a.m.
I thank you.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, successive food scandals have undermined consumer confidence. Furthermore, food safety will be a burning political issue from now on, becoming an integral element in the overall safety of citizens.
As a result, it is considered essential to provide extensive information on the ingredients of foodstuffs. Precise and relevant labelling, then, is indispensable, especially for ingredients which may cause allergies.
The problem is relatively simple for those allergens actually present in the final product.
Is it reasonable, on the other hand, to demand the inclusion on labels of ingredients such as technological aids, used especially in the production of alcoholic drinks, which constitute part of the production process but are not present in the finished product?
Since the best is always the enemy of the good, are we not in danger, in our commendable desire to protect allergy sufferers, of weakening traditional production methods through such measures, even causing markets to go bust, with no scientific proof of the harmful character of these aids?
One can well imagine the horror of consumers when they discover that sulphites and other unappetising ingredients are used in the production of wines as prestigious as champagne, or those of this beautiful region, Alsace, to name but a few.
I am therefore glad that a balanced compromise has been found on this controversial question.
The compromise states that it will be possible to withdraw certain ingredients from the list of allergens on the evidence of a scientifically-researched dossier, pending a full scientific study.
Coming from a wine-producing region, of course, I would have preferred it if the burden of proof - in other words, the production of the technical dossier - did not fall on the shoulders of producers who are sometimes small operators. I am aware, however, that if we did not accept this compromise, we would have to ratify the Council's common position, which makes no provision for a procedure for exempting ingredients from the list of allergens.
For these reasons, although my feelings are mixed, I believe that it is advisable to adopt this compromise. At the same time, I express the hope that the Commission will allow small - and medium-sized producers the flexibility they need in order to make their arguments heard.
Mr President, I must say that I am incredibly pleased with Mrs KlaÃ's report.
I am not among those who are so terribly concerned about all the E numbers and additives. There is, however, a group of people who lead extremely difficult lives, namely those who genuinely have food allergies.
I think it is only right to show solidarity with them.
As I say, I am extremely pleased that the rules are now to be very much tightened up so that everything that is allergy-causing is to be listed.
It is also very good that we are to obtain strict rules to the effect that all ingredients are to be listed on a decreasing scale.
My group will support all three of these reports.
Mr President, the Group of the Greens can by and large support the Kla? report.
We believe in particular that industry must prove that a substance is non-allergenic.
That has fortunately been retained in the compromise.
As regards the Olsson report the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the compromise.
Just like Mr Olsson we would of course have preferred to ban all growth promoters, but there are in particular animal welfare reasons for making a few limited exceptions nonetheless.
We are glad that there will be more research into safety and into efficient alternatives, so that eventually we can move away from them altogether.
We have a whole lot more difficulty with the Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez report.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would go much further.
Many of these additives and all those substances are unnecessary as far as we are concerned.
With the precautionary principle in mind, parabens, polysorbates and aluminium phosphates should be banned immediately.
We will however assent to the compromise because it is a step forward compared with the Commission proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs KlaÃ, who has worked very competently on this report and shown herself capable of weighing up both the advantages and the negative consequences of systematic labelling regulations.
She has fought her corner and defended her case against some of her collaborators, notably the Commission, which was not predisposed to listen to the demands of the elected Members of this House.
Mrs KlaÃ's report, as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, was the best solution in my view, speaking as an eagle-eyed native of Champagne.
Certain higher and sometimes contradictory interests, however, could not be ignored, and we thus decided on a fallback solution.
In a sense, I had already proposed that solution anyway, in the amendments I tabled in committee, but I had then rallied round, without enthusiasm, to the solution advocated by the rapporteur.
Today, part of me is happy that a partial solution has been taken up and reworked to satisfy the majority of us.
Ensuring clear and relevant information as well as a certain level of protection for consumers suffering from allergies makes good sense to me.
On the other hand, alarmist labelling would terrify consumers who suffer from allergies and reduce their own consumption.
Iconic European drinks such as champagne or Irish beer would suffer terribly from this, Commissioner, dragging the whole European wine industry down with them.
Tomorrow, before representatives of the wine industry of my region, Champagne-Ardennes, I am going to have to defend the established principle that it is the responsibility of producers great and small to prove that derivatives of supposedly allergenic products used by them as technological aids in wine are not themselves allergens, because they are the result of an important process of transformation of raw materials and operate in a totally different context, that of wine or beer.
All of this alters their characteristics fundamentally. Brewers will thus have to prove that isinglass, used for centuries in beer-making, is not a proscribed product.
In short, the burden of proof falls on their shoulders, but we have bought some time to do the relevant research.
I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur and supporting the solution proposed in Amendment No 4.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has moreover co-signed the compromise amendment and assumes the consequences of that choice.
Mr President, the three reports which are now the subjects of a joint debate are important items of focus in our endeavours to ensure food safety and consumer welfare.
I would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent work.
In the single market consumers encounter new and strange products and manufacturers on the shelves of their own familiar local shop every day, and they must be able to have complete confidence in quality control and food safety in that single market.
It is regrettable that whenever the EU is proactive in setting such important standards, this is so often felt to be needless concern over details.
One cause of that, of course, is the way the European press often deliberately sets out to portray things in a negative light, and disregarding the real problem at issue.
The reasons for this are not political; they are to do with journalism.
Stories need colour, and, unfortunately, that colour is often acquired by spreading scare stories instead of factual information.
The latest example of this is the news story about limiting the maximum amounts for PAH compounds in foods to protect consumers' health.
A totally legitimate research project carried out by the Commission has, at least in the Finnish newspapers, already developed into a scare about whether the EU is now going to ban private barbecues and our favourite summer treat, the grilled sausage.
There has been continual whining about the EU meddling in everything and being overly protective, and they have been asking when the Europolice are going to start lighting bonfires piled with dangerous cookery books and whether soon we will have to eat wearing a helmet on our head, just to be on the safe side.
Unfortunately, the nation swallows whole the scare stories spread in this way without any justification, giving rise to negative feelings and resentment.
For that reason it would be important if the good work done in Parliament to protect people's health also had more vigorous support from the EU Information Centres.
It is obviously necessary to provide background information early on at the preparatory stage so that the unsubstantiated urban legends about the EU do not get a chance to take root.
Mr President, I must firstly convey my special thanks to Mrs Ayuso, the Commission and the Council for cooperating so well on the current proposal and compromise concerning additives, so that we might conclude this matter no later than at first reading.
I suppose our package permits the further use of additives, but it has been quite crucial for me that we are now also putting the emphasis on the Commission's supervision and re-evaluation of the use of previously approved substances.
I hope that we do not continue with the policy of just going on accepting new additives and an extended use of already approved substances so that such additives and substances are only omitted from the list when the industry itself informs us that they are no longer used.
I think that the policy so far has been unduly defensive.
In my opinion, the Commission should constantly inspect and re-evaluate the use of additives so that the three well-known conditions for using them are fully complied with at all times.
I am therefore very pleased about the provisions in the package whereby the Commission must, within two years, present an overall report on the re-evaluation of additives and whereby this report must promptly focus especially upon the use of certain types, including nitrates, nitrites and polysorbates.
I hope that tomorrow's adoption of the reports and the process leading to approval of the package may herald a better policy on the use of additives in food.
I should also like to take the opportunity of thanking Mr Olsson for his really constructive cooperation in connection with banning the use of hormones in animal husbandry.
In this area too, we are now obtaining a result in which the use of the carcinogenic hormone, oestradiol 17? will cease in the course of two years.
In other words, hormones in general will cease to be used in animal husbandry.
This is a sound and very positive result that Mr Olsson has piloted through.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly congratulate the three rapporteurs, among whom I would like to single out Mrs KlaÃ, whose report demonstrates some very good ways of approaching this issue.
I know from my own personal experience the different preconceptions that have to be taken into account when considering issues of labelling.
I would particularly like to highlight the rules on labelling for products that trigger allergic reactions.
In the European Union, 8% of children and 3% of adults suffer an allergic reaction to food ingredients to such an extent that it markedly affects their general state of health, and that is an alarming statistic.
When it comes to keeping consumers informed, labelling is the only option in view of the large number of compound foodstuffs, the composition of which changes frequently.
Unlike the previous speakers, I am in favour of the continued addition of ingredients that, it simply has to be said, improve the quality of the meal.
That products should be listed only if there is scientific evidence that they trigger allergies goes without saying; we should also ensure that the list can be amended quickly when new findings come to light.
It should always be borne in mind that the plethora of information on a label has to communicate the essentials.
In this perspective, I look forward with keen anticipation to learning what the Commission thinks about the inclusion on labels of, for example, unproven assertions.
This is where there could well be a reduction in the amount of information provided.
May I just make one additional observation?
In 1998, as a rapporteur, I tried to bring in rules on the labelling of alcoholic drinks; the sole issue then was the labelling of sulphur.
What was, at that time, seen as revolutionary is now no longer an issue; proof that Parliament has, in recent years, come round much more to the consumers' way of thinking.
Furthermore, I welcome the proposal for labelling where the proportion of an ingredient is in excess of 2%.
Although this was, years ago, regarded as impossible, and may well not be necessary, we are now taking account of the tendency to use many ingredients in small quantities in the production process, and we are discharging our obligation to inform the consumer.
Businesses with whom I have had discussions have told me that most labels now include ingredients the proportion of which is under 2%.
I would just like to make a brief comment on the Olsson report; I welcome Mr Olsson's accommodating approach and see it as a good thing, but I am also aware that oestradiol 17? is already being replaced by other substances in many countries in the European Union.
That is something that we should be encouraging and promoting.
I really must insist that Members observe the limits on their speaking time.
I cannot extend every Member's speaking time by half, or we will not sleep tonight.
Would the Commission like to say anything more?
Very briefly, I was asked a question in relation to Amendment No 4, and perhaps I might just give some clarification to that on the KlaÃ report.
I believe the Amendment No 4 compromise is quite clear.
The industry can notify the studies for existing derivative products for a period of nine months after the entry into force of the directive.
The Commission will finally need to decide, at the latest four years after the entry into force, whether a derivative will need to be labelled or not.
The Commission will decide on the basis of the studies, after the consultation that is envisaged with the European Food Safety Authority.
Mr President, Commissioner, the point at issue is that the wording in the compromise is 'studies currently in progress', and I stressed in my speech the fact that these things have not been researched before.
If our new directive leads industry to consider requesting a study, is it possible that it is only now that I would commission one?
That was the question - not whether current studies would be taken into account, but whether it is possible that future studies will be.
One final response, perhaps, Commissioner?
. The compromise that was reached related to studies for existing derivative products; that was for a period of nine months after the entry into force of the directive.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0200/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste [14843/1/2002 - C5-0082/2003 - 2001/0291(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Corbey).
- (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the second reading I should like to revisit a number of important points from my report.
I do not wish to do so however without first thanking my fellow Members.
The shadow rapporteurs have been especially helpful.
At this point I would also like to direct a word of thanks to the industry.
We had the opportunity of holding intensive discussions, not only with the packaging industry, but also with the packers and the environmental groups.
This gave rise to heated discussions and it increased my understanding of actual practice.
These discussions have convinced me that we must start looking at packaging differently.
For a long time it has been self-evident to see packaging as an environmental problem, a small and necessary problem certainly, but a problem nonetheless.
We can also see packaging in a positive light by looking at it in conjunction with the product.
Packaging then becomes the protector of the product and prevents waste.
Packaging is also the vehicle of globalisation, of world trade and of socio-economic development.
Seen in this light sustainable development is no longer possible without packaging.
A positive way of thinking about packaging however is only credible if we go all out to prevent environmental pollution. Which is why recycling and prevention are necessary.
I shall turn to them briefly now.
First of all recycling.
This is an important part of the directive.
Some even maintain that really the packaging directive is first and foremost a recycling directive.
In the debates during the first reading I pointed out that recycling is not a goal in itself and that there are also limits to the environmental benefit of recycling.
During the second reading we were mainly concerned with the costs of recycling.
The British Government in particular is concerned about the extra costs of more recycling and published figures on this.
What remains unclear however is the way in which the costs have been calculated.
Recycling costs money, but it does produce something as well.
The greater the scale, the more cost-effective, but there are limits of course.
If you want to collect the last tin in the north of Finland, that does of course cost a disproportionate amount of money.
Our discussion about the environmental benefit in the first reading and the economic costs in the second almost inevitably lead to the conclusion that the optimum percentage could vary substantially from one country to another.
The discussion was indeed more of a discussion between countries than between political groups.
Ultimately we are going to have to work towards each country finding and fulfilling its own optimum.
But that is only possible if sufficient recycling capacity has already been created in each country.
That is why we need clear objectives now.
We must certainly not set the bar too low, nor too high, nor too close, nor too far away.
We need a good middle position.
I therefore call on you to support the compromise that the groups have reached. This compromise is 55% in 2007.
In passing I note that we are therefore later than the original Commission proposal, because that was 55% in 2006.
It is very important to set ambitious but achievable targets for the new Member States as well.
They must themselves be involved with this.
Waste and recycling have become global markets.
There is no objection to the export of sorted waste, but we must be sure that it has indeed been sorted and that it is indeed being properly processed in developing world countries.
The exporter must prove this.
Prevention.
Prevention still receives too little attention i n the packaging directive.
We have to do something about producer responsibility.
We have done so previously in the electronic waste directive and the end-of-life vehicles directive.
The responsibility of producers here is not just financial.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy demands better implementation of the essential requirements and asks producers to choose the most environmentally friendly alternative.
It is a good idea to set up an indicator for this.
Different materials such as paper, metal, glass and plastic must compete on an environmental quality basis.
This will provide an incentive for constant innovation in the environmental field. And there is an incentive to invest in recycling capacity.
It will lead to every country having optimum recycling capacity because every material producer will have an interest in recycling.
The introduction of an indicator is also a way of giving consumers greater involvement with packaging and of giving supermarkets or businesses the opportunity only to choose five-star packaging for example.
In this way sustainable development is something that concerns all of us.
This approach fits in perfectly with the sixth environmental action programme.
I would like to draw your attention to two further points.
Firstly, re-use.
Discussion of this topic has gained fresh momentum since Germany made deposit systems compulsory on 1 January.
Complaints are pouring in about this because of the distortion of the internal market.
Deposit systems can indeed conflict with the internal market.
It is a pity that the Commission has not seized upon the revision as an opportunity to do something about the long list of complaints.
It is also a pity that no majority was to be found in the first reading for the amendment to create clarity.
We must prevent improper utilisation of re-use and therefore we must put the environmental result first here too.
The second point that I would like to make concerns ceramics.
I have a question for the Commission about this.
The ceramics industry is concerned about the effects of the packaging directive and is seeking total exemption.
There are two points on which I would like a clear statement from the Commission.
Firstly, in my view it is not advantageous for the ceramics industry to fall completely outside the packaging directive - this directive does after all provide the basis for trade in the internal market.
Commissioner, what is your opinion on this?
Secondly, I would like clarity as to whether the ceramics industry will have a recycling obligation by 2007.
In my view it will not, but on this too I would like confirmation from the Commission.
Before giving the floor to the Commissioner, I would remind those of my fellow Members who have just rejoined us for this new debate that we have an extraordinarily full agenda this evening.
So that the last few Members, speaking on the last few reports, do not have to watch the sun rise from this room, I would ask speakers to keep to the time allotted to them.
. I thank Ms Corbey for her work as rapporteur on this subject.
I know she has done a very serious job and looked at this in depth.
In 1999 a total amount of 63.5 million tonnes of packaging waste was generated in the European Union.
This corresponds to around 17% of municipal solid waste and 3% of the total waste generation by weight.
The packaging and packaging waste directive has made the collection and recycling of packaging waste a normal activity in all EU Member States, increasingly so also in the accession countries.
In this way the directive has helped to reduce environmental impacts and to strengthen the internal market for packaging and packaging waste.
This revision builds on this success.
I am very pleased that the European Parliament has, since the first reading, given clear support for our proposal to more than double the minimum recycling targets and to further increase the recovery target.
It seems that there is now widespread agreement on the levels of the targets.
The key remaining question is whether the implementation deadline will be 2008, as in the common position, or whether an earlier date should be set.
In my view deadlines should be both realistic and ambitious.
It will also be important to give Greece, Ireland and Portugal - Member States already granted later target dates under current legislation - a reasonable time to adapt to the new targets.
This also applies to the accession states.
I intend to propose deadlines for these countries before the end of this year.
I am also pleased that Parliament largely agrees that other aspects - in particular, prevention and re-use - should be further studied before new decisions are taken.
However, the need for further analysis also applies to the new obligation referred to in the first part of Amendment No 7.
This new obligation to minimise the environmental impact of packaging risks duplicating the existing essential requirements and facing the same problems in regard to enforcement.
I fully understand the concerns of Parliament regarding exports for recycling.
I agree that we should make sure that recycling in non-EU countries should only count for our targets if it is done properly.
However, controls and paperwork should be focused on where they are really needed.
I do not see any reason why this should apply to materials such as metals, paper and glass.
These materials are part of a functioning, internal, international market.
I doubt that we need written proof of the recycling of each exported batch.
It would also seem strange to me to apply stricter controls on exports of packaging waste than the provisions on waste electrical and electronic equipment, which we decided just a few months ago.
There seems to be a great deal of concern in Parliament - as we just heard from the rapporteur - about the effect of the packaging directive on ceramics packaging.
Let me be clear that nothing in the directive obliges Member States to set up recycling systems for this type of packaging.
Excluding ceramics from the scope of the packaging directive raises the question of why we should exclude ceramics and not other, similar packaging types.
It also gives Member States the freedom to take any measure on ceramics packaging, as long as it is within the framework of the Treaty.
Therefore I believe it is better to ask the Technical Committee to solve any possible implementation problems, rather than excluding ceramics from the scope of the directive.
I know that flower pots, self-adhesive labels and related issues are important for the industries concerned.
Therefore they merit a proper discussion.
Conciliation is, in my view, not the right framework for such a discussion.
This is a job for detailed work by the experts in the Technical Committee.
Of the 32 amendments the Commission can accept 20 amendments in full, in part, or in principle.
A list of the amendments concerned has been handed over separately
Mr President, Commissioner, the modification of the directive on packaging is going to have enormous repercussions for the various agents, local councils, collection systems, companies producing materials, the food industry and consumers.
It is clear that we must set quantitative objectives and that these must be ambitious but, at the same time, they must be achievable.
We must not forget the fact that in certain Member States the objectives will be more difficult to achieve for historical reasons relating to lack of infrastructure, low population density or consumer habits.
I regret not having been able to reach a full agreement with the rapporteur, but I believe that her work has not been at all easy.
In the report which she presented in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy there were many points on which we were in agreement, but Mrs Corbey wanted to go further and, after having reached a compromise, at the last minute she has introduced modifications in Amendments Nos 26 and 27 which have obliged me not to sign them and to vote against them tomorrow.
I understand that in countries such as Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands the collection of waste is cheap and efficient.
In these countries there is a uniform distribution of population and no geographical barriers.
But it is not logical to impose the same objectives on other Member States which do not have a similar distribution of population.
And I am not just talking about my country, Spain, but also Finland, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom and other Member States which are going to have great difficulties fulfilling the objectives agreed in the common position.
And this is not a problem of a lack of investment on the part of public administrations.
There are 41 million of us living in Spain, half the population of Germany, in an area of 504 000 km2.
The population is distributed around the most mountainous rural environment in the whole of the European Community.
Can anyone believe that the collection of waste can be carried out on equal terms?
We need a realistic, flexible and, above all, applicable directive.
It appears that some people want to gear this directive towards their own laws and impose it on the other Member States.
This is neither fair, logical nor equitable.
I believe that the Council's common position is pretty balanced.
I fully support the dates and the quantitative objectives set in it.
My only regret is that there are not equal objectives for all materials and that, as a result of economic interests, we have forgotten that there are problems with the functioning of the internal market, which is the real reason for this Directive.
I believe it is very important that we support the various different options for dealing with waste: re-use, recycling and energy recovery.
These three options are better than merely depositing waste in dumps.
Finally, we must bear in mind that packaging waste represents a relatively small proportion of all waste generated in the Member States, 3% according to you, Commissioner.
So let us be flexible.
Industry is making great efforts as are the agents involved.
Mr President, it is important to improve on the present Directive on packaging waste, as has been said here in several speeches.
The targets for recycling and re-use for the next five years in the form now proposed are fairly high but are by no means unreasonable.
Many Member States have already achieved considerably higher levels than those now being proposed.
These suggested targets are easily achievable, and if we had less ambitious targets, then any branch of industry, for example, which would exploit the use of recycled material, could not develop.
In order to reach the targets, however, we should bear in mind the excellent measures that have already been implemented in different Member States to achieve the greatest possible targets for recycling and re-use.
For example, countries that have good experience of re-use projects should also be encouraged even further in this area.
Just as the rapporteur stated, economic and ecological factors must be taken into consideration in this connection.
I would therefore like to draw attention to the fact that, as recycling targets are being proposed for wood, it is these very ecological and economic factors that have not necessarily been taken into consideration.
The 15% target for wood is a low one, but in a country like Finland, for example, the ecological disadvantages of transportation greatly outweigh the benefits gained from recycling wood in this way.
It is a lot wiser ecologically if this wood is burnt as an energy source in people's houses.
I therefore hope that common sense will prevail and that Amendment No 26, which is a proposal put forward by the rapporteur and others, will be supported.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must address Mrs Corbey and say that she has done a fantastic job on a hopeless subject.
This is a waste directive that is not really concerned at all with packaging but with packaging waste.
To discuss this is, in actual fact, to begin at the completely wrong end of the production chain.
If we wanted to achieve a reduced quantity of waste and reduced mileage, especially for lorries transporting waste on motorways, we should begin by discussing packaging, the role of packaging, logistics and how we could gain a huge amount, both environmentally and in terms of road use, from having fully adapted packaging.
Nor does it make any sense at all for us to occupy ourselves with recycling - irrespective of whether it be recycling proper, including energy recycling, or re-utilisation - and for us to spend the whole time debating the packaging that goes out to households.
Clearly, we should have a much more rational system whereby the greater part of packaging material goes to shops, institutional households, wholesalers etc and whereby the packaging we carry home is as simple, slim and small as possible, almost to the point of being non-existent.
As matters stand, it is a question not of strength but of design.
We shall, in the main, support Mrs Corbey's compromise proposal, even though we have not, for various reasons, endorsed it.
Mr President, in brief, since I can do little more within one minute, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for seeking a compromise which has led to 11 amendments being signed, the majority of them, by several groups, for the revision of this Directive.
I would also like to point out that this proposal represents the fulfilment of one of the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and say, like the rapporteur, that the objectives of the proposal are ambitious but achievable, as certain Member States are demonstrating by already complying with certain aspects of this Directive on packaging and packaging waste.
We must place particular emphasis on compliance with the Directive (one of the most serious problems we are facing is very frequent non-compliance with Community environmental legislation).
We must stress the need to ensure that exporters carry out the process of recovery or recycling under conditions which are not merely similar to those laid down in Community legislation, but exactly equivalent to them.
Finally, Mr President, we must also act quickly to guarantee the selection at origin of materials that create less waste, are less harmful and reduce waste as much as possible, since that waste has increased over recent years in the majority of Member States.
Mr President, my group will be supporting a number of the compromise amendments that have been put forward.
This must have been very difficult for the rapporteur in face of Members of this Parliament who want to drag their heels for the benefit of the packaging industry.
However, looking at the current packaging directive and at compliance with it, and just looking at my own country Ireland and a number of others, for example Portugal and Greece - they are all now looking for derogations for extra time.
In my opinion, they are being rewarded for being tardy and environmentally irresponsible.
This is sending out a very dangerous message to the applicant countries.
If the existing Member States cannot comply with the existing legislation and cannot meet their targets then it is going to be very difficult to argue and to push for the new countries coming in to do the same, since they come from an economically less well-off background.
Some of the proposals that have been put forward in the legislation were alarming.
The idea of a maximum target for recycling is crazy.
If Member States can recycle 100% then surely they should be allowed to do so and to set a ceiling here is irresponsible.
The issue of recovery is a major problem.
Recovery is stretching definitions to the extreme.
Recovery is basically a nice term for incineration; it is burning and then producing heat.
The idea of a minimum target for recovery will to a certain extent force Member States who do not have incineration to bring it in or to use that as an excuse.
Perhaps the wording is not as bad as it was originally.
This is a major problem for countries like Ireland that have not done anything about their waste problem.
They will say, we are going to recover, and that sounds very nice.
At this stage we have to do what has been proposed by some other speakers.
We have to eliminate, reduce and recycle, and then finally disposal should be the last option.
Burning waste and calling it recovery is stretching the imagination to the extreme.
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, on her approach.
The principle underlying this legislation is limitation of the harmful environmental consequences of packaging.
The way in which the targets formulated are achieved may differ from one Member State to another.
Unfortunately, we have to say that the European Commission thinks differently about this, witness the fact that on 17 December last year it decided to summon the Netherlands to appear before the Court. And this while the targets are being amply achieved in the Netherlands through the operation of a voluntary agreement between the Ministry for Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment and industry.
This approach will also have to be recognised in this directive.
In compromise Amendment No 31 this has been done, although I still find the requirements very tight.
I recognise that the targets of this directive may be ambitious, but nonetheless this matter must not end in conciliation, certainly not if there is agreement with the Council on the other points.
I can for example give my unqualified support to the idea that the export of packaging waste may only count towards the achievement of the targets if the exporter can supply the proof that the recovery and/or the recycling has taken place in circumstances that are equivalent to the community regulation.
I am less happy with the fact that the discussion of mechanical recycling is again being deferred, so that we continue to be faced with a lack of clarity.
Finally, Mr President, I really do think that gift wrap should be covered by the definition of packaging.
Mr President, I believe that the approach of this directive is out of date. That is confirmed by the Commission's recently published Thematic Strategy on Recycling.
This now says: 'Current directives foresee that all Member States should achieve the same recycling targets as this one does.
However, the question is legitimate whether this uniformity in targets is most effective, both from an environmental and economic point of view.
It might be better to have an overall EU recycling target at EU level and let market forces determine which recycling facilities can achieve the objective in the most cost-effective manner.'
How right that is!
We know that there are some Member States that want to go beyond the proposed targets.
Others will find them impossible to meet.
So why are we ploughing on with a strategy that is already being undermined by the practicalities?
The United Kingdom has a problem with this.
For many years we have relied on landfill.
Our geology favoured that.
We consequently had no particular incentive to press ahead with recycling, as some countries did.
We are now moving as fast as we can, but there is no way that we can move as fast as the rapporteur's amendments prescribe.
To do that would mean spending EUR 1.8 billion on recycling packaging waste alone, and packaging waste is only 6% of the waste going to landfill in Britain.
This would mean that we would have to tell British local councils to initiate policies to remove packaging from the household waste stream.
That takes time and money, Mrs Corbey.
Maybe such policies are not the most pressing priorities of my country's local authorities.
Maybe their priority is financing home helps, Meals on Wheels for the elderly or services of another kind.
If subsidiarity is to mean anything at all, such priorities should be for local decision.
How can I defend a situation where a combination of continental MEPs press for changes that will supply an imperative to British local authorities that a majority of British MEPs have not voted for?
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for the work she has done on this report and on the proposals that are on the table.
We have just heard how the way we deal with packaging has a decisive part to play in shaping the future of our environment, and how there is - of course - a market in this field, one in which the big packaging groups are competing with one another, so that we have to give some thought as to how we achieve an optimum level of effectiveness.
Within this market there are specialities, which represent the opportunities offered by diversity in Europe.
Where these are concerned we have stressed the need for this great pot to safeguard the interests, futures and chances of survival of the small firms, scattered throughout Europe, working in the ceramics sector and producing highly-prized packaging such as that for Meaux mustard and similar goods.
To describe them as an industry would be an exaggeration, in that they have between 30 and 50 workers each.
It is for this reason that the keynote of our amendments is that the directive should not cover packaging materials which cannot be utilised for energy recovery owing to their material quality, which are inert, and the quantities of which do not exceed 0.1% of the proven quantity of packaging in the Community, and for which material or raw material recycling is ruled out for ecological and cost-benefit reasons.
We have just heard from the Commissioner - and for this we are grateful - that the packaging directive's recycling order will not apply to ceramics.
There must, of course, be a place for ceramics in the packaging directive, but recycling it would mean that it would have to be transported back across Europe, in minimal quantities, in order for this to be done.
Systems for its return, collection and recovery would have to be introduced.
That would kill off small businesses.
We cannot believe that Europe is about enacting directives that cut away the economic basis from under small firms that offer speciality goods that are highly prized in Europe.
I thank you for your unambiguous statement, which is something we can build on, and which will also give the firms a certain amount of breathing space and a reliable prospect of future development.
Mr President, Commissioner, although I often agree with you, this is one occasion when I do not, as I take the view that you ought to have intervened at a much earlier stage.
I have just heard impressive speeches to the effect that equal quotas in Europe are unfair.
At that, I cannot but laugh; why, then do we have them?
In Europe, we have to have comparable rules, and the ground rules have to be interpreted in such a way that the Member States can make a start.
I was here in 1994 - as was Mrs Jackson - when we adopted the directive.
If my schoolboy maths serves me well, that was twelve years ago.
There are Member States that, since that day, have simply sat with their arms folded and done nothing whatever.
This morning, I was at a big event in Frankfurt, along with several hundred others.
They gave me a good telling-off and said to me, 'Florenz, why are we, in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Belgium, in a number of Nordic countries, keeping in step and implementing these rules, while, elsewhere, they are doing nothing at all?
You are a poor representative of your country if you allow this sort of thing to go on'.
I have to tell you, Commissioner, you are the guardian of the laws, and you have to intervene at a much earlier stage.
Mrs Corbey, I see it as almost shameful that we should be starting a dispute in this House as to whether the starting date should be 2008 or 2007.
That is not what all this is about!
What matters is that we should heighten awareness among the public and in the Member States of the fact that a recycling strategy means that resources are conserved, and that when we talk about the conservation of resources, we are talking about our children's capital.
In Europe, that has to be organised on a Community basis.
I very much sympathise with those who say 'yes' to this, but are worried about the export issue.
With my liberal approach, I do not go as far as that, but when it comes to exports, we cannot have the situation in which enterprises here develop recycling strategies, and then export the materials.
Such a thing would surely be false.
While I, of course, have sympathy with Member States that sort out care for the elderly before dealing with the packaging directive, I do accept that this is the rule.
Mr President, there is no doubt that we need this legislation: we are absolutely drowning in a sea of milk cartons, hair sprays, coke cans, pizza boxes, bottles of wine and shampoo.
They are evident in every town, city and street we go into across the Union, in particular the UK.
Landfills are reaching capacity, incinerators are overflowing and the wads of excessive packaging we use should go.
This legislation, if it signals the end of just one elaborate box, fancy bottle or something wrapped in plastic and sold in a heavyweight bag, will have done its job.
However, I would call on everyone here to recognise the importance of allowing time for change.
Ministers are calling for a 2008 date for the UK and some of the other states.
I would ask you to support that.
Culture change takes time.
The UK is meeting its existing recycling targets, but it is simply not possible to meet and implement this legislation by 2007 without an expensive, crash-spending programme.
The figures do not look very significant, but they represent millions of tonnes of material which must be collected, recycled and new markets found.
A realistic timetable for implementation is five years.
Any attempt to compress this time will result in spiralling costs - if not quite as much as Mrs Jackson says.
Nevertheless, we need time and we will do the job.
Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my heartfelt support for the proposal put by the rapporteur, who has worked with great dedication.
I can understand the compromises that have been made.
Not everyone can be equally tough.
We must however in any event leave those who can be tougher, but who perhaps go about things differently, as in the Netherlands for example, with its voluntary agreement, in peace because they are achieving more than the others.
That is why I, just like Mr Hans Blokland, am happy with the amendment to Paragraph 31.
Everyone wants to achieve the targets in their own way.
That does however mean that you must not distort the market in achieving those targets.
Commissioner, I have a question for you about this.
It has become apparent to us - and they are finding this very difficult in the area that I come from - that because of the way in which deposit money is levied on single-use packaging in Germany - and shortly in Belgium too - it has actually become impossible at the moment to continue importing single-use packaging from other European countries into Germany.
What we have therefore is a trade embargo.
Do you not think, Commissioner, that this way of achieving the target, namely the reduction of waste, which I am otherwise in favour of, is distorting the market through the imposition of an ecotax or deposit money?
And should that not be reason for you, perhaps in consultation with your colleague Mr Bolkestein, to take this up and in any event to give me an answer now?
What is your opinion on this and what steps must be taken to bring an end to this trade distortion, which has for that matter already led to job losses?
Mr President, key to the 1994 directive were targets for Member States for packaging recovery and recycling, to be set initially for a five-year phase and thereafter to be reviewed for subsequent five-year phases - and hence we are here today.
I support the objective of this directive to minimise the impact of packaging and packaging waste, as long as the costs are proportionate to the environmental benefits.
It is often forgotten that packaging waste is only a small proportion of total landfill.
The key concern in relation to the amendments to this directive is the deadline for achieving compliance with the proposed higher recovery and recycling targets.
The deadline, or 'time-line', should be realistic, proportionate and achievable in line with best practice.
This will allow infrastructure and recycling capacity to be built up at a pace that ensures progress with the objectives of the directive whilst not imposing excessive or disproportionate costs.
I wish to draw attention to the derogation that sets the same recovery and recycling targets as for the other twelve Member States, but allows Ireland, Greece and Portugal longer to achieve them.
I urge support for the common position, which sets an accepted deadline of 2012.
There is an assumption that all Member States should ultimately reach the same recovery and recycling rates, irrespective of size, geography or infrastructure.
It is not a question of having done nothing alone.
Yes, far more could be done, but in Ireland's case we have a population of less than four million and too small a market to sustain a packaging manufacturing infrastructure.
We import 75% of our packaged goods.
There is one paper recycler, little plastics recycling, no metal recyclers and the only glass recycler in the country has recently closed down.
Therefore we are at a permanent geographical and structural disadvantage.
To comply with this directive we must ship packaging waste overseas or build more reprocessing facilities and export the empty packaging, which is uneconomic.
The cost will not be proportional to the environmental benefit.
I underline what Ms Jackson said to us, on the Commission's recent communication on the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste, published in May 2003.
From an environmental point of view it is more important to optimise collection and recycling in the Community as a whole, rather than to consider whether this takes place in a particular Member State.
This should be reflected in the overall recycling target at Community level.
In the Commissioner's own words, could she please explain how this squares with what we have here today?
Mr President, to her credit, the main thread of the rapporteur's argument has been the speedy revision of targets, thereby avoiding the temptation to embark on too large-scale and thorough a review now.
There will be another time for that.
I would like here to mention some of my own amendments, which were approved by the committee in the recommendation and also in the proposed inter-party compromises.
If the targets are to be implemented we should avoid discrimination between materials on the basis of weight.
That will not happen, however, if, for example, charges are based solely on weight and do not take account of each material's environmental impact.
Clarification is needed to give proper shape to the whole programme.
The very fact that there is an aim to recycle 55% by weight of packaging waste and an obligation that goes with it to take the environmental costs and benefits of the recovery and recycling of packaging materials into account means that there should be no one-sided increase in material-specific commitments, even if that would mean the 55% target would be achieved more quickly.
The Commission has promised to present a report in 2005, one section of which is to be on the subject of re-use.
My amendment proposes that that report should examine re-use and, in particular, a comparison of the ecological benefits of re-use and those of recycling.
The report should focus precisely on real environmental impact and assessing market viability.
Important details include examples in the Annex of products which constitute packaging that is not subject to the scope of this directive.
These include tubes and cylinders around which flexible material is wound, release paper of self-adhesive labels, and wrapping and gift wrapping paper sold as a separate product.
I want to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Corbey has presented for its second reading a report the essentials of which I can endorse.
We need the best possible systems to deal with what amounts to some 58 million tonnes of packaging material produced every year in the European Union, an amount that is increasing from year to year.
In so doing, we would be ensuring that the environment is better cared for and giving important sectors of industry the security to plan ahead.
Among those we will be voting on tomorrow, there is one amendment that I regard as particularly important.
Amendment No 4 has to do with packaging materials in small quantities, which are therefore subject to a very low market penetration in the Member States.
One material that occurs in small quantities of this sort is ceramic packaging; for example, ceramic bottles, pots, and bowls made in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, are mainly used for the packaging of brandies, chocolates, and patÃ©s.
Ceramic packaging accounts for only 0.1% of the packaging waste produced in the EU - in other words, just 58 000 tonnes out of 58 million tonnes.
Ceramics consist of baked clay, and their artistic and creative appearance means that, in many households, they are kept or re-used, so that they do not end up in the household rubbish.
Ceramics can be neither re-used in the production of energy nor recycled.
They pose no problems for the environment.
To treat ceramics separately, collecting them and transporting them thousands of kilometres across the Member States, would make no sense either in environmental or in economic terms.
I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 4.
Waste management, which was already introduced on the basis of this directive, or which has yet to be introduced in certain Member States, should deal with those materials that are suited to recovery; it must concentrate on materials the collection and recycling of which is profitable in economic and environmental terms.
. Mr President, I will make only four short comments.
Firstly, I would like to repeat that we have no intention to introduce a recycling obligation for ceramics packaging.
Secondly, in reply to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, we think that deposits on one-way packaging are in principle acceptable.
I know from the country I know best that they have worked for a very long time.
Mr Bolkestein and myself have made clear that we are not satisfied with the current situation in Germany, and we have urged the German Government to set up a return system in conformity with Community legislation, which can also be a nation-wide, one-way deposit.
We are taking action and we will continue to do so.
Thirdly, I have visited Ireland so I know the challenge the handling of waste creates in Ireland.
At the same time, we are open about the cost-effectiveness studies, the cost-benefit studies, that we have made on this particular issue.
We have done a very thorough job in comparing these targets and looking at the situation in different countries.
We have judged that it is not impossible to reach the targets.
However, it is reasonable to accept different target dates for different countries because the pre-conditions are so different.
I would also like to make a comment to Mrs Jackson.
Unfortunately she has left now, but she asked 'is this out of date?'
Are we discussing a proposal that is completely out of date or is the timing wrong?
There is, of course, a balance in trying to do what we can now and dealing with the acute problems of handling waste, while at the same time preparing for a modern, long-term strategy, which will probably not be following waste stream per waste stream.
However, we will try to establish a different type of approach, including what Mrs Paulsen proposed.
Hopefully, we will be able to look at the source of the problems, including transport of packaging and packaging waste.
I agree that this is the right approach, but the question is extremely complicated, because the whole issue has to be looked at in different ways.
We have already released a number of documents where we introduced this long-term thinking.
The IPP strategy has to do with this, our resource-use strategy as well as a new waste-recycling strategy.
We will therefore have to come back to this.
This is a revision of an existing directive but, be assured, we will have to look at the overall approach and discuss this again.
Thank you very much, Commissioner
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0207/2003), on behalf of Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (15792/1/2003 - C5-0135/2003 - 2001/0245(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Moreira Da Silva).
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no exaggeration, I feel, to state that tomorrow, when we approve the final version of the directive on emissions trading, we will have before us a new economic and environmental paradigm for the European Union: the carbon economy.
Carbon will have a price per tonne on the market, and whoever can produce it with the lowest carbon dioxide emissions will reap the benefits.
Approving this directive, then, has enormous political value: it lends credibility to our leadership on the world stage, which is crucial if we are to be able to convince Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol; from 2005 on, it will allow us to remedy the inadequate progress made by the majority of Member States towards compliance with Kyoto; and, most of all, it will reduce the financial cost of implementing Kyoto in the European Union by 35%.
Although Parliament has welcomed the Commission's proposal from the start and believes it to be valuable, we also felt that its scope could have been more ambitious.
I believe that this has been achieved with the recommendation for a second reading, agreed with the Greek Presidency, with the full cooperation of the Commission.
We will vote on this recommendation tomorrow.
This agreement brings two great advantages: firstly, it avoids conciliation, and hence the possible postponement of the launch of the scheme from 2005 until 2006; secondly, although it does not incorporate all the amendments tabled by Parliament, the compromise that was reached includes our most important proposals.
Allow me to highlight the principal innovations introduced by this recommendation.
Firstly, it defines a national ceiling for emissions allowances, in line with the Kyoto objectives.
A quantified objective to be obtained by the system is thus guaranteed, and the risk of over-allocation avoided.
Secondly, the temporary exclusion clause - the 'opt-out' - clause, will apply to installations but not to activities, thus assuring that the liquidity of the scheme and the equilibrium of the internal market will not be threatened.
Thirdly, the scheme can be extended to amend the directive in other sectors, notably the transport, chemical and aluminium sectors.
Fourthly, auctioning may now constitute part of the process by which emission allowances are allocated after the end of the first period, though unfortunately in a non-harmonised way.
Fifthly, credits deriving from clean development projects and joint implementation of the Kyoto Protocol will be linked into this directive, but they will not replace the priority that should be given to domestic measures.
Sixthly, an opt-in clause is included, permitting Member States to extend the system to other installations and activities.
Seventhly, the system may be extended to greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide from the second period of the directive onwards, though on a voluntary basis.
Eighthly, limits are then defined, with fixed and non-negotiable penalties for non-compliance.
Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the inclusion of benchmarking criteria for allocating emissions allowances among the Member States.
I feel, therefore, that the European emissions market has become more ambitious in environmental terms with this report.
It is more effective economically, with lower risks of distortion of competition, and it is more compatible with other national policies currently in force.
I would like to conclude, then, by thanking the Council, and the Greek Presidency in particular, for its cooperation.
I would like to thank the Commission, whose arbitration between Council and Commission was exemplary.
Most of all, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, because I believe that without their cooperation and support, Parliament could not have remained united.
And without Parliament's unity, this agreement would not have been such a good one.
.
Mr President, at last we have a compromise package on the table and this is of huge importance to climate policy within the European Union and across the world.
Acceptance of this package in the vote tomorrow will enable a highly ambitious and innovative policy to come into force.
In addition, the pace at which this directive has been adopted enables the timetable to stay on track, meaning action will not be delayed.
Let me extend my personal thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Moreira Da Silva, who has worked tirelessly to reach a second reading agreement on this directive.
I know that this has not been an easy task, particularly since emissions trading has been a new subject for many - if not all - of us.
I congratulate him on this achievement and look forward to a successful conclusion tomorrow.
I also thank the shadow rapporteurs from the different groups, Mrs Corbett, Mr Davies, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, Mr de Roo, Mrs Lucas, Mr Blokland and Mr Nobilia, for their active support in finding an agreement.
Climate change is a core concern of the European Union and when we signed up to the Kyoto Protocol we knew that this commitment would have to be followed by solid action.
The emissions trading scheme is a centrepiece of that action and a strong signal of that commitment.
At the heart of the European climate change programme that the Commission has set up is the preparation of concrete proposals for action, several of which have already been adopted by this House.
As you know, our approach to climate change follows three tracks: a leading role internationally in establishing the framework for global action, emissions trading within the EU, as the most cost-effective way to cut emissions and, thirdly, specific sectoral measures to reduce emissions, for example by promoting renewables, increasing energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions from cars.
We need to take serious emission reduction measures inside the European Union if we are to be credible when we call for global action to fight global warming.
Therefore, the rest of the world will also eagerly anticipate Parliament's vote tomorrow on the compromise package.
The directive will signify a breakthrough for both climate change and emissions trading.
The scheme is not only multi-sectoral but also multinational: it will cover at least 25 countries, i.e. two thirds of those countries with obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.
The Commission awaits the vote in a position of wholly endorsing the compromise package.
It has the support of all Member States.
The European Parliament has achieved significant concessions from the Council in this compromise agreement, for example in the extension of auctioning to the first trading period and additional safeguards against the over-allocation of allowances.
Therefore, I ask Parliament to conclude tomorrow by not only accepting the compromise package but by accepting it with a resolute majority.
In this way the European Union will reaffirm its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and underline the need to deliver emission reductions in the fight against climate change.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have always been passionately in favour of voluntary agreements, and I accept that we lost them at first reading stage.
That is why I am every bit as happy as you are about this marvellous package that Mr Moreira da Silva has put on the table after the most enormously hard work - something that I can confirm to my own group.
I think we are on the right track.
The reason why the compromise is so important is that, if we do not adopt it tomorrow, we will not know for some considerable time what will emerge from the conciliation procedure.
Apart from that, I am quite certain that we will then waste another year, and that is precisely what we do not want.
This really is about how future generations will live, and, although I am very keen on conciliation procedures, we should dispense with one and give the Council a great opportunity to follow where we lead.
On this issue, the Olympic spirit is not enough; simply joining in is not on.
All the Member States must make the utmost effort; even today, we can already see that some of them are having problems with this 'trend-line'.
On that, Commissioner, I am again in agreement with you.
You must see to it that they all play their part.
Some will be able to do more than others; there is no doubt about that, but they must all join in, and then we will get the right result.
I am, however, again astonished at how, silently and overnight, other sectors have been dropped from this directive.
That was a first-class demonstration of the Member States' weakness and lack of courage when it came to developing an approach according to which both transport and personal house fires - such as we have in our own homes - would in future be covered by the Kyoto Protocol.
I would very much have liked that, but it presupposes very tough politicians - of which there do not seem to be that many in the Council.
I believe that we have made a good start by taking 1990 as the initial reference year, and I hope that, with joint implementation, and also with CDMs, we are on the right track.
Even though we have not yet precisely defined the package, I do believe that we will, tomorrow, adopt it by a large majority.
Many thanks, Mr Moreira da Silva.
Mr President, first of all, a word of thanks to Mr Moreira da Silva.
He has gone about his business with energy and tenacity.
An energetic step to achieve the Kyoto targets is now of major importance.
Uncertainty about Russian participation in Kyoto must not lead to paralysis.
Climate change has major economic and social consequences.
We must therefore take the steps to turn the tide now.
Pollution must now acquire a price and that is an important tool for the preservation of industry.
The PSE Group is in complete agreement with Mr Moreira da Silva's desire to reach an agreement in the second reading and appreciates all the efforts that have been made to this end.
Unfortunately, we have to say that it has also been at the expense of our democratic procedures.
Not all of the amendments have received an equal amount of attention in the negotiations with the Council.
It is particularly disappointing for the PSE Group that the amendment on closures for instance failed to reach the finish line.
There was very broad support for this amendment in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We saw in this amendment an important safeguard against improper closures.
Kyoto must not be allowed to be a reason for closing businesses or moving them to a different part of the world and then selling the emission rights.
This amendment was important for the employees in energy-intensive sectors.
We cannot skate over it too lightly.
Public support for a dynamic climate policy is sorely needed, because quite an effort is still going to be needed to achieve the Kyoto targets.
I call on the Council and the Commission in any event to take account of closures in the allocation plans.
In the event of closures the emission rights must be returned.
The PSE Group is entirely satisfied on other points.
We have always stressed that the system must also be fair and be experienced as fair.
This is why we do not want any ceiling that prejudices Member States that have expanded their industry in recent years.
We do however want a ceiling that slowly but surely brings Member States to reduce the emission of CO2.
Nor do we want Member States that made an early start on innovation to be disadvantaged.
That too is an important point for us.
And finally, we do not want any superfluous bureaucracy.
The allocation of emission rights is already complicated enough.
We must not make it even more complicated by adding an auction for 5% on top.
No one is served by an auction for 5% and in this way we would also tend to stimulate overallocation.
In short, we are very satisfied with the outcome across the board and on this we congratulate Mr Moreira da Silva once more.
We call for attention for the social implications of this directive and the PSE Group calls on the Member States to take this into account in the allocation plans.
Mr President, Parliament can point to some real gains from the deal negotiated with the Council to fast-track this legislation and avoid the conciliation procedure.
We can claim to enclose a number of possible loopholes.
Member States will not be allowed to issue allowances that exceed their previously agreed targets, and they must not use the Kyoto mechanisms to avoid taking action to reduce emissions domestically.
