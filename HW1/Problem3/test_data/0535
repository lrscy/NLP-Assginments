By contrast, it has questioned and reduced the funding of current posts at the Commission.
Parliament drafted a model here which was then enshrined in an agreement.
This model requires efforts to be made to frontload certain administrative expenses in 2002, so as to have funds available for Commission staff costs in order to prepare for enlargement.
That only works, however, if all the institutions consider the model binding.
I must therefore insist on the Commission's behalf that we take stock in October in order to ascertain whether this frontloading model is working or, if it is not, whether new decisions need to be taken.
Enlargement needs to be prepared so that it works right from the start.
The Commission is counting on the European Parliament, it is confident that the European Parliament will not state that it is satisfied with the resolution passed in July alone and will check to ensure the Council is also making an effort to implement this frontloading model.
I repeat, the Commission needs personnel resources in order to prepare for enlargement.
Otherwise we cannot guarantee that the work needed to make a success of enlargement will be carried out from the start.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, I welcome Mr Haarder and it is good to see him again in his new role.
He knows he is always welcome in this House.
Please send our regards to Mr Pedersen; it was good working with him.
I do not want to go into detail on many of the issues because I will leave that to both rapporteurs, who have mentioned several items.
I would like to concentrate on one or two specific political issues.
One concerns the agreement that was reached at conciliation on Category 5.
Whilst it left the Council very happy, we in Parliament realised that we had probably made an enemy of the Commission by agreeing to that deal.
But let me reiterate why we did so.
We were convinced that in no way, shape or form would the Council ever agree to the flexibility instrument being used for Category 5.
Therefore we agreed to a deal that would bring benefits for Parliament and the other institutions and a sensible approach to Category 5, not as the Commission wanted.
The things we have proposed about frontloading, the use of ramassage and so on are there to ease the pain of the Commission.
We know the Commission is going to suffer but we are trying to ease the situation slightly.
If there are problems with enlargement because of what has occurred, then the Commission needs to convince the Council, not us, of its needs regarding staffing levels, because some of us are actually convinced.
Having said that, we cannot be criticised for the help we have given the Commission in its staffing needs over the last two years.
Against the wishes of the Council, we have helped the Commission to increase its establishment plans by several hundred members of staff.
So any criticism can only apply to next year.
Please bear in mind that we have stood side by side with the Commission.
This is an attempt to make the reform a success and to ensure that the Commission has the right people to do the jobs that we expect it to do.
I say that because the deal was quite unique.
However, Mr Stenmarck and Mr FÃ€rm on our committee now have to determine what will constitute the global ramassage for this year.
That is the task of both our rapporteurs, certainly Mr Stenmarck, who will look at the other institutions to see what money there is left over in their budgets to be put into the pot to ensure that the Commission is not disadvantaged to any great extent.
We are aware that what we can find this year will be acceptable, but this leaves the problem of staffing next year, so whatever we can save for next year's budget we will.
My other political point concerns the common foreign and security policy.
The President-in-Office mentioned it in his speech.
Let us be clear on our position.
We did not make an agreement on what the amounts are for the CFSP.
The amount in this year's budget was EUR 30 million; the amount in the PDB was EUR 40 million and the amount entered in the Council's first reading is EUR 47.5 million.
We made no agreements on that and, as far as we are concerned, we stick by Article 39 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
That figure as it stands right now should be EUR 30 million.
That is not to say that, come our second reading, the figure may well be EUR 47.5 million but, for the sake of this debate and to clarify issues, our argument is that the Council put the wrong figure in: it should be EUR 30 million.
There may be a legal interpretation as to when that disagreement was confirmed but, as far as we are concerned, it was confirmed at the conciliation meeting.
Let us not forget that there are problems in other categories also.
In Category 2, the EUR 27 million entered for the restructuring of the fleet is not going to appear by magic.
We must be serious when we say we must find a way of solving that.
It would seem that the only way we can do so is by using the flexibility instrument.
The Council may have to have a rethink on that unless it comes forward with a better idea which we have not yet thought of.
That is all I want to say on the political aspects.
I will leave the rest to the rapporteurs.
Mr President, thank you ladies and gentlemen and, especially, a big thank-you to the Danish Presidency.
Just as Mr Wynn said, we really appreciated the constructive attitude we encountered at the July conciliation when, for the first time in many years, we in actual fact produced an agreement of genuine substance.
Why, then, did we come to this agreement where category 5 is concerned?
Mr Wynn touched upon this.
We were subjected to strong pressure from the Member States and the Council and finally decided to agree to the flexibility instrument's not being used.
There was one further reason, however, for we believe we must make the fullest possible use of all the available means for rationalising and prioritising what we do, moving resources about, increasing efficiency and creating modern management in the European Union too.
We must use the opportunities to the full, especially when we face so incredibly important a task as enlargement.
I nonetheless share the Commission's view when it comes to a rather longer perspective.
It would be difficult in the long term to impose a lot of major new tasks upon the Commission without also providing the necessary resources in terms of staff and administrative resources.
This will probably become a source of conflict in the future, but I believe it was necessary this year to do things in the way we have.
How does the general budget situation look prior to the autumn budget procedure?
Above all, we must discuss what Parliament has been calling attention to for quite a few years, namely the poor implementation in many areas.
Every year, the budget allocates major resources which are subsequently not used.
Mr Haarder drew attention to this July's agreement to the effect that we must not increase the payments more than is necessary, and he even wants us to leave margins.
The problem, however, is that, through the commitments made in the budget, we have also decided upon a certain level of ambition to which we must try to rise.
That must also be a goal for the Member States and the Council.
The finance ministers cannot just sit and applaud when they are given back money that has not been used.
We have a political responsibility actually to realise the ambitions and implement the programmes we have decided upon in the European Union.
That is why Parliament repeatedly increases the payments.
We wish to signal that more must be done, and we must invest greater resources in order actually to fulfil the promises made.
I believe that we shall be conducting a debate along these lines in Parliament this year too.
It is not, however, certain that it is enough just to increase the payments, and we have had certain examples of its not being so.
Sometimes, increased payments do not after all lead to the Commission's being able to use those resources.
As I have already mentioned, we must therefore discuss the Commission's staff resources in a slightly longer term perspective.
We must also perhaps begin to discuss cutting back on our commitments.
In certain areas, where we see the Commission not at all implementing what we have demanded, we must perhaps even begin to discuss whether we should cut down on staff or, at least, hold them in reserve.
In the long run, staff resources intended for commitments of a certain level cannot be maintained when such commitments are not being met.
This problem of payments and implementation also looms very large when it comes to foreign policy and aid policy.
Year after year, we have seen how the Council has acquired more ambitions.
In 2000, Kosovo was added to the list, and there was subsequently a slight loss of interest in fulfilling the earlier promises concerning Africa and Latin America.
In 2001, Serbia was the new concern, whereupon there was slightly less interest in the former priorities.
New concerns for 2002 included the Global Health Fund.
This year, we are discussing Afghanistan, the Middle East and the police force for Bosnia.
In fact, we cannot add new tasks every year and simply forget the old ones.
There is a limit beyond which further resources must be provided if all our priorities are to be met.
This year, we shall have a lot of difficulty meeting our priorities where the Global Health Fund is concerned.
There are already huge cut-backs in the budget in connection with Kosovo, humanitarian aid etc. That is unsustainable in the long term.
If new priorities are to be added each year, further resources must also be provided.
Allow me finally to say a few words about simplification.
We have studied Structural Funds and a series of different political programmes.
I have travelled around - most recently in Finland, for example - and learned that regional organisations and universities etc are giving up applying for funds from the EU budget because the process is so terribly involved.
That, I believe, is one reason why EU money is not in actual fact being spent.
It is time to take this state of affairs seriously.
Within the EU, we must sit down and go through our methods, documents and bureaucracy so that the process is made a little simpler for all those who need to use EU resources.
Mr President, I believe these are some of the most important aspects we shall be continuing to discuss in Parliament, in the Committee on Budgets and in future budget debates.
Mr President, allow me also to begin by thanking the Danish Presidency for its splendid cooperation so far.
Ever since early last winter, when we began work on the 2003 budget, my objective, as rapporteur and as a person responsible for next year's budgets for eight of the EU institutions, has at any rate been to find a solution in which the EU's administrative budget is balanced and in which we do not have to ask for extra money by making use of what is known as the flexibility instrument.
That has not been an easy task because we had predicted a very large deficit in this budget at the beginning of the year.
With the agreement made on 19 July by the EU's two budget authorities - the Council and Parliament - it has nonetheless proved to be possible.
I would maintain that our having now achieved this objective is a very great success for Parliament.
We have obtained support for reforms that are necessary, especially in an enlarged EU.
The flexibility instrument must not be used for the EU's administrative budget.
We must respect the ceiling for category 5.
Following the conciliation, there is now a common commitment to solve the remaining problems in category 5 by means of what is known as frontloading.
Doing so is important in that a number of problems remain to be solved during the last months of the year.
I am nonetheless convinced that we shall also be able to solve them.
In this context, it would be very easy to allow one's vision to be clouded by all the details, and the budget work is certainly extremely detailed.
Together, we have nonetheless created better basic conditions for proceeding further with the historic task of, in a few years' time, welcoming MEPs from perhaps ten new Member States to this Parliament and to the EU's other institutions.
As I see it, that is absolutely the most important outcome of the conciliation.
As early as the beginning of next year, these countries will be able to send observers to what will also become their own Parliament.
With the result of the agreement, we are complying not only with our commitments but also with the priorities decided upon by the Committee on Budgets and Parliament at the beginning of this year.
It is firstly a question of ensuring that the EU institutions are given the opportunity to prepare for enlargement.
Secondly, it is a question of implementing the necessary reforms.
Thirdly, the intention is that both objectives should be attained within the budgetary framework.
I want to direct my concluding comment concerning the agreement between Parliament and the Council to the Danish Presidency which, in my view, has worked in an extremely effective way and with the clearly defined objective of reaching an agreement.
The Danish Presidency has focused upon this task and been constructive and ready to compromise in a way that has made an agreement possible.
It has shown a readiness to listen that has not always been characteristic of the Council in this context.
I, and no doubt many others too, are grateful for this.
The Council has for a long time been criticised for not having always made the same demands of itself as of others.
The Council has not itself been prepared to implement the reductions forced upon others.
When the Council has cut back on jobs in other institutions, it has not cut back on jobs within the Council itself.
A rather more humble attitude may in actual fact be necessary in the future.
I hope and believe that, in this respect, the Danish Presidency has played a positive role which will have lasting effects in the future.
Thank you very much, Mr Stenmarck.
The debate is closed.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0257/2002).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Question No 35 by Francisca Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco (H-0541/02):
Subject: Specific immigration strand for the MEDA programme
Judging from the information furnished in connection with the interview between Commissioner Patten and Prime Minister Youssoufi of Morocco on 27 June, the European Commission is in no doubt as to the scale of the problem of illegal immigration.
Does the Commission propose to devote a specific strand of the MEDA programme to immigration?
Do any concrete projects exist in this respect?
Are there any projects devoted to women immigrants?
Mr President, the Commission pursues a global and balanced approach to immigration from Morocco.
Given the importance of the subject, migration is one of the five priorities of the country strategy paper covering the period 2002 to 2006 for financial cooperation with Morocco.
It is also covered by the Association Agreement between the EC and Morocco.
Our approach to migration is comprehensive.
Attention is paid both to legal and illegal migration and to the socio-economic dimension.
This comprehensive approach is also reflected in our MEDA programming.
Within this framework we will aim to help the Moroccan authorities to better organise legal migration.
A project to set up a migration centre is currently being prepared.
Morocco and the EC have also agreed to cooperate in preventing and combating illegal migration.
As a first step, a border management programme will help the Moroccan authorities to establish greater border security and to fight trafficking in human beings.
This programme, which is worth about EUR 40 million, will be committed in 2003.
Furthermore, we are addressing the socio-economic causes of migration, in particular in the northern provinces of Morocco, which account for about 35% of total emigration from that country.
This region also benefited from substantial MEDA funding and another EUR 70 million are programmed for socio-economic development in 2004.
The majority of the existing projects in the northern provinces help improve the economic situation of migrant as well as non-migrant women, in particular through basic education for girls in rural areas, maternal and child health services, promotion of productive activities for women and provision of basic infrastructures.
In addition to MEDA, the Commission is financing projects under the budget line 'cooperation with third countries in the area of migration'.
EUR 3.3 million have been committed for projects in Morocco, in particular in the areas of co-development, intergovernmental migration dialogue and the fight against illegal immigration.
Mr President, I simply wish to thank the Commissioner for the information he has given me and say to him that - in terms of the co-development he has mentioned, which could resolve the problem of immigration - I will be closely monitoring all these projects and programmes he has proposed throughout north Africa, including the north of Morocco, which I believe to be very important if we are to prevent emigration.
I should like to make three brief points in response to that.
Firstly, it is manifestly the case that one of the best ways of preventing illegal migration is by promoting economic and social development.
I have no doubt about that.
Secondly, Morocco and other countries face real problems, given that they are themselves the targets of illegal migration from the south and often find themselves the route through which illegal migrants pass on the way to Europe.
We must help them deal with that problem.
Thirdly, obviously it would help Morocco if we were to be able to move from informal discussions to formal negotiations about a readmission agreement.
We recognise that Morocco has some concerns, which we hope can be satisfied, so that we can move on to that sort of formal agreement as soon as reasonable.
We sympathise with the problems that Morocco has to face; we want to help Morocco deal with those economic and social problems, and we support the efforts it has made, not least in the area of gender.
Question No 36 by Emilia Franziska MÃŒller (H-0570/02):
Subject: Relaxation of the ban on using meat-and-bone meal in animal feedstuffs
What does the Commission intend to do to ensure that any remaining stocks of meat-and-bone meal do not re-enter the animal feedstuffs circuit and, hence, the human food chain?
What has the Commission done to date in order to have at its disposal at the earliest possible date validated and secure analytical procedures which could establish the presence of meat-and-bone meal in animal feedstuffs and the presence of risk material in meat-and-bone meal?
How will the Commission ensure that, should the ban on using meat-and-bone meal in animal feedstuffs be relaxed, every possible danger to consumers from any remaining stocks of meat-and-bone meal and from risk material in meat-and-bone meal will be excluded?
Mr President, the extended feed ban remains in force as a transitional measure until 30 June 2003. By that time, the feed ban should be reviewed.
The review will take into account the forthcoming animal by-products regulation, the correct practical implementation of measures to control the feed ban, evolving scientific evidence and the availability of control methods.
The Commission services are already carefully examining the potential impact of different options for revising the feed ban but it is too early to predict the outcome of that exercise.
The implementation of the feed ban in the Member States is being monitored systematically by regular inspections carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office.
The FVO reports highlight the considerable efforts made by Member States to implement the rules.
However, where any weaknesses are identified specific recommendations are made after each inspection to further improve the controls.
The Commission has on several occasions expressed its concerns about the safe transport, storage and destruction of meat-and-bone meal.
For this reason the adoption of the animal by-products regulation will be much welcomed.
It creates a legal framework for the safe disposal of meat-and-bone meal by incineration, burial or landfill.
It also lays down the rules for the safe use of meat-and-bone meal as fertiliser, in biogas production and in animal feeding.
At present, meat-and-bone meal can only be used in pet food or in feed for animals.
The new control framework created by the animal by-products regulation opens up the possibility of revising the present prohibition on the use of meat-and-bone meal.
The animal by-products regulation includes provisions on channelling and traceability which will ensure that the present stocks of meat-and-bone meal cannot fraudulently be reintroduced into the feed chain.
Specified risk materials must already be marked as soon as they are removed from the carcasses, stored separately and finally destroyed.
The Commission is co-financing a research programme with two main objectives: firstly, harmonisation of the feed ban controlled by classical microscopy as well as improving its efficiency and secondly the development and validation of new methods based on alternative techniques.
The Commission is following the results of this research programme as well as private initiatives in this field closely and will take the results into account when reviewing the feed ban.
Whatever the outcome of the revision of the feed ban may be, I can assure you that the Commission will not reauthorise the use of meat-and-bone meal in animal feed unless every possible risk to consumers and animals can be excluded and the provisions can be controlled properly.
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, your main argument for relaxing the feed ban is the cost of disposing of animal by-products.
Now that is more of an economic argument or an environmental protection argument.
To hear this argument from you, the Commissioner for consumer protection, comes to me as something of a shock.
Should we not be setting the cost of disposing of animal by-products against what it will cost European farmers if there is a renewed outbreak of BSE in their herds or - worse still - if people start falling ill?
If you could answer me that, I would be most grateful.
I still take the view that we need a total feed ban on meat and bonemeal at least until we can determine how infectious the prions responsible for the outbreak of BSE are and until we can define different types of bonemeal for each type of animal.
Only then will we be sure that the bonemeal in poultry feed, for example, does not come from poultry.
It is important that I make it absolutely clear that the primary consideration in the imposition of the ban on meat-and-bone meal is public health.
It is also the protection of animals, but essentially the scientific evidence available to us shows that the transmission of BSE disease to animals is through the consumption of meat-and-bone meal.
Ultimately that would put at risk humans eating the meat.
That is why we put legislation in place to remove this specified risk material from the food chain.
So there are two blocks.
The first is the question of meat-and-bone meal.
As I said, the fundamental consideration in putting in place the ban on meat-and-bone meal is public health and the protection of animals.
However, as you probably know, this is a controversial issue.
Some MEPs and others take the view that the ban is too extensive and should be revised.
I do not agree, because I believe that it is by no means clear from the tests undertaken and the research done at the instigation of the Commission in Member States, particularly the work being undertaken by the Food and Veterinary Office, that the controls in place in respect of meat-and-bone meal are sufficiently secure.
The need for these controls arises in circumstances where there might be a relaxation of the ban on meat-and-bone meal, but not for feeding to ruminants.
There can never be a relaxation of the ban on meat-and-bone meal for ruminants.
It might be relaxed for pigs and poultry, which cannot contract BSE and therefore the consumption of meat-and-bone meal is not a danger to them.
The problem is that if the rule on the feeding meat-and-bone meal to poultry, for instance, is relaxed, there is a risk that meat-and-bone meal intended to be fed to poultry or pigs might ultimately reach ruminants, creating the very danger that we are trying to obviate.
Therefore I do not see the ban on meat-and-bone meal being relaxed in the short term.
However, this can be reviewed in the context of the TSE regulation, in particular Chapter 4, where an amendment can be made by comitology.
I indicated to Parliament when discussing the TSE regulation on a previous occasion that, although this amendment can take place by comitology, I have given an undertaking that I will come back to Parliament and, even though it is not strictly required under the legislation, discuss with Parliament what is the best way forward.
I want to make it absolutely clear to Mrs MÃŒller that cost is not the consideration.
I am sorry if you have been led to that conclusion because I have not made myself clear.
The primary considerations are the protection of animals and public health and the ban can never be relaxed for the purposes I have identified unless we can be absolutely sure that the controls in place in Member States do not create the risk instead of obviating it.
Question No 37 by David Robert Bowe (H-0583/02):
Subject: Crohn's Disease
As the number of incidents of Crohn's disease increases, does the Commission support a recommendation that all pasteurised milk products in the Union require a minimum of 25 seconds of pasteurisation in order to decrease the risks of bacterium MAP which is thought to be a triggering factor for Crohn's disease?
And if the Commission does not support this recommendation, why not?
The current EC legislation lays down a minimum of 71.7 degrees centigrade for 15 seconds for the pasteurisation of drinking milk and/or pasteurised milk products.
This combination is known to be effective for foot-and-mouth disease and other known animal health, public health and zoonosis risks.
However, Directive 92/46/EEC allows any equivalent pasteurisation time/temperature combination, provided it offers the same level of food safety.
The issue of possible links between Crohn's disease and paratuberculosis was reviewed by the Scientific Committee of Animal Health and Animal Welfare in its report adopted on 21 March 2000.
It concluded that insufficient data were available to determine epidemiological links between both diseases and no specific time/temperature combination for pasteurisation of milk which would inactivate the agent of paratuberculosis was recommended.
The scientific data available to the Commission indicate that no precise time/temperature treatment has been identified which would completely destroy MAP in milk.
In addition, the Commission has funded a project, SACROHN - improvement of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease, which commenced on 1 October 2000.
The total cost of the project is EUR 3 million.
The Community contribution is EUR 1 639 151.
The project duration is 36 months.
It is funded by the Life Quality Control of Infectious Diseases programme.
No concrete results are available from that source to confirm any link between MAP and Crohn's disease.
However the consortium is heavily involved in developing new detection methods based on new molecular technologies and culture techniques.
Such technologies are being used by the research consortia to facilitate the detection of MAP in milk and intestinal biopsies of Crohn's disease patients.
Efforts are also focused on using molecular typing techniques to establish any possible links between ruminant sources of MAP and the aetiology of Crohn's disease.
The project continues until October 2003.
Results will be made available at regular intervals.
More information can be found on the website.
In the event of new scientific data coming to light, the Commission would of course be prepared to take any necessary measures in response.
I should like to thank Mr Byrne for his very comprehensive and thoughtful reply.
This is an important issue, which is affecting more and more people.
It is a chronic health issue and has considerable effects on the quality of life of those who acquire this disease.
There is increasing evidence - though I agree, for the moment at least, with Commissioner Byrne that it is not conclusive - that there is a link between the presence of these bacteria in pasteurised milk and the incidence of Crohn's disease.
I would ask the Commission to consider all the evidence, when the studies are completed, and perhaps hold a seminar or a wider discussion on what measures might be taken, as this is a disease which is increasingly of concern and it is spreading.
The most obvious step would be for the Commission to extend the period of pasteurisation from 15 seconds at the appropriate temperature to 25 seconds.
This may be the most simple and effective method.
I wonder whether the Commission would agree that those steps might be taken at the end of the studies?
I am sure Mr Bowe will remember that previous discussions on these issues always centred around the need to have sound scientific evidence to enable us to justify decisions that are taken here and, in particular, to justify legislation requiring compliance.
As I have indicated in my previous statement, the project that is being undertaken at the moment will continue until 2003.
It is quite clear from this that the issue is being kept under review and scientific evaluation is continuing.
Ultimately a report will be published and then will be the time to consider what further action can be taken.
The issue that Mr Bowe puts his finger on - the question of temperature - will obviously be seriously considered, but we should await the scientists' advice.
However, it will be possible to look at the matter again at that time.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We are now going to start the second part of this Question Time.
You know that we dedicate twenty minutes to each Commissioner.
The more we speak on each question, the fewer questions can be put and the fewer answers given.
There is a very well established relationship here.
Part two
Questions to Mr Bolkestein
Question No 38 by Bart Staes (H-0525/02):
Subject: Refinement of the rules governing motor-vehicle insurance in the internal market
In early June, Commissioner Bolkestein presented a proposal for a directive designed to refine the four existing directives relating to motor-vehicle insurance.
As a result of the previous directives, and in response to repeated calls from the Commissioner with special responsibility for the internal market, what is known as the 'bonus-malus' system was abolished in Belgium.
That also spelt the end of the agreements on premiums concluded among the various Belgian insurers.
The possibility of being able freely to determine premiums undoubtedly constitutes good news for good drivers.
On the other hand, this will also increase rather than decrease the serious tensions caused by fragmentation.
The result thereof is the likelihood that we shall find more and more uninsured vehicles on our roads.
Will the Commission take into account that adverse effect during the further stages in the drafting of this proposal for a directive, or will it conversely authorise the Member States to take whatever steps they deem necessary to prevent any undesirable effects on premiums caused by fragmentation?
As the honourable Member is aware, the principle of contract freedom applies to companies offering financial services.
In the field of insurance, the Third Non-life Insurance Directive put an end to the system of prior or systematic government approval of tariffs and pricing policy.
Compulsory no-claims bonus systems violate the principle enshrined in the directives.
I believe that free trade in insurance products is in the interests of the vast majority of motorists, as this allows them to choose insurance companies that reward good drivers with lower premiums.
Turning to the question raised by the honourable Member in connection with the possible increase in the number of uninsured vehicles, I should like to draw your attention to Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the First Motor Insurance Directive.
That article states that all motor vehicles in the Community are required to have statutory liability insurance.
It is up to the national authorities to ensure that this obligation is respected.
The Commission's recent proposal for a Fifth Motor Insurance Directive, to which the honourable Member refers, does not alter this provision.
This new proposal, the Fifth Directive, does not infringe the fundamental principle of tariff freedom.
Its main purpose is to revise the four existing directives on motor insurance.
The main objectives are to update and improve the framework of compulsory insurance to protect the victims of car accidents, to plug gaps and to clarify some of the provisions in the directives.
The Commission is doing everything it can to improve the efficiency of the internal market for insurance.
Its plans are set out in the Plan of Action for Financial Services.
The Commission is convinced that greater competition will lead to lower prices and a wider choice of products for the consumer.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Staes for complimenting me on the quality of my Dutch.
It would indeed be strange, Mr President, if I could not speak my own language well.
Secondly, I should like to make the point that the very function of competition is to ensure that prices are as keen as possible.
On the one hand this rewards good drivers in the form of low premiums, which Mr Staes seems to welcome, while on the other hand it makes bad drivers pay for their own errors.
No one other than the person who causes damage should have to pay for it.
Then competition between individual insurance companies should ensure that the rates everyone pays are in line with the insurance products market, and this has nothing at all to do with the Commission.
If the Commission were to do as Mr Staes requests, it would eventually encroach on the powers and responsibilities of the private sector, which it not at all its proper role.
Question No 39 by Michl Ebner (H-0549/02):
Subject: Derogations from the rules on competition for pilot projects
The operating concession for the A22 Brenner motorway between Modena and the Brenner Pass has not yet been granted by the Italian authorities, apparently because of reservations expressed by the Commission.
If, instead of concentrating on the measures generally required to combat distortion of competition, the Commission - and, in particular, the Commissioner with special responsibility for competition issues - were to study this matter in greater depth, it would become clear that a pilot project is involved here and not the normal granting of an operating concession.
Is it not therefore imaginable, and would it not be in the EU's best interests in a sensitive area, for a pilot project, which would be limited in time to the duration of the operating concession and whereby some of the revenue generated from motorway tolls would be used for the upgrading of the railway line, to be promoted and supported rather than hampered on the grounds that it might distort competition?
Mr President, the fact that this is a pilot project, as was rightly said, does not prevent the general rules on concessions from applying.
Indeed, the doubts which my services and I raised on the subject of the aforementioned project concern exclusively the extension up to 2035 of the motorway concession for the Brenner in the absence of any competition.
The Italian authorities themselves have recently taken a similar position while committing themselves to proposing solutions which could at the same time meet the requirements for development of the project and the need to comply with Community law.
With the aim of not disrupting the implementation of this project, the competent authorities and my services are in close contact in order to find an appropriate solution.
Mr President, Commissioner, this pilot project affects three countries, Germany, Austria and Italy and operates in a sensitive zone through the ancient Hauptkamm, where the Brenner motorway operators on the south side of the Brenner pass and now the equivalent organisation on the north side of the Brenner pass want to use the road to subsidise the railways, so as to prevent ecological damage and set up a pilot project.
But the project needs to run until 2035. 2005 is not long enough, i.e. the Italian concession needs to be extended by thirty years.
The Italian Government sent a message of support through Minister Buttiglione, until recently a Member of this House, and it is to be hoped that this pilot project, which could set an example and which your colleague, the Commissioner for transport, thinks is a positive move, will be seen as such and an exception will be granted.
Though I have heard you make positive points I have not heard you say you are in complete agreement.
Could you perhaps comment on that?
I have discussed this matter on various occasions with Minister Buttiglione and also with some Members of this Parliament.
May I add that this concerns an extension for quite a long time - about 33 years - and thus this project falls under the rules of public procurement and thus competition must play a role in the award of the contracts.
After all, competition means that prices will be lower than would otherwise have been the case and also that advantages will accrue to, I assume, the Italian public or at least the Italian State and therefore indirectly to the Italian public.
Therefore we should all be in favour of more competition in the award of such immense contracts.
The fact that there is a possible cross-subsidisation in favour of rail transport is an aspect which is perfectly defensible.
Therefore, when the terms of the contract that is to be awarded are framed and formulated, that condition will have to be included in the contract to be awarded.
Anybody who wants to obtain that contract will have to satisfy that condition.
There is nothing wrong with that.
The Commission firmly believes that public contracts must be awarded subject to the rules on public procurements and they basically amount to the fact that competition must be allowed.
Otherwise we open the door again to awarding contracts in an underhanded fashion and it will be the public who will suffer.
I am sure no one in this House wants that and, therefore, the Commission is right to follow this line.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I agree with the Commissioner; obviously, the routes across the Alps are in competition with one another.
But, as we all know, these routes are in a highly sensitive zone.
If one motorway company has saved money over a number of years in order to be able to offer a better solution, then my question is, why can we not leave it to the motorway companies to decide if they wish to offer technical alternatives in order to improve traffic across the Alps?
I would be interested to know what you think about this and whether we should leave it to the companies involved to decide the technical alternatives.
Mr President, the Commission does not have the knowledge to enter into the details of any public contract and moreover that is not part of the Commission's role or responsibility.
We must leave it to the awarding authority, which it is assumed is the Italian State or part of the Italian State, perhaps provincial authorities, to formulate a contract.
The Commission's only responsibility is to see to it that, whatever the nature of the contract, whatever it may say about, for instance, new technical solutions or cross-subsidisation, competition is allowed and other economic actors have the chance to bid for the contract.
If the present contractor were allowed to continue his concession until the year 2035, there would be no competition and that would damage the true interests of the Italian people.
Mr President, I am very pleased to inform the House that a particularly important personage, not just for Italy but for Europe as a whole, is in the public gallery: the national chairman of the Italian association of persons incapacitated or injured as a result of accidents at work, who are calling upon Europe to provide security, preventive measures and rehabilitation and to ensure that structural obstacles are removed.
This morning, we had a meeting with Mr Medina Ortega and other Members, Vice-President PodestÃ  and President Cox.
I hope that their presence will lead us all to reflect seriously on the matter.
Mr Ferri, although I hope your point of order does not serve as a precedent for other speeches, I would reiterate your greeting on behalf of the whole of Parliament.
President.
Mr Ebner, you know that the question cannot be put again, but, since it is a point of order, I would ask you to be brief.
Mr President, I thought we were allowed two supplementary questions?
Mr RÃŒbig has asked one.
We are not.
Thank you.
Not even an explanation as to whether or not I am satisfied with what the Commissioner had to say?
No, since you are asking me, I suspect that you are not entirely happy, but in any event you still have the opportunity to speak to the Commissioner in the corridor.
Fine.
Thank you, Mr President.
I am not satisfied with what the Commissioner had to say.
Question No 40 by Paul RÃŒbig (H-0579/02):
Subject: Non-recognition of European standards relating to solar thermal collectors and systems
Uniform European standards for the testing of solar thermal products have been in force for about a year now.
For solar thermal collectors and systems manufactured in other countries to benefit from public solar energy subsidies in France and Spain, they must be tested for compliance with the respective national standards and verification procedures, despite their having already been certified in accordance with European standards.
The national verification procedures are not exactly in line with the European standards.
What is more, such double verification involves significant costs and bureaucratic obstacles and requires additional time.
Verification certificates issued by accredited institutes in other EU Member States are not recognised.
That makes market entry considerably more difficult, and undertakings in other EU Member States are put at a considerable competitive disadvantage vis-Ã -vis domestic manufacturers.
What is the Commission's opinion of the situation outlined above, and what will it do to remedy it?
The Commission would like to stress that solar thermal collectors and systems are not regulated at Community level.
The EN standards applying to these products are voluntary standards.
Any national regulations that require compliance with national standards and testing procedures if subsidies are to be granted must be assessed in the light of Articles 28-30 of the Treaty.
It follows from these articles, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, that the principle of mutual recognition applies not only to technical manufacturing specifications, but also to any testing procedures to which products may have been subjected in another Member State of the European Union or in a state that is a signatory to the agreement on the European Economic Area.
This principle also applies to any certificates issued for products following these testing procedures.
Here I refer to the judgment of 17 December 1981, concerning biological products.
There is another judgment dated 28 January 1986 concerning type approval for woodworking machines.
Then there is the judgment of 11 May 1989 known as the Bouchara judgment.
The jurisprudence is consistent and clear.
This means that Member States may not needlessly require technical or chemical analyses or tests if the same analyses or tests have already been carried out in another Member State and the results are available or may be obtained on demand.
On the basis of the information which the honourable Member has provided, the Commission will launch an enquiry into this matter and, if necessary, will initiate proceedings against the states in question under Article 226 of the Treaty.
Should an infringement be established, the Commission would also examine what conclusions should be drawn in the light of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I think making the principle of mutual recognition our focal point in Europe sets a good example.
I thank the Commissioner for his clear analysis and for clarifying the intention of the Commission, in its capacity as Executive, to really assert itself here and help this principle gain acceptance.
During the course of harmonisation, we do of course come up against limits which people are not always willing to accept.
We have also spent a great deal of time discussing test marks issued by independent certified institutes which test products.
Is there pan-European recognition for products tested in one country?
Are these test marks recognised as such in other countries?
If they were, that would increase the safety of products considerably in the future.
Does the Commission have plans for any initiatives here?
I hear that Mr RÃŒbig is pleased with the attitude of the Commission.
That is a good thing.
Once again, the essence of this problem is mutual recognition.
The jurisprudence is completely clear and consistent.
The Commission will initiate an investigation of these cases which have been brought to its attention by Mr RÃŒbig.
If necessary, the Commission will initiate proceedings.
Since the time allotted to questions to the Commissioner has elapsed, Questions Nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing.
If anybody has a point of order, they can put it.
Do you have a point of order, Mr Savary?
Mr President, I am sorry not to be able to ask this question, as Mrs BÃ©rÃšs asked me to put it very directly to Commissioner Bolkestein.
With regret, however, I accept the constraints of the Rules of Procedure.
Yes, and lack of time.
The twenty minutes for the Commissioner have passed and we have no option but to move on to the questions for Mr Verheugen.
Questions to Mr Verheugen
Question No 43 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0537/02):
Subject: Cyprus - expiry of the deadline for a political solution to the problem
In June 2002 the deadline that had been set for a political solution to the Cyprus problem, to be achieved by means of talks between the two Cyprus communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the UN, expired without producing a result, because of Turkish intransigence.
Could the Commission assess any results attained by the talks so far?
Could it outline the next steps leading up to the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, together with the nine other applicant countries?
Mr President, since direct talks began on 16 January 2002, the leaders of both communities have tabled proposals on the four core issues.
However, the parties have been unable to broker a comprehensive solution in keeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions.
As the direct talks are confidential, the Commission is unable to evaluate the results and has to rely on regular evaluations carried out by the United Nations Security Council.
The talks have reached a watershed now that the parties' self-imposed deadline of the end of June 2002 has passed.
Accession negotiations with Cyprus are proceeding as planned.
The Commission will be tabling its regular reports on 16 October of this year.
They will contain a detailed analysis of what progress the candidate countries have made in meeting the accession criteria and will be the basis for the Commission's recommendations on the countries which meet all the accession criteria.
These recommendations and any outstanding issues arising out of the negotiations will be examined at the European Council in Brussels at the end of October this year and accession negotiations should be concluded on the basis of these recommendations before the European Council in Copenhagen in December 2002.
Accession agreements should be signed in the spring of 2003 and ratified by the national parliaments in the following months.
Before accession agreements are signed, the Council will decide on the accession of the candidate countries after consulting the Commission and after receiving the assent of the European Parliament, as required under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union.
I thank the Commissioner for his reply and the stand which he has taken on this matter.
I should merely like to point out that, with the Commission reports just a few weeks away and enlargement just a few months away, this huge question mark still hangs over the Republic of Cyprus.
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm to us that, while the European Union and the Commission will support every effort to find a political solution, the main stumbling block to which, as we all know, is the intransigence of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot side, the Republic of Cyprus will not be barred from the first wave of new countries to join the European Union if no solution can be found.
I agree with the honourable Member that time is now of the essence and that it is most regrettable that no decisive progress has yet been reached on the Cyprus question.
The honourable Member is also right in stating that the European Union is doing everything in its power to help bring about a solution and it shall continue to do so in the future.
We shall endeavour to reach a solution right up to the last day.
It is very difficult to answer your question about the attitude of the Turkish Government, especially now the political climate has changed in Turkey.
I shall be speaking to the Turkish Foreign Minister this week and perhaps then I shall have a better idea as to whether we can expect a decisive and constructive attitude from the Turkish side in the time ahead.
For the moment, all I can say is that I am no more able than you to predict how Turkey will act on this question, but I should like to take this opportunity once again to make an urgent appeal to Turkey to recognise that it is the Turkish Cypriots who stand to suffer if no solution can be found to the Cyprus question.
They stand to gain the most from a political solution and the accession of Cyprus.
But they stand to lose the most if no political solution can be found.
I am sorry, Commissioner, but your replies do not add anything new.
We all know that cross-community talks have reached an impasse and that the prospect of finding a way out of it by December are slim, to say the least.
I should like to put two questions to you.
First, as things stand, there is a clear danger that the island will be divided or partitioned and that, unfortunately, would prove that the Communist Party of Greece was right to predict that moves to integrate Cyprus into the European Union would have precisely that result.
The question is, first, has the Commission considered that possibility and what plans has it made to forestall it.
And secondly, we all know that Turkey holds the key to the Cyprus problem.
The impression we get is that the Commission and the Council, the European Union in general, has not explored every feasible way of exerting pressure on Turkey.
You referred, of course, to the repercussions which Turkey's stand will have, but I have a feeling that the Council and the Commission could turn up the pressure.
The question is whether anyone is actually willing to exert that sort of pressure.
I would say to the honourable Member that my reading of the situation is slightly different from yours.
I agree that I have said nothing new.
But that is because there is nothing new to report.
Which is something we both regret.
Responsibility for the political process, i.e. the process which should resolve the whole problem of the future, lies with the United Nations.
Neither the Council nor the Commission nor the European Parliament has any competence in this matter.
You should be very careful not to undermine the authority of the United Nations here.
Which is why it is the established policy of the European Union - and that applies to everyone, Council, Parliament and Commission - to support the efforts of the United Nations with every means at our disposal.
The most important instrument which we can give the United Nations and which we have given them is the accession process.
The fact that it has come to direct talks at all is only because Cyprus has accession prospects and because the Turkish side now understands that the European Union intends to keep to its enlargement timetable.
So I think that the best way of exerting pressure on Turkey - and believe me we shall do so - is to ensure that it knows that the enlargement timetable is non-negotiable.
Question No 44 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (H-0574/02):
Subject: Cyprus and accession negotiations
What is the Commission's view of the progress of negotiations on the accession of Cyprus, and how might the inter-community dialogue on the Cyprus issue influence them?
My dear Sir, Cyprus is at an advanced stage of accession negotiations.
Of the 31 chapters, 28 have been provisionally closed.
No more can be done at this stage of the proceedings.
As far as discussions with the aim of finding a political settlement under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General are concerned, I have just expressed full support for this process, as has the EU on numerous occasions.
As for the question as to how the dialogue between the two ethnic groups may affect accession negotiations, the Commission's approach is dictated by the conclusions of the European Councils in Helsinki in 1999 and in Seville in 2002.
The Union has stated that it wishes a united island to accede.
However, it has also pointed out that a political solution is not a sine qua non to the accession of Cyprus to the Union, if the Cyprus question has not been settled by the time negotiations come to an end.
The decision will be taken by the Council, taking account of all the relevant factors.
There is still a chance that we shall achieve our objective of political solution before accession, which is why the European Council has called on the leaders of both ethnic groups to step up the talks.
If a political solution is reached, the accession agreement will reflect the agreement reached.
As the European Council in Seville recently declared, the European Union is prepared to include the terms of a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus question in the accession agreement.
We have emphasised that we feel that Cyprus should be able to speak with one voice and that Cyprus needs to be able to apply Community law throughout the island.
If a settlement is reached and Cyprus accedes as a united country, the European Union is prepared to make a huge financial contribution towards the rapid development of the northern part of the island in the run up to accession.
Commissioner, I think that the European Commission really has taken a constructive and positive approach to the integration of Cyprus and the resolution of the Cyprus problem and I welcome that.
I merely wished to ask you this: will you be making your own recommendation to the Council on the integration of the candidate countries during October.
You said that Cyprus has made substantial progress.
I think everyone recognises the fact that the Greek Cypriot side has come to the talks in good faith, but there is a possibility that the talks will fail for reasons which have nothing to do with the Greek Cypriot side.
I should like the Commission to make quite clear what its recommendation will be should that happen.
By which I mean, if cross-community talks fail, how will this affect Cyprus's integration prospects?
That is my question.
Mr President, Mr Hatzidakis, you are quite right.
The Commission will table a report on 16 October containing its appraisal of whether the candidate countries with which we are currently engaged in negotiations are ready to accede.
As you know, ten countries have been named, including Cyprus, with which we hope to complete negotiations by the end of this year.
The Commission will then state on 16 October whether or not this judgment still applies.
Naturally, this will include a clear statement on Cyprus by the Commission.
Question No 45 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0538/02):
Subject: Enlargement, women and fundamentalism
With regard to the enlargement countries and with a view to averting situations where religious organisations encroach upon areas that are the competence of the public authorities, what measures will the Commission apply to prevent human rights being restricted as a result of pressure from fundamentalists and to ensure that women can exercise their rights freely?
Mr President, as the honourable Member knows, meeting the Copenhagen political criteria is the sine qua non not just for concluding but even for starting accession negotiations, which is why no country can join the European Union unless it meets all the political criteria.
The question which you have put refers to religious organisations which you, Madam, say are usurping powers which belong to the state or that there is a danger that they will do so and that, as a result, the human rights of women in candidate countries might be restricted.
The Commission takes the view that future Member States have achieved a good level of democratic stability and that human rights, and that includes religious freedom, are respected in future Member States.
Religious freedom is guaranteed in all future Member States, meaning that religious communities do of course have the right to take part in social debate in their countries.
That is perfectly normal and it happens in every Member State.
Religious communities are part of civil society and, like every other social organisation, they are entitled to take part in social debate. In some countries to a greater degree and in some countries to a lesser degree.
Governments, the state authorities, are required to watch very closely to ensure that social groups do not exercise powers to which they are not entitled and which, for example, might have an adverse impact on fundamental rights.
In theory, as far as equal opportunities for women are concerned, we have made considerable progress from a legislative and institutional point of view in all future Member States, but obviously more needs to be done to foster economic and social equality for women.
But that does not just apply to future Member States; it also applies to the majority of current Member States.
We cannot say that all the deficits have already been rectified, which is why the Commission will of course continue to monitor developments closely in this area and will include an up-to-date appraisal of the situation in the report which I have already mentioned and which is due to be published in October 2002.
Mr President, has the Commission ascertained on which issues and in which countries these invasions of the public sphere by ecclesiastical powers are taking place?
Secondly, I would also like to ask the Commissioner whether he would be prepared to schedule information campaigns to increase awareness of the advantages and benefits of the Community acquis for women.
I have also heard references, Commissioner, to the existence in certain Parliaments of departments in which ecclesiastical powers carry out controls and monitoring of the activities of parliamentarians.
I would be grateful if this could be verified.
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, no knowledge such as you have just described has come to the Commission's attention.
I would therefore be most grateful if you would let me have a copy of the information which you obviously have at your disposal.
However, I must reiterate that the Commission does not consider it unacceptable interference for religious communities to join in political debate as part of civil society.
I know of no cases in which human rights are being violated as a result of action by religious communities.
If you have specific examples of this, we shall of course be glad to look into them.
As far as the information campaign is concerned, I can confirm that we are conducting such campaigns, especially on the subject of equality for women.
It is part of the communication strategy which we are implementing together with Parliament in order to make citizens in future Member States aware of all aspects of future Community law, especially human rights and the rights of individuals and groups.
Question No 46 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0543/02):
Subject: Future accession treaties for new Member States
It is possible that the Irish electorate will vote against the Treaty of Nice for a second time, which would also render the new breakdown of votes on the Council and seats in Parliament under that Treaty null and void.
Would it not then be possible for the Union to act as it did at the time of the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria, i.e. negotiate and reach agreement with each of the applicant countries separately on seats in Parliament and votes in the Council in the treaty of accession?
The Treaty of Nice would not then be needed as a basis for the accession of new Member States.
Is this not an appropriate procedure to use for the enlargement of the Union should the Irish people vote against the Treaty of Nice once again?
Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission sees no point in speculating on what will happen in the hypothetical event that the Treaty of Nice is not ratified.
As you know, bringing about the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is the common aim of the European institutions, as the European Council made perfectly clear recently in Seville in June 2002.
The Treaty needs to be ratified because, otherwise, it will be very hard to conclude the enlargement process by the planned dates.
The Commission would remind the House that the European Council in Seville in June 2002 welcomed the Irish Government's determination to get the Treaty of Nice ratified in Ireland.
This issue was aired this weekend at the meeting of foreign ministers in Denmark, the main item on the agenda of which was enlargement.
The Member States and the Commission again agreed that we should not interfere in the opinion-forming exercise in Ireland by making statements about what we would do if the second referendum again had a 'no' majority.
Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, I note that I was not really given an answer to the question asked because it was of a hypothetical and speculative nature.
At the same time, it is, anyway, surely the case that those who think in political terms must always think of different possible scenarios.
We are not, moreover, concerned here with the distant future but with something that will take place quite soon and that will have a major effect on the development of Europe as a whole.
It therefore surprises me that the Commission really is not thinking rather more about alternative courses and reflecting upon what might happen if the Irish people were to vote 'no' once again.
I am certain that the Commission must be thinking along such lines.
I also believe that this is a question of practical importance.
If the Irish people vote 'no', that cannot be allowed to be decisive for the whole EU.
There must be a practical solution.
In my question, I pointed out that Finland, Sweden and Austria in actual fact negotiated their way to a practical solution to the problems before these countries were Member States.
The same method could no doubt be adopted with the new candidate countries.
Might that not after all be a possibility, legally and practically?
Mr Schmid, once again please read my lips. There is no plan B and we are expressly prohibited from engaging in this sort of deliberation.
It is perfectly straightforward. If I were to say here and now that the Commission is considering an alternative or that the Commission has an alternative, before we knew it Irish voters would be asking, what is the alternative?
We should very much like to know what it is because then we might not need to ratify the Treaty of Nice at all.
So if we say there is an alternative, then all we are doing is making sure the Treaty will never be ratified.
And we do have a reason for insisting on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice because, not only does it contain the technical requirements for concluding enlargement negotiations in the institutional section, it also contains political requirements for concluding the enlargement process which are indispensable to a whole series of Member States.
The reason why we did not opt for the simple procedure in this enlargement round and simply write the institutional rules into the accession agreements was that most Member States felt that both institutional and political changes were needed before this very radical change in the nature and state of the European Union.
These changes are enshrined in the Treaty of Nice and I advise you to take account of them.
For a whole series of Member States, the Treaty of Nice has to be taken in its entirety.
The seemingly convenient alternative, whereby if there is no Treaty, then we simply lift out the institutional sections and write them into the enlargement agreements, is unacceptable to a whole series of Member States and, as far as I am aware, to the majority in the European Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are completely out of time for questions to Mr Verheugen.
In any event, various Members have raised supplementary questions and I am going to give the floor in chronological order.
First Mr Crowley and then Mr SeppÃ€nen.
Mrs McKenna, I am very sorry, but you are neither the first nor the second to have asked.
Do you have some special right and can you explain it to me?
Mr President, on a point of order.
This issue relates to the Irish referendum.
I indicated that quite clearly, so it would be extremely unfair to discuss the Irish referendum and not to allow speakers to put both sides of the argument on this issue.
On this occasion it is crucial.
I must be very brief: you must realise, Mrs McKenna - and I would ask you to be reasonable, as I intend to be - that we have Rules of Procedure for Question Time, and we are allowed two supplementary questions.
This is not a debate on the Irish referendum.
If you propose a debate in plenary session we will probably have one.
They are two supplementary questions, and not for or against.
I have the Rules of Procedure in front of me and furthermore we all know them very well.
The first supplementary question is for Mr Crowley, and I do not know whether he is for or against.
I know that he asked to put a question.
If Mr SeppÃ€nen will allow you to speak in place of him, then that is another issue, but he has the right to speak.
Mr Crowley has the floor.
I just want to ask Commissioner Verheugen whether he could reaffirm what I believe he said through the interpretation: that it is absolutely necessary for enlargement to be completed under this process, that the Treaty of Nice will have to be ratified by Ireland.
A yes or no answer will do.
Yes, it is absolutely necessary for the Treaty to be ratified by all the Member States.
Since Mr SeppÃ€nen has very kindly given up the floor, Mrs McKenna has the floor.
Commissioner, I am very interested in what you said.
You said, first of all, that you should not get involved in telling people what you will do if the Irish people vote against and that, if there was an alternative, the Irish people would want to know what that alternative was.
So you are saying you would keep the Irish people in the dark and bully them into voting 'yes'.
It is interesting to hear the Commission say that they should not get involved.
We have already had Commissioners such as Patten, Byrne and others telling the Irish people they must vote 'yes'.
Mr Prodi said that the Treaty of Nice is not legally necessary for enlargement.
Giscard d'Estaing said the same thing and that if the Irish people vote 'no' other solutions will be found.
But really the strategy here is to pretend that there is no alternative and to try to force the Irish people into saying 'yes' to something they have already said 'no' to.
As you said yourself, you do not want to propose alternatives because you do not want the Irish people to ask what those alternatives are.
How democratic is that?
My dear Madam, it seems to me that you are trying to draw something out of me for political reasons which is not there to be drawn.
I repeat, the Commission knows of no legal or political alternative to the Treaty of Nice.
As the time allocated to the Commissioner is at an end, Question No 47 will be answered in writing.
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
Mr President, the June European Council in Seville was particularly important to the debate on combating illegal immigration, establishing deadlines for the implementation of the most significant operational measures in this fight laid down in the global plan proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 February 2002.
Of particular importance to the Canary Islands is the recent effort made to contain illegal immigration by sea.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council asked the Commission to undertake a viability study on this matter, in order to work out how to improve monitoring of the European Union's maritime borders.
The main objective of this study will be to provide an exhaustive analysis of the legislative and/or operational measures to adopt.
The results of the study will be available at the beginning of 2003.
It should also be pointed out that the Community is supporting various projects in third countries, intended to combat illegal immigration.
Of particular interest to the Canary Islands is the major programme designed to assist the Moroccan authorities in better controlling their maritime borders on both the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts.
The Community has contributed EUR 40 million of funding to this objective, to which the Moroccan authorities will add a further amount.
It should, furthermore, be mentioned that the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 13 June approved an integrated approach in this field, which means that all the relevant instruments of the European Union's external relations structure will be used.
It has been decided to implement a series of operational measures, including systematic cooperation and joint investigation teams to fight against organised trafficking and contraband networks.
The Danish Presidency attaches particular importance to progress in the field of illegal immigration with regard to relations with third countries and to repatriation policy.
This will certainly help to speed up the implementation of future measures in this area.
Mr President, I am aware of the efforts being made by Mr Vitorino to achieve concrete measures for the control of illegal immigration throughout the European Union and especially in these outermost regions such as the Canary Islands.
The problem is that the situation is deteriorating, it is getting worse all the time, and an increasing number of immigrants are entering our regions.
And not only are they entering illegally by sea on boats, but they are also coming by air, in other words, many immigrants are coming to our region from other countries without any control whatsoever.
I have taken note of his observations.
He referred to Morocco, but he said absolutely nothing about Mauritania; and I do not know whether the Commission is aware, for example, of the discovery of an illegal immigration network operating in Mauritania and on Spanish territory, and acting jointly.
My concern is that, while I think it is right to carry out studies, I have the impression that the Council is not currently supporting the initiatives of Commissioner Vitorino, aimed at a rapid solution to this problem.
I fully share the honourable Member's view that the entry of illegal immigrants into European Union territory is not only taking place by sea, but also by land and via airports.
We have therefore collaborated with the Italian Government to produce a viability report on the control of European Union land and air borders.
The current study on sea borders is specific, since it complements the other one which has been produced by the Italian Government.
My hope is that, when the study phase is completed, the governments will feel that they have more support in terms of the application of concrete measures and the action plan to combat illegal immigration. The Commission Communication on the control of external borders contains a very long list of concrete actions.
Finally, I would like to say that we are naturally prioritising the issue of Morocco, but I have taken good note of the information the honourable Member has given me on the issue of Mauritania and I am going to investigate that as well.
Question No 50 by Esko Olavi SeppÃ€nen (H-0565/02):
Subject: TEAM experts
At the beginning of July, the Commission adopted a large information programme which included a plan for continuing and developing the activities of the network of TEAM experts.
How were these people selected, and how much is spent per annum on their training, expenses and appearance fees?
TEAM Europe was created by the European Commission in 1989 with the aim of providing a network of independent conference speakers whose expertise covers all fields of activity of the Union in all working languages.
Currently TEAM has about 550 members who can participate in conferences, seminars, debates and training sessions on issues relating to the European Union.
They speak in their own name and not on behalf of the Commission.
The members of TEAM Europe are selected by the representations of the Commission in each Member State on the basis of criteria that include experience, in-depth knowledge of European issues, languages, media training and availability.
They are organised in national groups.
The members of TEAM Europe are not paid by the Commission.
However, they can accept expenses from the organisers of the event in which they are participating and even some appropriate payment.
The Commission does, however, provide them with regular training sessions.
In 2002 the Commission organised three training seminars in Brussels specifically for members of TEAM Europe.
There was a two-day seminar on the external relations of the European Union in which 80 TEAM members participated; a three-and-a-half-day seminar on enlargement in which 60 TEAM members participated; and a two-day seminar on the future of Europe, the post-Nice process and the European Convention, in which 103 TEAM members participated.
This training is provided in the Commission, using speakers and interpreters from either the Commission or the other institutions and occasionally outside speakers who do not receive payment.
Question No 51 by Bernd Posselt (H-0588/02):
Subject: Visa exemption for Macedonia
Has the Commission any plans to introduce a visa exemption for Macedonian citizens who wish to enter the EU, particularly since in answer to a similar question the Council has said that without a Commission proposal it is unable to take a decision on this matter, which is of such vital importance for the stabilisation of Macedonia?
. (PT) Mr President, Regulation No 539/2001, adopted by the Council on 15 March 2001, includes the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia amongst third countries whose nationals must have a visa if they wish to cross the external borders of the Member States.
The introduction of a visa exemption for Macedonians would require the regulation to be amended, which only the Commission can propose, pursuant to the provisions of Article 67(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Communities.
The criteria for the inclusion of a country on the list of third countries for whose nationals a visa is mandatory or on the list of those nationals that are exempt from visa requirements are defined in the fifth recital of Regulation No 539/2001.
These are criteria covering the dimension of illegal immigration from these countries, reasons of public order and security, external relations, regional coherence and the principle of reciprocity.
These criteria are not immutable.
The extent and the persistence of certain developments with regard to one particular country or another can lead the Commission to propose that the regulation be amended.
In this field, the Commission makes an ongoing effort to detect such changes and to make a precise assessment of their relevance.
In order to undertake this task, the Commission makes use of a range of information from very diverse sources, paying particular attention to the data and statistics from the States Members that it collects from actions undertaken by certain specialised working groups in the Council.
In this context, it should be pointed out that the Seville European Council of 21 and 22 June asked the Council and the Commission, within the scope of their respective competences, to give absolute priority to certain measures in the fight against illegal immigration.
Amongst these measures is the re-evaluation, before the end of the year, of the list of third countries whose nationals are required to have a visa and of those that are exempt.
In this exercise of revising the regulation, the Commission will certainly take account of all information relevant to the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in light of the criteria laid down in recital 5 of the aforementioned Regulation.
Mr President, Commissioner, my question refers back to Question Time with the Spanish Presidency, when the Spanish Presidency told me that the Council could not address this issue because the Commission had not taken an initiative.
This may be a game of pass-the-parcel between the Council and the Commission - I have no idea - but that was what the Council told me.
Hence my question to you.
Of all the new states to come out of the former Yugoslavia, which never needed a visa, there are three countries with which the EU has association agreements, namely Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia, of which Macedonia is the only one which has to have a visa.
Even the neighbouring states of Bulgaria and Romania do not need visas, despite massive security problems, which is why this would be an important message for this country.
They feel humiliated, being at a disadvantage to the other associated countries.
It is the only associated country which has to have a visa!
I understand Mr Posselt's concerns perfectly.
There is, however, a difference, in that Romania and Bulgaria are both candidate countries for accession to the European Union, while Macedonia is not.
In any event, I acknowledge, on behalf of the Commission, that Macedonia has made a considerable effort to improve its external border control and the quality of its travel documents.
I even believe that Macedonia is currently adopting legislation on visas that is very similar to the legislation in force in the European Union, which is a significant and positive factor.
In order to gauge the progress made by Macedonia, however, we sent a delegation of experts last June as part of the regional CARDS programme.
The conclusions of this delegation and the report on the regulatory framework and its implementation with regard to granting visas and the control of Macedonia's external borders will be available in October 2002.
It is then that the Commission will assess the situation in Macedonia, in light of this report and the criteria of recital 5.
Only then shall we be able to take a decision on our initiative to review EU legislation on visas.
This is not, therefore, a game of table tennis, but it is essential to observe procedures.
For now, I am unable to tell you what our assessment will be after receiving the report by the group of experts, which will be sent to me next month.
Question No 52 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0599/02):
Subject: Visa requirements for people entering the EU from countries which have a special relationship with the Member States of the Union
A significant proportion of the EU Member States have a special relationship and cultural ties with countries outside the Union, for example Portugal and Spain with the Latin American countries. Many people have dual nationality, which means that this relationship forms part of their character, alongside their belonging to the Union.
How is this situation to be dealt with in view of the decision of the Council of Europe in Seville to revise the list of countries whose citizens will require a visa to enter the countries of the Union?
How will the citizens of Latin American countries be treated as far as Spain and Portugal are concerned?
Mr President, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, each Member State of the European Union lays down its own conditions for granting nationality.
Any citizen holding nationality of a Member State has the right to move and settle freely throughout the territory of the Union's Member States, under the provisions laid down in Community law.
In the case of dual nationality, citizens can invoke laws arising from citizenship of the Union.
The Commission takes the view, therefore, that the existence of cases of dual nationality in relations between Spain, Portugal and various Latin American countries is covered by existing legislation.
With regard to visa policy towards Latin America, Regulation No 539/2001 lays down the lists of third countries whose nationals are subject to visa requirements or who are exempt from such requirements.
Following up the conclusions of the Seville European Summit, the Commission sent a questionnaire to the Member States, in the aim of re-examining the lists of third countries annexed to the aforementioned regulation.
The Member States' answers can provide a number of suggestions, on the basis of which the Commission will perhaps be able to present a proposal for an amendment to the regulation.
The criteria used to determine the lists are defined in the first phrase of the fifth recital of the regulation.
Determining which third countries' nationals are subject to visa requirements and which countries' nationals are not is undertaken by means of a detailed assessment, on a case-by-case basis, using various criteria, particularly concerning illegal immigration, public order and security and the Union's external relations with the third countries. At the same time, account is taken of the implications for regional coherence and of the principle of reciprocity.
Any decision by the Council in this field is adopted by qualified majority, once the European Parliament has been consulted.
Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, I cannot imagine that one day, in Spain and in Portugal, and even in the European Union, Brazil could be considered to be a third country for the Portuguese or Argentina a third country for Galicians or the Spanish.
Although many people with dual nationality live in these countries, many children and grandchildren of Portuguese, Spanish and Galician citizens are not considered to be European.
I consider, however, that this extremely close family link that exists between Portugal, Spain and Galicia and Latin America must be given very special treatment in the solutions that the Commission proposed for the visas discussed at the Seville Council.
I hope that the Commission does not forget our family in Latin America.
Thank you very much, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, but I could not agree with you more, for all of the reasons you have given and for one more, which explains why we are speaking almost the same language.
In any event, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the countries you have mentioned already enjoy exemption from visa requirements and that the only countries in Latin America that are subject to these requirements are Colombia and Peru.
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 53 to 81 will be answered in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was adjourned at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Mr President, the Commission has today adopted a communication on the rationalisation of the coordination of economic and employment policies.
This coordination, at Union level, creates a framework within which the Member States define their own policies. It also contributes to progress on the ambitious Lisbon objectives.
We all know that the general coordination framework has become an increasingly more complex framework.
Too often new elements have been added as they became necessary and this situation has helped neither the coherence of the guidelines for the different policies nor the understanding of them.
You, as Parliament, have presented us with various proposals to improve the situation and, while working on the basis of existing legislation, we have tried to take them into consideration.
Rationalising coordination is not restricted simply to improving timetables and organisation, as it may seem at first sight.
We have tried to fundamentally change the coherence of policies and the evaluation of their implementation, thereby contributing to progress in the increase in growth potential, the creation of more and better jobs, an improvement in social cohesion and sustainable development.
With all of this in mind, the Commission makes concrete proposals in its communication to increase efficiency and coordination, to improve coherence and complementarity amongst the different processes and instruments, to stimulate our commitments and our 'ownership' in relation to a greater involvement by Parliament and social partners, and increase the transparency and understanding of policy coordination and therefore its visibility and effects.
These important political improvements will increase the Union's capacity to achieve its ambitious economic and employment objectives.
I would like to mention two key points: firstly, the Commission proposes a better structure for the cycle of policy coordination based on three points: execution, political orientations and guidelines.
These will be the key points which will make the coordination cycle more transparent and improve its effects.
The cycle will begin with the preparation of the spring European Council.
At the beginning of each year the Commission will present a package on the evaluation of implementation which will accompany the spring report and that package will present both the development of progress in the various areas involving the implementation of the broad guidelines of economic policy and the draft joint report on employment.
The spring report will therefore focus on the points on which progress must be speeded up and will propose key political guidelines for the spring European Council.
On this basis, in the middle of March the spring European Council will produce some general political guidelines and at the beginning of April the Commission, with these guidelines in mind, will present its guidelines which will include both the broad guidelines of economic policy and the employment guidelines.
Finally, the competent departments of the Commission will adopt this raft of guidelines once they have obtained the support of the European Council in June.
The second key point of the proposals presented today by the Commission is improving the efficiency of coordination.
In this respect, we suggest that we focus more on the medium term when it comes to drawing up guidelines.
The raft of guidelines will adopt a more differentiated medium-term perspective and will be reviewed in their entirety just once every three years.
In the intervening years the changes will be restricted to those necessary to take account of the most significant events during that period.
The more strategic approach will give stability to the guidelines on the different policies and allow them to be better monitored.
Furthermore, coherence will be improved by greater clarity in the contents of the respective instruments and their synchronisation.
This better complementarity will strengthen the basic political messages.
The Commission suggests that this rationalisation be implemented quickly and the first raft of new guidelines should be updated at the spring European Council of 2003, with the Commission presenting its first implementation assessment package at the beginning of 2004.
Consequently, the new cycle will be completely under way before the elections to this Parliament.
In addition to these improvements which will begin to operate by the 2003 cycle, the Commission has proposed a series of amendments relating to the law currently in force in the Treaties, aimed at the coordination of economic policies.
I am not going to get into this issue today; I simply wish to point out, as I said at the beginning of my speech, that these issues are linked to the process of streamlining we are discussing today, since, as I said, we are working on the basis of existing legislation.
I would like to end by stressing that the Commission appreciates Parliament's contribution of policy coordination and we eagerly await your suggestions on the guidelines we are going to propose and on this rationalisation process.
Your contributions and participation are a sign of your commitment to the common guidelines for the different policies and to an improvement in economic and social results.
My colleague Anna Diamantopoulou will comment on certain further elements relating to this coordination process which we have both presented jointly today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during last year's debate on the employment package, Parliament made a clear demand for procedures to be streamlined.
The Barcelona Council tabled the same demand.
So, it seems to me that this communication responds to the demands of both Parliament and the Council for more up-to-date procedures.
As Mr Solbes Mira quite rightly said, this is not simply a technical arrangement.
It is not simply better timing. There really is an ambitious political objective in terms of better defined policies, better governance and greater efficiency.
We are forging ahead with modernisation, with this new common procedure, we are applying our experience from ten years of economic guidelines since Maastricht, five years of the Employment Strategy in action and, of course, the whole Lisbon framework, and that is important.
I should like to make a few comments on the European Employment Strategy in particular.
First, both strategies will clearly be strengthened and will have a higher profile within the Lisbon framework.
Secondly, we now have a medium-term time frame and that is important.
Rather than annual guidelines or annual recommendations, we have a medium-term time frame.
We aim to issue new guidelines up to 2010, with a mid-term review in 2006, as requested in Barcelona.
So there will be a mid-term review, when we set objectives and guidelines, together with annual controls and annual cooperation in monitoring policies and it is this that will maintain the momentum of the strategy.
The third point is that this exercise has a clear objective: to achieve greater cohesion between the two policies.
Obviously there is a division of roles between the two policies.
The economic guidelines provide the general framework, the framework within which the employment guidelines move, but it is the employment guidelines that define the more detailed framework and objectives and propose individual strategies.
My next point concerns better governance of economic and social policies, which is also one of the items on the agenda of the Convention set up to revise the Treaty.
What we want to show is that, while we respect the autonomy of each policy as defined in the Treaty, we also have the facility to set a single economic framework for the Union.
I think that, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, things will be much clearer and much more transparent because both dossiers will take account of all the basic aspects of economic and structural policy in practice, at a given time and in a coordinated manner.
I should also like to assure you that our efficient consultations with Parliament will continue; they have merely been moved from the autumn to the spring.
Our aim is to ensure that, with this new framework, we can cooperate efficiently with Parliament.
Commissioner Diamantopoulou, Commissioner Solbes, thank you both very much.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for today's communication.
I do, however, remain concerned about two points.
The Lisbon Summit foresaw a key coordinating role for the European Council itself.
Although it remained unspoken, one of the main reasons for that was to avoid the whole procedure being dominated by Ecofin.
In the procedure in this communication there is a fundamental breakdown, following the June Council.
We then have the separate competitiveness, employment and Ecofin Councils making the final decisions in their respective areas.
It is at that point that Ecofin will become dominant and will hamstring the other two Councils.
That is a fundamental flaw in the whole procedure.
My second concern is that the first and last mention of Parliament is in May, in relation to the employment guidelines.
If the Commission as an institution is serious about the involvement of Parliament, it should be joining with us in calling for an interinstitutional agreement to give Parliament a formal say in the preparations for the spring Council.
Mr President, thank you for that information we have received from the Commission.
It was brief, as it presumably needs to be in this context.
I should nonetheless like to address two more matters.
First of all, it would be interesting to know more about the way in which the European Parliament and the national parliaments are to be able to arrive at a joint position.
Mr Hughes has already addressed this matter, but it is important for it to be clarified.
The point might be made that it is at present quite unclear how the European Parliament and the national parliaments are to participate in this process.
The second matter I want to mention is the processes.
I support the idea of these processes needing to be coordinated.
Two processes are discussed, but I believe that three processes need to be talked about, namely the economic process, the employment process and the process of social inclusion.
All three have their particular value and something special to contribute.
It is therefore extremely important for these distinctive features to be retained when the processes are coordinated. Otherwise, there will be a decline in their overall value.
I wonder therefore what thought has been given to the way in which, when the processes are coordinated, it might be possible to retain the special character of each particular one.
Mr President, Commissioners, a couple of brief comments.
On a number of occasions - most recently during the informal Council of Ministers in Kolding - we have, on behalf of Parliament and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, made the point that we would welcome coordination of the employment and social policy cycles.
We want this to happen for a reason: because it is very clearly stated in the Treaty that employment policy guidelines must to some extent be aligned with economic guidelines.
I hope that we will see interaction between these two elements.
That we do not focus exclusively on employment. That we do not concern ourselves merely with the quantity of jobs, but also with their quality.
That we do not think just about jobs and phrases like labour market flexibility, but that we also give some thought to security on the labour market and the social implications of this.
In other words, all the elements that could contribute to interaction, and my question is whether that is the intention of this entire policy mix event.
Mr President, I am going to try to respond quickly to the problems that affect me most directly and leave to Anna Diamantopoulou the problems which fall more within her competence.
Firstly, is there a split in relation to Lisbon and is there a lack of coordination in terms of the decision making at the spring Council?
I believe that there is not; I believe that the situation is precisely the opposite.
In fact, we will go to the spring Council with a position on guidelines for the different processes.
The Lisbon Council will take this decision - which of course must be consistent in all the guidelines - and subsequent Councils will then have to work on that basis.
Therefore, what we are achieving is the opposite: that the various Councils work in a direction which has already been previously defined.
Not only are we acting coherently with Lisbon, but I believe we are going further than what had initially been foreseen.
Secondly, something which concerns many of you: what is the role of Parliaments - European and national - in the process?
From the point of view of the broad guidelines for economic policy, we are working with existing laws, as I said before.
We are not therefore talking about a modification of the Treaties or other aspects which can be raised in the Convention.
Nevertheless, we believe that the new procedure allows Parliament to take two types of action.
Firstly, the debate on the report on implementation of the broad guidelines for economic policy. Parliament will have much more time than it did previously to hold that debate, and will also have more opportunity to take its own positions on the broad guidelines of economic policy, as we have been introducing into practice over recent years.
In this respect, we believe that the situation is clearly improving.
The position of national parliaments must be decided by each Member State, although the Commission advocates the idea that, both in the broad guidelines for economic policy, and in issues relating to the stability programmes, the national Parliaments should be involved.
Finally, it is true that there is basic coordination between the broad guidelines of economic policy and employment, but also with the Cardiff Process and the other processes which can affect economic policy.
These are the essential issues I wanted to comment on.
Mr President, I should like to respond to two points. ?he first concerns distinct policies and whether we can achieve them.
Without doubt, this proposal sets specific objectives, together with procedures and dates for achieving them.
One clear objective, as I said, is that these two policies should be independent.
So that we have clear, specific guidelines on employment, within the framework of the general guidelines, with objectives and procedures attached to them.
I do not know if anyone can say for sure that we shall achieve this objective.
But one thing is clear and that is that the political will is there and that the procedures are being designed so that we can move in this direction.
I think that we now all have a political responsibility to achieve this both for political reasons and because we need distinct employment policies in the European Union as a whole.
The second question concerns Mr Bouwman's position on employment, which of course means more than just job numbers.
Within the framework of the guidelines and in Parliament we have said time and again that we need to include directions and guidelines on the quality of employment and this is what we are working towards.
My initial reaction is rather positive, as I believe that the Commission proposals are along the right lines.
We cannot ask for better coordination of the Member States' economic policies without also calling for an improvement in the coordination process for economic, social and sustainable development policies at European Union level.
I believe that all processes relating to the BGEP, namely the Luxembourg, Cardiff, Cologne, Lisbon and Stockholm processes, and any others, for that matter, need to be rationalised.
The experts are beginning to lose the thread, and the citizens are completely lost.
Rationalisation is therefore required, provided, of course, that the European Parliament and the national parliaments are involved in the said processes.
If I have understood Mr Solbes correctly, in future we will have coordination for the medium term, with a complete review every three years.
Three years is a long time, however, for a Parliament with a five-year mandate and a Commission that also has a life expectancy of five years.
Some legislatures would, therefore, only hold one major debate on the broad guidelines.
In addition to this, three years is a very long time in economic terms.
Three years ago, Mr President, the world stock markets were all bullish.
Two years ago, however, the bubble burst, causing substantial collateral damage.
Therefore, and this is my question, can you envisage not adapting the guidelines to the development of the economy and of life in society?
Mr President, Commissioners, you started, Commissioner Solbes, by mentioning that you are working on getting the Treaty changed.
I should like to ask you straight up: exactly what changes are you working on? How will the European Parliament and codecision and joint competence fit in with these changes?
And for my second question.
We all talk about growth and employment.
We have the stability and growth pact.
We have the internal market.
We have the Lisbon process.
What potential for coordination in these three agreements has still not been exhausted and how does the Treaty prevent these orders from being fulfilled?
Mr President, I am pleased to hear that Parliament will be receiving documents before we are supposed to be drawing up our reports - that is something positive.
The question I want clarified is: where does sustainable development fit into this?
In his introduction Commissioner Solbes talked about sustainable growth, which is not the same as sustainable development - some growth can destroy the environment and jobs and is not particularly sustainable.
So where is the sustainability element going to come from?
How is this going to be determined through a qualitative analysis of growth, and how is this going to fit into this coordination which we are hoping to see in future?
At the moment this is a missing element and yet it is supposed to be a key element of the spring summits as decided at GÃ¶teborg?
Mr Goebbels, in order to clarify the position we have presented the issue very quickly.
We produce broad guidelines every three years, but this will not prevent us from having an annual modification and an annual debate.
I will give you an example: at the moment, the broad guidelines for economic policy have the essential aim of strengthening growth within a framework of economic stability in order to increase productivity and employment.
This type of principle is going to be general for a long period.
Clearly, the results produced each year, and the modification we will have to introduce bearing in mind what is happening in the economy, will have to be debated each year, and we will have to make annual modifications, but on the basis of a fundamental model which will be in force for three years.
Mr Karas, I believe that either I did not express myself well or the translation has not been entirely correct.
I have said twice that our intention with this Communication is to rationalise and coordinate the instruments of economic policy without changing the law.
Therefore, this document contains no modification of the Treaties.
We are talking about how to take better advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties.
I would like to make two comments in this respect: the European Parliament's participation is clearly defined in the Treaty in relation to the general employment guidelines and we are implementing a system for participation by Parliament - not in a co-decision procedure since we are not talking about legislative regulations - which, since there will be more time to work on the application reports of the previous year and - Parliament's cooperation will be necessary here - the times for decision making on the broad guidelines for economic policy will be improved, will allow Parliament to increase its participation in the process, which is what we all want to see.
The third element: to what extent can Lisbon be improved and applied further?
I believe that that it was what we are trying to do: to achieve the best possible result from Lisbon.
A final comment in relation to sustainable development: sustainable development is included this year as an objective of the broad guidelines for economic policy, and these include certain elements relating to sustainable development.
Mr President, I think that the Commission has made a laudable attempt at achieving greater continuity and coherence, but please allow me to say that I do not think the attempt goes far enough towards the optimum goals.
I should first like to say something about continuity.
I think working in the context of the longer term is fine, but adjustments must remain possible from time to time.
The communication from the Commission takes account of this.
I have a question on the timetable.
The timetable now provides for new guidelines to cover a period of three years: 2003 to 2006.
This would take us beyond the Commission's and Parliament's mandates; I had hoped that this would be more of an induction programme, linked to the political mandates of the Commission and Parliament.
Can the Commissioner comment on this?
Secondly: the global economic guidelines are mentioned as key implementation instruments, as they also contain the lines of force of the employment strategy.
My fellow MEP Stephen Hughes has already commented on this in the context of the Ecofin Council.
Employment is part of those economic guidelines, but it had already been decided that they would also contain the consensus view on matters such as coordination of pensions and healthcare.
I should like to know what has happened to these topics, as I see nothing about them in the notification.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commission for its proposals, but I would also like to draw attention to a subject which is inextricably linked to the improvement of economic and employment policy coordination, and that is the debate, which is quite heated in some Member States, on the Stability Pact and the flexibility thereof.
I would like to ask the Commission how it intends to respond, to distinguish between the attitude of certain Member States, of certain governments, which would like to revise the Stability Pact and make it less rigid - in some cases for the simple reason that they are having difficulty keeping their public finances under control but want to keep promises they have made to cut taxes at such a difficult economic time - and the attitude and position of others, which are putting forward what I believe are sensible proposals to turn the Growth Pact and investments to good account, making good use of the golden rule that the most fruitful public investments have to be incorporated into and integrated with the Lisbon strategy. Lastly, how will this be coordinated with the proposals the Commission has presented this evening?
Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission how it intends to guarantee that economic, social and employment policies will be coordinated, as defined in the Lisbon process, and pursued in a democratically legitimate manner if it rejects changes to the Treaty within the framework of the Convention.
I would firstly like to answer the question on the relationship between the processes of the Commission and of Parliament.
Of course we could consider a long-term programme - five years - but, in our opinion, this period of time is excessive.
If we do not talk about five years, the problems the honourable Member mentions will always exist.
It is either one year or any figure greater than one year presents us with these problems.
However, I believe that the concern is that two or three years raises the problem, as does four years.
It is either five or one.
Five is too much, one means that we have less room for manoeuvre.
In any event I believe that it is a false problem.
Because the necessary modifications can be discussed annually and therefore this does not cause any difficulty, as I said earlier to Mr Goebbels, and if a change in circumstances or an institutional change requires the problem to be reassessed, this can clearly be done.
The second point: what happens with the Employment Ecofin and to what extent may contradictions arise?
Contradictions in the process are precisely what we are trying to prevent, for a very simple reason: the process starts with the Commission, with a position which must be consistent; that position must be decided on or approved by the European Council; the Ecofin Councils and the Employment Council will have to work on the guidelines produced by the spring European Council, and it will be the June European Council that finally accepts guidelines which must be consistent amongst themselves and consistent with what the European Council itself has proposed.
Therefore, this type of incoherence should not arise.
An issue which I believe to be totally outside today's debate is the Stability Pact.
I am not going to say too much about this.
The Stability Pact is part of Community legislation.
My position is very well known: I believe that the legislation has to be complied with and therefore my position is that the Stability Pact must be applied as laid down in the legislation currently in force.
This does not mean that the Commission is insensitive to the experience which the Pact has provided us with and that it has not proposed - the Commission itself - a series of interpretative elements in accordance with economic developments, including such important elements as, for example, taking account of the cyclically adjusted budgets in order to assess the reality in terms of the possibility of achieving the nominal objectives laid down in the stability programmes.
I still believe that the Stability Pact is an excellent instrument and that we must naturally draw the best possible conclusions from the reality of the situation so that the Pact may function better, but not so that the substance of the Pact is affected.
My final point: the legitimacy of the process, raised by Mrs Randzio-Plath.
I believe that the process has all the legitimacy available at the moment; in fact it has even more, given that not only the sectoral Councils are involved in these decisions, but also the European Council at the beginning and the end of the process and, secondly, not only is the current commitment maintained, or the current participation of the European Parliament, but the intention is to increase it.
The honourable Member raises another problem: what type of modification of the Treaty can be considered in the future with a view to greater participation by the European Parliament in this process?
This Communication says nothing about this issue.
This is an issue under discussion in the Convention, and the eventual result will depend on the negotiation at the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, I should like to comment on three points.
First, as we have already pointed out, the whole proposal comes within the framework of the current Treaty, which does not need to be interpreted differently or more widely or changed in any way.
Secondly, this proposal is just one step.
We cannot update the Lisbon procedures in one fell swoop.
So, to come back to what Mrs Van Lancker said about other policies, such as pension schemes or policies on other social issues or the problem of exclusion which we discussed recently, I have to say that all these procedures are in a state of flux and that our final objective is to coordinate them within a common framework.
The third point raised by a number of honourable Members is just how medium-term or short-term the timetable should be.
I think that the success of this proposal lies in the fact that it sets medium-term objectives - I mentioned 2010.
This is very important because, with employment in particular, policies have to be structural.
They leave cyclical changes out of account, which is why medium-term objectives are much more significant and help governments to focus their efforts and apply specific objectives.
At the same time, however, we propose that procedures should be monitored annually, meaning that a debate will be held in Parliament once a year on the basis of the Member States' reports and, as Mr Solbes Mira just said, if specific incidents occur or unexpected circumstances arise, we can obviously review the new proposals.
Thank you Commissioner Diamantopoulou and Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the continuation of the debate on sales promotions in the internal market.
Mr President, Commissioners, every businessman agrees that, if we are to have a real single market, we need to remove all the remaining obstacles, which is why the initiative for this proposal for a Commission regulation is welcome, but the text of it is not, at least not in its entirety.
One of the few points I wish to comment on is the plan to allow below cost selling.
What is the point of this clause?
Who does it benefit, except a handful of large retail outlets which you can count on the fingers of one hand?
Absolutely no-one!
But for over 20 million small and medium-sized enterprises, it spells mortal danger from unfair trading by large retailers who, by selling below cost, could wipe out thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises and minimise any possible competition.
For tens of millions of workers, unemployment will be the result.
And more unemployment is the last thing the European economy needs in its present parlous state.
Nor will it benefit consumers, because short-term bargains will rapidly be replaced by massive price increases once a few companies have cornered the market.
That is why, if we want to say that we represent the millions of workers and businesses in the European Union, if we want to maintain that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European economy and society, if we want to carry on claiming that we are in touch with reality, then we need to vote against below cost selling in tomorrow's vote.
Does Mr Harbour wish to speak on a point of order?
Mr President, I wanted to catch your eye before Mr Folias started, because I believe that all of us here would like to write into the record before the debate that we are recommencing this debate ten hours - I repeat, ten hours - after it was first started.
I, and I am sure my colleagues, in particular the rapporteur, consider this is a quite unacceptable way of planning our business as a serious parliament on this most important subject.
I shall look forward to contributing later, but I wanted that on the record now, because it is very important that you as President understand how seriously we regard the way this has been handled.
I have taken good note of what you have said, Mr Harbour.
Mr President, I should like to endorse what my honourable friend Mr Harbour has just said.
I feel that the legislative work of this House is not properly reflected in the order of business and that we are still prone to the resolutionitis which we suffered from in 1979.
The PPE group had a really hard time with this Commission proposal, in part due to the fact that the Member States have very different approaches to competition law.
We took great pains to broker a compromise, including with the rapporteur in committee, and I should like to report to plenary today that the PPE group firmly backs this compromise, which is identical to the report by the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I think this is a remarkable announcement to plenary by so big a group.
There was not one dissenting voice within the group.
This compromise includes a statement to the effect that we agree with the compromise and that we agree with the Commission's idea of using a regulation.
We believe that, in principle, a regulation is the right way to tackle the problems addressed here.
However, the Member States will need time to adapt, so we have suggested a later starting date, namely 1 January 2005.
Mr Folias has addressed the problem of small and medium-sized businesses.
They were in fact a crucial factor in our debate.
To give just two examples: numerous Member States have banned below cost selling in their fair trading legislation, partly in order to protect their small and medium-sized enterprises.
We have amended the Commission proposal by expressly allowing for such an eventuality.
We have also ensured that tariffs for fees for the liberal professions can be maintained without restriction.
On the other hand, we have achieved the required degree of harmonisation.
I think that excesses in competition law such as we saw at the start of the year in Germany, when a firm wanting to offer a 20% discount was prohibited from doing so by a court order, will be a thing of the past.
Thank you for listening.
I am afraid I must leave now.
I have another meeting at 9 p.m. and trust that the honourable Members and the Commission will excuse me.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Beysen, very much for his thorough work and for his attention to all the issues which, as the previous speaker, Mr Lehne, pointed out too, have been the subject of a great deal of debate in the Commission.
I believe that it was a good idea to present the proposal in the form of a regulation, for I feel that a regulation is genuinely the most suitable vehicle for laying down uniform rules on specific, clearly-defined issues, for guaranteeing price transparency and for increasing legal certainty, and that it is the best way to meet the need for uniform rules now the euro has been introduced.
Above all, the regulatory approach makes it possible to create a legal framework on the basis of which the consumer and other market actors can obtain sufficient information to be able to make informed decisions.
The text before us, which we are to vote on tomorrow, is, in any case, the result of thorough analysis in committee and in the committees responsible for drawing up opinions.
It amends and improves many important aspects of the original proposal relating to the provision of protection and guarantees for consumers, minors, small and medium-sized enterprises and healthy competition, and the introduction of the subsidiarity mechanism.
Indeed, an amendment introduces the principle of subsidiarity, on the basis of which the Member States can partially limit trade communications on grounds of consumer protection, safeguarding competition or the protection of providers.
I feel that the provision adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - increasing protection for minors, particularly as regards personal data and potentially dangerous free samples and premiums - is especially important.
In addition, the consumer is also safeguarded as regards the court or out-of-court settlement of claims.
All in all, I feel this is a well-balanced proposal which takes into account both the need to make the international market fully functional and the need to protect the consumer.
Mr President, it is important for us to harmonise sales promotion practices in the internal market at Community level, but the Commission proposals raise a great many questions.
The most serious, as numerous honourable Members have already said, is that it allows below cost selling, which national authorities will be unable to restrict or ban.
I do not think this will help foster healthy competition; what it will help foster are unfair trading practices by very large companies; smaller businesses and consumers will be the ones to suffer because, once the competition in the vicinity has been wiped out, one or, at most, a few companies will corner the market.
I therefore welcome the intervention by the Committee on Legal Affairs and its amendments allowing each Member State to introduce or probably maintain bans on below cost selling in their legislation.
Five countries in the European Union already have this sort of legislation, including Greece, where law 2941, adopted in 2001, basically guarantees trading standards and bans below cost selling.
Under the Commission text, this law would violate Community legislation.
If the amendment by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs is adopted, there should be no problem, and it is therefore vital for us to support these amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I believe that the draft regulation currently before Parliament is to be welcomed because, although it is true that promotional sales are a topical issue and represent a very considerable share of the market, it is also true that there are still national laws in force imposing restrictions on promotions, particularly on discounts, which, in actual fact, jeopardise the consolidation of the internal market.
I feel that the Commission has presented us with a well-balanced text which will provide an appropriate solution to the problem of the absence of a genuine internal market for promotions and promotional sales and of the market being governed by a variety of different laws which ban in some countries behaviour which is permitted in others.
I fear that some of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market are in danger of diminishing the effectiveness of this text.
I refer, in particular, to Amendments Nos 29 and 32, which, although intended to safeguard the principle of subsidiarity, are, in actual fact, in danger of rendering the regulation's provisions and proposals on the specific case of discounts ineffective.
I believe there is one thing that must be made clear first of all: competition authorities exist at both Community and Member State level. Competition laws and laws on all cases which can be classed as unfair competition exist, and so cases of discounts which would appear to be an example of fair competition are prosecuted via this channel too.
Competition authorities do exist but, in all other cases, not only are discounts not negative, they are positive.
They are clearly positive for the consumer, who can buy goods and services at a very advantageous price, and it does not matter whether for a limited period of time or not.
It is not true, in my opinion, that discounts are necessarily harmful for small businesses: quite the opposite, small businesses often offer discounts to launch a product or a commercial activity, not having a great deal of financial resources available for large-scale or even, often, small-scale promotional campaigns.
I feel we are in danger of doing consumers and businesses a bad turn here.
Another brief point: the issue of inflation.
I am thinking of Italy, but other countries are in the same situation: penalising discounts until it is impossible to offer them in practice, as has happened in Italy, has contributed in equal measure to the creation of the conditions for a less competitive market and, therefore, a market which is at greater risk from price inflation.
Mr President, I warmly welcome, on behalf of my colleagues in the United Kingdom Conservative Party, this very elegant and simple proposal for reform of the single market.
It will perhaps surprise colleagues that the regulatory content of this regulation before us occupies eight clauses and three pages and yet we had 200 amendments.
Part of the problem - I say this particularly to the Commissioner because I know he is sympathetic to this - is that despite the fact that the single market is at the centre of economic reform of the Lisbon goals, when a simple proposal for reform is put forward we are in the extraordinary position that a significant number of Member States oppose it and, indeed, Members seek to change and dilute it.
We have reached an acceptable compromise, thanks to the heroic efforts of Mr Beysen.
I am confident we will get a strong majority for this tomorrow and it is absolutely right that we should.
How can we justify in the single market today a position where people shopping in Antwerp will get entirely different deals, offers and conditions to people who shop in Rotterdam, only a few miles away?
That story is repeated across the European Union.
The purpose of this regulation is to empower consumers to make choices in the single market, by giving them information and allowing them to exercise their choice.
A lot of the proposals and a lot of the amendments by the Socialist Group, which I am sure we will reject tomorrow, reflect the old mentality of trying to tell consumers what is best for them.
That world has gone!
We are talking about an Internet world where people can shop all over the European Union and where businesses can put out offers to them.
This is a crucial measure.
In conclusion, I want to thank the Commissioner for the remarks he made in the commercial communication, where he said Parliament comes to rescue the internal market.
This side of the House and this committee shall continue to do that.
We shall also rescue Europe's consumers from the over-interference that some colleagues are proposing.
Mr President, we must welcome the courageous study that the Commission has undertaken on sales promotions in the internal market and the legislative approach it has chosen and most of the solutions found to the regulation we are now considering.
However, no fine intention to improve the functioning of the internal market and to make best use of competition rules - as the Commission would like to see, and rightly so - can hide the irrationality of allowing sales below cost.
As has already been said in this debate, no one gives anything away for nothing and there is no such thing as a free lunch.
Nevertheless, selling below cost is a commercial stratagem which will, sooner or later, be tolerated by consumers.
The fairness of commercial practices is an essential and absolute value for the construction and development of a healthier, fairer and more cohesive economy.
The predatory practice of pricing below cost is incompatible with these values.
Indeed, when this practice is widespread, it imposes unacceptable pressures on the production system in a field with a dominant position, destroying legitimate profit margins to an unimaginable level and, consequently, the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are thereby bound to make all types of concession and are subject to every type of moral pressure.
This practice is also responsible for promoting impulse purchases, which obviously present no advantages for consumers, and instead threaten their interests and change their scale of priorities.
The ban on irresponsible selling must, therefore, be maintained as a principle crucial to fair commercial practice.
Furthermore, we have seen that the commercial strategy of predatory pricing is not controllable simply by applying the general rules on unfair competition.
The European Parliament must, therefore, table amendments to the Commission regulation, respecting the principles that I have mentioned.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly congratulating the rapporteur on his report.
The text approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is the result of skill and a spirit of dialogue, which has allowed broadly accepted compromises to be reached.
The result is a text which has been rebalanced in order to increase consumer protection, especially with regard to the information they are to be provided with, complaint procedures and the situation of minors, amongst others.
Also excluded are practices which are not of a commercial promotional nature, such as the operation of games of chance in the apparent form of sales promotion operations or sales at a loss or below cost.
I repeat that the latter is not a genuinely promotional practice, since its aim is not so much to protect the consumer as to eliminate market competitors, which at the end of the day benefits neither consumers, competition nor the good operation of the market.
For this reason, it is considered an illegal practice in the majority - not in the minority - of Member States.
Furthermore, several of them - since the competition rules are insufficient - have had to reintroduce these provisions.
And this, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, must be taken into account when the Commission produces its article 7 report and when we try - as we are trying - to implement the common market.
Because the common market cannot be a means for extending practices which the majority of Member States consider to be prejudicial, for good reasons.
The impact of a liberalisation cannot be measured in purely economic terms, but we have to take account of all the factors that affect the common good, and consumer protection is something which cannot simply be left to the predatory practices of certain large companies.
We therefore feel that the solution adopted is appropriate and consequently the enormous majority of our Group - which is not ultra-liberal but rather is in favour of a social market economy - is going to support it.
Mr President, Commissioner, if our aim is to produce both legislation providing full legal certainty and, at the same time, rules which will allow the citizens to derive maximum benefits from the internal market, then the regulation before us is certainly a step in the right direction.
We have worked hard on this regulation, and the number of amendments cited by my colleagues and the debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market too are evidence of the importance of what we consider to be a road that Europe must take without fail and which we want to build.
The internal market needs rules, and the rules must be evaluated in the context of everyday life.
The regulation broaches a number of extremely important issues.
I will not go back over those which have already been mentioned by my colleagues.
There is one point, for example, on which we would like there to be greater reflection and that is the settlement of disputes.
We would also like to try experimenting with self-regulation in this new world in which consumers enter into dialogue with the market.
Still on the subject of the disputes which are never absent from commercial relations, we call upon the Commission to expand this pilot stage of the European Extra-judicial Network.
Moreover, once again as my colleagues have recommended, we would like to see an increase in the activity of the Expert Group on Commercial Communications.
This group, set up in the dim and distant past in 1998, now needs to be adapted to deal with the increasingly urgent development of the internal market.
Then there are a whole series of points already mentioned which we fully support.
In conclusion, we feel that this is the right way to promote our ideal of Europe through the internal market.
Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Beysen for agreeing to act as rapporteur.
He gave our group sufficient opportunity to express the essence of our views in the report.
As a consequence, not only did we gain the support of 90% of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but we were also able to ensure that the proposal as a whole is now more balanced and shows the human face of the internal market.
I have two questions for the Commissioner.
I should like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on the amendment in which we want to maintain the national provisions banning sales below cost, or in any case giving the Member States the opportunity to do so.
I wonder whether the Commissioner understands our preference for preventive action over ex-post appeals to national or other competition authorities.
I wonder whether the Commissioner is fully aware that not all Member States have a legal culture that facilitates appeals to the competition authorities in order to resolve such problems.
I wonder whether the Commissioner comprehends that sales below cost are an instrument that can not only be abused by a dominant player to vanquish its rivals within competition law, but that it also enables an integrated distribution company to exploit its stronger financial position vis-Ã -vis specialised SMEs that have less financial clout.
The other question I should like to put to the Commissioner relates to consumer protection, on which a number of announcements have been made.
Are we to expect anything more?
If so, what?
What else does the Commission have up its sleeve?
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I too should like to start by extending my warmest thanks to the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Beysen, and congratulating him on his report.
It was thanks to our excellent working relationship that we were able to put what started out as a highly disputed Commission proposal on sales promotions to bed.
Advertising in the individual Member States and, more to the point, cross-border advertising in Europe, is a difficult and tricky business nowadays.
One hardly dares launch an advertisement nowadays without checking with a lawyer first.
There are all sorts of restrictions and bans on advertisers in the Member States.
To bring you up to date on what is happening in Germany, which Mr Lehne also used as an example, the euro discount offered by a clothing chain at the beginning of the year was prohibited by the courts, early riser price discounts have been prohibited by the courts and classic customer loyalty schemes such as Air Miles have been banned under German law.
Consumers are treated like ignorant, uninformed children.
We have to put a stop to this, which is why I and my honourable friends in our group welcome in principle the Commission proposal to help out here.
With the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs, it will certainly do a great deal to help the cross-border marketing of goods and services in Europe.
The Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed important amendments to the scope of the regulation.
A number of sensitive areas need to be exempted, especially national advertising bans for members of regulated professions such as lawyers and notaries, and bans on the advertising of pharmaceuticals.
In addition, national rules on aggressive advertising practices or the exertion of psychological buying pressure need to stay in place.
Seasonal and clearance sales are also exempted from the regulation, as are fixed-prices for books and, last but not least - and this has already been addressed - the thorny issue of below cost selling.
We were right not to include this in the scope of the regulation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this proposed Regulation on sales promotions in the internal market will allow European companies to take better advantage of the removal of borders in order to carry out their economic activities.
I therefore believe that the proposal is very appropriate in order to humanise the national provisions on the communication of sales promotions.
This proposal has given rise to a very important debate in this Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on a very specific aspect, namely, once again, sales at a loss.
I am glad to see that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has included the views of the Environment Committee in its amendments, and I therefore congratulate Mr Beysen, rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and Mrs Patrie, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
It is reasonable that sales at a loss should be regulated at national level.
At the moment, the majority of Member States prohibit this practice: Germany, Austria, France, Ireland, Greece and Spain, amongst others, and it is not an arbitrary prohibition.
I am going to be the last speaker to say that sales and re-sales at a loss cannot be considered commercial promotion practices, because these practices distort the principles of fair competition and in particular prejudice small retailers, who do not have the margins to compete in such a situation.
Furthermore, they create a false alarm in terms of consumer information, harm the image of the brand and seriously alter the planning of manufacturers and suppliers.
Specifically I support Amendments Nos 27, 28, 29, 30 and 32 and I trust that the majority of this House will approve them and that the Commission will accept them.
Mr President, in my introductory remarks this morning I explained that the objections of this Parliament and of other groups in society concentrated on four different sectors, four different aspects of this subject.
On behalf of the Commission I should now like to address those four aspects.
Almost all MEPs who took the floor this morning and this evening have mentioned sale below cost.
In discussing national provisions banning sale below cost, Mr Beysen, Mr Langen, Mrs Fourtou, Mrs McCarthy, Mr MacCormick and many others expressed concern at how SMEs would be affected if these national provisions were to be abolished.
I think the resolution before us offers an acceptable solution as it asks the Commission to undertake further investigation before proposing a Community-wide solution to this problem.
The authors of the resolution agree with the Commission that varying national rules in this area make cross-border purchasing and price strategies more difficult, and that action at European level is necessary for this reason.
The Commission finds the compromise acceptable.
I should also like to emphasise that the Commission does not agree that such prohibitions on sale below cost are needed to maintain clearance sales.
After all, seasonal clearance sales of this kind operate well in the seven Member States that do not have such provisions.
It is for this reason that the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 30 tabled by Mrs Thyssen.
I am happy to clarify, though, that the study which the Commission has promised to carry out into selling below cost will take proper account of the consequences of deregulation for SMEs.
I should now like to turn to the second topic which I mentioned this morning.
With regard to the comments made by Mrs Patrie on consumer protection and the link between this initiative and our activities on fair trading practices, Mr Beysen's report fortunately does not take the view that this proposal will have a negative impact on our ongoing study into the need for an initiative on fair trading practices.
That confirms the statements made by my fellow MEP Mr Byrne and myself on a number of occasions, namely that these two initiatives are entirely complementary.
The Commission therefore regrets that it is unable to accept Amendment No 28 tabled by Mrs Ghilardotti and the second part of Amendment No 12 tabled by Mrs Niebler.
The information requirements in the proposal offer a high level of consumer protection, which is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 41 and 50, which would undermine the level of consumer protection.
On the issue of alcohol, the Commission does not consider Amendment No 80 to be proportional since the Member States restrict the sale of alcoholic products to minors.
On the third point, promotional games, I can tell you that in view of Parliament's strong opposition to the Commission's present approach to this subject, the Commission accepts the compromise solution put forward in Mr Beysen's report.
For that reason the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 8 as it is currently worded.
Amendments Nos 20, 21 and 22 tabled by Mrs Patrie and Mr Lehne are now redundant since the link between taking part in a promotional game and the sale of a product is no longer possible.
Fourthly, I should like to address the issue of mutual recognition.
I should like to point out that this principle serves to allow free movement in sales promotion activities even without excessive harmonisation.
As Mrs McCarthy and Mrs Fourtou have clearly indicated, the principle of mutual recognition is the cornerstone of all our work in the area of the internal market.
As we already know, this applies to the Internet as well.
Amendments designed to remove this principle from the proposal, such as Amendment No 72 tabled by Mrs Patrie or Amendment No 79 tabled by Mr MacCormick and Mrs Hautala, are therefore unacceptable to the Commission.
The same applies to Amendment No 73 tabled by Mrs Patrie which makes the application of this principle dependent on further cumbersome notification procedures.
The Commission also rejects amendments that undermine the internal market, such as Amendments Nos 28 and 12, and amendments that aim to exclude certain sectors from their advantages, such as the first part of Amendment No 13 tabled by Mrs Niebler.
The Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 39 on language requirements.
Finally, I should like to inform Mr Fiori that the Commission certainly agrees that the opportunity to obtain redress must be used as quickly as possible, but the Commission thinks that in most cases this is best done by the promoter itself.
The Commission will propose a certain number of rules ensuring that the promoter acts in this regard.
