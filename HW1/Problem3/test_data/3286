I should now like to reply to some specific questions.
Some of you seem to be of the opinion that this agreement is unbalanced and skewed in favour of United States stakeholders.
Considering the economic pattern of the EC-US wine trade and the political and legal background, this first-phase agreement is not unbalanced.
It improves our relations with our leading customer considerably and establishes a good basis for future discussions and negotiations.
Besides, several provisions of key interest to the United States, such as the approval of their existing wine-making practices not covered by current Community authorisations and much simplified certification requirements, will only kick in once the United States has notified the Community it has changed the status of the 17 famous European wine names that are semi-generics in the US.
There is the question of the protection afforded to European wine names being insufficient.
The protection under this agreement is afforded through US labelling rules and guarantees that European wine names will only be used for European wines, notwithstanding a grandfathering clause on existing brand names.
In addition, this agreement is without prejudice to our rights under TRIPs and does not affect our legislative framework for GIs.
On the most-favoured nation risks mentioned by several of you, I can state that the Commission's aim in these negotiations and those with other new wine-producing countries, is to improve the dialogue between us and our negotiating partners and avoid the trade conflicts and WTO panels that would be extremely costly for European producers.
The most favoured nation clause is well-known with regard to tariffs, but the situation is completely different when it comes to its application in relation to procedures for recognising wine-making practices.
In order for the same concessions to be granted to another third country, that third country would have to be in a similar situation as regards acceptable wine-making practices and monitoring of those practices and of the wine.
However, the United States system of administration for wine labels is unique.
It is not used in other third countries and the most favoured nation risk therefore seems to be very small.
That is an important point.
As regards the possibility of adding water, let me recall that this is permitted today in the European Union for reasons of technical necessity.
We have no defined limits for the addition of water to wine, but, for example, a limit of 7% has been defined in respect of adding water to concentrated grapes, as it is impossible to detect the addition of water below that threshold.
But make no mistake, we will not accept any undermining of the quality of EU products.
On the question of mutual recognition, as I said in my introductory statement this agreement does not grant the United States mutual recognition of its wine-making practices.
This was one of the key US objectives, just as the phasing-out of semi-generics was for us.
However, since the US did not agree to phase out the use of the 17 EU semi-generic wine names used in the US, we did not agree to grant them mutual recognition of their wine-making practices.
As I said, we will only maintain the existing Community authorisations on United States wine-making practices.
We will accept the other existing US wine-making practices only when the United States has changed the status of our semi-generics.
That link has to be taken into consideration.
We will have the possibility, for new wine-making practices, to raise objections and hence not to accept new US wine-making practices.
We will not simply accept all the practices used by the United States.
However, various myths seem to abound.
To take the example of oak chips, which have often been referred to, such chips are already permitted in the European Union on an experimental basis.
Clearly, however, under the agreement, a wine will have to be aged in oak barrels before the term 'barrel-aged' could be used on the label.
That goes without saying.
Finally, it is very important that discussions be opened on the reform of the common market organisation in wine.
The impact assessment work has already started and consists amongst other things of an economic analysis of the sector, which should be completed by the end of the year.
Later, the impact assessment report will cover several options and the effects of those options.
The Commission will involve all stakeholders within the sector in a public debate that will hopefully be held in February, before presenting a proposal.
The Commission communication could be submitted by June next year, with a Commission legislative proposal being presented before the end of next year.
I should inform Mr Freitas that both madeira and port are on the list of the 17 wine names considered as semi-generic, and that the use of those names will therefore be restricted.
He can be quite sure about that.
Finally, the whole issue of geographical indications is of huge importance to the Community and I have constantly made this clear to our trading partners in the WTO negotiations.
Our intention has been to obtain a multilateral register, the extension of the existing higher level of protection afforded to wines and spirits to other products, and a clawing-back of certain names, the use of which has been abused world-wide.
Some of our trading partners even consider that GIs are not an issue for negotiation.
Something on GIs must come out of our final discussions in Hong Kong.
It is such a vital issue for the agricultural sector.
Â Â  We all hope that you will succeed in defending Europeansâ interests on this occasion.
At the close of this debate I have received six motions for a resolution(1) submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is therefore closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 September, at 12 noon.
The sitting will now be suspended until the beginning of the vote.
To those who may be asking why we are doing this rather earlier than usual, I will say that the Bureau has discussed how we might avoid the situation that always occurs at 12.00, 12.05 or 12.10 p.m., with the representatives of the Council of Ministers or the Commission having to talk rather over the noise of all the Members pouring into the Chamber for the vote.
We have therefore agreed to experiment with closing the debate at 11.50 a.m., so that the debate can proceed without disturbance.
It is for that reason that we now have a bit more time than usual.
Â Â  We are going to begin our voting session, with which our friends from Bulgaria and Romania shall become acquainted for the first time.
MrÂ ZappalÃ , I give you the floor on the basis of RuleÂ 131(4).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the content is quite simple: when this directive was being drawn up, a discrepancy arose between Articles 7 and 8 and ArticleÂ 78, and today we are putting it right.
I should like to add some information for my fellow Members.
This directive obviously affects a large part of the economy in the Europe of 25 Member States.
Therefore, we who dealt with this legislation at the time are envisaging setting up a major investigation next spring to examine its implementation within the Member States and, where appropriate, to study any impact this legislation has had and hence the progress it has made within the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to make reference to the principle whereby Parliament defends democracy and the rules of the constitutional state.
While we know that the Constitution of Cyprus provides that, before the public prosecutor of the Republic of Cyprus may address Parliament, he must ask for the opinion of the Supreme Court, we have to check that he has done so.
It has been said that he did not do so.
I do not believe that Parliament can vote in favour of a motion that contradicts the legal order of the Member State.
Â Â  MrÂ Geremek, simply out of courtesy to you, I am going to consider your speech to be a personal statement, but you cannot resume the debate at this stage.
I give the floor once again to the rapporteur, MrÂ Lehne, and ask him not to reopen the debate, as this is voting time.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to explain what Mr Geremek has said.
The very simple reason behind it is that the Cypriot constitution includes a provision on the suspension of the immunity of members of the national parliament that is not to be found in the constitutions of other Member States.
In Cyprus, it is not the parliament that rules on suspension, but the Supreme Court.
As Mr Matsakis is a Member of the European Parliament, though, it is clear that, in accordance with the protocol on privileges and immunities, it is of course not the Supreme Court of Cyprus that is competent to rule on his suspension, but this plenary, that is to say, those who are assembled here today.
It was for this reason that the Committee on Legal Affairs, saving only one vote to the contrary, took the view that the proposal should be put to the House in its present form.
I ask you to endorse it.
Â Â  Thank you for that clarification.
I am not accepting any more speeches; I am sorry, but we are in the middle of voting.
Moreover, I will resume voting time without delay.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 166.
You know as well as I do that, no matter what the colour of your politics in this place, there is one factor that uniquely unites nearly all of us: whether black, blue, yellow, red or green, we all try our best to represent the people who kindly gave us this job.
In my region, the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, in the last election voters experimented and tried a different colour.
Indoctrinated by old adverts and TV celebrity, they believed that, as we say in the UK, the future is bright, the future is orange.
A few months later and alas, one of our new representatives disappeared from the scene and from this Parliament.
There are many concerns for his safety: some believed he had been kidnapped, others that he was a relative of Lord Lucan.
I ran a competition in the East Midlands offering a bottle of champagne for the first confirmed sighting of my illustrious but missing colleague Mr Robert Kilroy-Silk.
Alas, to this day the champagne remains unclaimed, and so as an unclaimed prize, I believe I should give it to the man himself.
Here is the said bottle of champagne.
Â Â  After that short interlude, we will now be able to carry on with our votes. However, do not abuse the patience of the President of the sitting.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report both for reasons of substance â its content and purpose â and because of the urgent need for it to be adopted.
The good proposals for directives on the table will be rendered pointless unless Article 78 is amended.
I feel, however, that the need for a clear, simplified legal framework, one that is consistent on the subject of public contracts, is sufficient grounds for adopting this proposal at the earliest possible opportunity.
Â Â  . I very much welcome the result of the vote on the correction of Directive 2004/18/EC of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.
In order to adjust threshold values in the award of public works contracts, the correction of this clerical error was necessary.
I would however like to observe that there is still, in my view, a need for improvement in the substance of some of the Directiveâs provisions, particularly in those relating to cooperation between municipalities and to the establishment of associations for a particular purpose by boroughs.
Mandatory tendering for such forms of cooperation is not practical, goes against the objectives of the directive and prevents boroughs from providing public-friendly services at a reasonable price.
I therefore regard it as urgently necessary that the directive be revised on the basis of practical experience at the beginning of 2006 in order to give attention to this matter.
I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already decided to consult interested parties about this.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Costa report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Bulgaria on certain aspects of air services.
The various bilateral agreements established in the field of air services are the main instruments whereby we can guarantee that our relations with third countries run smoothly, with particular regard to aviation safety.
Accordingly, and in light of the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Communityâs exclusive competence in this area, the Council has authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries aimed at replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement.
In Bulgariaâs case, the amendments proposed by Parliament are corrective in character and deal with taxation on air fuel, clauses on designation and pricing, and there is nothing in these areas to which we object.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Costa report on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Croatia on certain aspects of air services.
The various bilateral agreements established in the field of air services are the main instruments whereby we can guarantee that our relations with third countries run smoothly, with particular regard to issues of aviation safety.
Accordingly, and in light of the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Communityâs exclusive competence in this area, the Council has authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries aimed at replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement.
In Croatiaâs case, the amendments proposed by Parliament are corrective in character and deal with taxation on air fuel, clauses on designation and pricing, and there is nothing in these areas to which we object.
Â Â  The financial effect of the proposal to increase the fees payable to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has not yet been established.
The proposal will in any case have consequences for budget headings 3 and 2 of the new financial perspective for 2007-2013.
We are, on principle, unfavourably disposed to the EMEA being strengthened as an authority and being given an increased budget.
We have therefore voted against this report.
Â Â  . The Florenz report on fees payable to the European Medicines Agency is a good example of the way in which we should take on board the experience and the evaluations carried out by the Communityâs agencies.
The report before us follows a significant change in the powers of this Agency, which have not merely been changed but have in fact been extended.
It is therefore of vital importance that this Agency be given a solid and up-to-date financial framework.
The purpose of the amendments that were tabled was to clarify the principle of setting the fees payable to the Agency and reducing rates for traditional herbal medicinal products.
Accordingly, the rapporteurâs position is that the level of the fee should be commensurate with the actual workload involved in evaluating the products.
I therefore voted in favour of the Florenz report on fees payable to the European Medicines Agency.
Â Â  EU fisheries policy should be aimed at guaranteeing abundant fish stocks, quality food products for consumers and sound basic conditions for the European fishing industry.
EU fisheries policy has unfortunately been turned into a permanent policy for subsidising an unprofitable fishing industry that cannot survive by its own unaided efforts and without aid policy guaranteeing the fish stocks.
This prevents structures from being rationalised but not the depletion of stocks.
At the same time, the Icelandic example, with its developed ownership of fishing rights, shows that there are other methods that both protect fish stocks and help the industry adapt to new basic conditions.
Fisheries policy does not need to be aid policy.
EU fisheries policy should seek new directions whereby fish stocks are secured from depletion and, at the same time, the fishing industry is restructured.
Â Â  . The new fisheries protocol between the EU and the Comoros for the period 2005 to 2010 is the logical and predictable development of the previous agreement, and differs little from it.
Following the very good level of utilisation of fishing opportunities between 2001 and 2004, the new protocol proposes a reduction in the total number of vessels, despite an increase in the permitted annual catch from 4Â 670 to 6Â 000 tonnes.
In keeping with other fisheries agreements with Indian Ocean countries, the agreement between the EU and the Comoros is of great importance to the Communityâs tuna fishing sector, as it will equip the sector with the resources to meet the demands of the Community market.
Although the rapporteur has produced an excellent report, which I broadly support, I must point out that the new agreement reduces the number of Portuguese longliners licensed to fish in the area covered by the agreement.
I must also register my dismay at the Commissionâs failure to consult the Portuguese sector in the course of the negotiations relating to the proposal before us.
Â Â  . The new protocol for the fisheries agreement with the Comoros will be in force between 2005 and 2010.
It differs little from the previous protocol (2001 to 2004), which has been extended for ten months.
The adoption of this agreement will make it possible to provide fishing opportunities to Member State fleets operating in these waters, including Portugal.
From the EU side, it is calculated that each EUR invested by the Community in the agreement generated an added value of EUR 5.7, an impressive return on investment.
The number of purse seiners remains the same (21 Spanish vessels, 18 French and 1 Italian), while the number of longliners decreases from 25 to 17 (12 from Spain and 5 from Portugal).
This is due to the low level of utilisation during the previous protocol, which demonstrates that the distant water fleet has become ever smaller, as evidenced by the negligible size of the Portuguese distant-water fleet.
This protocol increases contributions from shipowners by 40% from EURÂ 25 to EUR 35 per tonne, and cuts the Communityâs contribution.
We find this unacceptable, as the Commission stated its intention to negotiate future protocols with other countries at the same rate for shipowners.
Â Â  . The new protocol setting out tuna fishing opportunities concluded between the Community and the Comoros for the period from 1Â January 2005 to 31Â DecemberÂ 2010 has raised a number of questions for Member States with fishing fleets as regards its viability.
Having followed the process carefully, I was struck by the fact that the negotiations did not involve consultation with the sector.
The Commission has taken this criticism on board and has reiterated the huge importance of continuing and stepping up dialogue with the fisheries industry within the framework of the partnership agreements.
The Commission has also stated its intention to hold talks with the tuna sector in autumn 2005, to address all of the relevant issues to the sector.
I should like to highlight the fact that the financial contribution has gone up from EURÂ 350Â 250 to EURÂ 390Â 000 per year.
More importantly, 60% of this amount is earmarked for measures designed to support the development of local fisheries.
I therefore have no objections to the rapporteurâs proposals.
Â Â  We approve of the initiative taken by the Council concerning the retention of telecommunication data for the purpose of giving the law enforcement authorities better tools in the fight against serious crime and terrorism.
Experience in Sweden shows that telecommunication data has been important in many serious crime investigations.
We therefore support the Councilâs proposal in principle.
The proposal presented by the Commission on 21Â September 2005 concerning the retention of telecommunication data opens the way for a debate on combating crime.
The Commissionâs proposal would give the European Parliament influence.
We therefore chose to abstain in todayâs vote in anticipation of a new position being adopted.
Â Â  We believe that the initiative by, for example, the Swedish Government on the retention of data processed and stored in connection with the provision of services such as telephone communications, text messaging, e-mail and the Internet etc for the purpose of combating terrorism and other cross-border crimes goes much too far in relation to the expected benefits.
The Member States should facilitate the exchange of information between each other in order more efficiently to combat these crimes.
That does not, however, require harmonisation involving uniform rules governing the way in which this huge quantity of data is collected.
In fact, the proposal gives rise to considerable misgivings about peopleâs legal certainty and is also in danger of entailing significant costs for the service operators.
In spite of its criticism, the report states, however, that harmonisation in this area is necessary but that legislation must take place not, as is currently the case, on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation but on the initiative of the Commission and through codecision on the part of Parliament.
The June List does not share that view.
Â Â  . We backed the proposal to reject this initiative, which, using the âfight against terrorismâ as its pretext, is an attack on the citizensâ fundamental freedoms, rights and guarantees.
The purpose of this proposal is to store communications data (telephone, SMS and e-mail) indiscriminately, systematically, and, from what we can gather, without any checks and balances.
As the rapporteur points out, this is an inappropriate and unnecessary proposal, which breaches the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
Quite apart from the countless doubts and questions as to the actual scope and effectiveness of this measure, this measure would, as far as the rapporteur is concerned, be tantamount to storing four million kilometresâ worth of files.
It is worth noting that this is not the first time Parliament has rejected such an initiative.
Yet the British Presidency and the Commission, despite widespread criticism, have presented fresh initiatives in this area this week.
Portuguese law provides for a security system which, in conjunction with the judiciary, already includes a balanced range of measures, rules and controls.
If the system is used judiciously and rigorously, and assuming it is given the required human resources, it will certainly be capable of combating crime, even the most organised crime, effectively.
Â Â  .At a time when several European countries are in the grip of the terrorist threat, it is unthinkable that the Member States should be called on to withdraw an initiative that is intended to ensure more effective cooperation, in order to ward off, trace, detect and pursue the perpetrators of terrorist acts and their accomplices.
To reject this initiative solely on the grounds that it comes from the Member States and not from the Commission is irresponsible, given what is at stake: protecting the safety of our fellow citizens.
Once again, this report is guided not by the interests of the general public, but by ideological considerations, with an attempt made, without revising the Treaties, to deprive the Member States of their powers more and more each day for the benefit of the Commission.
Being unable to rely on the people in the wake of the French and Dutch referenda, the supranational institutions of the Union seem to have embarked on a quest, outside the Treaties, to gradually seize the Member Statesâ powers, following the example of the landmark ruling pronounced on 13 September 2005 by the Court of Justice, which precisely authorises the Commission to legislate on criminal matters.
Finally, in the face of the terrorist threat, how useful are these delaying tactics based on a would-be breach of Community law, proportionality or the presumption of innocence?
That is why we have voted against this report.
Â Â  . The practical usefulness of the proposal for the EU-wide storage of communications data is very much a matter of doubt.
The blanket monitoring of all telephone calls, -mails and text messages without any well-founded suspicion cannot be justified on the grounds that it might, under certain circumstances, with a little bit of luck, or at some unspecified point in time, perhaps, help with the investigation of a terrorist attack.
To do so would be to accumulate an unimaginable mass of data, which, if the worst came to the worst, hard-pressed investigators would have to work through with a fine-tooth comb.
What is lacking is a well thought-out definition of which items of information are actually of use for the purpose of efficient and successful cooperation, resulting in an excessively comprehensive list which leaves too much room for interpretation.
Nor has sufficient attention been given to how this would be implemented in practice.
It is small and medium-sized enterprises that will be particularly hard hit by this initiative, for they lack the organisation and funding to cope with such mandatory storage.
What is particularly questionable is why there is no explanation of how industry is to be reimbursed its costs â which are expected to run to several hundred million euros â by the individual Member States.
The draft is legally dubious, may well be contrary to various constitutions, and runs counter to the EUâs declared goal of becoming an area of freedom.
It is also objectionable when, for the sake of preventing young people from being radicalised, there is control and censorship of the electronic media, while, at the same time, people are assured, in all seriousness, that the freedom of the press and the media are not being compromised â that is reminiscent of George Orwell.
Â Â  . My vote on the retention of data report reflects both my feeling as a London MEP that there is a necessity for the security services to have the most effective powers available to combat terrorism and protect the public.
In developing important retention of data powers, it is equally important to ensure that the powers are workable, are developed in close partnership with Internet Service Providers and that we achieve proportionality in relation to how long data can be retained.
It is clear in the light of the London Bombings that my own Government wanted to see effective powers to tackle terrorism and as a London MEP, I want to ensure these powers are both effective and proportionate, and that they help to the UK public safe.
Â Â  . I am broadly in favour of the thrust of the proposal tabled by the four Member States, and share the concerns expressed therein.
I also feel that, overall, it does not contain anything excessive or disproportionate.
Nevertheless, I voted in favour of the report proposing the rejection of the proposal by the four Member States, because while I welcomed the thrust of the proposal, the Commission is soon to present a thorough, comprehensive proposal on this issue, and I believe that this is the right way to make law on this issue.
At the present time, security must not be confused with securitarianism.
The retention of communications traffic data is not at all the same as bugging telephone calls; it is simply a matter of retaining the minimum amount needed for effective criminal investigation.
Although the strength of this measure does not specifically lie in prevention â although this element is a part of it â its usefulness in terms of criminal investigation is clear for all to see.
Accordingly, let us now hope that the Commission justifies the trust placed in it and, at the earliest opportunity, presents the proposal required to regulate this important area.
Â Â  Mr President, the introduction of a list of safe countries is a step in the right direction if we are to have a common minimum policy on managing the flow of refugees to Europe.
A minimum policy is all it should be, though, for the ultimate powers of decision on the recognition and admission of political refugees should still rest with the Member States.
That is why it is necessary for Member States to have the right and option, alongside the European list of safe countries, to use their own lists.
The rapporteur vehemently refuses to recognise this possibility, though.
This report has, in fact, one goal and one goal only, and that is to undermine the very principle of the list of safe countries.
That being the case, it will not come as a surprise to you that my colleagues and I voted against it.
Â Â  The June List believes that the Member States themselves should be free to decide the shape of their immigration and asylum policies as long as these are in accordance with current international law.
We do not wish to help create a Fortress Europe.
Nor should it be for the European Parliament to lay down which laws should apply in this area.
We cannot therefore support the Councilâs proposal, be it with or without the changes proposed by the report, and we have thus abstained from voting since the directive is part and parcel of devising a common policy for this area.
We have however voted in favour of many of the committeeâs amendments in order to emphasise our support for a refugee policy that is more humane than that expressed in the Council directive and that fulfils current standards laid down in international conventions.
Â Â  . This proposal for a directive represents the first step on the road to harmonising the asylum process at EU Member State level.
As our Group has pointed out, Parliamentâs report sets in stone some of the worst aspects of the agreement reached by the Council on the same proposal, such as the removal of the âsuper safe countryâ concept, which is criticised by the United Nations Commission for Refugees, and the possibility of appeal in the event of an asylum application being refused and the applicant being allowed to remain in the country until the appeal process has been completed.
The amendments tabled by our Group and our vote in plenary, however, are further attempts to remove other negative aspects, including:
- the rejection of a period of detention for asylum seekers, especially in âdetention centresâ for illegal immigrants;
- the rejection of the concept of âsafe third countryâ, because the analysis of a period of asylum should take account of each individual case; consequently, the idea of setting up an arbitrary list of countries should be rejected.
After all, on what criteria should such a list be based?
Â Â  . This report forms the framework for the European Union's common position on the sensitive question of dealing with the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
Despite the fact that the EPLP still have certain reservations concerning the Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler report, British Labour MEPs voted to support the report in the final vote.
We do so safe in the knowledge that any outstanding concerns or problems will be rectified by national governments in Council during the implementation stage of the new procedures.
We remain confident that a balance can be found in Council on the basis of some of the recommendations made under the consultation procedure in Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler's report.
Â Â  , . In general, we have to conclude that the report is in many areas a vast improvement on the Commission proposal.
During MrsÂ Liotardâs visit to the Italian refugee camp on the island of Lampedusa on 27 and 28 June 2005, she was able to see for herself how important it is for refugees to have specific rights.
If an EU Treaty can do something to improve the situation of those people, then we are in favour of such improvement.
We still have major misgivings about some sections of the Commission proposal, though, including, for example, the concept of âsafe third countriesâ.
We have, unfortunately, been obliged to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea, so, despite these concerns, we will nevertheless vote in favour of the amended proposal, because it can vastly improve the position of asylum seekers, because Amnesty International was relatively positive about it, and because we hope that it will put an end to the disgraceful Lampedusas of Europe.
Â Â  . This is an important and welcome report as it allows directly-elected representatives at the European Parliament to have their say on a crucial Civil Liberties issue following the political agreement reached by the Member States governments in Council.
I sympathise with the Rapporteur's view that international standards for the protection of refugees (including the 1951 Geneva Convention) should not be undermined and fully endorse the role of Parliamentarians in scrutinising the amendments proposed by the Council.
Nevertheless, given the fast changing international climate, the need for some flexibility to be retained at the national level in the listing of 'safe third countries' leads me to abstain on aspects of this report.
It is clear that we need a fair yet workable approach to the management of asylum, one which is sensitive to the needs of those fleeing political persecution, whilst guarding against possible abuse by others who do not have a legitimate claim.
I therefore welcome the steps taken by Council towards an integrated approach to asylum policy and look forward to further constructive proposals in this sensitive area.
Â Â  . In my vote on the Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler Report, I would like to express my concerns around the concept of âsuper-safeâ countries, by which the EU States would be allowed to draw up a list of third countries, which are deemed so definitely safe so that refugees' status would be automatically denied.
It is vital in my view, having practiced asylum law in the past, that we do not erode completely individual assessment for asylum seekers and the Geneva Convention's ânon-refoulementâ Principal (principal by which governments may not turn refugees away automatically without having their case heard or checking subjective or objective elements to genuine asylum cases).
Â Â  . The Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler Report, which this House has today adopted by a narrow majority, reflects the EUâs asylum and immigration policy in all its wretchedness.
By way of a response to the Councilâs proposal for a directive, which was characterised by nothing more than the desire to keep refugees out, the report enshrines in law a number of glaring deficiencies.
It incorporates the concept of the âsafe country of originâ, so that asylum seekers are denied the right to have their applications examined in the first place.
As regards the treatment of asylum seekers and âillegalsâ, the text makes no distinction between them, not even in relation to their being dumped in âdeportation centresâ.
It gives legal standing to the concept of âsafe third countriesâ, along with the criteria for them and a list of them, with the consequence that such things as the deportation of refugees from one country after another cannot be prevented.
I shall be abstaining from voting on it, for, even though the report does institutionalise the denial of rights to refugees, it does at least include a number of improvements to their lot over against the Council document.
The EUâs political dilemma has not gone away.
Its âFortress Europeâ policy puts the lives of more and more people at risk, while also depriving people of their rights.
An EU asylum policy that treated people as having dignity would be rather different.
Â Â  . The delusion that legislating on this issue is a simple process takes no account of the evidence that different legal systems produce different results, which may prove unpredictable or unwanted.
Take, for example, the issue of the suspensive effect of appealing against a decision not to grant refugee status.
This delusion also overlooks the fact that there are different traditions as regards the actual definition of refugee.
Take the difference between Portugal and the United Kingdom, for example.
These two aspects were the reason why I voted as I did on the report before us.
Given that all of the points I felt were key were rejected by the Left in Parliament, I was unable to vote for this report.
All that remains is for me to express my disappointment that the Leftâs obviously good intentions will, as often happens, produce an unwanted outcome.
A series of moderately flexible rules aimed at making the necessary adaptations to the various national legislations in no way undermines the need to ensure decent, humane hosting of refugees.
In fact, this is the right way of addressing justified concern over the refugee issue, and demonstrates a desire to find workable solutions.
Â Â  Parliamentâs changes, which do not force countries to refuse to handle applications from people from âsafe countriesâ, which demand shorter processing times and which would require asylum seekers not to be treated as criminals, are along the right lines.
However, the European Parliament voted against the Group of the Greens/European Free Allianceâs proposal totally to abolish the concept of safe countries and instead to follow international human rights rules on giving individual consideration to asylum seekers.
In all probability, the Council will take no account of the improvements voted for by Parliament.
When we vote today on this directive, it will instead be the Councilâs proposals, which are inimical to human rights, that we shall in practice be voting on.
I shall therefore vote against the proposals.
Swedenâs Green Party is opposed to a harmonised asylum policy because such a policy is in danger of becoming undemocratic and of precipitating the lowest standards.
The result would be both a bad bill and Parliament threatening to go to court citing illegal procedures.
Â Â  . Having had many encounters with refugees from Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Nepal, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, I appreciate that these poor souls do not come to our continent for fun.
Each set of parents and every child have their own story to tell â a story of despair and fear.
This draft directive is disturbing and is the ultimate proof that the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers are playing their own games and refusing to consult with the European Parliament.
They went against the spirit of the Treaties in concluding what I believe to be an ill-considered political agreement without consulting the European Parliament.
I therefore endorse Amendment 182, according to which the European Parliament retains the right to bring a case before the Court of Justice in order to verify the proposalâs legitimacy and its reconcilability with the fundamental civil rights.
I also support all amendments that intend to delete the concept of âsafe third countryâ from the proposal.
This notion is unacceptable in that it passes the buck from Member States to third countries and will inevitably lead to arbitrariness and political scheming.
Incidentally, who decides whether a country is (super)safe or not?
Is Afghanistan safe after the war?
Are Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan â two countries that are creaking under a totalitarian regime â safe countries?
Some people in Belgium believe they are.
Â Â  The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of MrÂ Kreissl-DÃ¶rflerâs report on the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (A6-0222/2005).
We are, however, aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmarkâs position.
Â Â  â The sitting is resumed.
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Mr President, I have something to add to todayâs Minutes, that being the fact that the written statement on rheumatic diseases has, today, already surpassed the two-thirds majority.
Three hundred and sixty-seven signatures had already been collected, and the figure reached 378 by noon today.
This written statement, of which I am the joint originator, calls on the Commission and the Council to include rheumatic diseases among the priorities for the EUâs Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
I ask that this sensational achievement be recorded in todayâs minutes.
Â Â  â MrsÂ Stenzel, what you are saying does not pertain to observations on the Minutes of yesterdayâs, that is the previous, sitting.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
- A6-0251/2005 by MrÂ Guellec, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development [2004/2256(INI)];
- A6-0246/2005 by MrÂ Marques, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions [2004/2253(INI)].
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to spend a few minutes presenting my report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development.
It is worth pointing out that there have been repeated and insistent calls from a large number of European regions over many years for this concept to be taken into account in EU policies.
The accession of 10 new Member States, which has manifested itself in a worsening of regional disparities and the emergence of new territorial inequalities, has singularly amplified the calls for this major necessity.
The draftsmen of the draft Constitution for Europe were well aware of this, since Article 3 of the draft Treaty refers to economic, social and territorial cohesion among the essential objectives of the EU.
The problematic fate of the Treaty could lead some of those responsible for regional policy, particularly within the European Commission, to show extreme caution against even referring to the necessity for territorial cohesion.
We do not consider this attitude to be justified and I hope, Commissioner, that you will share our viewpoint.
Indeed, the tremendous geographical, human and cultural diversity of the territory of the EU, within what is, when all is said and done, a relatively limited area, represents a unique asset on this planet, but, if we are not careful, it contains the seeds for major imbalances that are unbearable for those who view themselves as the victims.
This was demonstrated beyond all our fears, unfortunately, during the referenda in France and the Netherlands on the draft European Constitution.
It is probable that popular referenda organised on the same basis would have produced the same result in several other Member States.
That is why I wanted my report to contribute to finding answers to the questions raised.
How can we reconcile the citizens to the European project?
What is the future for Europe?
For our Europe.
One of the answers is provided by the cohesion policy, this policy of solidarity that is the original model for the EU and that sets it apart from a simple free-trade area.
Besides ensuring that it has the necessary resources, which assumes that it will be taken properly into account in the financial perspective 2007-2013, it is important for it to integrate the territorial dimension into all its aspects.
That is how territorial cohesion will come to represent a clear basis that all Europeans can understand for increasing cohesion within the territory of the EU.
More particularly in relation to the realisation of territorial cohesion, I will mention a few specific principles and measures.
The principles are as follows: the principle of equality between citizens throughout the territory, which in particular implies appropriate accessibility of services of general interest and services of general economic interest; integration of the territorial aspect into the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; multicentric development of the European territory; the role of small and medium-sized towns and their connection with rural areas; strengthening all aspects of territorial cooperation; supported decentralisation to the regions, which are best acquainted with the needs and potential of their territories; multilevel governance, and the participation of non-public partners.
One of the concrete proposals that we are presenting to the Commission relates to the implementation of three instruments.
First of all, we are proposing a mechanism for cross-fertilisation between sector-specific policies with a major impact on the development of the EUâs territories and regional development policy.
Next, new territorial indicators, in addition to gross domestic product, are needed to measure the development of a region and to assess objectively the obstacles to this development.
Finally, we need a system for assessing the impact that various Community policies have on territorial cohesion.
Another proposal relates to the drafting of a White Paper on the objective of territorial cohesion and in particular on how this objective is to be incorporated into the national strategic plans that the Member States are currently in the process of drawing up.
I hope, for my part, that tomorrowâs vote will translate Parliamentâs broad support into an ambitious territorial cohesion policy.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today sees the completion of a further stage in the process of conferring special status for the outermost regions, pursuant to Article 299(2) of the Treaties, which is based on the highly specific situation in these regions.
These regions are characterised by their remoteness, insularity, difficult topography, small size, mountainous nature and economic dependence on one sole product or activity, and the permanence and combination of these factors.
These are the characteristic features of what are referred to as the outermost regions, and are unique within the EU.
The fact of the matter is that it would be a grave violation of the principle of proportionality and equality were the outermost regions treated in the same way as the other regions of Europe.
The model of integration in these outermost regions must take account of their highly specific characteristics and must therefore be subject to adaptation, adjustment and in some cases derogation.
What is different must be treated differently, and the differences evident in the outermost regions have a very detrimental effect on their economic and social development, resulting in unacceptable competitive disadvantage and an inability to make the most of the benefits triggered by the internal market, the recent enlargement, the Lisbon Strategy and globalisation.
The fact is that the outermost regions have little chance of competing on a level playing field when the economic activities developed there are burdened by considerable extra cost, arising from, , transport, the absence of economies of scale and external economies, small and fragmented markets and the scarcity of qualified labour.
It is therefore of vital importance that we pursue measures aimed at stepping up the EUâs special treatment towards the highly specific characteristics of the outermost regions.
This is the thrust of the Commissionâs communication entitled âa stronger partnership for the outermost regionsâ, on the subject of which I had the honour and the exciting task of drawing up the report before us today.
The Commission is proposing a far-reaching strategy based on three priorities: competitiveness, accessibility and regional integration.
This strategy is set to be implemented under the revamped cohesion policy.
The Commission is also proposing the setting up of innovative instruments, such as the specific programme to compensate for additional costs, along with a wider neighbourhood action plan to aid integration of the outermost regions into the surrounding geographical areas, which will involve both transnational and border cooperation on the one hand and trade and customs measures on the other.
This is the backbone of the Commissionâs proposal to offset and reduce the severity of the main handicaps from which outermost regions suffer.
The main priority is to address the most serious of these handicaps, namely the remoteness of the outermost regions, which will be done by promoting the use of new information and communications technology, by facilitating transport links to the European mainland and by fostering the integration of the outermost regions in the surrounding areas to which they have always had their backs turned.
The second big idea is to promote the competitiveness of the outermost regions, which will be achieved not only in terms of the extent to which we reduce the significant extra costs inherent in being an outermost region, but also by means of decisive action on dynamic elements such as competitiveness, education, training, innovation, research, the information society and entrepreneurship.
On this last point, the Commissionâs proposal falls well short and this is its major weak point.
The problem is that Community policy with a potentially significant effect on the competitiveness of the outermost regions falls well short of what is required.
This is particularly true of policies designed to boost human capital, technological research and development, the environment, services of general economic interest and telecommunications.
For that matter, the Commission does not propose any special plans for those regions leaving Objective 1 on account of exceeding the 75% of the Community average in terms of per capita GDP.
Special phasing out arrangements from Objective 1 to Objective 2 are clearly called for in Article 299(2) of the Treaties.
The Commissionâs proposal is, however, a major step in the right direction, because it is timely, because it correctly establishes its strategy and its priorities and because it proposes innovative policies.
We welcome the Commissionâs initiative, but we urge it to be more ambitious and to take on board the suggestions and comments made in my report.
I could not finish without a word of thanks to those people whose contributions have enhanced this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by making some comments on Mr Guellec's excellent report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development.
I highly appreciate your support for promoting the concept of territorial cohesion in our regional policy.
I wish your enthusiasm was shared by all our Member States, but, as you know, the current version of Structural Funds draft regulations has weakened the Commission's proposal on territorial cohesion.
This is true, for example, for urban issues.
The proposals foreseen by the Commission as compulsory have been rendered merely optional by the Council.
Another example is the substantial decrease in terms of financial resources regarding the new European territorial cooperation objective in the Financial Perspective, according to the latest compromise proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency.
In this proposal it amounts to only half of the amount proposed by the Commission.
So I should like to encourage you to reinstate our initial ideas in the negotiations.
I see the work on territorial cohesion as something that we must take forward on two fronts.
First, through greater emphasis on territorial cohesion in the next generation of cohesion programmes.
It must be said that in the draft Community strategic guidelines â which were adopted by the Commission at the end of June â we asked Member States and the regions to pay particular attention to a balanced territorial development when preparing their future regional programmes.
In this context, the future national strategic frameworks represent a key opportunity for promoting development models respectful of territorial balance.
Moreover, the draft regulations foresee provisions for the specific character of certain territories and they focus on certain thematic priorities which contribute to the territorial development by improving their accessibility or by fostering the development on research and innovation poles.
Secondly, I believe we can advance our work on territorial cohesion through promotion of exchange of experience, best practice, benchmarking and also analytical work.
As you know, Espon â the research programme â is helping us to improve the understanding of territorial trends and the impact of sectoral policies on the enlarged Union.
In addition, other networks, such as Interact or Urbact, contribute to this.
I feel confident that these initiatives can be continued in the future as well.
With regard to the regular reports on economic and social cohesion carried out by the Commission, I propose to devote part of the fourth cohesion report â due for publication in 2007 â to the territorial cohesion issue.
I would also like to inform you that my services are currently preparing a working paper on the cities' contribution to growth and jobs in the regions.
This paper will complement the Community strategy guidelines and will be presented to the informal ministerial meeting on sustainable communities in Bristol in December of this year.
Finally, I am also convinced that we can take forward our work on territorial cohesion through better coordination of Community policies and national policies.
So, once again, I am grateful for the emphasis you put on the role of territorial cohesion in our regional policy and I am willing to take forward the territorial cohesion issue both in the context of the new programmes and in our exchange of best practice.
I now turn to Mr Marques' report, which is also excellent.
It is about stronger partnership for the outermost regions, with a number and diversity of recommendations which are clear proof of the strong commitment and dedication of the European Parliament to this important subject.
I am very pleased that the Commission succeeded in establishing a good foundation for a strong partnership with the outermost regions, at both political and technical levels.
I strongly believe that the last meeting we had in La RÃ©union is visible proof of this partnership.
As you said, we have indeed proposed a significant number of measures to promote economic development of the outermost regions in line with our communication of last year.
Our proposals cover many areas such as cohesion policy, agriculture, fisheries and research.
Those proposals are currently under negotiation in the Council and Parliament.
I sincerely hope that we can swiftly come to an agreement.
Some important proposals are still under preparation; in particular, rules on national regional aid, which the Commission will adopt by the end of 2005.
I share your view that much remains to be done.
Your draft resolution constitutes an important milestone, which we will take into account in our daily work.
In our next report on the outermost regions, possibly in 2007 or 2008, I plan to assess the progress made.
It is also indispensable to have a coherent approach across all Community policies that takes account of the specific situation of the outermost regions and which needs to be complemented by appropriate national policies.
As Commissioner in charge of the coordination of questions related to those regions, I am committed to ensure that all measures taken by the college are adapted to the specific situation of these regions.
Your motion for a resolution identifies a significant number of topics to which I will refer in my closing remarks.
With regard to financial perspectives and the cohesion policy and the outermost regions, we certainly welcome the UK Presidency's stated aim of reaching a consensus on the package of regulations as soon as possible so that it can be finalised very quickly once the outcome of the future financing negotiations is known.
I pay tribute to Parliament, which quickly recognised the urgency of the situation and voted through the regulations at first reading by an overwhelming majority and with very constructive amendments.
An urgent deal on the budget is particularly important for the outermost regions.
Such a deal must include, in our view, the special programme that the Commission has proposed for the outermost regions in order to compensate for the additional costs those regions have to bear.
I repeat that we will do everything we can to get support from the Member States for those ideas.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to focus on the second report.
For any policy to be implemented successfully, it needs a good strategy, as we are all aware.
Yet a good strategy on its own is of little worth without the policy instruments needed for its implementation.
The Commission deserves praise for the strategy document that it has presented to us.
What the document reveals is that the repeated expressions of concern and the calls from various Community bodies for stronger partnerships with the outermost regions have been duly taken on board and followed up.
As regards farming, I was the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, and was delighted to see the unanimity among its members on the broad issues raised by the document, on sectorial questions and on the specific recommendations and suggestions that I formulated in order to make improvements and plug gaps, with regard to banana, sugar, milk and fruit and vegetable production.
I welcome the fact that the rapporteur responded positively to all of the crucial questions put forward by the Committee and congratulate him on his outstanding work.
I also share his concerns as regards the uncertainties concerning the policy instruments required to give the proposed strategy tangible form, such as those instruments designed to solve the current impasse on the financial perspective for the next programming period.
Without such practical measures, this debate will be little more than a statement of good intentions.
I want to believe that the Commission and the Council will be consistent with the positions that they have thus far held and I hope that their actions will live up to their responsibilities and the expectations that have been created.
If so, this will be to the benefit of the social, economic and territorial cohesion of some EU regions suffering from the greatest disadvantages; and if not, the objectives of our Union will not be met.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to applaud Mr Marques for his outstanding report and for taking on board the proposals tabled by the Committee on Fisheries contained therein.
As draftsman of the opinion of that committee, I should now like to say a few words of interest to the fisheries sector in those regions.
Although I broadly welcome the content of the Commissionâs communication in relation to this sector, I feel that it should have gone a little further.
I therefore put forward a range of points that I consider essential in the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.
There is no doubt in my mind that POSEI-Fisheries should be updated, in keeping with POSEI-Agriculture, on which I was rapporteur, owing to the specific characteristics of the sector and the regions, and the constantly developing situation there.
I wish to highlight the highly vulnerable nature of the fishing zones there, of which we are all aware, and the social and economic importance of fisheries in some of these regions.
The truth is that although there is a great deal of water, it is well known there are not many fish in the waters of the outermost regions.
Added to which is the lack of a continental shelf, meaning that fishing essentially takes place on what are referred to as âsubmarine hillsâ.
On this basis, I am of the opinion that the Commission must always apply the precautionary principle where appropriate, unreservedly and without delay.
We recall, for example, the recent proposal to ban deep-water trawling off the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, a position that we advocated in Parliament.
Nevertheless, the Commission must give preferential treatment to the outermost regions when it comes to access to maritime resources with a view to safeguarding traditional fishing methods.
I also feel that the Commission should place limits on fishing methods that may be harmful to ecosystems.
As for the financial aspect, I should like to remind the Commission of the vulnerable nature of the outermost regions.
The Commission should therefore maintain, in the European Fisheries Fund, the level of aid currently granted under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, the level of aid for the processing industry and the derogations that have thus far enabled the outermost regions to modernise their fleet.
It should also look to increase compensation levels in respect of the additional costs involved in marketing certain fisheries products.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to comment on MrÂ Guellecâs report on territorial cohesion and should like to begin by thanking him for the extremely constructive cooperation we have had while the report was being drafted.
The big difference between now and 15 to 25 years ago is that the regions are very active in their own development.
They no longer wait for someone else to enable them to develop their economies and societies and create a good life for themselves.
They wish to do these things themselves.
It is not so strange, therefore, that territorial cohesion has become an important concept.
What it does is sum up this feeling and this desire that exist throughout Europe, including in the city suburbs, that everyone is needed on the continent of Europe, that everyone is important and that all regions have something to contribute.
This needs to be obvious to all of us in the EU.
That is why the concept of territorial cohesion, whereby we hold our continent together and everyone feels they are participating, is so important.
There is a huge amount of knowledge throughout Europe, and that is something we must make the most of if we are to develop our continent.
If we do not do so, we shall be making a mistake.
The whole of Europe has an incredible amount of wealth, which is often to be found out in the regions or city suburbs.
We have a great many natural resources which, when they are turned to good account, are helpful not only to the regions but also to the whole of Europe.
We are also concerned here with energy, which is what provides us with export income.
We also have very extensive natural resources that we can use in tourism and for recreation.
A lot of people are employed in these areas, which are ones that we can develop and that our good for the whole of our continent.
We also have variety in Europe.
We have minorities and immigrants from all around the world whose energy and knowledge must also be made full use of.
I therefore wish to emphasise a number of points in the report that I think are important.
The first is that the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies must embrace everyone.
We must ensure that they extend to include all regions.
Otherwise, we shall not be able to develop the whole of Europe.
The second is that we cannot accept sectoral policy areas, which have the opposite effect of merely strengthening the centre.
Thirdly, I want to say how important it is for the various policy areas to be valued in Europe so that we obtain genuine territorial cohesion.
Take the transport area, for example.
We must ensure that we have transport routes enabling the whole of Europe to be developed.
I think that this is a constructive report, and I really do hope that the Commission will listen to what Parliament has to say.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we simply changed places because Mr Galeote will be along later.
I should like to start by saying that we have before us two excellent reports, one by Mr Guellec and one by MrÂ Marques, both of whom I should like to congratulate.
With regard to the report by Mr Marques, I should like to point out very briefly â because I do not come from one of these regions and my honourable friends from such parts know more about this matter than I do â that the Union needs to give priority to the issues of the outermost regions by honouring the commitments which we all made within the framework of the Treaty on European Union and I am sure that the Commission, insofar as it is able, will proceed in this direction.
I wish to comment at greater length on the report by MrÂ Guellec and to say that the Commissioner was indeed right; the draft regulations on the Structural Funds contain many ideas relating to the question of territorial cohesion, an issue which is dealt with in Mr Guellec's report.
For its part, the European Parliament will indeed do what it can in its negotiations with the Council to ensure that this principle of territorial cohesion is promoted through the regulations on the Structural Funds.
However, we must not forget that this principle was a principle which was first introduced in a text of the Treaty on European Union within the framework of the adoption of the draft Constitution.
It was an idea which was jointly promoted by your predecessor, Mr Barnier, and the Committee on Regional Policy of the European Parliament at the time.
The endeavour was indeed a success, but we have nonetheless, as you know, been unable as yet to get the Constitution ratified.
I should like to say that the ratification of the Constitution, in relation to the principle of territorial cohesion, will give us many more tools than we presently have at our disposal for proceeding beyond regional policy and seeing territorial cohesion within the framework of competition policy, within the framework of the transport policy of the European Union and so on.
Consequently, Commissioner, I should like to come back to what was also said yesterday in this Chamber.
You for your part â the European Commission â and we for our part must take advantage of this period of concentration on the European Constitution in order to enlighten the citizens of the European Union and ensure that this Constitution, which contains positive provisions for the citizens themselves, is adopted as quickly as possible, so that we have more substantial legislative tools in our hands.
Of course, as long as this period does not turn from a period of concentration into a period of hypnosis.
That is the huge wager before us and I think that both Parliament and the Commission need to make every possible effort not to waste valuable time and to ensure that the European Union acquires the Constitutional Treaty to which it is entitled and which it deserves.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say to MrÂ Guellec and MrÂ Marques, both personally and on behalf of my colleagues in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that it was a great pleasure to work on their reports, which, of course, are essentially acceptable to us.
For my part, I would like to focus more particularly on one of the points raised in MrÂ Guellecâs report, but which also affects MrÂ Marquesâs report, as MrÂ Guellec has examined the role of urban centres and the surrounding areas.
For a number of years we have readily been talking â I myself represent a town, Rheims in Champagne â about the concept of catchment areas.
Catchment areas are zones covering both a town, whether small, medium-sized or large, and all the surrounding rural areas up to 5,Â 10,Â 15,Â 20, or even, to take the French capital, Paris, as an example, up to 200Â kilometres outside it, where a number of people travel every day between their homes and their workplaces.
It was therefore vital, in order to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, for the European Union to fit the bulk of its assistance into the framework of harmonious, consistent territorial development.
These catchment areas, in particular, must play a central role, which is currently not the case.
I have mentioned travel; it is clear that, in all catchment areas, there are housing problems.
Housing is more expensive in the town centre, and cheaper on the outskirts; people choose to live in the outskirts because it is quieter there, or because housing is cheaper.
All of this results in problems with daily commuting.
We are seeing depopulated villages just a few kilometres from our towns, while, in some neighbourhoods, there is appalling overcrowding.
We are experiencing security problems, and I could go on.
It is therefore perfectly natural that, in order to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, we need to ensure that there is real cohesion within these catchment areas, between the town centre, the suburbs, the immediate surroundings and the more remote areas.
Can we overcome these problems without too much difficulty?
The answer is obviously no, in view of the large number of players involved.
These include housing associations, decision-makers in the employment sector, and, of course, political decision-makers operating at local, regional and national level.
We are all aware of the difficulties involved in harmonising the positions of the various political organisations.
In this regard, MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the European Union currently has a central part to play, in providing a stimulus to create, over the years to come, true cohesion in all of these areas, and harmonious development within these catchment areas.
Finally, MrÂ Marques, I have already mentioned the respect I have for your report, and the support that we give it.
I hope that, in all of our outermost regions, whether in the areas surrounding small towns, larger towns or in any other areas, the EURÂ 1Â 100Â 000Â 000 that we obviously hope will be released will enable us to realise the harmonious development for which we all hope and pray.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, although I propose to devote my remarks primarily to Mr Guellecâs report, Mr Marques can take note of the fact that I regard âterritorial cohesionâ as applying also to the outermost regions.
I am much obliged to Mr Guellec for what is a really good report, and I believe that its being an own-initiative report makes it a good means whereby we in this Committee of the European Parliament can develop our own approach.
Good teamwork has made it possible to produce this balanced but forward-looking report.
If we all agree that we want â and let me say, Commissioner, that I hope you will succeed in your efforts to get the Member States to join in this â to communicate Europe to people where they are and in their day-to-day lives, then territorial, along with social and economic, cohesion is of enormous importance.
It will help to secure the acceptance of the principle that all EU citizens should be valued equally and treated fairly irrespective of the region in which they live; it will also help to get this incorporated in all our important documents, for example those relating to the Structural and Cohesion Funds, but also in the implementation of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies.
We do well to make partnership a primary principle â partnership between cities, their and rural areas, but also partnership between all political levels.
As I see it, the coherent, harmonious development of all the EU countries, the regions and the cities, largely depends on this, and I want to express my strong support for the idea that a regionâs state of development should be assessed by reference to more than just its GDP; other territorial indicators â educational, scientific, cultural and sporting provision, for example, as well as the incidence of unemployment or the state of the infrastructure â need to be included, for viewing the region as a whole gives a much clearer picture of what it is like.
That is a significant step towards fairer assessment, and will eventually enable the people who live there to have a better understanding of Europe and of the regulations that we enact, and I get the impression that there is still a desperate need for far better communication between us and the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  . â Article 299(2) of the Treaties states that, taking account of the structural, social and economic situation of the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments, specific measures to support these regions should be adopted.
These regions are characterised by permanent structural disadvantages which set them apart from the other regions of EU Member States.
These structural disadvantages are compounded by their remoteness, their insularity, their small size, their difficult topography and climate and by their dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development.
This is referred to in the Treaties, and for this reason, the specific characteristics of the outermost regions must be mainstreamed across all Community policies, bearing in mind their development needs and the need for effective implementation of economic and social cohesion, a principle that is also enshrined in the Treaties.
Furthermore, a specific Community programme to support these regions, bringing together all of the dispersed measures should be set up, which must be granted adequate financial resources within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
This will contribute significantly towards solving the regionsâ problems.
Many of the characteristics and needs of these regions and their populations can and should be addressed.
Of these, I wish to highlight the need to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks and the activities of fishing communities in these regions.
To this end, it is essential that exclusive control of access to their waters, pursuant to the relevant national jurisdiction, should coincide with its exclusive economic zone.
We must consider implementing a range of permanent support measures in the area of the environment, given that most of the territory of these regions is made up of nature reserves and other protected areas.
Lastly, we should support measures to support training in traditional handcrafts, local production and tourism.
Â Â  . Mr President, the British Deputy Prime Minister has been here this week, so it is timely to have a report centred on two of his pet subjects: regionalism and gobbledegook.
My plain-speaking constituents have no time for regionalism and I doubt if they would be interested in strategic spatial impact evaluation procedures.
Mr Guellec clearly does not pick up simple messages from ordinary voters.
His fellow Frenchmen rejected the EU Constitution, yet it is an essential ingredient of his report.
That is no surprise, for the rapporteur's own website has a whole section devoted to the Constitution, including a table of key dates.
The most recent key date for MrÂ Guellec is 29 October 2004, when the Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome.
The day of the French referendum, 29 May 2005, is not even a minor detail for him.
He said that territorial cohesion becomes an essential objective of the EU in the Constitution.
Sadly for him the Constitution is not an essential objective for French and Dutch voters.
What is territorial cohesion?
The rapporteur can only tell us that the first formal attempt at a definition comes from the Commission.
Who ever heard of such nonsense: to suggest a project and then attempt a definition?
How typical of this mad European Union.
The rapporteur says that regions are the best qualified level to determine needs.
He should visit the so-called region that I represent.
The regional authority in Exeter cannot possibly know what is best for Gloucester, Swindon or Penzance, all many miles away.
The ordinary people in those areas do not think so.
Perhaps Mr Guellec is not bothered what those ordinary people think, as long as he can emphasise that his beloved EU Constitution strengthens the role of the regions.
The only problem for him is that ordinary people in his own country do not agree with his approach.
He certainly achieves cohesion in one respect, because ordinary people in all parts of the continent will be equally confused by his report, and he is equally out of touch with all of them.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, implementation of cohesion policy stems directly from the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Communities. It is stated therein that as a Community we shall strive to reduce disparities in the level of development of individual regions and the degree of underdevelopment in less privileged areas.
This also applies to rural and remote areas. It is therefore entirely appropriate for us to consider this very important issue, and I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work.
Cohesion policy involves more than implementation of the provisions of a treaty.
It is about long-term thinking and strategic action.
It is also an expression of solidarity within the Union.
Clearly, when considering territorial cohesion we should not adopt a simplistic approach, along the lines that everyone is entitled to everything in equal measure.
We are all aware that we should be striving to achieve equality between citizens, which is quite another matter.
The existing differences between Member States and their regions mean that the Unionâs cohesion policy must adopt a variety of approaches.
The policy must be ongoing in nature, and have commonly agreed aims and appropriate limits in terms of time periods and areas covered.
I would also like to emphasise most strongly that it must have suitable financial resources at its disposal if it is not to be meaningless.
In this connection, the difficulties experienced in reaching agreement on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective give reason for concern.
The delays and the real threat of a delay to the Unionâs budget could have very serious consequences.
In my view, it would be advisable to return to sound source material that is politically neutral in nature.
I have in mind the Europa 2000 Plus study referred to by the rapporteur, though it does of course need updating.
The priorities set in the strategic guidelines published by the Commission in July are due to be endorsed by Parliament and the Council.
They should then serve as a basis for genuinely cohesive preparation by the Member States of documents aimed at the future, namely the National Strategic Reference Frameworks.
In general, I feel that the priorities laid down in the Commissionâs document are sensible.
The urban aspect is worthy of mention.
MrÂ Beaupuy referred to it just now, in connection with the role played by metropolitan centres.
Other important factors are entrepreneurship and the knowledge-based economy.
I would also like to say that genuine coordination of work related to the various Union documents is essential.
We need more than lip service to the idea.
The proposal concerning the relevance of potential accelerated work on the White Paper on territorial cohesion should be considered seriously.
It does rather seem as if little account has been taken of the actual situation in the new Member States in the work undertaken to date.
According to the latest figures published concerning Union expenditure over the last year, two countries of the old Fifteen, namely Greece and Portugal, head the list of net beneficiaries with reference to GDP.
The new countries lag far behind.
I should add that in term of absolute sums Spain comes top.
It is not my intention to criticise anyone in any way whatsoever, but simply to dispel the myth that enormous amounts of money are being handed out to the new Member States.
MrÂ President, the Union cannot look to the future with optimism if it lacks a properly run cohesion policy.
I would remind the House that there can be no European cohesion without European solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, the Guellec report does not impress me, for three reasons.
First of all, the EU has no power in the field of spatial planning, yet it presumes to chart a course for this on the back of the dead Constitution.
That is wrong and it shows utter contempt for the electors of Europe, not least the electors of Mr Guellec's own country, who handsomely rejected the Constitution.
Secondly, territorial cohesion is clearly being advanced for the political objective of bypassing and downgrading the entity of the nationâstate.
It aims for territorial integration.
There are obvious political and constitutional issues here, which are perhaps more obvious to me, given where I come from, than to some others.
I do not want my part of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, treated instead as part of the territorial whole of the island of Ireland.
That would offend and it would defy the settled political will of Northern Ireland's people.
The EU must act within the constraints and parameters of that reality.
Thirdly, within the context of cohesion funding, talk of territorial cohesion in my region is somewhat ironic, since we were excluded from cohesion funding from its inception, while our neighbour in the Irish Republic was included.
The real route to cohesion was equality of access to funding, but that was denied to Northern Ireland, while the south of Ireland benefited to the tune of over EURÂ 2Â billion for its infrastructure.
Thus, it is so much nonsense to now talk grandly about securing equality of treatment between territories.
The EU had its chance to give such equality of funding to Northern Ireland for necessary infrastructure but it failed, by making national statistics instead of regional need the threshold for access.
Â Â  Mr President, unless I am misinformed, I have had Mr Galeoteâs three minutes added to my speaking time, but I shall defer to the servicesâ judgment on that; in any case, I do not need all three of them, but I would be glad to lay claim to some of them.
I, of course, take a completely different view of MrÂ Guellecâs splendid own-initiative report from that of Mr Allister, who spoke before me, for Mr Guellec is right to emphasise territorial cohesion as one of the EUâs strategic goals in terms of the promotion of harmonious and balanced development throughout its territory.
It is in this respect, as he also rightly points out, that the EU marks itself out as something more than just a free trade zone, and quite right too.
The eastward enlargement brought a new and significant dimension to the challenge of cohesion, as the EU had never before had to face such a marked increase in disparities.
It is true to say that the new, enlarged EU is now characterised by a great deal of geographical and cultural diversity, and this is what distinguishes it from comparable major economic areas such as the USA, Japan or Mercosur.
As such diversity does, however, constitute one of the EUâs great growth factors, it needs to be maintained as European integration proceeds.
This means that the policies that affect the EUâs spatial and urban structure must promote its territorial continuity, without â let me emphasise â standardising local and regional identities, as these have a vital role to play in enriching the quality of life for the public as a whole.
If I may express this in more precise terms, the territory that now comes into being does not abolish national, regional or local areas.
On the contrary, the object of spatial planning at European level is to make the best possible use of every specificity as a source of growth.
The rapporteur is right to say that the EU does not as yet possess any competence for spatial planning, for no provision is made for it in the treaties, even though it is a thorny issue for the Member States.
I am persuaded that the reduction in the number of goals for the coming planning period will make the new regional cohesion policy more coherent. The new regional cohesion policy, with fewer targets to meet in the next planning period, must â and will â gain new dynamism in facing up to the challenges that await it, so that the objective of territorial cohesion, too, will be achieved, and, indeed, if need be, independently of the budget funding provided for regional and cohesion policy, which we still hope will be substantial enough to enable us to perform the tasks set us.
With this end in mind, we must, on the one hand, focus on the Communityâs strategic guidelines for cohesion, while also taking territorial specificities into account, and, while I am on that subject, I have to say that I take a rather sceptical view of the rapporteurâs proposals, according to which, alongside GDP, new territorial criteria and indicators need to be created in order to evaluate a regionâs development and the obstacles to it.
We have learned from previous planning periods that this is where we face the great risk of such additional criteria, when brought into play by one or other party, all too easily degenerating into a wish list that can no longer be objectively evaluated.
It is indeed the case that economic, social and territorial cohesion make interconnection not only between the regional, state and European levels, but also between the Communityâs various policy areas necessary.
It is the regions, however, that will in future remain the appropriate territorial level for the implementation of cohesion policy, in line with the principles of subsidiarity and decentralisation.
It is with this in mind that both Parliament and the Commission have â and rightly â favoured explicit decentralisation and concentration along the lines of âone fund, one programmeâ, and so I am led to take what is actually an optimistic view of the next planning period.
Â Â  â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating my friend, Mr Marques, on his excellent report and to thank him for being amenable to incorporating contributions made by other Members of this House.
I should also like to congratulate Mr Guellec on the quality of his report.
As shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Regional Development, I tabled a number of amendments, most of which were adopted, and proposed that my political group support the report and most of the amendments tabled in the vote, both in committee and now in plenary.
Despite our different perspectives and approaches, we came together in support of, firstly, the strategy proposed by the Commission for the sustainable development of the EUâs outermost regions, as regards the priorities, the instruments and, most importantly, the setting up of a specific programme to offset the additional costs relating to the specific, permanent constraints suffered by the outermost regions, such as remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products and activities and the limited scope of local markets, and, secondly, the establishment of an action plan for the wider neighbourhood.
Although we were in favour of the strategy, we offered a number of criticisms or reservations, relating to the following areas: firstly, the absence of measures and financial resources to follow up the Commissionâs statements and proposals; secondly, the use of per capita GDP as the sole criteria for these regions to qualify for the new âConvergenceâ objective of the revamped cohesion policy; thirdly, the use of population criteria for the distribution of budgetary appropriations set out for the specific programme to compensate for additional costs; and fourthly, uncertainty over the action plan for the wider neighbourhood, given that it is unclear how this will fit in to the future âEuropean territorial cooperationâ objective of the revamped cohesion policy and of the relevant âNew Neighbourhood Policyâ.


Consequently, in line with the view expressed by the rapporteur, I would suggest that the outermost regions deserve to be treated as a special case in view of their specific constraints, under Article 299(2), regarding the conditions for access to the Structural Funds, whereby priority financial support should be given to them, irrespective of their income level.
I would also advocate an increase in budgetary appropriations relating to the specific programme to be redistributed fairly on the basis of the constraints affecting them.
Furthermore, the action plan for a wider neighbourhood should be clarified within the framework of the future âEuropean territorial cooperationâ objective and the Unionâs new âNeighbourhood Policyâ.
The concept of neighbourhood should encompass both neighbouring regions and countries such as Morocco, Cape Verde and Brazil, and countries hosting large communities of immigrants from the outermost regions that retain strong traditional ties.
I therefore support the adoption of this report, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as it represents a further step in the right direction in response to the Commissionâs welcome proposal.
In this way, once the financial perspective has been adopted, the conditions will be in place for the sustainable development of the outermost regions, and the successful promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my sincere appreciation of both MrÂ Guellecâs and MrÂ Marquesâs reports; I shall focus particularly on MrÂ Guellecâs.
One of the European Unionâs basic aims concerns cohesion policy, especially since the latest enlargement and in view of the imminent future accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
The European Parliament has distinguished itself precisely on cohesion policy during this first part of the parliamentary term, since it has approved all the regulations on regional policy for the 2007-2013 programming period.
On the other hand, the constant, fruitful cooperation and dialogue with Commissioner HÃŒbner, which I have personally experienced as rapporteur on the Cohesion Fund regulation, has led to a firm resolve on the part of the Commission and Parliament not to accept reductionist solutions.
A credible and effective cohesion policy cannot, indeed, exist without adequate financial instruments, and that is why we are hoping for a prompt decision on the financial perspective.
It is necessary to avoid having European aid concentrated in just a few areas, thus adding to the existing disparities within a single region.
Instead, measures must be adopted that are widespread, harmonious and thorough in less-developed areas, as MrÂ Guellec has rightly shown.
I also agree with the rapporteur on the importance of towns, especially small to medium-sized ones, as motors for territorial cohesion.
That is the point I tried to make by tabling amendments, which Parliament then adopted, to the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, for which I was shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
The amendments also emphasised the pivotal role of the urban dimension in developing the immediately adjacent rural fringes.
I also welcome MrÂ Guellecâs proposal of using specific territorial indicators alongside the usual parameter of GDP for measuring a regionâs development.
I also believe that they should be used periodically to provide impact assessments on ongoing Community programmes.
Among all the positive effects that such working methods would bring about, I would mention the further transfer of responsibilities to local authorities and actors, who must increasingly be seen as leading players and promoters of development, and greater flexibility at the implementation stage of measures, leading to a more appreciable effect on the territories.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am delighted that we have the opportunity today to debate and vote on two important reports on the regional policy of the Union.
I should like, if I may, to focus my attention on the report by Mr Guellec on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development.
My colleague's report has, in my opinion, one very important paragraph: I refer to paragraph 3, which states that Parliament calls for 'regional development to be founded on programmes which guarantee equality of treatment between the EU's territories, while preserving their diversity, which notably implies appropriate accessibility of services of general interest and services of general economic interest'.
What services of general interest are we talking about today?
The services which the European Commission insists on liberalising?
How will these services continue to be services of general interest and how will they help territorial cohesion?
To give you a spectacular example, I am sure that you know that Greece, on the basis of Community legislation, will shortly be privatising its national airline.
I wonder to what degree this will help territorial cohesion, knowing the peculiarities of the Greek state.
How can a private individual replace the state as a general interest service provider?
Obviously, we are proceeding with a firm step, in this instance, towards both the decline of the citizens in outermost areas who expect a service of general interest, and of the workers who risk finding themselves unemployed in the Community of the future.
We are also discussing territorial cohesion here at a time when, in Brussels, the governments of the Member States can hardly even agree on the financial perspectives, with the result that the Member States will be in for a few surprises.
So let us not bury our head in the sand.
Territorial cohesion is desirable but on the right bases, bases which relate to social opinion, not on the basis of market pressures.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, one of the European Communityâs strategic aims often referred to by advocates of integration is to reduce the disparities in the level of development of the regions of Europe.
Citizens of the new Member States placed great importance on this and still do.
Along with economic and social cohesion, territorial cohesion has an important part to play in achieving that aim.
In view of the differences in development across the 25Â Member States that will soon become 27, actions concerning transport, tourism, environmental protection, research and innovation are particularly important.
Territorial balance can be ensured by strengthening the ranks of small and medium-sized urban centres.
In these areas, urban planning should provide for the development of housing stock, transport networks and the regeneration of land previously put to industrial use.
This approach will allow the periphery and surrounding rural areas to benefit from the economic growth of the centres too.
At present, dynamic economic and urban growth is only taking place within the largest urban centres, namely the metropolitan areas.
Unfortunately, the developmental needs of smaller urban units are being disregarded, so the growth is accentuating inequalities instead of reducing them.
Satisfactory territorial development in all Member States of the Union can only be achieved through the implementation of a decentralised model of spatial development.
One key feature of such a model is that it is based on a network of towns with different economic, social and cultural potential.
Another important feature is the establishment of permanent links with rural areas.
The Lubelski region I come from is one of the largest in Poland.
It accounts for 8% of the territory of my country and 5% of its population.
There are 40 mainly small and medium-sized towns in this region, the largest being Lublin, the regional capital.
The latter has a population of approximately 400Â 000 inhabitants, and the population of the other town varies between 20Â 000 and 70Â 000 inhabitants.
Over half the population of the region lives in rural areas.
If the unsatisfactory level of infrastructure is taken into account also, the Lubelski region could serve as an example of the practical implementation of territorial cohesion in a decentralised manner.
One can but hope that the activities of the Unionâs decision-makers will result in more than mere fine words and intentions, as was the case in the past.
Specific measures are needed, and provision should be made in the Unionâs budget for the next few years, and also in the long-term Financial Perspective.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the Commission for the good work it has done, for defining the special nature of the outermost regions better, and for meeting the needs of those areas, which suffer particularly from their geographical location in terms of development and market competitiveness.
It is good that increasingly effective measures in support of those regions are being assessed and that a wider neighbourhood action plan is also foreseen in the Marques report, to encourage trade between those regions and their adjacent markets.
The wider neighbourhood action plan is a good opportunity both to establish economic, social and cultural links with those countries that host emigrant communities from the outermost regions and to bring down the barriers that limit trading opportunities with the surrounding geographical areas, such as the West Indies, the Americas and Africa.
In its communication COM(2004)0343 of 26 May 2004, the Commission set itself two goals: to reduce the difficulties of access to the outermost regions, not just in relation to continental Europe but also from one region to another, and to improve the competitiveness of businesses.
This is the goal we must achieve: help them to grow so we can all grow.
That, if you like, is also the meaning of the Lisbon Strategy.
In the present context, however, efforts must first be directed towards having some certainty on the financial perspective, because only then will we be able to judge whether the funds available to the regions will allow for the fair distribution of resources in line with the requirements that the Commission has outlined.
In conclusion, then, I welcome a greater commitment to the outermost regions and a stronger partnership for these regions, so as to enable them to escape from isolation and to make them increasingly competitive on the common market.
Â Â  Mr President, I know I have one minute, and you would not let me go over it, would you?
You just conspire against me, as the previous President did, to engage in some kind of institutional bullying.
But we shall leave that to one side.
I am glad of the opportunity to place on record the deep resentment of my constituents in the East Midlands at the attempts by Brussels â aided, let it be said, by a supine British Government â to divide England by imposing artificial regions.
It will divide the English nation and undermine our nationality.
Well, I have news for you: it will not work because the people in, for example, Derby, in the East Midlands, have no special affinity with the people of Lincolnshire.
The regions are artificial.
They are spurious. They have no identity.
They will not work either because the English people do not want them.
They voted against in the north-east by 90% in the one opportunity they had, and they will do so elsewhere.
We English are very tolerant.
We are prepared to subsidise the Welsh, the Scots and most of the nations here.
We do it with resignation.
We will not tolerate being robbed of our nationality and our identity.
So carry on with your policy.
Carry on trying to divide us, because what you will do is inflame the English and English nationalism and we will assert ourselves and we will insist on governing ourselves again.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Kilroy-Silk.
The speaking time allotted to you is nothing personal.
It is not my will, nor my responsibility.
I am just reading the list in front of me, as you very well know.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate MrÂ Guellec and MrÂ Marques on their excellent reports.
As I come from one of the outermost regions, I will concentrate on MrÂ Marquesâs report, which focuses on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions, because it makes it possible, thanks to some in-depth work, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the European Unionâs activities in those regions.
I give my full support to the rapporteur, who, while noting that the most recent proposals drafted by the Commission in favour of the outermost regions are promising, nevertheless calls on it to be more active in exercising the right of initiative accorded to it under the Treaties, with regard to the cohesion policy, of course, but also to other Community policies and more generally to areas important for the development of the outermost regions.
It seems to me to be essential to point out once again, at a time when everyone is preoccupied with the financial perspective and the reform of EU regional policy for the period 2007-2013, that the great majority of the derogations implemented or proposed for the outermost regions can in no way damage competition or the fundamental principles of Community law.
With regard to the programme to compensate for the additional costs incurred by the outermost regions, the Commission has quite rightly proposed to provide it with EURÂ 1Â 100Â 000Â 000.
However, echoing one of my amendments, which was adopted in the Committee for regional development, I would stress that these funds should be devoted solely to the outermost regions and that their allocation should not penalise any of those regions.
With reference to another of my amendments that was adopted in committee, I hope that the wider neighbourhood action plan will have a specific budget aimed at transnational and cross-border cooperation and that the much hoped-for coordination between the assistance funded by the ERDF for the outermost regions and the assistance provided by the EDF for their ACP and OCT neighbours will finally come into effect, with or without the inclusion of the EDF in the budget.
In conclusion, I think this is an opportune moment to state, with modesty, but without an inferiority complex, my conviction that the outermost regions of the EU are just as important as its centre.
I sincerely hope that this vision is shared by all the Member States, old, new and future.
Indeed, in an increasingly globalised world, there is no benefit for the enlarged Europe in doing without its outposts in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, Latin America or the Indian Ocean.
That is the position that Parliament has always defended and will, no doubt, continue to defend.
Have no doubt that the overseas populations will be particularly grateful to you for this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while I welcome MrÂ Marquesâs work, I would like to comment more specifically on the report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development.
First of all, I would like to congratulate MrÂ Guellec on his excellent work and the pertinence of his comments on the concept of âterritorial cohesionâ, which seems to me to be at the heart of Community regional policy, which is now referred to more and more frequently as cohesion policy.
The Constitutional Treaty makes territorial cohesion an objective of the European Union, in the same way as social cohesion and economic cohesion.
Thus, even though the ratification process experienced some difficulties, as we know, this constitutes official recognition of the relevance, currency and importance of the territorial aspects of regional and cohesion policy.
The latest enlargement also confirms the urgent nature of this.
In my opinion, regional policy primarily aims to reduce development disparities at local and regional level and thus constitutes an indispensable counterbalance to convergence and economic competitiveness policy.
However, cohesion does not stand in opposition to convergence and competitiveness: these concepts must be and remain complementary.
While ensuring that the development of Europeâs most dynamic regions is not hindered, so that they can play their part as the engine of the European economy, the main aim of the cohesion policy is to help the most disadvantaged and underdeveloped regions.
The reformed regional and cohesion policy must also be integrated in the Lisbon Strategy but, above all, ensure solidarity and equality between areas and the visible continuity of the efforts previously agreed to in the old Member States.
Therefore, to achieve harmonious and sustainable development of the European territory, we must attack territorial imbalances.
We must take into consideration the diversity of the European area and the often cumulative handicaps of certain areas, be they natural, historical or demographic, such as low population density or imbalances in the age pyramid or in the active population.
We must measure the additional costs faced by these regions and help them so that these areas have the same development opportunities as others and so that the people who live there are not penalised.
Of course, that requires resources and I hope that the financial perspective will soon reach a favourable outcome, so as to give the regional policy an adequate budget and to help the areas that still need it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Marquesâs report once again bears witness to the attention that the European Parliament pays to the outermost regions.
Indeed, the Ligios report on the French overseas departments, back in the second parliamentary term, laid the initial foundations for the concept of the outermost regions, a report that inspired programmes already intended to compensate for remoteness and insularity.
During the current period of uncertainty about what will happen after 2006, Parliamentâs support for the outermost regions is very valuable.
SÃ©rgioÂ Marquesâs report is very much to the point in this regard.
Indeed, although the European Unionâs support has made possible a number of achievements in our underdeveloped regions, there is still much to be done.
That was also the conclusion of the 11th Conference of Presidents of the Outermost Regions, which took place on the island of RÃ©union at the beginning of this month, in your presence, Mrs HÃŒbner.
On that occasion, I advocated a reversal of approach to relations between the European Union and the outermost regions.
Over and above what the European Union brings to these regions, we must recognise the worth of what they bring in terms of European added value.
Let me remind you of some obvious examples.
It is the outermost regions that put Community shipping in its position as world leader.
The geographic situation of Kourou in Guiana makes a significant contribution to the competitiveness differential enjoyed by the European space industry.
So, there is the ocean, space, and we could also cite the exceptional biodiversity of the outermost regions, their importance for improving knowledge of climatic phenomena and their contribution to cultural diversity.
The great distance from the continent in which the outermost regions are integrated and the geographic proximity of other continents with which the European Union has agreements also sometimes give rise to contradictions.
I would like to conclude, MrÂ President, by saying that this dual identity provides a real prospect for the sustainable codevelopment of these areas, all of which face major challenges.
The EUâs ability to respond to the question of the development of its outermost regions will bear witness to its ability truly to be a decisive player in fair and controlled globalisation.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, this debate is particularly important for the new Member States of the Union and especially for my country, Poland.
To put it bluntly, any changes in the policy on providing equality of opportunity for poorer Member States must not have a negative impact on the new Member States.
If the Union is to demonstrate solidarity and unity in practice, it must respond to the aspirations of its new members on the basis of existing principles.
At the same time, this policy must take greater account of the needs of small and medium-sized towns and regions than has been the case in the past.
To date, the tendency has been for metropolitan areas to receive the lionâs share of Union funds and resources.
There is some justification for this, but it has meant neglecting smaller local government structures at a lower level, even though they were in even greater need of support.
I fear that the proposed changes we have been hearing about this last year are aimed exclusively at extending the flow of funding to the poorer countries of the old Union.
We have nothing against that, but at the same time we would like it to be possible to make use of all the existing opportunities and support for the new Member States.
I have every confidence that the Commissioner will be the guardian of a Europe of equal opportunities within the Commission.
I can assure her that she can always count on our support on these issues.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the European Union has been pursuing its policy of social and economic cohesion for the last 30Â years, with notable cohesion not meaning putting the brake on the development of the most powerful and dynamic of the regions of Europe.
On the contrary, it means increasing the potential for development of the weakest and enhancing their opportunities in terms of competitiveness.
The European Union is called on to react creatively to recent and future enlargements.
For example, cohesion policy must be adjusted appropriately in response to new conditions and challenges.
Conditions in the enlarged European Union are different.
Consequently, existing actions aimed at social and economic cohesion need to be expanded, and become horizontal.
More emphasis should be placed on the need to reduce the differences emerging between centres and the hinterland, between metropolitan areas and small and medium-sized towns, and between towns and rural areas.
The new conditions also make it necessary for local authorities to be much more involved in efforts to do away with the disparities between all the social groups mentioned.
The democratic deficit will not be reduced without the active participation of representatives of regional and local communities in the implementation of Community programmes.
I would remind the House that in JanuaryÂ 2003 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the role of local and regional authorities in the European Union.
It was laid down in this resolution that not only should local and regional authorities be more involved with the implementation of Union policies, but that they should also contribute to the drafting of such policies.
Extending cohesion policy to include territorial cohesion confirms that cohesion policy as implemented across the length and breadth of the Union is one of the European Unionâs key policies.
I should like to add that I believe Community provisions should place more emphasis on partnership.
I have in mind partnership between authorities at different levels and also joint activities increasing effective use of European financial instruments.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Parliament showed its desire to give special assistance to remote and peripheral regions when it voted in July on a major package of cohesion policy measures.
However, in July, the Committee on Regional Development adopted the own-initiative report drawn up by Mr SÃ©rgio Marques, in response to two Commission papers on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions.
The report called for support for the outermost regions and for areas that are important to their development: agriculture, fisheries, competition and state aids, enterprise policies, services of general interest and services of general economic interest, taxation, customs measures, environment, energy, research, technological development, vocational training, transport, trans-European networks, new information and communication technologies.
It is to public transport that I would like to turn.
Public transport is important to all our local communities, and in Scotland ferries provide an essential service for some of the European Union's most peripheral and vulnerable communities.
Tomorrow I will be welcoming to the European Parliament a delegation from the CalMac trade unions, who will be meeting the transport Commissioner.
As I said yesterday, presently these ferry services are being put out to tender in communities where they are the sole mode of transport connecting island communities to the mainland.
Under the latest Commission proposals for land transport public service obligations, public administrations will be given flexibility over tendering processes and will be able to award certain services to in-house operators directly.
Why are lifeline ferries being treated differently from trains, trams and metros?
There are no trains, trams and metros in Scotland's peripheral, island communities.
Given the Commission's general position on the needs of the outermost regions, its position here would appear to be contradictory.
I urge the Commission to clarify its position.
Lifeline ferry services are too important to be ignored.
Â Â  Mr President, that the outermost regions need our support is self-evident.
The Marques report offers many good proposals for strengthening the infrastructure of, for example, isolated islands or mountainous regions.
Structural policy of this sort is yet another expression of European solidarity and equality of opportunity.
What I particularly like about this report is the balance that it has acquired now that the unreasonable demands are gone from it.
What makes the rapporteurâs concept credible is that it takes Parliamentâs existing structural policy conception as its foundation.
Its consistency and the reasonable demands for the coming period notwithstanding, I do see danger ahead in the likelihood that, in future, far less money will be available for structural policy, and this leads me to believe that structural policy on the present models will, in a few yearsâ time, be obsolete, and we will need to look for new ideas as to how, with less money, to carry on supporting Europeâs regions â whether that means a policy of subsidised loans, of guarantees, or one with a greater emphasis on key infrastructures and core projects.
In future, we will have to give more attention to the question of how and where subsidised investment actually does attract more investment, and whether our use of investment subsidies in isolated areas might not in fact result in an ever-increasing need for support.
Our eventual goal must be a policy with an overall greater emphasis on Europeâs ability to compete.
Much as I welcome the Marques Report as a first step towards a realistic outlook, we need to move even further away from indiscriminate ongoing subsidies and towards economic growth that maintains its own momentum.
If we are to do that, the EU needs more encouragement to move in that direction, not least from those who make regional policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU is not only a political project; it is also a project that is synonymous with solidarity and should be based on economic, social and territorial cohesion.
As an area that cuts across all areas, territorial cohesion should be mainstreamed in all EU policies, so that we do not fall into the trap of exacerbating the differences between the existing 25 Member States and those that are on their way, whom I should like to take this opportunity to greet.
We must break down some of the barriers faced by the outermost regions and invest in a sustainable development model that takes account of the disparities between not only Member States but also regions, even within the same Member State.
The purpose is therefore to give tangible form to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, without making the mistake of achieving efficiency and competitiveness by promoting an unequal Europe.
It is essential that we do not use per capita GDP as the sole eligibility criteria for the Structural Funds, which is after all the classic indicator.
Other indicators must be used, as a matter of priority, such as the amount of activity in research and innovation, the level of education and training, the extent of diversification of productivity in the area and the unemployment rate.
Subjecting a regionâs actual needs to an indicator that is often determined at national level is notoriously error-prone.
I should like to draw your attention, Mr President, Commissioner, to the issue of phasing out in certain regions, 19 of them in all, which since enlargement have acquired the status of being statistically wealthier, whilst their actual economic situation has seen no improvement.
This is a serious problem affecting regions such as the Algarve, in Portugal, from where I hail, one of the outermost regions in terms of the European mainland, which also suffers from deep internal disparities, quite apart from the fact that it is surrounded on all sides by Objective 1 areas.
For this region, just as for all of the other 18, a balanced solution must be found whereby they remain eligible while structural problems are still apparent, and they are helped to achieve more balanced development.
The Union needs to find a response to the challenges that enlargement has placed before us.
That response must be characterised by solidarity and responsibility and requires territorial cohesion and the political courage to create the conditions whereby the EU can become a prosperous area, without discrepancies between north and south, east and west, between mountainous areas and outermost regions.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to refer to the report by Mr Marques, whom I warmly congratulate on the work he has done.
I refer to the particularly remote island areas which we also have a duty to support and not to abandon.
To exaggerate somewhat, and this goes slightly beyond the boundaries of the issue, I would say that we have a duty to support every resident of the European Union living in difficult areas under difficult living conditions.
In my country, in Greece, many people live in island areas, which may not be particularly remote but where living conditions are difficult and the people there often remain totally cut off for fairly long periods of time, especially in winter.
The European Union is the country of solidarity.
All its citizens have the right to education for their children, job security, a healthy life, healthcare, recreation and everything that urban residents can enjoy.
If we abandon the people in remote regions and they are forced to leave their villages, noÂ one else will ever go to live there, resulting in ecological deterioration, devastation and destruction.
These people are doing us a favour by living there.
We need to give them solace. .
The region is the foundation of Europe.
If we start to abandon these people to their fate without a second thought, then the destruction of the European Union will come about.
They are doing us a favour by living there under these difficult conditions and we must return the favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, territorial cohesion is a strategic aim of the European Union, and one of the most important of these, as it promotes harmonious and unified development.
Nonetheless, it remains a dream.
In particular, following the recent accession of 10 much poorer countries, the disparity between the development of individual regions has become even more marked.
For example, if the British Inner London region boasting 270% of average GDP for the Union is compared with the Lubelski district in Poland whose GDP is barely 30% of average for the Union, one can appreciate how much still remains to be done.
The European Union needs a Community strategy for cohesion, and the territorial aspect should be taken into account when implementing all Community policies.
All aspects of territorial cooperation should be strengthened.
I refer to cooperation at cross-border level and also at inter-regional and supra-national levels.
Stronger cooperation and partnership between urban centres, their periphery and rural areas is also needed.
In a European Union founded on solidarity, regional development must be based on programmes that ensure equal treatment for all regions.
In practice, this means that the citizens should have appropriate access to public services and to services provided in the general economic interest.
The House is well aware that we are nowhere near attaining that objective.
Consequently, the failure to agree on a new budget for the Union and the lack of a new Financial Perspective are particularly worrying.
Actions aimed at achieving territorial cohesion across the Union must be improved, and Parliament must become more involved in monitoring progress towards genuine territorial cohesion.
If this does not happen, disparities in the development of individual regions are bound to increase.
Ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you to help create a cohesive Europe founded on solidarity.
I am sure none of us would advocate a Europe in which we were subdivided into the rich and the poor.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I share the positive assessment of the two reports that we are examining, which reveal the considerable differences that exist among our regions and show how these differences have become even greater with enlargement.
Territorial cohesion is the basis for lasting social and economic cohesion.
If we want to aim at having an area of growth, well-being, stability and justice that embraces all the 500 million inhabitants that make up the European Union today, it has to be a primary objective.
If it is so difficult, however, to make more slowly developing regions progress, what will happen when events that are completely out of the ordinary strike one of these regions, events that may result from climatic factors, fires, floods or earthquakes?
We have seen on our television screens what has happened on the other side of the Atlantic in highly developed areas like Louisiana or Texas.
On our own doorstep we have the situation of the regions in Romania where the flooding of recent weeks has led to death and despair.
If the European Union is not there when it is needed â because in actual fact, apart from a Solidarity Fund that hardly has any money available at all, we do nothing â if Europe is not there in those cases, when does it expect to be there?
What can a Europe that has not yet reached agreement on the financial perspective, a Europe in which six governments of large countries are calling for further reductions in their financial commitments, promise to those countries and those peoples who have believed in the European dream?
Well, I think we need to reflect on that, because that is what our fellow citizens are expecting and that is what we are duty-bound to do for our future and for that of our children.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the most efficient ways of implementing community policies is to strengthen the cohesion between regions with different levels of development.
This is something we must do to achieve the most important objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, such as increased competitiveness, more jobs, a strengthening of social cohesion, togetherness and solidarity as well as securing sustainable development.
Cooperation and cohesion between regions contribute to stronger integration; they create the foundation of sustainable development in each region and facilitate the universal use of best practices.
They enable the regions to cooperate in various ways within the framework of regional cooperation across borders, between states or larger geographical entities.
Exploiting heterogeneity and the national, regional or local opportunities may increase our workload, but if we consider the task on a European scale, it promises more substantial results and larger benefits, and it is definitely worth the effort.
The government must also take part in the national, regional and local cooperation.
Dialogue, the exchange of opinions and a lively relationship between the three levels of nation, community and region are essential prerequisites to cooperation, as are the public and private sectors.
Development strategies are built on good partnerships that involve consultation, active participation by all partners, combined efforts with the relevant authorities, social partners and the organisations of the civil society including non-governmental organisations.
Regional cohesion implies equal treatment of the various European regions, while not losing sight of their individual geographic and demographic characteristics.
Its fundamental objective is to raise the standard of living which in turn is a precursor to the equal treatment of citizens.
The economic and social convergence of the regions helps the cause of gender equality in all areas and at all levels.
To get there, we have to initiate dedicated programmes and fight all forms of discrimination.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to thank both rapporteurs, MrÂ Marques and Mr Guellec.
As Commissioner HÃŒbner has already said, territorial cohesion is under pressure, and she was actually asking for this Parliamentâs support.
There is every reason to repeat this request in this House, for when we study last weekâs OECD report on the regional differences, we see that 40% of growth is realised in less than 10% of the regions.
We know that competition on a world scale requires that a distinction be drawn between regions, top regions and regions of excellence, which are mentioned in the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development.
Although that may be the case, knowledge is one thing, but innovation in the regions, production and marketing are quite something else.
In short, specialisation within the regions is necessary.
There is nothing wrong with it, but the strategic actions plans requested by Parliament and the Commission that are in line with the Lisbon objective are tailored to national scale.
It is now important in this Parliament to highlight once again, and safeguard, the territorial, or regional, dimension, certainly now, with a view to the future, that the new objective 2 funds and the resource and development funds will be combined, or will, at least be deployed together.
That is why I support Mr Guellecâs idea of reviewing the regional contribution in 2007 in the form of a White Paper or otherwise.
What will then be the state of play as regards this multi-level approach, or this decentralised focus, for that matter?
On a final note, there are, fortunately, regions developing that often take on cross-border tasks in a new context.
In my region, I have seen Eindhoven, Louvain and Aachen, located in three countries, do exactly that.
So, although territorial dimension and cohesion are important, they are also being restyled.
In that way, we have to help think ahead in respect of these opportunities that are vital across the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an undisputed fact that, without economic, social and territorial cohesion between the regions of the Union, we shall be unable to meet the internal and external challenges which we face.
How successful can our fight for a competitive and social Europe with quality of life for all its residents be if structural inequalities between its regions continue to remain acute and territorial peculiarities continue to constitute a factor of delay and exclusion for numerous European areas?
In the enlarged European Union, with the rapid increase in regional inequalities and acute intra-regional inequalities, we need a dynamic and effective regional policy, which not only must reach the poorest regions of the Union, but also must help to bring about a balanced relationship and integrated development between urban and rural areas in each region, while at the same time strengthen inter-regional cooperation.
The budget which will be allocated in order to apply regional policy and cohesion policy must respond to the risks which are now visible.
The role and importance of territorial cohesion must not, under any circumstances, be downgraded.
In the new programming period, it is of fundamental importance that sectoral policies which aim for integrated regional development be better coordinated and new territorial indicators be adopted, together with GNP, which will allow development to be calculated and obstacles to development at regional level to be identified and evaluated.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, I should like to begin by thanking MrÂ Guellec for his report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development.
The report is being discussed at a time when work on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is ongoing, and when the Council is considering cutting the resources devoted to the European Unionâs regional policy.
I trust the outcome of this debate will be that most of the resources the Commission proposed should be devoted to regional policy in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective will escape cuts, in particular as concerns the new Member States.
I should also like to endorse the rapporteurâs view about the importance of territorial cohesion to regional development.
I come from the Mazowsze region.
It is true that this is the richest region in Poland, as evidenced by the fact that we have the highest GDP per head of population in the country.
At the same time, Mazowsze is the region with the most marked internal differences.
According to estimates of GDP per head of population, it is likely that in the seven years between 2014 and 2020 Mazowsze will exceed 75% of the average GDP per head of population for the European Union, and will no longer qualify for support from the Structural Funds.
Nonetheless, many parts of the region will remain characterised by a very low level of development.
I have taken Mazowsze as an example, but the same is true of many other regions in the old and new Member States.
I therefore hope that the European Union will devise additional instruments for use in such situations, and that territorial cohesion will become an important aspect of the Unionâs future regional policy.
In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur for highlighting the role of spatial planning in cohesion policy, as it often goes unrecognised when planning regional development.
Â Â  Mr President, for two hours, many Members of the European Parliament from 25 different countries, using twenty different languages, have been expressing their views on regional development issues.
Commissioner HÃŒbnerâs presence in this debate is very important for all of us and I would, of course, like to acknowledge the work of the two rapporteurs, Mr Guellec and Mr Marques.
I believe that the two reports demonstrate a European reality which is very different to that of other territorial political entities and models.
It would say that the European Union is characterised by a lack of territorial continuity.
We are essentially a small peninsula off the great continent of Eurasia, with a very distant peninsular and island presence.
It is very different, for example, to the great North American quadrilateral, which is enormously consistent, and it has great territorial diversity, which makes it very difficult to remain competitive compared to other similar territorial entities.
Recognition of this regional reality and these regional policies is very important.
I am a representative of an island region, an outermost region, very distant from the centre of Europe, but, as Mr VergÃšs said earlier, this type of region presents a different reality and aspect, since they take Europe out into the great oceans, the Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, in a different manner.
But it would be impossible to try to redirect the whole of this population â we are talking, for example, in the case of the outermost regions, about 4 million inhabitants, who face difficulties competing in the Unionâs great internal market â solely by means of economic protection measures.
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals it has made and, of course, express my support for the proposals of our rapporteur, Mr Marques, on the development of these regions within the context of a great European Union cohesion policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Guellec and my compatriot MrÂ Marques on their excellent reports.
What emerges from these reports is that the stakeholders share a view of an ideal Europe that sees the priority of cultural diversity in their regions as the most important element of the EUâs development model.
Regional policy is therefore a separate initiative and must not simply be subject to replicating the implementation of national policy at national and European level.
Regional policy is an area of concepts, policy measures and action, which takes the relevant parts of national policy and adapts it to its own objectives and strategies.
Regional policy in the EU has always been seen as something of a focal point, given public policy does need to intervene; after all, not everything is resolved merely by means of a functioning market, as some would still have you believe.
Regional policy is the strongest way of ensuring territorial cohesion.
Consequently, if the resources at its disposal become weakened, selfish interests will prevail and solidarity will be the loser, and without solidarity the feeling of belonging, the key element characterising European identity, will not be able to flourish.
I therefore add my voice to the calls for the Commission to draw up a White Paper on this objective of territorial cohesion and to create a system of gauging the impact of Community policy on territorial cohesion.
This has become even more of a priority, in my view, owing to the impact of the phenomenon of globalisation, given that some EU regions will be successful and others will lose out.
In these new circumstances, regional policy requires a new driving force and for this reason I wish to commend the Commission for stepping up the integration of territorial issues into existing Community policies.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin, if I may, by congratulating Mr Marques on the thorough work that he carried out and wish to thank him for the attention he gave to the Azores perspective.
Community policies have presented many challenges to the outermost regions.
There have been welcome developments in some of these, such as restrictions placed on free access to the waters off the Azores, but also cases of incomprehensible backtracking on others.
An example of the latter is the proposals to amend the specific supply arrangements proposed by the Commission, which, if implemented one day, would lead to total economic paralysis in the Azores.
We are opposed to the ban on shipment of the only product covered by the âcontradictoryâ specific shipping arrangements, along with new arrangements designed to ban the shipment of any product containing goods covered by these supply arrangements, in breach of international and Community law governing rules of origin.
The setting of insignificant quotas as regards quantities and products solely destined for exotic destinations such as Morocco, which has no traditional business links with the Azores, at the same time as a ban on shipments to traditional markets such as the Portuguese mainland, the United States and Canada, would be a sick joke if it did not feature, in black and white, in one of the Commissionâs regulations.
The procedures put forward by the Commission are, in any event, out of step with the structure of the internal market, impossible for small businesses with simplified tax arrangements to put into practice, deeply discriminatory and of an unprecedented administrative complexity.
The President of the Commissionâs statement that he accepts decisions made by the national European justice system to reject precautionary measures to stop shipments from the Azores is a very welcome sign.
It is now crucial that, in the same way, all remaining legal provisions proposed are carefully reviewed.
I therefore appeal for common sense to prevail, so as to ensure that the interests of a European cartel are not confused with the general interest and that a root and branch review can take place of the Commissionâs legislative proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to make five brief remarks.
I support both reports as they are well written and cover the most important points.
My first remark is that I like the way in which the reports focus on one fund and one programme, as this streamlines the way in which we conduct our business and makes it more effective and less complex.
That is a very welcome approach from both rapporteurs.
My second remark concerns the territorial indicators.
Coming from Finland, I think it very important that we do not just focus on GDP but broaden our view and look at how difficult it is to get to a place.
I welcome the rapporteurs' proposals on that point.
My third remark is that I am disappointed there is no mention of the northern sparsely populated regions in the reports.
I urge anyone who has not been to Lapland to go and see what a real outermost region looks like.
This was mentioned in Article 218 of the Constitution, and it is unfortunate that it is not going to be adopted on time.
My fourth remark concerns the agencies.
Agencies and the decentralisation of agencies are part of regionalisation.
I do not mind that the Food Agency went to Parma â I can live with a Chemicals Agency â but we must be rational.
As part of a rational regional policy we should look at where the seat of the European Parliament should be.
I am not sure that it is good regional policy to fly or take the train to Strasbourg once a month.
Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs for including competitiveness and Lisbon in the reports.
All in all, I support them.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity of thanking Commissioner HÃŒbner for the fact-finding missions that she keeps undertaking in various parts of the Union.
The basic point I would like to make about the report is that you cannot have âmore Europeâ for less money, and so it is, to say the least, desirable that we should come to a speedy and realistic agreement on the Financial Perspective.
The report itself, as is only right and proper, makes demands for an increase in economic and social cohesion in line with territorial cohesion, so that every citizen of the EU will be able to rely on the best possible state and political structures in making a success or his or her own life.
What can the EU do about this?
For a start, it must establish a framework for the balanced economic, social and territorial development of the geographical area of the Community as a whole.
Secondly the EUâs sectoral policies must therefore acquire this new territorial component and with it added European value.
Thirdly, the Communityâs diversity needs to be promoted, with the various regions supported in their specific interests, strengths and weaknesses for the sake of a polycentric regional policy.
It is through such an all-embracing approach by EU policies, enhanced by the territorial component and with subsidiarity maintained, that we will be able to move the EU a significant step further down the road towards becoming a Union of all citizens.
Particular attention needs to be given to disadvantaged regions such as rural mountainous areas, for which suitable indicators will have to be devised if we are to have a better picture of what their actual disadvantages are, for which existing models and calculation methods, such as, for example, per capita GDP, are not sufficient.
There must also be a greater emphasis on the simplicity and practicability of Community policy if its effective implementation and application in every EU region is to be guaranteed.
This is one instance where the âless is moreâ principle is particularly applicable.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the main aims of territorial policy, as is correctly pointed out in the two reports, is the application of the principle of equality among citizens regardless of where in the European Union they live.
Particular attention needs to be paid to the 9Â 400Â 000 inhabitants of the 284 islands of the European Union: 3% of the total population living in an area of 95Â 000Â km2.
Economic development in these areas is affected by their isolation and the additional costs that that causes.
In many cases, these islands are mountainous and they are also less-developed outermost regions.
Their average per capita GDP in 2004 was 72% of the EU average and in most cases lower than that of any other area in their respective countries.
It must be pointed out, however, that those logistic difficulties do not necessarily equate to unfavourable economic circumstances.
Such handicaps should potentially, in fact, be turned into advantages, opening the door to new development opportunities.
These islands are part of our Unionâs natural heritage and are particularly suitable for many kinds of activity, such as tourism, cultural and leisure pursuits.
Amongst other things, with the development of a knowledge-based economy â a major Community policy objective â it is no longer closeness to raw materials or to major markets that leads people to choose where to live, but rather the natural beauty and amenities of the surrounding area.
In that respect, the availability of infrastructure and essential facilities become decisive factors.
Therefore, after introducing the âone fund per programmeâ principle in the financial perspective for 2007-2013, we need to promote the territorial cohesion policy as an instrument that adds an essential resource, as these two reports have rightly done, and include it among the priority aims of the European Unionâs cohesion policy in its broader sense.
Â Â  . Mr President, that was an excellent debate on both reports and one to which I have listened carefully.
With regard to Mr Guellec's report, I have taken note of the strong support in this House for the recommendations it puts forward: to consider territorial cohesion as a major element in the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; to give a boost to all dimensions of territorial cooperation; and to place greater emphasis on cooperation between urban centres, suburban areas and the countryside, particularly those with specific disadvantages, so as to contribute to the development of sustainable communities.
I am very pleased that we share many ideas.
Let me respond to those few ideas on which I think we might have difficulty in finding a solution.
First, with regard to the adoption of new territorial indicators, alongside GDP, to measure the development of regions and evaluate obstacles, I would remind you that there are no standardised and generally-accepted indicators in the field of territorial cohesion and, as you know, any new indicator needs to be accepted by Eurostat.
There are currently only a small number of indicators available at regional level that have been harmonized: GDP, employment, unemployment and population data.
Secondly, I agree that more work needs to be done in this area, but we must be realistic at this stage.
On the issue of establishing a system for assessing the impact of the various Community policies on territorial cohesion within the Union, it is true that current impact assessment does not take into account territorial cohesion issues.
I agree that this question deserves further examination.
I have taken note of your proposal to develop such a system through Espon and I will ask my services to analyse this.
We will also discuss it with the Member States, which, as you know, cofinance this programme.
On your suggestion that a White Paper on territorial cohesion be drawn up by 2007, indicating in particular how this objective is to be incorporated in the national strategic plan of each Member State, you may remember that I raised the possibility of preparing a White Paper in order to promote territorial cohesion on the European agenda in the perspective of a ratified Constitution.
That was done in Luxembourg in May.
I would like to remind you that in the strategic guidelines we asked Member States to pay particular attention to territorial issues when preparing their national development plans.
These are already being drawn up and so, while I agree strongly with the added value that the White Paper would bring, we cannot wait for it in order to incorporate this dimension into the national strategic plans.
On Mr Margues' report, I have also noted a number of concerns and recommendations and I would like to respond to as many of them as I can in the time available to me.
Concerning the wider neighbourhood action plan, I fully agree that we have to strengthen the economic, social and cultural links between the outermost regions and their non-member neighbours.
We have to take this forward on two fronts: first, trade and customs measures that would allow for the integration of markets in goods and services, as well as in trade-related fields; and second, the preferential agreements with non-Member countries.
This mainly concerns the ACP countries through the European partnership agreements.
These new agreements are to enter into effect as of January 2008.
We are currently in the process of negotiations, but we are also examining the needs and interests of those regions, together with the Member States concerned.
I share your view that economic integration needs to be supported by exchanges of a social and cultural nature and cooperation in fields such as new technologies, health measures, combating illegal immigration and measures on the environment and risk prevention.
I can also tell you that my services are currently exploring ways in which the Community financial instruments â not only the ERDF, but also the European Development Fund â can be used to strengthen the wider neighbourhood policy.
With regard to agriculture and fishing, some of your recommendations are already part of our legislative proposals, as some of you must know.
On the reform of the organisation of the sugar market, the Commission's proposal takes account of the specific problems of the outermost regions.
The Commission is convinced that the sugar sector in the outermost regions is expanding, also in the context of its contribution to energy security.
On the new agricultural fund, here, as you know, we have proposed maximum co-financing rates that are higher for the outermost regions, while the intervention areas have also been extended.
On bananas, you know how difficult the negotiations are for us, but I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to protect the interests of Community producers.
On fisheries, at the Council meeting of 21 June, the Commission declared that specific treatment was needed for this sector in the outermost regions.
We have launched a study into this and will carefully examine the issue.
On competitiveness, your recommendations concerning the competitiveness of regions and the attention to be devoted to the development of human capital constitute the centrepiece of the draft Community strategic guidelines for the next generation of cohesion programmes.
In the area of research, we have introduced specific measures for the outermost regions in the draft seventh framework programme.
With regard to state aid, the latest proposal for the rules on national regional aid contains a number of positive measures in favour of the outermost regions.
Those regions will be considered within the scope of ArticleÂ 87(3)(a).
They will also benefit from increased aid ceilings and will be able to authorise operating aid.
My door is always open to those who need further detailed information.
I believe that, at a time when so many proposals affect the situation of the outermost regions or regions in general, constant cooperation and communication are a must for all of us.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission communication on the screening of the legislative proposals pending before the Legislator.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at half past three this afternoon, the Commission adopted a communication on its âbetter lawmakingâ policy, and this communication was immediately forwarded to your House and to the Council.
The Commission has undertaken a comprehensive and systematic review of all the draft legislation presented by it prior to 1 January 2004 and not yet adopted, and today sees its announcement of the outcome.
I would also like to say that all the things that may have appeared in this or that newspaper do not amount to a decision by the Commission, and that most of them are wrong.
Todayâs communication is a first step, and a relatively small one, towards the completion of the far greater and more demanding project of âBetter Lawmaking in Europeâ, with which we have two ends in view, namely both to build up the publicâs confidence in European integration and to counteract the impression that the European Union is a regulation-crazed and bureaucratic monstrosity.
At the same time, we want to liberate the forces for growth in the economy that have been tied down by excessive or excessively complex rules and regulations.
We must not underestimate the dangerous effect of the perception of Brussels as no more than an enormous and rather impenetrable bureaucracy, and this is where we all â in the Commission, Parliament and the Council â need to demonstrate by our actions that Europe is not like that.
âBetter Lawmakingâ is also an essential part of the initiative for growth and employment.
In Brussels, the Commission has stated that it, in its work, gives priority to growth and to the creation of more jobs.
It has revised the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment with this in mind and highlighted the area of policy that can make a decisive contribution to the enhancement of growth and to the creation of jobs.
âBetter Lawmakingâ is one of these core policy areas.
From my many, many conversations with representatives of European businesses, I know that many of them regard it, indeed, as the most important.
Small, medium-sized and micro-businesses in particular wait with longing to have their burdens removed.
Securing Europeâs position as a business location and improving its chances in global competition are both absolutely dependent on our having a successful purge of red tape, annulling regulations that have become meaningless and offering industry and service providers a modern legal framework on which they can rely in the long term.
I will speak plainly to you, honourable Members: this is not about the sort of deregulation that is weighed down with ideological baggage; this is about making regulation better.
The single market needs an unambiguous and reliable legal framework, but we must also ensure that our societies are not weighed down with unnecessary bureaucracy, and that the public can be certain that European law is drafted with the greatest possible care and will take effect only where European regulations are absolutely necessary.
That is something on which the institutions agree.
Let me repeat that we are all in the same boat and share responsibility.
That is the political context of the Commission communication on the review of pending legislative proposals.
One might describe it as the of a menu, the main course of which is yet to be served.
I do hope, though, that the goes down well.
This policy forms part of a broader-based strategy, which is itself founded upon three pillars.
Firstly, the Commission regularly submits to systematic examination all the legislative proposals it has presented, yet which have not been adopted by the legislator within a given period of time, the object of this exercise being to decide whether the proposals can be withdrawn, or whether decision-making can be made easier by other means.
The Commission has, this year, reviewed all the regulations that were still waiting for adoption on the cut-off date of 1Â January 2004, looking to see whether proposals had become obsolete, had been held up in the legislative process for some considerable time, whether their review was called for by reason of new scientific knowledge, changes in the market or other considerations, or whether they met present-day standards in terms of their expected cost and their likely effect on competitiveness.
The end result of this is that, of the 183 proposals it has reviewed, the Commission intends to withdraw 68 on the grounds of their incompatibility with the goals of growth and employment or with the criteria for better lawmaking, their being â quite objectively speaking â no longer relevant, or the improbability of their making further progress through the legislative process in their present form.
In the case of five of the proposals mentioned in the communication, the Commission recommends that the legislative process be proceeded with, although it does, before this happens, wish to submit in-depth economic analyses in order to help the legislative body to come to a decision.
I would like to point out that some proposals are being withdrawn as part of a wide-ranging review of Community policies, although the Commission is retaining the option of, after this process, submitting revised proposals accompanied by a comprehensive assessment of their cost.
I would also like to point out that the Commission, this afternoon, in communicating to the Council and Parliament which proposals it intends to withdraw, is complying with its obligations under the framework agreement on relations between it and Parliament.
The proposals selected will be regarded as formally withdrawn only as and when an announcement to this effect is made in the Official Journal.
Todayâs communication is concerned with pending proposals for legislation, which constitutes the first part of the Commissionâs strategy.
As the itself is not tampered with in any way, it has no direct effect on the economic process.
In evaluating the result, I think there are three things that it is important to bear in mind.
One is that the number of pending proposals for legislation was far smaller than many had expected.
In two-thirds of all cases, the review has led us to the conclusion that there are good reasons for the proposals to be retained, and only one-third of them overall fall short of our requirements in terms of better regulation.
This screening process represents the first test for the credibility of our âBetter Lawmakingâ policy and will be a trial run for the implementation of the real project, to which I shall now turn.
That project is called âsimplification of the regulatory frameworkâ, and is the biggest project to be embarked on under the âBetter Lawmakingâ policy.
The Commission will now respond to the European Parliamentâs resolution, adopted earlier this year, on the renewal of the Lisbon Strategy by proceeding to a comprehensive and systematic review of the European Unionâs .
I am talking here about over 20Â 000 pieces of legislation.
At the end of October, the Commission will come to a decision on the principles and criteria by which this will be guided, and on how, organisationally speaking, we are going to get on top of this gargantuan task.
The one thing that is certain is that this Herculean labour will demand that all three institutions work as closely together as possible, and the Commission will inform Parliament as soon as a decision has been taken on the procedures and methodology.
The third pillar has to do with the standards applicable to future legislation and the assessment of its impact.
The Commission sees it as being of the utmost importance that lawmaking should, in future, be significantly improved and made subject to rigorous standards, and has already decided that all proposals for legislation, White Papers and policy statements underlying its work programme should be accompanied by comprehensive impact assessments.
It has recently adopted detailed directives on the methodology to be used and will, next year, commission an external analysis of all the impact assessments already submitted.
The Commission is also engaged, with the help of a network of outside experts, in building up the available analysis and scientific knowledge on which impact assessments rely.
It regards the new criteria for future lawmaking as decisive in setting our direction for the future, and as making it possible to really cut back bureaucracy and take the burden off businesses and the authorities in the Member States.
Some Member States have already adopted a policy of this kind and are achieving remarkable successes with it, freeing business and administration from unnecessary costs and thereby achieving measurable added growth.
That is what we want for the European Union as a whole.
This, honourable Members, is something that we will need to discuss in depth, and, while the Commission will have the utmost regard for Parliamentâs responsibility, this policy will need to be supported by the Member States.
I very much hope that this debate sends out the clear message that, this time, Europe is getting serious about this.
One thing we all agree on is that we need better laws and less bureaucracy.
Even at this early stage, I can tell you that this project of codifying disparate pieces of legislation is very far from being the end of what we shall do.
We shall also be considering whether regulations are still needed at all or whether they need to be made more user-friendly, that is to say, rewritten.
Europeâs competitiveness will be one yardstick â but not the only one â whereby this will be measured, and let me say, lest there be any doubt about it, that the object is not to make Europe less integrated than it already is or to alter the balance between the three great policy goals of growth, social cohesion and sustainable development.
Far from âBetter Lawmakingâ being some sort of Trojan horse to undermine Europe, the intention is it should strengthen Europe and make it more efficient.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I now give the floor to Mr Stubb.
I am afraid I am not sure how I should pronounce your name, Mr Stubb.
Â Â  Mr President, Stubb is a very common Finnish name: you probably only need an 'inen' or 'onen' at the end to turn it into Hakkinen or Raikkonen or something along those lines.
Commissioner, I welcome your initiative, it is an excellent one.
But I am a little sad to see that the debate we have had in Parliament was derailed, in the sense that we immediately started to talk about process: why did you not come with the paper to us first?
Well, you have come to us, and we see it right here.
It is a very good initiative.
There is nothing new in this, it is part of improved regulation and it is something that we urgently needed, especially after the French and the Dutch referendums.
If I have understood you correctly, you are going to withdraw 70 initiatives, which are: firstly, old; secondly, based on an impact assessment; or thirdly, based on subsidiarity.
If that is the case, I am all for it.
I can say this even though I sit at this end of the table.
I am a federalist, I want more Europe, but I want less and better regulation.
The problem with the European Parliament today is that we are putting up too many barriers and we should not do that.
We need more freedom.
Just give us one answer, what is your timetable, when do you want our answer?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, before the starter, there is often an .
Although this particular little culinary offering, having been brought to us courtesy of the media, was not to our taste, we still find a juicy preferable to a dry piece of paper.
As for what you have served up to us today, we will have to look at the details.
The philosophy you have described is, I think, one of which we can all approve.
We are concerned not only that there should be no erosion of social and economic standards, but also that bureaucracy should be kept to a minimum, that regulations should be as simple as possible and be readable â not, perhaps, so much by the general public as by the experts, which these days they are not.
We will also be discussing this with representatives of the national parliaments.
I have just heard that there is to be a meeting of COSAC at the beginning of October, and this will certainly be on the agenda for that.
I do have a specific question for you, Commissioner, and it is this: are you willing to make available to this House all the documentation on the basis of which you have drawn up this list, so that we may gain an insight into your motivation and your reasoning, and may then consider them when we give our own opinion?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise for having to go to the next meeting straightaway, but there are two things I would like to mention that I believe are important where better lawmaking is concerned.
I do not intend to discuss what should be done about the involvement of the press.
This is the first step in the right direction; it is courageous and it is the right thing to do.
We must give it our backing and encourage the Commission to move on to the âmain courseâ, for that we regard as crucial.
I have two suggestions to make.
The first has to do with the small business sector, to which the Commissioner referred.
Where better lawmaking is concerned, I can only hope that representatives of the small and medium-sized business sector will be included among the external groups of experts whose advice is to be sought.
The fact is that industry can certainly cope with and accept certain aspects of regulation, but local small businesses and local craftsmen may well not be able to, and will go bust.
So I ask, I appeal, as a matter of urgency, that these external groups give small and medium-sized enterprises the representation they deserve.
The second point I want to make is that complaints from the national level about over-regulation are a regular occurrence, and it often turns out that, rather than the over-regulation originating from Europe, its cause is in fact to be found in the complicated way in which the Member States transpose it.
What is needed is the boldness to highlight the perverse ways in which European rules are sometimes applied and bring in a benchmark to indicate who is acting in such a way as to benefit the public and who is doing it in such a way as to inconvenience them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to answer the questions that have been put to me.
Let me take the timetable first: the Commission will come to a decision about the methodology and organisational principles of the great âBetter Regulationâ project at the end of October.
I will be putting to it an action plan for an initial three-year period in the hope that we will be able to get most of the project completed in that time.
We will in any case have to decide what our priorities are, and we will do so in such a way that we start with the areas that there is reason to believe really are over-regulated by reason of the vast amount of legislation.
