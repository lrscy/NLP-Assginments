The Community policy which absorbs the most funds generates an enormous amount of information, which we do not currently take advantage of.
That information could provide a much more up-to-date result, and a much more up-to-date and reliable picture of Community agriculture, than many much more expensive and less reliable investigations.
Today we are dealing with the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, and it would be desirable to confront it with more and better statistical information.
The reason why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has withdrawn its amendments is that, during the debate, the Commission published a report on the creation of a database on payments made by the EAGGF-Guarantee, in other words, on the distribution of agricultural aid.
The Agriculture Committee believes that that report satisfied our demands since the Commission had committed itself to transparency towards Parliament and the whole of society.
The second point of the conclusions of that report lays down that the said database will begin to operate after 1 January 2003, although this will not prevent the presentation of indicative figures before that date.
While repeating to the Commission that we need that information for the purposes of the mid-term reform of Agenda 2000, I would like the Commission to answer a simple question: on what date will the database in question begin to operate, and when will the indicative figures be presented?
The sooner this is, the better will be the work of our committee and the work on the review of Agenda 2000.
Mr President, the answer to this question is that, as Commissioner Fischler has already indicated in various letters to Members of this House, in early autumn he intends to publish statistical information on the recipients of direct payments, classified according to the amount.
The statistics will cover 14 Member States, because figures for Greece are still not available.
This will, of course, be statistical information only and it will not contain any personal information on those recipients.
. (FI) Mr President, the Commission proposed that the European Community should approve the Joint Convention, but it wanted to put forward a reservation with regard to Article 27.
The Article is important as it allows the signatories to the Convention to unilaterally ban the import of foreign spent fuel and radioactive waste.
Why, then, should there be a reservation?
The Committee having deliberated on the matter, the following can be stated: an EU Member State may categorically and unilaterally ban the import of spent nuclear fuel from a non-EU state.
An EU Member State may also ban the import of spent fuel from another Member State when it is no longer intended for reprocessing but disposal in another country.
A country cannot unilaterally impose a ban on the import of spent fuel meant for reprocessing.
The reservation with regard to Article 27 that the Commission is proposing would not clear the way for an EU single market for the disposal of nuclear waste; it would instead allow the EC to amend Directive 92/3/Euratom to ensure compatibility with the Joint Convention.
Mr President, I need a technician.
I first thought it was a remarkably intelligent achievement on my part, but it was done by the machine.
Although I voted against, it showed the green light.
We know that we have no faulty Members.
It must be the machine.

(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
Colleagues, thank you for your cooperation.
We have managed, in under an hour, to do 15 reports under the new Rules and more than 360 amendments.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
So far, the Socrates programme has made an important contribution to educational exchanges, but it is costly to run and smothered in red tape.
Technically, the Commission proposal responds to Parliament's proposals for less red tape, but far more needs to be done before the smallest, remotest institutions will find it easy to take part in the programme.
The CAP accounts for almost half of the EU budget and it is only correct that every euro spent should be accounted for.
I fully support the need for efficient databases.
However, let us remember what the aim of such data collection is.
It should allow for a more efficient administration of the CAP and more efficient use of public funds.
Simplification is the key: not complication.
We do not need to create even more paperwork and administrative hassle for already beleaguered farmers.
If we want to encourage people to stay in farming - in particular young people - we must not turn farming into a career that is more to do with mountains of paperwork than producing food and taking care of the land.
We must take particular care to avoid duplication of effort.
There are a lot of data available, supplied by farmers in meeting the requirements of various programmes and schemes, available to national and European authorities.
Let the efforts be at an administrative level in terms of sharing information and statistics, making information systems compatible and so on. Those who, like myself, represent large agricultural constituencies will surely oppose seeing any further administrative burdens foisted on farmers.
As can be seen in its explanatory statement, this report appears, in substance, to be trying to keep everyone happy: the Commission, which is implementing the deregulation; the Member States which are - for the time being - responsible for ensuring safety; the major airlines, upon whom there is no question of imposing overly restrictive - and, above all, excessively costly - regulations; the low cost airlines, upon whom the report is seeking to impose certain minimum standards, as long as these do not affect their profits?
This is undoubtedly an example of what the European authorities can do in this area: they are setting standards for work, rest and time on board for crews and commercial flight personnel.
These EU-wide standards may offer personnel a minimum of guarantees and that is why we did not vote against the report.
But this minimum is so minimalist that it is certainly the most that we could expect from the European authorities, which, above all, do not want to cause difficulties for employers in the air transport sector.
Today it is widely recognised that cabin crews bear a huge responsibility and are of increasing importance to passenger safety, given the current climate in civil aviation.
It is crucial that we harmonise flight times, working hours and rest requirements for cabin staff, not only in view of future enlargement but also, and especially, because we feel that there is an urgent need to protect these workers in light of the expansion of low cost airlines in the European Union.
This is why we support this report, which seeks to remedy a shortcoming on the part of the Commission in not including this matter in its proposal for a Regulation, which we can only deplore, all the more because various Members States still have no legislation on this matter.
Nevertheless, we wish to stress the importance of maintaining existing national legislation that is more favourable to workers than the proposal that has now been approved.
. (PT) This is a proposal concerning a very technical and detailed regulation, which is intended to harmonise, in the name of air safety, the rules governing flight times and crew rest time, in order to ensure that all operators enjoy similar working conditions and common safety standards.
Despite the broad support of the airlines, the pilots' unions have not backed the rapporteur's proposals, taking the view that the flight times are exaggerated.
The concerns of the rapporteur, who stated that he was happy to have concluded negotiations that had been dragging on for a considerable time, had the almost unanimous support of his colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Consequently, it is considered that the solution that has been reached is the best and perhaps the only one possible.
I therefore share the rapporteur's conclusions.
The eleventh UNRWA convention on improving the situation of refugees in the Middle East, who include some 4 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, is ultra urgent given the tragic situation facing the Palestinian people today as a result of Sharon's policy.
The increase in the EU contribution from EUR 120 million to EUR 237 million is also important, although this sum should be enhanced when the budget is drafted.
But most important of all, the ?U and the international community as a whole should call on the Sharon government in Israel to bear the full cost of restoring the infrastructure which its military action has destroyed, causing a sharp drop in the standard of living of the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and occupied territories.
We voted in favour of this report because, of course, we are not opposed to aid from European countries being granted to Palestinian refugees.
There is nothing, however, to boast about when you see the increase in the amount of this aid.
If you take the number of Palestinian refugees crammed into the countries of the Middle East, the sum being proposed only represents approximately EUR 40 per year at the most.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the full amount will go directly to refugees, and that, along the way, it will not grease the palms of European companies and suppliers.
Above all, however, how can we fail to mention the hypocrisy of the report which criticises the fact that 'refugees' living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult' and which has the gall to blame, in particular, the 'high population growth' but which does not even mention the war conducted by the State of Israel against the Palestinian nation? The report does not condemn the fact that, although thousands of Palestinians are forced to live in refugee camps, this is because the State of Israel, with the support of the most powerful nations, Europe included, is opposed to them being able to return to the land from which they were driven?
The question of safety of nuclear fuel shipments is an urgent one.
At this very moment two shipments of nuclear fuel which were rejected by Japan because of the falsification of safety data by BNFL are approaching the shores of Europe, and will enter the narrow confines of the Irish Sea.
The movement of this dangerous cargo at this time is spitting in the face of the victims of September 11.
These ships are not capable of withstanding a terrorist attack, and they are not capable withstanding a fire.
They are an invitation to terrorists to hijack material for the making of a nuclear bomb.
We now have the ludicrous situation of the nuclear industry shopping dangerous radioactive material around the planet.
The convention should not be seen as giving a green light to the nuclear industry for such trafficking of deadly material.
I urge the Irish Government to take action under the Convention to stop these shipments.
The Convention recognises that any State has the right to ban imports into its territory of foreign spent fuel and radioactive waste.
This should also apply to the coast waters of the Irish Sea which are already dangerously polluted with radioactive waste.
Mr President, Mr Deva's report concerns the eradication of poverty and food security.
It contains many important proposals on how to eradicate poverty and guarantee food security, proposals which I fully support and which I was pleased to vote for.
However, Mr President, how many pensioners are there in the whole of the developed world who would still be able to teach and work in poor, developing countries, who could help to improve the economic situation?
How little do we ourselves do in the European Union to help these pensioners, these elderly people who still feel able to be useful to society and would like to go and work in these developing countries?
I hope that more will be done in future.
. (NL) There are various reasons why the Deva report has not received my support.
First of all, the proposal to abolish all subsidies in the EU is one-sided.
I am all in favour of removing barriers for products from poor countries, but there are also good reasons for retaining regional production or environmental subsidies.
The impact on the developing countries is, although essential, not the only consideration.
Accordingly, it would make sense for the WTO to make allowance in the trade rules for the extent to which the consumption of a specific product affects nature, starting with the production process and including transport to the country of consumption.
A second point of criticism concerns the implementation of ethical investment.
The report is making a step in the wrong direction.
It concerns itself with the internal organisation of the management where it prescribes the establishment of an internal committee and the sections of the company to which this is accountable.
It would be preferable to look into strategies which would allow ethical investment to be introduced on a larger scale.
There is particular room for improvement in measurability and reporting.
Finally, the plea to review the common policy on public health is inappropriate since the health policy does not fall within the Community's remit.
. (NL) Mr Deva's proposal is the best we can expect from a British Conservative.
He believes in capitalism, but also has consideration for the way in which the difference in welfare between Europe and the developing world has developed over the centuries.
He knows that our industry owed its rise to protectionism rather than to a laissez-faire attitude, and realises that the WTO Agreement on investment measures hinders the developing countries in their attempts to develop a local industry by promoting local products.
His views on a reliable legal system, the fight against corruption, transfers of technology, health care, women's emancipation and land reforms, as expressed in his initiative proposal, receive my support.
I also endorse the EU's tasks: a different contribution to the WTO, a reduction in export subsidies, no sale of unsafe food or of insecticides that are banned here, a ban on the trade in firearms, cancellation of debts and concrete measures against European companies and people involved in illegal trading in diamonds, oil and gold.
On the other hand, I do not share the rapporteur's optimism about ethical investments by entrepreneurs and about the contribution of trade liberalisation to development, because the cheap acquisition of resources in the developing world remains an important ambition for many entrepreneurs.
. (PT) The Deva report acknowledges a universally positive aspect of the phenomenon of globalisation, which is that it contributes to the creation of economic, social and cultural wealth for the entire world.
He emphasises, however, that the poorest do not participate in this 'benefit gain' which results from technological progress and the growth of international trade.
In order to free ourselves from the blind pursuit of globalisation, the rapporteur suggests emphasising the concept of 'maximising the advantages of the least advantaged section of the global community'.
The report seeks, therefore, to reconcile the global principle of the positive aspect of trade liberalisation with the need to force multinational companies to adhere to the same types of regulatory, stabilising, and legitimising functions that are binding at national level, which is why I have voted in favour of the report.
Mr President, of course I voted for the report on recycling and on the recovery of packaging, which it discusses, but I have to say that, when I was discussing the report with a pensioner, Mrs Caterina Rossi, from Bergamo, she said to me, 'What a good report!
So packaging can serve some purpose!
Even the paper which surrounds packages, even wood and plastic can be reused and are good for something!
Why is it, then, that it is sometimes said that we pensioners are no longer any use?
Do you mean we are less useful than packaging, than the paper which surrounds all the products sold?
I hope that Parliament will pay more attention to pensioners and the elderly, at least as much attention as it pays to packaging, which - and this is good news - the European Parliament sees as so useful: let us hope that the pensioners and elderly people of all the individual States as well as the European State will be considered to be this useful.
Every year, the European Union produces more than 60 million tonnes of waste packaging.
And, despite the objective of stabilisation in the Fifth Environment Action Programme, despite the fact that waste prevention is the first priority of European environmental policy, the situation is more or less the same: the amount of packaging continues to increase in the European Union.
In the light of this growing mountain of waste, it is high time that we developed an ambitious strategy.
This strategy must involve enhancing the Commission's modest proposal; in other words, by introducing prevention and producer responsibility.
The European Parliament has already expressed itself in favour of raising recycling targets and improving prevention by introducing producer responsibility.
The Commission's proposal has not taken this on board.
Yet, prevention is a genuine priority in the area of waste management, and could even become the cornerstone of the European environmental policy.
We have before us a real opportunity to move forward in terms of an integrated product policy and the thematic strategy of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
I shall support the report, which also emphasises two concepts that are key to a successful environmental policy: cooperation, which we need from everyone, and the fact that the impact we have on the environment should always, in future, guide our action.
.
(NL) Packaging is what the consumer is left with when he buys a new product.
It has become more bulky over the years, not only to protect the content of boxes, but also, and particularly, to catch the eye of potential buyers.
Packaging material has become increasingly colourful, and contains, more than the simple cardboard boxes before, material that is harmful to the environment, including heavy metals.
It was high time that the European Commission proposed altering the Directive on packaging and packaging waste introduced eight years ago, but the proposed change leaves something to be desired.
The emphasis on generating energy by incineration is wrong, for this only allows the producers and processors of polluting packaging to carry on as before.
Attention should instead be directed to the prevention of waste and the reuse of material.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is right to want to recycle at least 65% of the weight, completely ban the use of lead, cadmium, mercury or hexavalent chromium from 2007 and to subject new packaging material to stricter requirements from 2004.
I also welcome the initiative to produce 10% less packaging waste in 2006 than in 1998 and to reassess national and European rules concerning the obstacles they constitute for reuse.
I wholeheartedly support this report which addresses the need to tackle the growing mountain of waste in the EU.
The original Commission text should be upgraded and tightened up to ensure a more ambitious strategy for countering this mountain of discarded packaging materials.
As such, I welcome the concepts of prevention and producer responsibility; these will go some way in ensuring that the onus for implementing these measures is evenly spread across European citizens.
I also welcome the call for producers to have taken 'all necessary measures to minimise its environmental impact', whilst at the same time I recognise that it may be difficult to standardise such a measure.
Finally, placing this Directive into a broader context, to ensure that it is compatible with the Sixth Environment Action Programme, makes good sense and demonstrates that the EU is capable of joined-up thinking and a sensible approach to this matter.
Mr President, I would like to talk about Mr Fava's report on the creation of the Single European Sky.
My colleague and right-hand man, Giuseppe Italia, from Cremona, an elderly pensioner, said to me as I was preparing to come here to Strasbourg, 'I advise you to vote for the report on the Single European Sky.
I am an elderly pensioner, and I will not take offence, Mr Fatuzzo, if you say in your explanation of vote that we pensioners are nearer to the sky than the other citizens.
Would it not be appropriate, given that we are already near the sky, for us to be eligible for discounted aeroplane tickets and for pensioners to be encouraged to travel by air with less expensive tickets in this way?'.
I voted against the 'Single Sky' initiative, which resembles more of a manoeuvre by the Commission to increase its power (with, as usual, the unconditional support of the European Parliament) than an initiative that is genuinely designed to improve air safety and increase the flow of air traffic.
During yesterday's debate, I drew attention to a major difficulty that is still to be resolved, that of relations with Eurocontrol.
I must now mention another: that of relations with the military.
The Commission has declared its intention, as soon as it gains the powers conferred by the 'Single Sky' project, to alter the distribution of airspace between civilian and military use.
The objective is perfectly clear: to make inroads into military zones or even withdraw them, in order to facilitate civilian air traffic.
We are doubly shocked by this method, which essentially seems to assume that military uses are less important today in Europe, an idea which in turn assumes that we are enjoying a period of lasting peace.
This is a naÃ¯ve and dangerous assumption.
As far as the procedure is concerned, let us reiterate that the Commission has no military responsibility (which is fortunate, as is evident here).
This responsibility belongs to the sovereign States and Community procedures have nothing to do with this area.
- (DA) The June Movement does not agree with the entire content but has voted in favour of the report because airspace is a cross-border problem requiring common European solutions.
That is something we want to signal by means of our 'yes' vote.
Although we cannot deny that some progress has been made with regard to the rules governing air traffic control, the will, re-stated by the Commissioner responsible for this dossier, to speed up the liberalisation of air transport services entails risks which have been clearly expressed by the relevant trade unions.
Unfortunately, they have not been heard sufficiently, not to mention listened to, except by a few left-wing Members.
We cannot, however, believe that the effects of liberalisation are solely positive.
We need only observe the sad deterioration of rail transport services in certain Member States since their liberalisation.
What was initially proposed was the introduction of competition separating service providers (operators) and regulators (establishment of and compliance with rules).
Under pressure, the Commission has fortunately had to review its text, which is still mediocre and dangerous.
Air navigation services will, therefore, be liberalised, resulting in real safety hazards.
The Commission proposes, in connection with its efforts to achieve harmonisation at Community level, the introduction of a system of authorisations for the provision of air navigation services.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) I am bound, in the end, to lend my support to this report, which emphasises the importance of the Commission proposal to create a Single European Sky by 31 December 2004 at the latest.
Creating a Single European Sky seems to me to be imperative if we want not only to optimise the use of our existing airspace, to establish more stringent aviation safety conditions, and the safe and effective management of projected increases in traffic, but also to create conditions allowing European airlines to compete with others.
This proposal, which must allow a certain amount of harmonisation and interoperability of air navigation systems, is not, however, without its problems.
The definition of cooperation between Eurocontrol and the Community is one such problem, as is the definition of cooperation between civil and military authorities.
I am supporting this report to emphasise that the creation of a Single European Sky must not be delayed in any way. A reduction in costs relating to air traffic control, fewer delays and increased system capacity are all at stake, as well as, in particular, a considerable improvement of the safety conditions.
On the pretext of wanting to create 'an integrated airspace governed by the same principles and rules', the Council, the Commission and the Fava report are actually proposing the establishment of a means of air traffic control in Europe based on economic criteria, in other words, a Single Sky market.
Was the air disaster in Germany last July an example of what we can expect from the Single European Sky?
The air traffic control company Skyguide was a private company.
It operated in a functional airspace in which operator and regulator were separate.
Skyguide was so lacking in human and material resources that safety was affected.
Is this the path we should follow, as the Commission recommends?
In any event, this accident should make Members of Parliament extremely prudent pending the results of the enquiries, and also in light of the consequences of the effective liberalisation of other means of transport such as rail transport in the United Kingdom.
That was the message of the major European strike by air traffic controllers on 19 June 2002.
Instead of swearing by the market alone, we should favour cooperation, such as exists within the organisation for air safety, Eurocontrol.
We should pay more attention to public service and safety.
We should think globally about the intermodality of transport.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) There is a noticeable tendency to scale up in all areas in which the EU is involved, and it often results in a decrease in the democratic involvement of the people and a lack of sound, custom-made solutions.
This is why I generally view scaling up in a negative light.
I would make an exception for aviation, which, in most cases, involves cross-border connections and long distances.
To maintain national navigation systems and fragment the airspace into small areas would not be conducive to safety.
It would therefore seem obvious to hand over this task as a whole to the existing Eurocontrol that has monitored the airspace of the Benelux countries and western Germany for a long time.
This should also apply to military air traffic, which, particularly in France, is still able to occupy an unacceptably large part of the airspace.
It is a pity that, now of all times, we are missing the opportunity of having clear and safe management of the airspace.
The letting of airspace blocks for a fixed period of time will only perpetuate the old fragmentation in a different form.
Geographical fragmentation will make way for economic fragmentation.
This is something on which I shall expand when I speak on the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte.
. (FR) The Commission proposes, by means of these regulations, to dismantle the existing systems, the better to serve economic interests.
The sky is to be divided into functional blocks that will be sold separately to service providers.
All the services will be liberalised (control, radio, radar, search and rescue and meteorological).
This 'Single Sky market' goes against common sense and the principles of safety and public service.
The British rail service has clearly shown this.
Multiple operators and competition between service providers have been detrimental to investment in maintenance, to increasing safety and to improving staff working conditions.
What is needed is quite the opposite.
More cooperation is required between air navigation services, and safety must be ensured by means of integrated systems.
More public control over air transport is needed at European level, to make way for intermodal passenger and freight transport schemes.
The Commission proposals and the report under examination are not a step in this direction.
That is why we have voted against them.
. (NL) I have already indicated, in my remarks on the Fava report, that scaling up may be inevitable, but that unfortunately, the wrong choices are once again being proposed.
Mandatory tendering, for a limited period of time, for public tasks by private companies that compete among themselves - something which has been suggested before for public transport and ports - is now also being applied as a solution to organising air safety.
This means that each airspace block can end up with a different company, although in the long run, a near-monopoly is bound to emerge and will control the lion's share of the airspace.
The neo-liberal ideology will then triumph over safety.
In this model, safety has given way to cost-cutting as a primary concern.
It is believed that costs can be reduced by the use of fewer staff, and under poorer working conditions.
Since these people are dotted around various companies with different interests, which are continually concerned about their chances of winning or losing the next tender, workers get the feeling that their work is no longer as vital as before, and this will inevitably lead to a drop in its quality.
Moreover, the military are still not ending their occupation of the airspace.
This approach gets no support from me.
. (FR) Naturally we are in favour of maximum air safety.
We have, however, abstained on this report as it only addresses this matter from the point of view of the airlines and airport management bodies.
As the rapporteur points out, it is also significant that the directive does not put forward a single measure with regard to the safety of communities living near airports.
The European Parliament and Council consider this to be a question, principally, of establishing a unified system that will allow the European Union to exclude less safe aeroplanes from its airports and also to prevent certain Member States from being tempted, for commercial or other reasons, to be less strict with regard to the necessary controls.
All well and good.
The rapporteur, however, sees this as a means of restoring a feeling of safety among passengers, which will greatly benefit the airlines.
At the same time, the European authorities are preparing to take serious safety risks with their Single Sky Project.
These same European authorities can take all the steps they like - that may well exclude African, Latin American or Eastern European planes - but with the Single Sky and their privatisation projects, conditions in the European sky are going to end up more like a third-world sky.
. (PT) Air accident rates vary from region to region, since aircraft built in Western Europe are amongst the safest in the world.
Eastern European airlines have a high accident rate, as do those from Africa, Asia and South and Central America.
Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, responsibility for aviation safety is assigned to individual States.
The European Civil Aviation Conference applies the SAFA procedure (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft) as a means of monitoring aircraft and, consequently, of increasing aviation safety.
I therefore support the European Commission's proposal for a directive intended to formalise the SAFA procedure in the Community.
It is seeking thereby to guarantee coordinated action, together with an exchange of information that enables the early identification of possible problems, which I believe adequately reflects concerns about guaranteeing air safety.
In conclusion however, I should like to emphasise the importance of the proposal before us to restoring the safety profile of the aviation industry, in a period post 11 September 2001, in which this profile has been and is still fairly depressed and whose restoration is crucial to the sector's survival.
. (NL) Transport links with countries outside Europe mean that means of transport which do not comply with our environmental and safety requirements are travelling on our roads, in our ports and in our airspace.
I am talking about single-hulled oil tankers, ramshackle lorries and poorly-maintained noisy aircraft.
Smaller regional airports, which are the only ones willing to accept old, noisy planes carrying freight from Eastern Europe and developing countries, are particularly badly affected at the moment.
There is every reason for banning such means of transport from the territory of the EU, though we can of course understand that countries with a lower standard of living and less advanced technology still have no choice but to use them.
We would do better to help them achieve safer transport standards than to allow them to cause problems here.
Unfortunately, the proposal on the safety of aircraft from third countries does not go as far as this.
That is why I support the modest improvements proposed by Mrs Maes for the first reading.
She is right to emphasise the need for tighter random checks, even in cases where no suspicions exist, and to call for a ban on the transport of radioactive material on passenger flights.
Taking the complaints of people living near airports seriously is just as important.
. (FR) We support the broad lines of the Stevenson report, which advocates promoting the cultivation in the European Union of plant proteins necessary for animal feed (soya, but also peas, beans, field beans, sweet lupins, and also, to a lesser degree, legumes, cereals, grasses, etc.).
It would appear in fact that we are currently highly dependent on imports (more than 77%), while the production of plant proteins is increasing in the world and we could do much better.
This reliance causes us serious strategic problems, but also public health problems, since it is difficult under these conditions to establish product traceability, which could lead us, for example, to buy GMO soya whether we want to or not.
What, though, has limited European production in this area?
The Blair House agreements, which have also had another disastrous effect since they have in return led to the use of animal meal, which was the cause of mad cow disease.
These agreements must be urgently revised or circumvented.
Unfortunately the Commission does not seem prepared to do this.
Once again, we wonder which side it is on, and if the Community system is in fact, once again, going to make us weaker.
. (FR) Why not, when we are aware of the consequences of feeding bovines on animal meal, develop the production of plant proteins for animal feed instead?
The report, however, is only concerned with the trade war against the United States, on which animal feed in Europe today is heavily reliant.
The real needs of the world's population are not even addressed.
The basis of the food production system, however, is morally bankrupt, as it aims only to satisfy the needs of countries and social classes with high purchasing power.
In order to sell foods with a high added value that make the most profit to those with high purchasing power, we are wasting what could be used to feed the poorest.
Several kilos of fishmeal, for example, are needed to produce more expensive fish in fish farms.
This is a revolting system, because it contributes to raiding the resources of the poorest countries and starving part of the world's population.
It is also in the name of profit that Europe funds set-aside land in order to prevent a fall in prices.
We did not want to support this entire system by voting for one option.
We have chosen to vote against Mr Stevenson's report in its entirety.
There is no justification for the committee's taking the ban on processing animal protein in animal feed as a pretext for demanding EU subsidies for lupins - would you believe - and other protein-rich crops.
Equally unjustified is the demand for a 'safety net' or income-insurance scheme to benefit producers of oilseed and protein crops.
According to the committee, the Commission's solution of using the world market almost exclusively, would make the EU vulnerable, 'particularly to climate change, harvest failures and even price increases from the main global suppliers (USA, Argentina and Brazil)'.
We see nothing wrong or unnatural about that. On the contrary.
As liberals, we believe in globalisation, free trade and international solidarity.
We cannot therefore support Mr Stevenson's report.
. (FR) While the EU is heavily reliant on certain suppliers of plant proteins, the Commission proposes continuing to depend on imports, prioritising a market opportunity over rationalising its various policies.
In doing so, it ignores the difficulty that farmers have already experienced in this type of situation and deprives the agriculture sector of new prospects.
The development of protein-rich oil plants would comply with the need to develop a diversified, sustainable agriculture sector, in response to consumer demand for traced products and consumer rejection of GMOs.
It would also provide farmers with new opportunities through the development of non-food prospects such as biofuels.
Lastly, these crops have an essential role to play at an agronomic and environmental level.
We must not sell this agricultural sector short.
Let us provide it instead with the means to realise its ambitions by establishing conditions for profitability comparable to those of cereals, by favouring the diversity of species, and more particularly those not affected by the Blair House agreement.
These efforts will be in vain, however, if our negotiators do not commit themselves to defending our agricultural production with conviction on the international scene.
. (NL) The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also right to be concerned at the increasing need for imports of often genetically modified soya cake from the United States, Brazil and Argentina.
The EU currently imports almost twice as much cattle feed as it produces itself.
The old solution of feeding animal meal and slaughter waste to cows as a source of protein is no longer possible since the advent of mad cow disease, or BSE, but that is the only change that seems to be generally accepted now.
We are still not able to raise questions about how we produce our food in general.
Is it reasonable to deliberately feed vegetable matter to pigs and then to eat the pigs ourselves, bearing in mind that the meat of these animals has less nutritional value than the original product?
Is it reasonable to lift the ban on including fishmeal in processed animal feed as an additional source of protein?
The oceans are being fished until they are empty, and the fishermen of the South now respond to all proposals for limiting catches by accusing the North of causing the problem by producing fishmeal.
A better part of the proposal is the idea that farmers should grow more leguminous and oil-producing plants as part of a crop rotation system.
Mr President, the British Conservatives today reluctantly voted against the Blokland report on the establishment of a Community framework for noise classification of civil subsonic aircraft for the purposes of calculating noise charges.
This is because Amendment No 8 was adopted, reintroducing the concept that Parliament rejected last year - setting noise target values and charges for airports rather than just for aircraft.
Whilst aircraft move around the European Union, airports clearly do not and therefore airport noise charges and related land planning issues are matters for Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on floods in Europe.
Mr President, in recent weeks we have witnessed a terrible natural disaster in Central Europe which has led to damage the scope of which is almost beyond comprehension.
Both Member States and candidate countries have been affected.
Particularly in this six-month period as we face enlargement, it has almost symbolic significance in reminding us that the Member States and the candidate countries have a common destiny and share the same problems which we shall do better to solve through joint efforts.
I should like to thank the European Parliament for this opportunity on behalf of the Council to express deep sympathy with the victims of the disaster.
Many millions of people are affected.
Some have lost relatives, and many their homes.
The material destruction will make itself felt in everyday life for a long time to come.
We must all do our utmost to help.
It is important, especially in the light of the importance of enlargement for the European Community, that the EU, which is also a community of values and of solidarity, should help deal with the extensive damage.
That was also emphasised in the letter received on 21 August by the President of the European Parliament and the Heads of Government of the Member States from the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, Chancellor SchrÃ¶der and Chancellor SchÃŒssel.
The Presidency was closely involved in the deliberations which led to the letter's being sent.
I should also like, on behalf of the Council, to thank the European Parliament and the President of the European Parliament for the commitment and good will which Parliament has shown in ensuring a rapid and effective response on the part of the Community.
The Commission is, in the same way, to be commended for the considerable vigour it has shown in regard to this difficult matter.
The Commission deserves praise for the fact that the EU has quickly been able to take the initiative regarding decisions that will benefit the affected regions in Germany and Austria, as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as candidate countries.
A number of actions have already been set in motion, and it will be possible to make a start on others in the very near future.
It is my understanding that there is broad support within the Council for making flexible use of existing instruments such as Structural Funds, agricultural aid and Trans-European networks, as well as for making exemptions and more rapid procedures available to the affected areas when it comes to state aid and invitations to tender.
The Council had a first opportunity to discuss the Commission's statement at a meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee on 29 August.
The Commission proposes, for example, that an EU disaster fund be established of which it will be possible to make use in connection with the floods in Central Europe and future disasters.
I should like most gratefully to thank the Commission for the proposal, which is being debated by the Council.
I am pleased to note that there was political backing for setting up the fund at the informal meeting of foreign ministers in Elsinore last weekend.
That is a good starting point for the intense discussions between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament over the next few weeks.
The matter will be put on the agenda of the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council to be held between 30 September and 1 October when we shall take stock of the matter and, if possible, arrive at some practical decisions.
The Danish Presidency is very keen that the Community should play its part in solving the problems created for our fellow citizens, both in existing and future Member States, by the severe flooding.
We must act quickly and effectively, and we look forward to constructive cooperation with the European Parliament on this important matter which cannot help but affect many of Parliament's rules and procedures.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we were all both concerned and moved by the extent of the flooding that so badly affected Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia a few weeks ago.
On 18 August, in the company of President Prodi and my colleagues Mrs Schreyer and Mr Verheugen, who are here today, I was able to see for myself the scale of this disaster in the region of Dresden in particular.
President Prodi and Mrs WallstrÃ¶m went with Mr Verheugen to Prague, and Mr Fischler was also able to observe the extent of the damage in his own country.
Ladies and gentlemen, today, first of all, I would like to offer my deepest sympathy to all the families affected, but I also wish to recognise in particular the civil defence forces, the thousands of volunteers we saw, and the local, regional and national political and civil leaders who have shown such admirable dedication in this situation.
On 28 August, the Commission announced a series of initiatives under the various Community policies to help the countries and regions concerned to cope with this disaster.
Not only has the Union shown its solidarity with the communities concerned, but it also intends to demonstrate its capacity to act and react quickly.
Mr President, all the Commissioners present were particularly affected by the proposals you made at the beginning of this part-session, and by Mr Haarder's speech a few moments ago.
I would like to point out, with regard to natural risks, that two subjects always go hand-in-hand, prevention and repair.
Allow me, first of all, to say a word or two about prevention.
I know that prevention requires both funding and political courage.
For example, the desire to control land use planning, to avoid waterproofing excessively large areas, in short, to manage rather than to develop land use planning.
I also know, however, that prevention always costs less than having to repair the damage.
At Community level, it is clear that the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds act as a financial lever for prevention.
Allow me to give just one example.
Many countries were affected by the Rhine and Meuse floods during the first half of the 1990s.
We then mobilised over EUR 140 million under the Interreg programme, and that money made it possible to develop flood-monitoring and warning systems, and identify risk areas, build flood control reservoirs and facilitate water run-off.
For the current period, 2000-2006, many programmes also contain risk prevention actions.
This, for example, is the case of the objective 1 programme for Brandenburg, which lays down the construction of flood protection.
More than forty projects will be implemented within a budget of EUR 230 million.
This, for example, is also the case for the Austrian Tyrol.
Following the Galtur disaster of February 1999, in which 31 people lost their lives, almost EUR 10 million are to be allocated to an avalanche prevention measure.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that these efforts, in their current form, are not equal to the risks we face.
Together with you, we have held discussions on the future of regional policy after 2006.
When the time comes, I shall propose that natural, technological and environmental risk prevention should become a high, almost inevitable priority of future regional policy programmes after 2006.
We can see that the frequency of these disasters is increasing, even if they are not all such serious ones.
Furthermore, regions such as Germany, which, with the support of the Structural Funds, have made considerable efforts to boost their economy after reunification, to restore towns and villages, have now seen their work wiped out in a few short hours.
That is why regional development cannot take place without natural, technological or environmental risk prevention.
The Commission, mainly on the initiative of Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, will propose a European risk prevention strategy by the end of this year.
To conclude this point, I would like to say that it is quite appropriate that we are discussing this subject at the moment, today, while the Heads of State and Government are meeting in Johannesburg.
It is plain that our planet needs global thinking and collective courage, as advocated by the Brundtland report at the end of the 1980s, before the Rio Summit.
It is also clear that global thinking, either at world level or at European level, must be implemented in practical and local terms, in the field.
That is the ecological challenge, the sustainable development-meets-regional policy challenge to which we have the obligation to respond.
Mr President, I am now going to talk about the urgent need to rebuild, to prove swiftly our solidarity with the German and Austrian LÃ€nder, but also with the Czech and Slovak regions that have suffered damage.
First of all, we need to mobilise all the instruments already available to us to address this challenge.
That was the commitment given by the Commission on 28 August, a commitment that led immediately to decisions in the first area, the agriculture sector, under the impetus of Mr Fischler.
The existing instruments, of course, include the Structural Funds for the Member States affected and the pre-accession instruments for the candidate countries.
For eligible areas and regions, Structural Fund credits may be reallocated among the various priorities of the regional programmes, and we are prepared to increase the cofinancing rates as much as possible.
Meetings will be held over the next few days with the national and regional authorities to specify the amounts that can be reallocated according to requests from the Member States.
We shall be as flexible as the regulations allow, in particular with regard to State aid.
I would also like to confirm that the disaster areas will not be penalised by the application of the N+2 clause if, due to the floods, the credits are not used within the period stipulated by the regulations.
Here again, however, the instruments available to us have their limits.
The Structural Funds cannot be used outside the eligible areas.
Although most of the disaster areas in Germany can benefit from these Funds under objective 1, this is not the case in Austria.
Furthermore, these instruments are governed by provisions with which you are familiar, which do not always allow the necessary aid to be quickly released.
That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is why the Commission proposes the creation of a disaster fund for the regions and States in case of a major natural disaster.
I would emphasise that this solidarity fund will be available to benefit both current and future Member States.
We considered it preferable to call upon a new, flexible instrument that could mobilise at least EUR 500 million in 2002, and EUR 1000 million in future, which would be added to the Fund in case of a disaster.
The aim of this Fund would be, on the one hand, to help normal public life to resume, for example by repairing energy, transport and telecommunications networks, rebuilding or building temporary accommodation, and, on the other, to limit damage by consolidating preventative infrastructures, for example dikes and dams.
As you can see, this proposal is, therefore, different.
Both in the amounts in question and the type of interventions envisaged, it differs from the emergency victim aid system that existed between 1977 and 1996.
I believe, however, that this Commission proposal fulfils the wishes I have heard here myself, in this very Chamber, over the past three years, for example following the disasters that affected Greece, the Azores, the Canaries, France and the United Kingdom.
In a few days, on 18 September, we would like to adopt a proposal for a regulation specifying the conditions and implementation methods for this disaster fund.
This tight deadline shows the Commission's determination to act swiftly, just as you yourself, Mr Cox, clearly expressed your desire to act.
On behalf of the Commission and my colleagues here present, I would therefore like to thank the Committee on Budgets, its Chairman, Mr Wynn, your rapporteurs Mr Colom i Naval, Mr PodestÃ  and Mr FÃ€rm, for the quality and speed of their cooperation.
This support and understanding are essential as our joint objective is to make this fund operational in the next few months.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs, as you said, Minister, reacted positively to this proposal at Elsinore.
In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say once again that prevention is always more effective and less expensive than repair.
Sometimes, however, as is the case at the moment, urgency is paramount and it is important for the European Union to be able to provide help and practical solidarity to the affected communities and regions of Germany, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
This shows that European solidarity, in conjunction with local, regional and national solidarity, is far more than just words. For the past fifteen years it has been the basis for cohesion policy.
It has a purpose.
And today, we are showing that this purpose is being confirmed, pursued and even consolidated.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Barnier and the other representatives of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has experienced one of the most catastrophic floods in its history, and we express our sympathy to the families of those who have died in it.
Many people are still missing.
Not only in two Member States of the European Union - Austria and Germany - have we seen great destruction and devastation, but also in two candidate countries, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
Mr Haarder and Commissioner Barnier - representing the Commission - and also our Parliament's representative, have already had occasion to give expression to the present need for European solidarity.
Clearing up the flood damage is primarily, of course, a task for the regions and nations, but the events with which we have had to deal here have has such a dramatic impact that people have looked to Europe to give an expression of solidarity, and so, even though Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, is unable to be here today, I would like to express loud and clear my heartfelt gratitude to him for having been to the disaster zones with other representatives of the Commission, and for having represented the European Union there in a way that was right and fitting.
I attached great importance to this.
I have not been to the disaster zones and have only been in telephone contact, but many have told me that Mr Prodi's presence - and the humanity he personally embodied - enabled them for once to perceive the Commission and Europe in a quite new way, and not as the distant bureaucracy they had always thought it to be.
His quite personal human presence on the spot meant a very great deal to all of us.
I kept in touch with President Prodi during this time and, on behalf of our group, told him - he was, I believe, in the Czech Republic at the time - that I supported him in so far as I could, and assured him that any commitments he might make would have our group's support.
I want my expression of thanks to include the whole Commission, including Commissioner Barnier, who has just spoken, Commissioner Fischler, Mrs Schreyer, Mr Verheugen and all who have played their part, but also especially to the Danish Presidency of the Council under Mr Haarder, whose government, in its capacity as the Presidency of the Council, has shown such an open-minded attitude to this matter.
We are all of course aware that there is a constant tension between solidarity and subsidiarity, but, in this instance, it is solidarity that has had a challenge thrown down to it.
If the follow-up measures are now completed as promptly as they should be - and what the Commissioner has said gladdens my heart - then we have done our duty as the European Union.
Before turning to a number of somewhat practical matters, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to those who gave assistance on the ground.
Mention of, for example, the fire brigade, often raises a smile in our society, as people think that the things fire-fighters handle are toys.
In a situation like this one, though, experience teaches us just how important it is to have a fire brigade, how vital are the soldiers who are deployed in a domestic emergency situation, how important the police are, how important civil defence is.
At any rate, I have seen, in Germany, the country from which I come, innumerable young people getting stuck in and giving help, and, at a time when anonymity and egoism often seem to be predominant, it is a good sign that it is young people who manifest this solidarity.
Turning now to certain aspects of the emergency aid, on which Mr Ferber will also have something to say, we take the view - admittedly in contrast to the Commission - that EUR 1 billion should be allocated to emergency aid.
I would like to express my gratitude to the six groups who agreed on this document - Mr Karas and Mr Ferber did so on our group's behalf - for being willing to come to an understanding about a joint text.
Aid for agriculture had already been under discussion, then came the Structural Funds' efficiency reserve, followed of course by the disaster fund that now has to be set up for the future, and there will of course have to be a flexible approach to the rules on competition.
Commissioner Monti and the Commission as a whole have committed themselves to this.
What people now expect of us - and here I am particularly addressing Mr Wynn, the chairman of the Budgets Committee - is that we now implement all this without delay.
If we now hesitate and spend weeks disputing among ourselves, we will be throwing away the goodwill that the European Union, especially in the person of Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission, has garnered.
I therefore ask that we act with decisiveness and commitment in setting the follow-up measures in motion.
Let me make an observation with only indirect relevance to this issue.
Deliberations are in progress on the subject of the Stability Pact.
Even in a catastrophic situation such as this one, the Stability Pact must not be jeopardised, for this is an issue of confidence in the European currency, of confidence in the ability of the European Union as a whole to deliver the goods.
I therefore urge us all - Commission, Council and Parliament - not to shake the foundations of the Stability Pact, but - to return to the catastrophe - to do our duty by the people who have been hard hit.
This European Union of ours will then enjoy far more popular acceptance than we often take to be the case.
In this spirit I commend cooperation to all the institutions concerned!
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this summer we have seen a genuine environmental, economic and cultural disaster in Central Europe.
On 14 August, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I expressed our solidarity and the need for the Commission to act, and please allow me to mention the fact that President Prodi and the Commissioners not only put their boots on and walked around in the mud, but that, furthermore, Mr Prodi accepted the invitation from Chancellor SchrÃ¶der, who took action from the outset to hold that extraordinary Berlin Summit, which I believe was a strong sign of will and action.
Other colleagues of mine will speak more extensively about the situation in Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic, in Slovakia and in Hungary.
But please allow me, on behalf of the Socialist Group, firstly to express our condolences, our concern for the victims and also our sincerest thanks to all the volunteers who have taken action, not only those who come from the regions in question, but also those from many others.
I have had the opportunity to see volunteers in my country from the Canary Islands, which are rather far away, who were on their way to Central Europe to lend a hand wherever necessary.
This demonstrates that there is a common spirit amongst us.
I believe that this is the time to point out that we must change our past behaviour.
Solidarity must be expressed equally towards everybody, and that is a lesson we must learn from the Azores.
We also learnt a lesson, for example, from the Greek earthquake and that is that joint action by Greeks and Turks allowed past barriers to be overcome.
It is at times of difficulty that will must be shown.
With regard to the decision taken by the House - I am glad that it is unanimous and that the Committee on Budgets has acted seriously - I believe that there must be decisive support.
Clearly disasters cannot be planned for in the budgets, but what we can do, as we have with ECHO and as we are now going to do with the fund, is try to create a system of safeguards which allows us to act.
I would like to point out, now that the Convention is under way, that the time has come to remove this absurd distinction between obligatory and non-obligatory spending.
It appears that we have to pay what goes towards cows and wheat but not what goes towards disasters.
I believe that this is an important political lesson.
This also applies to the stability pact.
The application of the stability pact can be discussed when there is a disaster, but what is not acceptable is that the stability pact is being discussed in countries which have not suffered disasters.
I believe we must be very firm about this.
Finally, Mr President, I believe that, in terms of our approach to sustainable development, we must be humble and respectful towards nature, which has a memory and may return to haunt us.
We must act more firmly on the way towards a policy of sustainable development and, above all, of strengthening solidarity between us.
Mr President, the floods that put Central Europe under such immense strain this summer were a huge natural catastrophe. The financial losses were colossal.
The floods caused fatalities, injuries and distress.
In such circumstances the European Union also has an obligation to help.
For that reason, my group, the ELDR, supports the Commission's actions and plans to help flood victims and help finance reconstruction, and is calling for a vigorous programme of further action.
The distribution of competence means the EU's responsibility is greatest in the area of agriculture.
Thus, the measures the Commission has taken to bring forward payments of direct agricultural aid are right, as are their other plans.
The ELDR Group furthermore believes the following measures are also the right ones: the partial reprogramming of the Structural Funds, a temporary increase in Community funding, and channelling the performance reserve to the flood area.
There is also every reason to use the TEN funds for the reconstruction work.
Action to help candidate countries also has the support of our group.
It must be made possible to use the emergency aid reserve in the budget to repair the damage.
Our group is in favour of establishing a European emergency aid fund.
Technically it may be appropriate to establish it in accordance with a flexible instrument.
Its purpose would have to be clearly defined and the rules made clear.
Compensation would mainly have to come from the Member State's national share and insurance companies.
Our group is prepared to promote the fastest possible implementation of legislation and technical preparation concerning this fund.
It is important that the European Union should make a more intensive effort to overcome climatic change, implement the Kyoto agreement and reduce greenhouse gases.
It is important to promote the use of renewable energy sources.
At the same time, we need to consider the risk of natural disasters, such as flooding, at different levels of the social structure, and try to reduce them.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Commissioner, Commissioners, my group welcomes the discussion on the measures required at European level to cope with the unparalleled damage wrought by the disastrous floods in the Federal Republic of Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia.
I would like to again express our dismay and our grief over the victims and express our sympathy to their families.
The immense material damage and the destitution of thousands of people call for extensive and coordinated aid on the part of the European, national and regional forces and institutions.
The members of the public, communities, businesses and faring installations that have been affected expect the European institutions to provide immediate and tangible aid to alleviate their need and also to deal with the extensive consequences of the emergency.
The European Union can do a great deal to polish up its image and reputation in the eyes of the public by acting speedily and without bureaucracy.
The remarkable wave of solidarity and unselfish mutual assistance that showed itself in the struggle against the floodwaters, must be supplemented by clear and substantial indications of the European Union's solidarity.
The Commission has taken the right step in proposing the possible reallocation of European resources within the European funds, but this is not sufficient.
Alongside the Community Disaster Fund, which the Commission has proposed and which will mobilise aid money in the long term, there is a need for emergency aid supplied from the margin of as yet unused European budget resources.
Over and above that, we propose that, in the event of disasters, it should be possible to examine the legal option of reducing the share of national cofinancing, at the same time suspending the putting of contracts out to tender in order to mobilise local and regional enterprises.
This would make an effective contribution to supporting and promoting small and medium-sized enterprises in the region or local area affected by the calamity.
We welcome the European Investment Bank's initiative, under which EUR 1 billion is to be made available in the first instance for the purpose of granting credits under special conditions, with the option of topping them up at a later date.
Making these interest-free would be a greater help to the recipients.
This brings us to the proposal that the European Union, using a specially created fund, could take on the cost of the interest incurred.
I would like to point out by way of conclusion that these disastrous floods are not an isolated and extreme natural occurrence; the incidence of natural disasters in various parts of the world is increasing.
For us, this should be - indeed must be - a clear warning signal, calling on us to give environmental issues, in all relevant areas of Community policy, a far higher priority than we have done to date.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it was with horror that we watched as the rivers of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Bavaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, both great and small, became rivers of destruction.
Never before had the Elbe, the river that runs through Dresden, my home town, broken its original banks with such brutality. It destroyed much of the reconstruction work of Germany's post-reunification period, destroyed new homes, and, above all, took all the possessions of young people starting businesses and homes - they will be in debt for generations - and largely wrecked the newly-renovated city centre to a truly massive degree.
No words of mine could be equal to the task of describing the losses, the suffering and the despair of the victims.
When I refer to my home town, let it be taken as a symbol representing the many small towns that have also been affected as much as the great cities of Germany and its neighbouring countries.
For my own part and on behalf of my group, I would like to express my deep sympathy with all of them.
My desire is that this discussion may become a real sign of solidarity and that a disaster fund may come into being, founded in a spirit of solidarity with all regions rather than with only a few of them and including the candidate countries.
Both residents and visitors always had a healthy respect for the Elbe.
The city has come to terms with the spring floods, but now the newly-emerging plans for the trans-European networks will make it into a basin with fast currents endangering the people on the riverbank.
So I call on the Commission to reconsider whether their plans for the development of the Elbe and also of the Danube are still justified in the light of current experience.
There is a development plan for the Danube, one that is sustainable and will preserve the alluvial forests.
It is now for the Commission to deal with the question of whether they will finance this plan alone or enter into some sort of arrangement for the financing of dams.
As regards the Elbe, it is still an open question to what extent the Commission will take on responsibility for the plans that exist to develop it, which have been shown to be unworkable.
That they have not yet been implemented - which was a great good fortune, as the flood would otherwise have been even more torrential - is due to the initiatives emerging from civil society that have to date prevented these plans from actually coming to fruition.
The coming weeks, though, will see the question raised of whether it will be possible to preserve the important alluvial forests and their resources, and hence also to keep the waters back, or whether the Elbe development will proceed.
The same is true of the Oder, for which there are similar plans; there are nature reserves near the Oder as well, and it threatens to flood villages.
The question facing the Commission is whether a new plan can be successfully drawn up and whether all existing plans can be reviewed, so that the Commission, too, may take full responsibility in this area.
Mr President, the motion for a resolution tabled by the UEN Group and the motions tabled by the other political groups seek essentially to create a credit line in the Union's budget to help to deal with the damage caused by the natural disasters which have occurred recently in a number of Member States and in the candidate countries.
Moreover, the need for emergency Community action was blatantly obvious if we consider the exceptionally widespread effects of the atmospheric phenomena which have affected the whole of Europe.
When he visited the disaster areas, President Prodi himself could only, in expressing the Union's condolences, declare its ready availability to intervene with both exemptions and financial aid.
In our opinion, there are other considerations which point to the need for the creation of a stable credit line.
Although many would not admit it, I am afraid it is becoming obvious that our world's climate is changing, and it is not necessary to subscribe to the theory of alarmism to see this.
Of course, meteorological statistics through the years have consistently done their best to show us encouraging comparisons, making the scale of disasters seem less large, but it is not their - still large - scale which is disturbing now so much as the increasing frequency with which they occur, on the one hand, and the fact that they repeatedly occur out of season in Europe, on the other.
The creation of a stable credit line in the Union's budget would, therefore, help the States to take the necessary action to address the damage caused by these events.
There is no doubt, however, that the other, more important part of the Community's action must relate to prevention.
It is certainly useful to reconsider at both national and Community level agricultural production policies, forestation policies and policies for managing hydrological risk areas.
In any case, the key issue, the essential consideration, is certainly the greenhouse effect and its harmful consequences , which, I am sad to say, have been scientifically proven beyond all reasonable doubt.
We must reflect on the fact that the issue of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions - addressed for the first time as early as 10 years ago in New York and for the second time six years later in Kyoto in the famous Protocol - is still far from being resolved in any significant way because of the failure of a sufficient number of States to ratify the Protocol.
The call for Russia to ratify the Protocol is certainly an important step, but it falls within the scope of the political and economic relations which are being established with that country.
We still have an unquestionable duty to insist more firmly that the candidate countries ratify the Protocol, starting with Poland.
Mr President, my group, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, would also like to convey its condolences to the relatives of the victims of the severe floods in Europe, and we must find effective methods of helping the many people who are now in need of help.
I would, however, warn against having the EU take part in the aid work. The victims of the hurricane in Latin America did not receive the money we had allocated.
The EU often contents itself with accepting the public relations benefits of a major appropriation but is in no position to take effective action.
That could also easily happen this time.
It would be wiser to pay a portion of the bill for the aid programme that has now to be undertaken by the local, regional and national authorities, and I personally am prepared to go a very long way down this road, for it is in times of need that friends show their worth.
We are wealthy in the EU, much wealthier than, for example, the badly affected Czech Republic and Slovakia.
We should now be resolute in showing our solidarity in practical, cash-down terms.
We ought also, however, to look at the causes and take the greenhouse effect and other human assaults upon the environment seriously.
France's President Chirac is right, of course.
He deserves great praise for his speech in Johannesburg.
I am not yet in a position to assess the Danish Presidency of the Council's contribution to Johannesburg, but it is scandalous both that we should continue to dump EU-subsidised goods on developing countries' agricultural markets while refusing fully to open our own markets to those countries' products and that it has not even been successfully agreed that 15% of energy should come from sustainable energy sources by the year 2015.
It is presumably by means of this absence of decision-making that we are laying the foundation for the natural disasters to come.
Thank you, Mr President, even though there is not a very great deal to express thanks for.
Mr President, it goes without saying that we welcome the Commission's initiative to help those who have sustained damage in the flood disaster speedily and without bureaucracy.
We believe, though, that the aid measures put forward by the Commission at the present time will, unfortunately, prove to be inadequate to help the victims to a sufficient extent.
Moreover, the funds are to some extent granted on the basis of unequal criteria.
We are deeply affected by the extent of these disastrous floods.
In Austrian regions alone, over 10 000 homes have been destroyed, innumerable bridges and roads have been destroyed or have sustained major damage, with the infrastructure of communities and regions suffering serious consequential damage.
Hundreds of businesses were seriously affected by the floods, their plant and buildings badly damaged or wrecked.
In Upper Austria alone, thousands of jobs have been affected or put at risk by the flood disaster.
The overall extent of the damage is increasing on a virtually daily basis, as we get a better overview of the degree to which the regions have been adversely affected.
It is currently assumed that the total damage will amount to over EUR 800 billion, which means, as has already been frequently said, that the sum of EUR 500 million proposed by the EU as emergency aid will not be sufficient.
We are therefore working on the basis that at least EUR 1 billion will be allocated to emergency aid measures.
In this context, we would also remind you that a surplus for the year 2000 totalling EUR 11.6 billion has just been repaid to the Member States.
If billions are again repaid to the Member States in respect of 2002, it will not look good from where we stand, as the people affected by the floods will take it as read that the EU honours the concept of solidarity more in word than in deed.
So I do believe that the Commission should indeed make up the cash and that this year's surplus should be cut back accordingly.
It cannot be, or rather it should not be, the case that Europe's poor are treated unequally.
I do not consider it right and proper for aid measures, in the final analysis, to be allocated according to the region for which they are destined.
The situation in Upper Austria is that many businesses are not in the target region at all and certain aid measures are therefore denied to them.
It goes without saying that we must also spare a thought for farmers, who should, speedily and unbureaucratically, have funds made available to them for the purchasing of feedingstuffs, be enabled to use set-aside land and should have cereals in intervention provided for them at cheap rates for feeding purposes.
It is obvious that we have to think of the thousands of private citizens whose homes were destroyed, and we should also, in a spirit of solidarity, make funds available for them.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my gratitude to the Commission for the initiative that they launched at the end of August, inaugurated by a visit to the affected areas and then by last week's special session of the Commission to fire the starting shot for the creation of the legal basis for aid to deal with this grave calamity.
Let me specifically mention in this connection Commissioner Fischler, who has rather less of a problem with budgets.
Not only does he have to make proposals, but he can at the same time take decisions via the Austrian Upper House.
It is a great help to the farmers affected by the floods that this has been done so quickly in the aftermath of the events.
Three things are needed.
Firstly, we must make emergency aid available, and do so quickly.
To do so is an expression of European solidarity.
I will deliberately emphasise that this must be quick and, indeed, immediate.
It will not be enough for people in the affected regions to be sitting in houses and dwellings that they have laboriously decorated, having put up a rough-and-ready Christmas tree, while we in this House are still discussing issues such as legal bases, reallocations and more of the same old thing.
Rapid emergency aid means that the procedure by which we act must be the speediest available - we in the PPE group propose that this be based on the procedure used in the 2002 Fourth Supplementary Budget - so that, by the end of October at the latest, funds of the order of EUR 1 billion can be on their way.
Secondly, the legal circumstances need to be created.
The Structural Fund - Michel Barnier has been mentioned - the law on subsidies and public procurement; all this has to be taken into consideration.
What we have to implement here is a complete package of legislation, in order that European law does not stand in the way of rapid reconstruction.
Thirdly, we have to equip ourselves to face the future.
How can we set up a disaster fund for the future? That is the question.
We ought to do that calmly and unhurriedly, in order to get everything right in budgetary and legal terms.
If we do these three things, aid will get to people fast, and Europe will discharge its long-term responsibilities to its people.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, representatives of the Commission, this House has already seen lengthy discussions of whether or not there ought to be an institution or fund with the specific purpose of giving aid in times of catastrophe.
It must be said in all honesty that many of us were sceptical, believing that it would prove to be a drain on our resources, but the great disaster over the past few weeks has, I believe, convinced us that solidarity is a proper response to such calamities.
This is not just about financial support for countries that suddenly find themselves faced with a gigantic task; it is also - as already mentioned - a spiritual and moral issue, and also one on which this European Union of ours, which no longer evokes great enthusiasm, can gain added public support if it shows that it is acting in a spirit of solidarity.
My group is therefore unambiguously in favour of the creation of a new financial instrument with all the precautions that honesty requires that we take in a disaster situation.
Firstly, the disasters concerned must be of major dimensions, and we must not encourage the delusion that we can supplant the efforts of the nation states; we can and must supplement them, but that is no substitute for effort at a national level.
I would like again to underline what Commissioner Barnier said with reference to prevention.
Not only must we - where this is possible - provide for a return to the natural state, but we must also put preventive measures in place using all our technical knowledge, as for example happened in my home city of Vienna, where we have again been spared disaster.
What this means is that the states cannot take it for granted that they will keep getting money when disasters strike, and then, for years on end, carry on with planning and population policies that have failed utterly.
The last point I would like to make has already been mentioned a couple of times, but it cannot be too clearly emphasised, namely, that we must help speedily.
I know we all have certain time limits to keep to and so on, but I see some plans which state that the present is perhaps to arrive before Christmas or only after it, when it is too late.
It is too late for people to have an experience of the European Union as a real help.
So I am asking everybody in Parliament, but especially the Commission, to prepare matters as speedily as possible and in so efficient a manner that both the Council and Parliament can give their prompt agreement.
If we can tell people that this has been done, then, I believe, it will be with greater enthusiasm that they will be able to say 'yes' to this European Union of ours.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to express my and my group's sympathy for everyone hit by the disaster.
The disastrous floods in Central Europe have been, and remain, appalling.
Something has happened to the climate.
Imbalances in the frequency of drought and rainfall are becoming more and more common, and winds are becoming more and more violent.
In Johannesburg, an attempt was made to find global solutions.
The country which causes the most pollution per head of population - the United States - does not wish to participate.
The way the world is at present, it is the EU which must now assume the leading role in bringing about a sound environmental policy.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, stated that this will affect our processes and decisions.
I believe that that is the case.
Major issues have arisen within the EU which have required common solutions and have welded countries and peoples together.
That has applied in the cases of the Coal and Steel Union, agricultural policy, the internal market and Economic and Monetary Union.
I am convinced that we must pull ourselves together in order successfully to cope with the world's future environmental problems.
The next major project for the European Union should be to create a common environmental policy that is both tough and directly binding upon countries and individuals.
In that way, it might be possible to raise the standard without anyone's being able to lower it again, and the EU would be given the opportunity to play a leading role when it came to improving the global environment.
That is the most important issue for humanity and the EU combined.
Mr President, the most disastrous floods in living memory to strike those who live on the Elbe and on some of its tributaries have also had a grave effect on farmers and their businesses.
Although there is as yet no definite account of the damage, provisional reports from the Federal States of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, which have been particularly affected, give some indication of the colossal extent of the flood damage, the present position being that the damage done by floodwater to agriculture and forestry amounts to around EUR 287 million.
In Saxony alone, some 1 900 farms have been directly affected by floodwater, and another 640 in Saxony-Anhalt.
Far greater, though, is the damage done to residential property in the villages, to the infrastructure of rural areas and to the dikes on the rivers.
My home area, Prignitz, lies right on the Elbe, and damage there has been great; even though it was possible to prevent disaster itself in the form of flooding or the breaching of the dikes on the Elbe, the inhabitants of thirty-eight Prignitz villages had to be evacuated, with some 20 000 head of cattle being rescued from the flooding - a massive achievement for neighbourly aid in the sparsely-inhabited Prignitz.
A massive amount of work was done in Havelland, where many thousands of helpers did their best to counteract the artificial flooding of Havelland even though the polder dikes had been burst.
The environmental and financial effects will become apparent only in late 2003 and 2004.
It is my express demand that the advance payment of the EU's 50% per-hectare premium be proceeded with speedily, but I do ask Commissioner Fischler to review its payment to businesses, even though this is not within his remit.
The application forms that have come into my possession are drafted in the language of bureaucracy rather than that of solidarity.
There is, then, a need for additional money.
Special credit facilities and guarantee programmes may well be helpful, but many farmers no longer have it in them to get into debt again, as these programmes all have the characteristic that they become effective after a time delay.
We know that this year, EUR 1 to 1.3 billion of the EU's budget will be left unused.
I ask as a matter of urgency that consideration be given to the possibility of the unused funds being used as non-repayable subsidies to benefit the farmers in all the affected areas which have suffered severe damage, rather than being repaid to the Member States.
When the EU implements its measures, it is subjected to intense scrutiny by its citizens.
What is needed, and in short order, is money, not sleight of hand or political evasive action.
With that in mind, I hope Parliament, and all of us, will be able to do the right thing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, as an Austrian MEP, to start by expressing my gratitude for the possibility of prompt and speedy help.
These sad events have brought us closer to achieving the proximity to our citizens for which we have often longed.
It has been possible to give Europe a slightly better image.
Brussels, that bureaucratic monster, seems to embody solidarity, and may that not remain merely an outward show.
Disasters have more than a merely national dimension.
European solidarity is called for, and the EU has come up with the right response.
Alongside the countless victims, whom we mourn, there are so many individuals and families on the brink of ruin; we have businesses both small and large, farmers, the environment, agriculture, public services, historic buildings, art treasures, including in the candidate countries, in need of prompt and speedy aid, given on a joint basis and without strings attached.
It is of little interest to the public whence the money comes and how we do all the restructuring.
We have to tackle this promptly, speedily and swiftly.
Aid must be visible.
Turning to the follow-up measures and to the long-term measures, I would like to underline what my fellow-Members have said, namely that climate change has become a brutal reality.
Man-made climate change has arrived.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said that we must have greater humility where nature is concerned, but to do so demands more effective action, more effective political action, on our part.
Commissioner Barnier repeatedly emphasised the need for preventive measures.
Not only are these necessary and cheaper, they also take greater care of the environment.
I hope - and it is in these terms that I appeal to all the Member States, to the Commission and to this House - that these do not merely express pious aspirations, but will be implemented in all relevant policy areas.
It is in the light of this that we should give ourselves time to engage in detailed discussion of the Disaster Fund.
There is not much point in simply blundering into the rebuilding of what has been destroyed if we have not previously gathered all the available information we need, especially in environmentally sensitive areas.
We simply have to rebuild in a sustainable way.
Public expectations of this EU of ours, of this community of solidarity, have grown and will carry on growing.
So congratulations on these ad hoc measures; we should be equally zealous in identifying the structures for the future, for our solidarity should be not only with those who are the victims now, but with everyone, and not only today, but also tomorrow.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my very heartfelt thanks for all my fellow-Members' solidarity and sympathy, as this is a really difficult time for people in the affected areas of Central Europe.
The last time Austria experienced a flood disaster of this magnitude was over a century ago.
We are especially grateful to the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for their prompt action in response to this catastrophe.
I would also like to thank all the Austrian MEPs for the solidarity and cooperation which have been manifested without regard to party political boundaries, and also all the voluntary aid workers, the voluntary fire brigades, the Red Cross, the Austrian Federal Army for their tireless endeavours.
I am myself from an affected area in Lower Austria and have personal experience of their superhuman efforts.
It took no time at all for many livelihoods to be destroyed, with, for example, over 20 000 hectares of Austrian arable land inundated.
The damage done has been enormous, meaning, among other things, that harvesting cannot be completed in the areas where threshing is done late, and that many fields and meadows cannot be mown as they are still under water as a result of the continuing high groundwater level.
Machines and equipment are sinking into the fields, and shortages of animal feedingstuffs are to be reckoned with.
The Commission's immediate authorisation of measures to help farmers is therefore a matter of life and death for us, and for it they have my heartfelt gratitude.
In a study, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research puts a figure of over EUR 7.5 billion on the damage.
The destruction of many businesses and of the infrastructure in these regions has set the areas' development back by years.
Parliament and the EU as a whole must give aid, actively and with all speed.
The time has come to demonstrate this.
I see this as a chance for the Europe in which we share to prove itself.
I really do welcome the emergency aid that the EU gives, one of the most important features of which is, as many of the previous speakers have already said, the transparency of the process and the absence of bureaucracy involved.
This is an area where - to speak very frankly - the governments of the affected areas also need to make the necessary funds available without delay.
Emergency aid must find a place in the Supplementary Budget.
We have to set up an efficient disaster fund, give it sufficient funds and define criteria for it.
It must be possible to give this fund an endowment of a billion euros.
Disasters will happen over and over again, but our society is distinguished by the way we treat nature and live in harmony with it, and by our solidarity with those visited by misfortune, for we can all be in their position.
Mr President, honourable Members, I myself am from Saxony.
It pains me to even think about what has happened there and two minutes is far too little time in which to do so.
12 August marked the start of one of the worse natural disasters this country has ever known.
To give you just one statistic: on 12 August, the Erzgebirge had 360 litres of rain per square metre within 24 hours.
I think many a Member State would be quite happy with just a fraction of that rainfall in summer.
The swollen streams and rivers carried off everything in their path.
Thousands of people lost everything they owned within a few hours.
Retailers and tradesmen lost not just their shops and businesses but all their stock and materials.
21 people are thought to have died in the floods.
The floodwaters have receded and what are we left with: devastation and mud.
Initial estimates put the damage to infrastructure and public buildings in Saxony Free State at EUR 16.5 billion.
By way of comparison, the annual budget of Saxony Free State is around EUR 15 billion.
Saxony-Anhalt is complaining of damage in the region of EUR 2.1 billion, although I think that the final bill will be higher.
Emergency help is urgently needed.
The federal government has already reacted and will shortly be providing EUR 10 billion for reconstruction.
However, the European Union is also being called on to help.
It too has already reacted and this reaction has been welcomed.
But may I point out that, even if we single out the Structural Funds and give priority to certain measures, we cannot stop there.
There must be no let-up in subsequent Structural Fund support for Objective 1 areas in eastern Germany and I urge you to bear this in mind.
May I take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped clear up and helped fight the floods.
I should also like to ask the Commission not to leave the Czech Republic and Slovakia out of its emergency aid plans.
They have suffered enormous damage and are perhaps not as well-equipped as Germany or Austria.
Mr President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, my greatest sympathy at this time is with the families badly hit or otherwise affected in the disaster-struck areas.
Respect and admiration are also in order for the huge response to the disaster and for the way in which thousands of people stood shoulder to shoulder in combating the masses of water.
It was unprecedented.
There must be no doubt that the EU Member States should pull together in dealing with a disaster like this.
It is therefore important to remember that aid is twice as valuable when it is offered promptly.
I would also draw attention to the fact that many people are looking to see how we help the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic is a candidate country, and it is therefore very important that we deal with it in such a way that it, and thus the other candidate countries too, feel secure.
I would finally draw attention to the fact that agriculture in the affected areas is suffering losses twice over: firstly, this autumn's harvest of coarse fodder has been lost and, secondly, the harvest of sown winter crops will not be ready for next year. I would therefore very much urge that there be no doubt about the fact that the losses sustained by agriculture in particular will be spread over at least two accounting years.
Mr President, on the evening of 12 August, my daughter bought a camera in my home town of DÃ¶belin, population 28 000.
Three hours later, the shop no longer existed.
The same applies to 1 425 homes in the district and 711 businesses.
And of course, schools, scientific establishments and, above all, public infrastructures were seriously affected and, to put it bluntly, agriculture is staring ruin in the face.
As we have already heard, 220 000 hectares were flooded and the provisional estimates of flood damage to farming are enormous.
Mrs Fiebiger has quoted the figures.
Worst of all is the loss of animal fodder, mainly as the result of the grain lost.
Governments and the European Union have already given a considerable sum of money in initial emergency aid.
And quite apart from that, the Commissioner responsible, Franz Fischler, with whom I am in constant personal contact, and again may I express thanks to him for that, has ordered EUR 560 million to be paid in the form of direct payments to farmers, although the final figure will be higher because, according to my information, regions in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have now been included.
As you have already heard, set-aside areas have been provided, together with cheap grain for animal fodder.
My request, or rather my question is this: have these EUR 560 million really been available since 1 September?
To hear that from you in person, my dear Mr Fischler, would be music to the ears of the victims.
Because make no mistake.
This is a national emergency and, although the regions affected must make every effort to deal with it, they will be stretched beyond their financial limits.
Dealing with this disaster in the short-, medium- and long-term is therefore the job of these regions, the national governments and the European Union.
And action must be taken quickly because the people affected are in urgent need of financial support.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to add my voice to the messages of condolence and thanks to the honourable Members.
Europe has been affected in an incomparable way by the problem of flooding and must be part of the solution to this immediate problem we are facing.
Therefore, the urgency demanded by the honourable Members and assistance which goes beyond mere words are the two elements that are absolutely essential for this Parliament to demonstrate.
Mr President, fresh money is needed to provide aid; not just the money planned for, but new contributions.
We must bear in mind that this House has contributed for many years to the 1.27 limit of the European Union's budget never having been used and therefore a substantially smaller proportion than that has been used.
I believe that Mr Barnier has introduced some absolutely essential considerations and details.
I am a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and it is clear that flexibility is fundamental in reprogramming, that the efficiency reserve must be used for this task, revitalising small and medium-sized businesses, which are the driving force for normalisation and recovery and that prioritising the defence of our infrastructures must be an essential element of the new priorities.
Mr President, I will end by saying that, while we have been able to save for many years, solidarity now requires that we be generous.
Mr President, honourable Members, as a member of parliament from one of the regions affected by the floods, I am very grateful that this debate is being held here today.
Here we are, worrying about how to get money to the victims.
That shows that, as a community, the European Union basically functions on the principle of solidarity.
I should also like to make a point of thanking Commission President Prodi for having visited the damaged regions in person.
His visit clearly demonstrated that the European Union is alive and well and ready to help and did much to raise the stock of the European Union.
The local citizens saw that Europe is a dynamic force for help.
I visited some of the damaged areas last week in preparation for today's debate and spoke to citizens and those in charge.
The devastation is immense and the people are in deep despair.
But they draw hope for a new beginning from the overwhelming sense of solidarity already shown in Germany and from the support coming in from further afield, including from the European Union, because they cannot cope with these problems alone.
The bottom line - I have been told time and again - is that money is needed, and needed fast.
Apart from replacing personal property lost, we need, first and foremost, to ensure that infrastructures are restored as quickly as possible, so as to minimise the losses to business.
Apart from cheap loans, which the Commissioner has already mentioned, I think we need to do more to ensure the money flows quickly.
One way would be to provide funds from the supplementary budget or from the disaster fund which has already been discussed here today.
This money needs to be provided in the short term.
The second way of providing funds is through the Structural Funds.
I think both channels are important and are the right approach.
However, in the case of the Structural Funds, we need to bear in mind that, under current legislation, the Structural Funds can only be implemented if there is 50% cofinancing.
This cofinancing is entered in the countries' budgets in annual tranches and the corresponding funds are then earmarked.
Additional funds cannot be provided in the short term.
Which is why using the Structural Funds only makes sense if cofinancing is altered.
What we need is a reduction, and I do not mean by a couple of percentage points; we need a drastic reduction just for this period, i.e. while funds are being used to repair the damage.
Nonetheless, the question of providing more money from the Structural Funds over coming years needs to be reviewed, as Mrs Krehl has already said.
I think that if we take this on board, we shall have a huge opportunity to help people and win their confidence in the European Union.
Mr President, with a peculiar sort of local chauvinism, I too must start by saying that my home region of Upper Austria and, more importantly, my home district of Perk have been devastated by the floods.
In my home district of Perk, we had a total of three flash floods and mudslides of unprecedented magnitude within a month.
The first, which, relatively speaking, was the mildest, hit my own house.
The time of trying to persuade ourselves that this is a one in a millennium occurrence - an unhappy combination of circumstances - is past; we are sure that this is a catastrophe brought about by climate change and could strike again at any given moment.
It could strike again anywhere in Europe or the rest of the world at any given moment; in other words, even as we deal with the emergency and repair the damage, we need to focus on prevention and on protecting the climate.
I am very grateful to everyone, including the Commission, which has put a really impressive package together and shown us how we can help at European level.
All of us from the regions affected have already said that this is a message which has been very well received by our citizens.
I also believe - which is why, of course, we are lobbying here for increased support - that help from the European Union should be in proportion to the damage.
The total bill in Upper Austria will probably be in the region of EUR 3 billion.
I have a special request to put to the Commission on behalf of my region, which is neither an Objective 1 nor an Objective 2 region and the places worst affected do not qualify for aid.
It is a request for support in implementing restructuring measures within Austria, including these areas.
I should like to thank you, President Cox, for having taken an early initiative on behalf of the European Union and agreeing to open an exhibition of the damage in Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria which I have organised at 5 p.m. this evening, because I think this sort of solidarity is important.
I can also report that, in my region, even people who lost everything or almost everything are saying, the poor Czechs, they are even worse off, they will probably find it even harder to cope.
I believe we have seen an upsurge in cross-border solidarity.
I should like to use this platform to thank everyone who has helped in Austria, the army, the fire brigade, the Red Cross and all the volunteers.
Many agencies have been overwhelmed with offers of help.
In Austria, African asylum seekers have been helping and young Muslim associations have volunteered to help.
There has been a wave of solidarity, the like of which we have never experienced and which has taken many people by surprise and I should be glad to pass the message of heartfelt sympathy expressed here to the victims in my home region.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the reason for my intervention is, of course, the various disasters that have recently befallen the Member States of the European Union - the devastating floods, droughts and fires.
This summer, the torrential rains that lashed Germany and Austria as well as the Czech Republic and Romania, have caused incalculable damage.
In human terms, first of all, with the loss of dozens of human lives and thousands injured or missing and families made homeless.
There has been material damage too, with considerable damage to infrastructures, with roads and bridges destroyed, fields of crops flooded and the destruction of centuries-old cultural heritage.
First of all, and I feel sure that I speak on behalf of all my fellow Members, I wish to use this forum to praise the total commitment and the mobilisation of the emergency services, fire brigades, police, soldiers and volunteers.
On the eve of the gloomy conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit, the European Union is already facing the consequences of climate change and of the failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
For me and for my country, the European Union means solidarity, both with the Member States, and with the candidate countries.
The European Union must, therefore, bring into play all the mechanisms and financial means at its disposal to help the affected areas.
Aid must be direct and immediate, because the victims will not be sympathetic to bureaucracy and administrative delays.
I wish, therefore, to state my unequivocal support for establishing, in the short term, an exceptional budget line to deal with this type of disaster, redirecting Structural Funds that have already been allocated, bearing the new situation in mind, and for freeing up credits granted under the pre-accession programmes.
In the medium term, I am also in favour of the Commission proposal to create a special assistance fund for natural, technological and environmental disasters with a value of no less than EUR one billion.
This fund would enable us to provide a rapid response in the event of disasters in the broadest sense of the term.
I suggest that the sums in this fund that are not spent during the current budget year be added to those of coming years, so as to strengthen it.
There would consequently be a greater year-on-year ability to respond.
Furthermore, the size of the freed-up funding should take account of not only the extent of the disaster, but also of the prosperity of the regions affected.
Mr President, honourable Members, large-scale disasters such as that which struck a month ago are indeed ill winds of sadness, anxiety and pain but they often also bring some good.
That good may be that people feel closer, feel drawn together and that we are all pulling in the same direction.
Cooperation experienced in a European context does more in hard times than endless lofty speeches and we have seen here - and my congratulations first and foremost to the Commission on how it has kicked into action - that the European Union, which is often perceived as inflexible, is keen to show how flexible it can be by earmarking Structural Fund resources, by paying out aid to farmers, by implementing rules for funds available from Europe, by applying a flexible aid regime, i.e. where funds are not channelled directly, and by being flexible in its competition requirements.
And this sends out a good message, a message that, when it has to, Europe can get moving.
We have our work cut out for us.
The Council and Parliament now need to hand out fast, solid aid.
Fast aid because the dikes which have been inundated will not hold up forever.
Help is needed. And solid aid because permanent help is needed and, may I say here loud and clear, that the proposed aid fund, which has our full and unwavering support, is clearly not designed to be a quick fix for a few months or a one-off incident.
Anyone who has witnessed how two countries which, economically, are usually among the strongest in Europe, have received expressions of solidarity from countries which are not among the strongest will never again be able to refuse these regions help if disaster threatens in the future.
I say that in the light of what we have done in the budget in previous years.
Unfortunately, there was never enough money available to really be able to help.
Basically, all we did was to raise hopes and then dash them again.
This must not happen with the aid fund and we shall need to act accordingly.
We need, however, to address a number of issues which go beyond these emergency measures.
We need to deal with these issues in the Committee on Budgets and we shall be looking here for close contact and close cooperation with the Commission and the Council in order to get things moving as quickly as possible.
But we also need to take account in our calculations of experience in formulating policies in other areas.
Satellite data on flood management need to be included in the framework research programme, as does seismic research, because we are not just talking water here, we are also talking earthquakes - think of the Azores.
We need to think about how to impose mandatory specifications to ensure buildings are stable.
We also need to think very carefully about straightening rivers and about flood plains.
And urgent help is needed.
In the medium term, we need to create a solid basis for future help from the European Union - including financial help - and take preventive measures across the whole of the political spectrum which concerns us.
Only then will help be credible, because only then will people take us seriously and, even then, we must not promise more than we can deliver.
I should like to thank everyone who has helped and I trust we shall pull together over the coming weeks and months in order to carry out the work in hand.
Mr President, members of the Commission, honourable Members, as you have already heard, my homeland, Austria, has suffered damage to the tune of EUR 7 500 million.
I personally have cleaned up, evacuated and shovelled in Upper and Lower Austria, as have many of us here and thousands, literally thousands outside this House.
Together we have witnessed the material need and mental anguish caused by this disaster, which has pushed people to the brink and wiped out houses, streets and businesses.
Many only realised just how bad things were once the fire brigade, the army and the emergency services had left.
I should like on behalf of a great many people to thank the authorities, the communes, the LÃ€nder, the governments of the Member States, the European Union and the volunteers and, as the chairman of a social organisation, the Ãsterreichisches Hilfswerk, which is one of the eight organisations distributing donor money, to thank the thousands, or rather hundreds of thousands of donors.
Civil society has proven its worth and has come up trumps.
But its job is not yet done.
The Austrian Chancellor, Dr. SchÃŒssel, estimated yesterday that 70% of the damage has been recorded and EUR 65 - 70 million paid out directly.
The leader of the Austrian delegation, Ursula Stenzel, took the initiative of tabling a joint resolution by Austrian members, which has been included in the joint resolution by the European Parliament.
There is no need to define this disaster; it has already taken place, which is why the European Parliament is calling for emergency aid of EUR 1 billion for the flood area.
We are calling for flexibility in the aid regulation, we are calling for Structural Fund resources to be reallocated, we are calling for the national cofinancing portion to be reduced, we are calling for national limits on aid to be lifted and we are calling for emergency aid to be paid out quickly; we want specific dates, not just promises.
May I close by thanking all the honourable Members for the tone of this debate.
There has been no playing victims off against non-victims, north against south, Member States against candidate countries, budget figures against each other, projects against new plans.
It is clear from the debate that we need to act because we are all in the same boat.
It is a good example of political maturity and of a willingness to demonstrate that actions speak louder than words, to help ensure there are no delays, that action is taken in the short term and that a new approach is taken in the long term.
Mr President, I wish to say two things: the first is to express the profound and genuinely heartfelt solidarity of the Autonomous Region of the Azores; the second is to praise the words and specifically the action of Commissioner Barnier, who, for several years now, has dedicated considerable attention and commitment to the problem of natural disasters.
What is needed now is to transform this commitment into a draft regulation that will ensure that these phenomena are dealt with objectively and impartially so that all citizens are treated equally, wherever they may live, be it in the mid-Atlantic or at the centre of Europe.
This must be done, furthermore, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and bearing in mind the spirit that has been demonstrated in this House; the spirit that European solidarity is being built right now, in these times, which are extremely difficult for us all.
Mr President, it has been a quiet but stirring debate.
I am thinking of the eye-witness reports we have heard and also of the many expressions of sympathy and willingness to offer prompt assistance.
I think it can be concluded that Parliament, the Commission and the Council are united in wanting to help the hundreds of thousands of people affected, and not only help them but help them quickly.
We are looking forward to the Commission's presenting practical proposals.
We think the Commission has acted well in this respect.
The Presidency should do everything to ensure that the Council deals with the matter promptly and, judging by what I have now heard, I am certain that matters can also proceed very quickly here in Parliament.
It is important to act speedily. As one MEP said, aid is twice as valuable when it is offered promptly.
I am convinced that, both in the short and longer term, we can establish an effective tool for helping all the people affected.
As I said in my introductory speech, the Foreign Ministers have given their support this weekend to our establishing a tool of this kind.
Our task now is one of reconstruction following the extensive damage but, as many MEPs have mentioned, we must not forget the work of prevention either, for the damage could have been less serious if we had been more far-sighted in the way in which we had dealt with European rivers.
A friend in need is a friend indeed, says an old proverb to be found in many languages.
I think it important that the solidarity of which today's debate has been an expression should also extend beyond the existing or present Member States to include the candidate countries which would, in that way, be given a signal that they too were being considered in the context of what we were working on.
It is that spirit of community and solidarity with the new Member States which, later in the year too, we shall be using to carry through one of the most important decisions in the history of Europe.
Thank you Minister.
I want to thank all colleagues who have participated in the debate. The tone of the debate and its content very much speaks for itself.
Owing to the different executive responsibilities of our colleagues in the Commission, it is important that we should profit from their presence at the end of this debate by inviting each of the Commissioners to make a short statement pertaining to the college in general and, specifically, to their own portfolios.
Mr President, honourable Members, fellow members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank you all for your speeches and for the tone of this debate.
I think this really was one of the European Parliament's finest hours.
I have no wish to speak at length; I merely wish to answer the questions addressed directly to me.
The main question here is, how will the measures decided for farming now be implemented?
The first measure decided was to use set-aside areas.
This measure is up and running.
These areas can already be used in the regions in question.
The second measure decided was to provide grain for fodder from intervention stocks in Austria.
This measure is also up and running.
Applications are already being received from the Austrian authorities.
The third and most comprehensive measure is to give priority to advance payments of 50% of the area premiums in the current budgetary year.
Mr Goepel asked what the state of play is here.
The decision has been taken and will be processed, the money will be allocated using the normal allocation procedures used for premiums.
This is the quickest method.
In other words, the sums in question are released by the executive in each Member State.
May I add that this has since been somewhat extended and that these advance payments already total over EUR 900 million.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I think that once again today's debate has sent out a clear signal, a clear signal of solidarity and a clear signal that the European institutions are working very well together and are being supportive of each other in this situation.
I think this too is highly significant.
The Commission decided what help it could give in its executive capacity, what measures we could take directly, at its special meeting after the summer recess.
There is financial aid for farmers, pre-accession aid and, most importantly of course, the Structural Funds.
But we can also offer greater flexibility.
On this point, I should like to stress that we decided, as far as tendering rules are concerned, to allow maximum flexibility in the regions affected, so that swift action can be taken.
My colleague, Mr Monti, has made it perfectly clear that no objections under aid regulations will be filed against national aid to compensate up to 100% of the damage sustained by businesses and that this aid may even include loss of earnings or orders.
I think this is a very important signal to the businesses affected in these areas.
As regards the question of setting up a fund to provide direct aid in the event of natural disasters, I am most grateful for the huge consensus in the House, a consensus which cuts across the party political divide and is in step with the Council.
As you know, we have had no such instrument, no aid fund for natural disasters in the past.
We need to set this fund up first.
That means we need agreement and a special contract between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Commission will be tabling a proposal on this in the next few weeks.
We shall then have to create the corresponding legal basis, so that money from the fund can be disbursed.
I have a direct request to make of the European Parliament and the Council here: please remember the devil is in the detail when you formulate this legal basis; bear in mind that we want to get the money to the regions affected quickly.
We should give the regions affected a lump sum in aid and, instead of waiting for projects to be specifically formulated, we should declare the aid as such for the region.
It would appear from the debate that the whole House agrees that we shall need aid of at least EUR 500 million to 1 000 million per annum.
We need to come to an agreement with the Council here, because the fund will obviously have to be financed by the Member States, even if we want to provide aid this year without calling up new funds.
However, we should also make it clear that aid from us is subsidiary aid.
It is solidarity aid on the part of the European Union and we should not raise false hopes.
I also understood from today's debate that the House agrees that the decisions in question, the regulations in question need to be passed post haste.
This being so, we shall have to set ourselves an ambitious timetable so that the decisions needed to set up this emergency aid fund can be taken by the end of October.
Thank you for your support.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I should like to pick up on just one thought that has run through the whole of this debate, namely the fact that, in the midst of such awful disaster, comforting moments occur, especially when humanity suddenly shows its face where it was least expected.
I am delighted that we have been able to show the human face of European politics.
That applies not just to the disaster areas in Germany and Austria.
I can assure you that it was highly prized in the Czech Republic.
The speed with which we acted and the fact that we took it for granted that action was needed have left behind a far deeper impression than much we have done for the Czech Republic over recent years.
To know that, in your hour of need, you are in the same boat as your neighbour and to see help given in a spirit of solidarity has answered the question raised by a lot of people in this country: why exactly do we want Europe and do we need it?
I am very grateful to the European Parliament that, like the Commission and the Council, it has not wasted time worrying about distinctions between Member States and future Member States when it comes to aid from the new emergency reserve.
We can choose our contracting partners, but we cannot choose our neighbours.
If it rains cats and dogs in Austria and Saxony and in the Czech Republic, which is in between the two, we cannot say we shall help Austria and we shall help Saxony, but we shall not help the Czech Republic.
And people in Prague noticed that this is the general view.
I was there on Thursday.
It seems to me - and I say this in all caution - that the flood has also washed away a number of recent political problems between the countries affected.
Mr President, as we reach the end of this debate, I would like to add a few thoughts to those of my colleagues.
It is telling that several Commissioners wanted to be present throughout this debate as we have worked together, and each of us, in their own sector, must contribute to a swift, effective response.
In particular, I would like to say to Mr Ferber and Mr Markov that we are really going to use all the margins for flexibility available to us on the cofinancing rate, invitations to tender and State aid.
What applies to the Structural Funds for EU Member States also applies to pre-accession instruments for the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as Mr Verheugen has already said.
I would reply to Mrs Krehl that we have no intention of excluding these two candidate countries from our solidarity.
Earlier, Mrs Schroeder spoke of the villages or regions bordering her home town of Dresden.
I personally will not forget the sight of the town of Wiesenstein, which profoundly affected me. This small town had only just been rebuilt and restored after the fall of the Berlin wall, and, tragically, it has now been destroyed.
We must not forget that aspect, in addition to the large towns concerned.
I would also like to respond to Mr Virrankoski, who mentioned the Fund's methodology.
Very shortly, on 18 September, we shall present a proposal: speed, effectiveness and fairness for the distribution methods of this new Fund.
I am currently working on criteria that will make it possible to characterise a major disaster.
A major natural disaster, in my opinion, is a disaster that seriously affects a significant proportion of the population in one or more regions, in one or more States.
It is also a disaster that severely compromises the economy of that region, group of regions, State or group of States.
That is clearly the case of the floods that have recently affected many regions and four States.
It is in this spirit that we are working.
Mrs Berger has mentioned the regions that do not fall within the scope of objective 1 or objective 2. The point of this exceptional aid Fund that we are creating together is that it will be able to fund regions outside the objective 1 and 2 areas that have been affected or which could be affected in future.
Lastly, I would like to say to Mr Swoboda and Mrs Echerer and others who have spoken about sustainable development, as I myself did in my first speech on prevention, that there is no European competence for land use planning.
Town and country planning falls within the competence of local authorities, regions, or even the Member States.
The Commission is not claiming new competences, either now or within the scope of the Convention.
We do, however, have a responsibility.
I am consciously using this word in the same way as the expression 'political courage'.
Our responsibility is to ensure, as in the case of the credits managed within the framework of the Structural Funds, that the credits we are going to allocate within the framework of the total appropriations under this Fund, are used in the field, pursuant to the directives on the environment, with the requirement for sustainable development and perhaps with an additional requirement from now on, concerning prevention.
This may be the case of the credits allocated within the scope of Agenda 2000-2006.
I promise you that in the proposals I shall make on behalf of the Commission for future regional policy after 2006, the emphasis will be placed on this obligation to take account, with regard to prevention, of the risk of natural and ecological disasters for the future programming documents in each of the regions that are to receive credits.
That is the commitment I am giving.
In conclusion, as Mr Karas said earlier, I have been struck by the tremendous dignity and high quality of this debate.
That is to be expected and basically demonstrates the action, rapid reaction and solidarity that must exist within the European Union and the neighbouring candidate countries - one big family facing their misfortune together.
Thank you Commissioner.
For the past two hours this has been a debate marked with a very particular character.
For all of the European institutions it demands the speediest and most substantial response we can deliver.
As mentioned in the debate, in times of crisis it shows that the European Union is indeed a union with a human face.
That is something perhaps more fundamental in its totality than the sum of all its individual parts.
I thank those who have contributed to the debate.
I received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42(5).
The next item is the presentation by the Council of the 2003 draft general budget.
Minister Haarder will now speak on behalf of the Council.
I have the honour, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, to present the 2003 draft budget of the European Communities, prepared by the Council on 22 July.
Both as Minister for European Affairs and former Member of the European Parliament, I am very pleased to note that the budget procedure for 2003 has so far been characterised by sound cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament.
In the draft budget I am about to present, account has already been taken of a series of agreements and common understandings resulting from the consultation meeting between the Council and Parliament on 19 July 2002.
During the preparatory three-way discussion and consultation meeting in July, some single-minded work was done by the Danish Finance Minister, Thor Pedersen, Committee Chairman Terry Wynn and your fellow MEPs in the committee.
I am certain that this work has created a sound basis for the budget authority's two branches being able to reach agreement on a satisfactory budget for 2003.
I know that some MEPs have previously been disappointed about the fact that the European Parliament and the Council have had difficulty reaching agreement, but that has not been the case this year, which is something I am very pleased about.
I shall presently touch upon a number of challenges which have already been debated by the European Parliament and the Council and in connection with which agreements and common understandings have been reached.
I shall then provide a general survey of the main features of the draft budget prepared by the Council on 22 July.
I should first like, however, to refer to the debate we have just had in connection with the tragic floods.
We are all agreed that this new challenge requires prompt action to be taken.
It is heartening that the individual Member States have already, on their own initiative, been contributing to the reconstruction.
At the same time, the Commission has implemented a series of initiatives, which have just been discussed, and the Council is now to debate what further measures can be implemented.
I shall now return to the results of the meeting of Parliament and the Council on 19 July.
A common understanding and agreement were reached to the effect that the administrative preparation for enlargement is a key priority which the institutions must be given the opportunity to discuss from now on and right through 2003.
A common understanding was reached to the effect that work must be done on securing funding for the common foreign and security policy in the light of important new tasks.
A common understanding was also reached to the effect that the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets should be financed and that the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments should be kept as low as possible.
Allow me firstly to say a few words about the administrative expenditure for 2003.
The agreement reached by the two branches of the budget authority in July is a sound one.
The Council and the European Parliament acknowledge that the institutions must prepare themselves for enlargement of the EU in 2003.
This will involve additional administrative expenditure.
For example, there will be need for more staff and more space.
By means of the agreement entered into, we have attached importance to securing funding for the pre-enlargement measures that are necessary for the individual institutions.
At the same time, there is agreement that the ceiling for the administrative expenditure in 2003 should be retained.
The flexibility instrument must not be used.
The two branches of the budget authority have agreed that, in particular, pre-enlargement expenditure intended to be applied in 2003 may, as far as is possible, be applied as early as this year.
This will make it easier for the institutions to prepare for enlargement.
For the moment, the purpose of this frontloading exercise is to finance the publication of the Community's body of laws in the languages of the new Member States.
In this connection, there will, among other things, be a need to adopt an additional supplementary and amending budget for 2002.
By means of an agreement reached as early as in July, the institutions will acquire the best possible basis for planning as they prepare for enlargement.
The agreement will secure a calmer atmosphere surrounding both the European Parliament's and the Council's budgets for 2003.
Moreover, it is a good thing that we are agreed about following up the opportunities for increased interinstitutional cooperation indicated by the secretaries-general of the institutions in a series or reports.
A solution has also been found to the issue of the early retirement of employees of the European Parliament's political groups.
Both Parliament and the Council accord high priority to the EU's participation in external actions, that is to say the common foreign and security policy.
The European Union should have adequate resources for being able at any time to carry out the tasks consequent upon our position in the international community.
As I am quite sure MEPs agree, it is a question of the EU's credibility.
At the consultation meeting in July, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed that, when required by the circumstances, the emergency aid reserve for humanitarian aid may also be used for civil crisis management.
It was also agreed that an attempt should be made to enter into an agreement concerning the appropriations to the common foreign and security policy.
This must happen as part of an overall agreement concerning the 2003 budget.
We must secure the appropriations to the CFSP in 2003 in the light of new and essential tasks.
We also concur about seeking an agreement concerning how best to involve Parliament in CFSP arrangements within the framework of the Treaty.
It is heartening that such good results have already been achieved in this field.
In its draft budget, the Commission has set aside an amount of EUR 40 million to the CFSP.
In this way, preparation has been made for taking over the policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The Council welcomes this appropriation but believes that the overall appropriations are inadequate.
The Council therefore proposes a total appropriation for the common foreign and security policy of EUR 47.5 million for 2003.
Above and beyond the policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Council foresees, for example, measures involving specialist assistance to third countries in the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, there is a need for more appropriations for non-proliferation and disarmament measures.
I hope we can reach agreement on something corresponding to the Council's proposal.
I shall touch briefly upon the Commission's proposal to use the flexibility instrument for providing funding to the tune of EUR 27 million for restructuring the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets.
In this area, both the European Parliament and the Council have undertaken to find a solution before the close of the budget procedure.
In the Council's view, the flexibility instrument should only be used in extraordinary circumstances.
On the issue of providing EUR 27 million by way of funding, the Council believes that all possible methods of funding should be investigated before consideration is given to the Commission's proposal to use the flexibility instrument for this purpose.
Finally, a couple of words about the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments.
In this connection, I am pleased that Parliament agrees about the need to exercise budget discipline and sound financial management.
During the consultation in July, Parliament declared that the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments should be kept as low as possible.
At the same time, account must be taken of the Council's first reading of the 2003 budget.
As politicians, all of us in this Assembly are well aware that significant refunds to the Member States of unused EU funds present the public with a poor picture of the EU.
We must show the surrounding world that we are in a position to engage in realistic budgeting.
The Council would like to request the Commission to state the anticipated surplus for 2002 so that this can be factored into the 2003 budget via a letter of amendment.
Allow me to go on to mention a number of key features of the Council's draft budget.
The global appropriations for commitments amount to EUR 99 548 million, which constitutes an increase of scarcely 0.9% on the 2002 figure.
Special account has been taken of the possibility of the appropriations in actual fact having been used up.
The global appropriations for payments amount to EUR 96 992 million, which constitutes an increase of 1.4% on the 2002 figure.
This low growth rate must be seen in the light of the limited use of appropriations for payments in preceding years.
The first reading of the 2003 draft budget took place:
with due account being taken of the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure
within the framework of the Council's conclusions of 5 March 2002 concerning the budgetary guidelines for 2003, and
with account being taken of the conclusions from the consultation meeting of 19 July 2002 between Parliament and the Council.
Particular care was taken
to maintain the annual expenditure ceilings established in the financial perspectives for 2000-2006
if possible, to leave adequate margins below the ceilings for the various areas of expenditure, except in the case of the categories relating to Structural Funds and pre-accession aid, in which the ceilings include expenditure targets
to set adequate funds aside for the EU's various priorities.
I should like to emphasise a couple of the main points in the Council draft budget within the various areas of expenditure.
With regard to agriculture, the Council proposes an adjustment downwards of EUR 288 million.
Experience has shown that the appropriations for the common agricultural policy have often been set too high.
The Commission is now being given the opportunity to re-evaluate its estimate in connection with the autumn letter of amendment.
Due account can be taken in this context of the latest information concerning, for example, market conditions and the changing rate of exchange of the dollar.
In this connection, the Council joins with Parliament in noting that the Commission will also look more closely into whether the amount it has proposed for eradicating animal diseases is adequate.
When it comes to the appropriations for the development of rural districts, the Council has accepted the Commission's preliminary draft budget.
Where structural arrangements are concerned, the appropriations for commitments have been fully charged to the budget. This has happened in accordance with the conclusions from the European Council meeting in March 1999 in Berlin.
The Council has accepted the Commission's proposals almost in their entirety.
There has nonetheless been a downwards adjustment of EUR 525 million in the appropriations to the Structural Funds in the light of previous years' underutilisation of the appropriations.
Where the internal policies are concerned, the Council has accepted the amounts about which agreement was reached in connection with already adopted multiannual programmes.
In the case of programmes under discussion, the Council has adjusted the appropriations so that they reflect the Council's common position or the result of the discussions in the Council.
These downward adjustments do not affect projects in connection with regions bordering on the candidate countries.
Allow me also just to mention that the Council has slightly increased the appropriations for funding the special Olympic Games in Europe in 2003.
A margin of EUR 122 million has been left under the ceiling for expenditure area 3, enabling the European Parliament to fund various priorities, at the same time as making it possible to cover future needs.
Where expenditure area 4 - external policies - is concerned, the Council has accepted the appropriations in the Commission's draft budget almost in their entirety.
It is important, for example, to finance the efforts in Afghanistan.
Under expenditure area 4, the Council has agreed to accept the appropriations to international fisheries agreements proposed by the Commission.
I have already mentioned the Council decision concerning the budget for the CFSP.
A margin of EUR 80 million under the ceiling for expenditure area 4 has been left, enabling the European Parliament to fund various priorities, at the same time as making it possible also to cover future needs.
I have already mentioned the administrative expenditure under category 5.
I shall conclude my report on the various expenditure areas with expenditure area 7, relating to pre-accession aid.
The Council draft budget makes no changes to the Commission's proposals concerning the appropriations for commitments.
The appropriations for payments have, however, been adjusted downwards by EUR 300 million.
This must be seen in the light of the preceding years' underutilisation of the appropriations.
All in all, I am pleased to be able to state that the Council draft budget for 2003 contains sufficient funds to cover the EU's various priorities, as well as taking account of the agreements and common understandings we reached at the first consultation meeting in July.
You all know that this budget procedure is only just beginning and that there is still a way to go before the final adoption of the 2003 budget.
The prior conditions are present for our being able to obtain a satisfactory budget by the end of the year.
The draft budget prepared by the Council offers a sound basis for this.
The agreements and common understandings we reached at the meeting on 19 July are a positive sign that we have the will to reach agreement.
In conclusion, I would point out that I am certain that all three institutions present here today will do their best to contribute to a careful prioritisation so that the challenges of next year can be met.
I am also certain that we shall not forget that, in the last analysis, the EU budget is funded by the citizens of Europe.
That is why budgeting must be realistic and responsible - for next year too.
Thank you, Minister.
It is always interesting to hear a former Member of this House speaking as a minister.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members. The previous debate on aid in the event of natural disasters clearly demonstrated what people's expectations of the European budget are.
But if we look at the real national quotas, i.e. the ratio between the European budget and the European national product, then the picture looks slightly different.
It is almost the reverse, because the national quotas account for just over one per cent.
The Commission proposed 1.03% of the European national product for the 2003 budget.
The Council cut this back slightly.
According to the financial perspective, i.e. the financial forecasts we have all agreed on, it should in fact be 1.08%.
I think this should in fact be taken as a guideline, even though I am in favour of keeping certain reserves back for contingencies, just to be on the safe side.
The Council has now made across-the-board reductions, for example in the agricultural sector, but has disregarded the fact that we need to revalue in order to take account of the current value of the dollar.
But we are agreed that a new presentation of the necessary agricultural expenditure needs to be made in the autumn.
The Council has accepted a great many of the Commission's estimates for the draft 2003 budget. We welcome that.
We also generally welcome the fact that a consensus has been reached in the foreign policy area and that the so-called emergency reserve can also be used to fund civil crisis management.
I think that this should give us more chance to react quickly to crises and that this is an important step on the road towards a clear, efficient common foreign and security policy.
However, I must also seriously criticise the outcome of the Council reading.
For example, the question of how funds to restructure the fisheries fleet in Spain and Portugal or measures needed to support sustainable fisheries reforms shall be financed has still not been answered.
This question was broached but then put on the back burner.
And the Council has reduced funds to cofinance the trans-European transport and energy network by 15 million. Member States already have high hopes in precisely this sector, which will now be discussed in connection with natural disasters.
I think this reduction should also be reversed.
I must also heavily criticise the Council decision on personnel expenditure, i.e. its approach to the personnel costs of the individual institutions.
The financial perspective allowed a 3.6% increase for all the institutions.
And yet the Council has awarded itself a much higher increase.
Taking personnel costs alone, the Council has awarded itself a twofold increase.
And if you add in all the Council's administrative expenditure, the Council has awarded itself an 11% increase.
I must state quite clearly here, to paraphrase the words used with such gusto by the Ecofin Council, the Council of Finance Ministers, on another occasion: this Council decision on its own administrative resources does not fit into the budgetary landscape.
It has helped itself, at the cost of others, to be precise at the cost of the Commission, where the Council has suggested swingeing cuts.
Obviously, the Commission's administrative expenses for the year 2003 will be very high, because this is the year we shall be preparing for the biggest enlargement in the history of the European Union and the Commission will need to start preparations in 2003 so that we can control new members right from the start.
For example, we shall need to control how environmental laws are being transposed, if competition rules are being complied with, what the situation is in the food law sector or the veterinary sector and whether European Union legislation is also being implemented.
These are just some examples of the Commission's work.
Obviously, there is no point in starting to negotiate structural assistance or agricultural aid programmes with new members once they have already joined.
Preparations need to start now and that takes staff.
