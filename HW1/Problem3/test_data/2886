There is no question of creating an exception to these rules.
In relation to your Committee on Regional Development, Mr Janowski, obviously major hubs cannot grow infinitely.
What is required is better use of existing capacities.
The role of regional airports will be enhanced.
You also insisted, and rightly so, on airport connections in their own region, their 'interland', through a number of rapid means of transport, especially rail transport.
Some of you asked me about ground handling.
Obviously today, as Mr Jarzembowski said, we cannot commit a new directive to cover ground handling services, since we have not yet received the impact analysis, and we prefer to focus on applying the existing Directive.
We are therefore focusing on monitoring proper application of the existing Directive.
In relation to the new Member States, we have requested precise information on an airport-by-airport basis in relation to the number of providers, their dependence on the airport and the conditions for the award of contracts, and if we are not satisfied with the replies we can always invoke the infringement proceedings that apply in such cases.
I must also say that, if we were in fact compelled to change this directive on ground handling services, we would pay close attention to the social effects of changes to the rules.
Some mention has also been made - by your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - of the need for better use of infrastructures at night with quieter planes.
I would be tempted to say yes, but in the medium and long term.
We have not come that far yet.
I wish to finish by mentioned the environmental problems: as air traffic develops we must evidently do all we can to ensure that it does not impede our fight against global warming.
This is why Europe has adopted quite an avant-garde approach by supporting the idea of making air transport join the emissions trading system.
As far as airport infrastructures are concerned, we are also worried about all the problems that may be caused here, particularly the nuisance value for local residents and noise levels.
Mr President, such a productive debate has not enabled me to find answers for everything but, as a number of speakers said, obviously Mrs Jensen's report forms an excellent basis on which to build.
I will follow Parliament's requests with great interest in an attempt to provide an appropriate response.
I might also say that in any case I am glad to have worked in close cooperation with the EP for the benefit of our citizens.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at voting time, to be held in a few minutes.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) It is common knowledge that the environmental damage that goes with flying, excluding the emission of greenhouse gases, largely originates in take-off, landing and taxiing.
This primarily hits the area around airports and those who live there.
Their demands for reducing airport traffic are justified.
On the other hand, flying is part of our everyday life, and our way of life has changed with its having become accessible to those on low incomes, pensioners and students.
Even the European Union could not work if we could not get from Budapest, Athens or Helsinki to Brussels in a matter of hours.
The solution is therefore to reorganise airport traffic in an environmentally conscious way.
Unnecessarily long taxiing of aircraft on the ground and circling for a long time over airports must be stopped.
Pollution of the area around airports would be greatly reduced if millions of passengers used the train or metro system to reach the airport instead of cars.
Railway and metro lines to airports must therefore be built in parallel with airport development, and no new international airport should be built without suitable rail links.

Composition of the European Parliament (vote)
- Report: Alain Lamassoure, Adrian Severin
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Madam President, I would just like to make a clarification, because several different terms are used in the report and in the amendments, and I would like everybody to know what we are going to vote on.
There are a number of amendments by Mr Tajani and others which, when speaking about 'citizens', have in mind national citizens and not European citizens.
When voting one way or the other on those amendments, please bear in mind that they are not talking about European citizens, but national citizens.
I am sure everybody understands that this is an important difference.
Thank you for your clarification.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like some clarification from the rapporteurs and Parliamentary officials.
I wish to know whether, if Amendment 1, first signatory Mr Mayor Oreja, were to be adopted, Amendment 51 would fall.
I think this is a mistake, and that if Amendment 1 by Mr Mayor Oreja were to be adopted, Amendment 51 would not fall, but it would change the voting intention of the Italian delegation.
Mr Tajani, one of the co-rapporteurs will speak on that matter when we get to that point.
I think you are right but, for the moment, let us proceed.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to point out that, ever since Maastricht, European citizenship has coincided with national citizenship in all of the Treaties.
They are the very same, identical thing.
Is that fact clear to my colleague Mr Severin?
(The vote was suspended for a few moments owing to technical problems)
Madam President, I kept the numbers of votes 'for' and 'against' for the last two recorded votes and they were identical.
That was when we had the first problem.
You may care to take the vote on amendment 21 by the IND/DEM Group again.
I think you are absolutely right.
I, too, was worried by what was happening at that stage.
(The vote was suspended again for a few moments)
(FR) Madam President, we have no roll-call vote for the other reports.
Perhaps we could begin by voting on the reports that do not require a roll-call vote, if you do not mind, so that we can keep the sitting moving?
The problem is, we are in mid-report, so I am afraid we do have to conclude it before we can take something else.
- Before the vote on Amendment 1:
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, I do apologise to everyone for the question due to my inexperience: this is only my third term in the House.
If I have understood correctly, if Amendment 1 were adopted this would retain the text in the paragraph of the amendment and remove the figures corresponding to the number of seats in the report.
Is this how I should take it?
I am asking the authors of the amendment: is that the way everyone understands it?
This means I have made a mistake, and therefore I apologise to those involved.
I recommended a positive vote when drawing up the PPE-DE voting list, because I thought that the amendment concerned only the text.
However, where figures are concerned, for the PPE-DE Group the instruction changes to a free vote, and along with my co-rapporteur I invite all those who wish to support the proposals of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs to vote against Amendment 1.
(Applause)
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is still not clear whether Amendment 1 is compatible with Amendment 51.
If Amendment 1 is compatible with Amendment 51, as I believe it is, the Italian delegation will vote in favour of Amendment 1, but we do need this clarification.
This amendment will dispose of all the others.
Our congratulations to our co-rapporteurs, and our thanks to our technicians.

The next item is the vote.

(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on recital S:
Madam President, this is an oral amendment to Amendment 7 on Recital S, and it is to replace the words 'authors of crimes' with the words 'perpetrators of crimes'. This is necessary, otherwise the sentence will have no meaning in English.

Explanations of vote
in writing. - (PT) The harmonisation and reliability of data and information collected on marine activities is of critical importance for the fisheries sector and all efforts undertaken to improve their quality should be supported.
Given the sector's current needs and ecosystem concerns, the European Commission has proposed that Council Regulation (EC) No 1543/2000 be amended while the European Parliament assesses a proposal for a Council regulation on a new Community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector.
It is therefore necessary to amend the existing Council Regulation (EC) No 1543/2000 in order to prevent an overlap between the old and the new regulations.
The current Commission proposal makes these necessary and logical changes and was unanimously approved by the Committee on Fisheries.
It also now merits my vote in favour in plenary.
in writing. - I voted for this report, which approves a Commission proposal amending (and preparing for the repeal of) Regulation 1543/2000 (a Community framework for the collection and management of the data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy).
The Commission aims to bring in a new, more comprehensive data collection regulation in 2008; this amendment allows for a better transition by removing current requirements to submit six-year national programmes for the collection and management of data from 2007 to 2012.
Instead, transitional programmes covering the years 2007 and 2008 are to be drawn up.
in writing. - UKIP wish to see the common agricultural policy abolished.
Therefore, under no circumstances can we vote for a report that gives even more power to a Commission whose legitimacy we do not recognise.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Chatzimarkakis report, which seeks to improve the CAP's budgetary execution and transparency, in other words to identify the beneficiaries of aid for agriculture.
I feel the legitimacy of the CAP, one of the largest items of EU expenditure, is all too often called into question by the opacity with which agricultural aid is managed.
The merit of this report is that it clarifies the situation.
I am most satisfied by the Internet postings of all the national lists of direct beneficiaries of EU aid, and the links to be set up between the web pages of the Commission and the Member State payment bodies.
Monitoring of CAP financing, however, must be carried out in strict compliance with the regulations governing data protection.
That is why I voted against the amendments requiring the registration or recording of users consulting the data, since transparency must be guaranteed on both sides.
I also believe that the data on the payments of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ought to be broken down in order to identify the major beneficiaries.
in writing. - (PT) We regard as essential the need expressed in the Commission proposal, and highlighted in the parliamentary report, to increase transparency, both in the financing of the common agricultural policy and in the provision of accounts in respect of the expenditure practices of the EU institutions.
It is also essential to improve budgetary control.
However, we are disappointed at the proposal's limited scope and the fact that the European Parliament has not been ambitious enough in either its report or its amendments.
In our opinion, there are still some proposals of no practical use which in fact limit the freedoms and guarantees of citizens, such as the requirement for 'those using, or looking at, the data [on the Internet to] sign on or register'.
In addition, there is some ambiguity, both in the Commission's proposal and in the EP's report, with regard to the continued publication of information.
It is proposed, from the start, to carry out 'an assessment of the advantages or otherwise of the publication of this data' in the future.
Another debatable issue is the reinforcement of the Commission's power of control over the Member States.
Finally, we consider that the best way of enhancing 'transparency and public understanding of the common agricultural policy' - an objective expressed in the proposal - is through its complete overhaul.
in writing. - (PT) The Commission's proposal to make certain amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is necessary in order to make this process more transparent.
I believe that improved transparency, together with better use of the agricultural funds, would help to eliminate the European population's distrust of the CAP and the European institutions.
I am therefore voting in favour of Mr Chatzimarkakis's report, which reiterates the Commission's position and adds certain amendments that I regard as important.
in writing. - I voted for this report, which proposes a range of improvements to the transparency of the CAP.
It calls on national lists of recipients of EU direct farm aid to be published on the internet.
The UK already does this, and I would like to see other states doing the same.
The report also calls for better procedures to take when publication requirements are not followed, and for data protection to be included in the Commission regulation itself.
in writing. - (DE) Across the board, our small farmers, who are the salt of the earth, are being submerged in a sea of irrelevant bureaucracy and subjected to satellite surveillance, and woe betide them if their fence is standing a little too far to the right or the left.
It is time for some humanity again, instead of beating our hardworking small farmers senseless with bureaucratic cudgels.
The black sheep who fabricate entire fields and business activities and who cause BSE and other scandals should be named and shamed.
It is a mockery, however, to say that prices are rising so this could justify cutting subsidies.
Austrian organic farmers were getting around seven schillings - equivalent to around 95 cent - per litre of milk before accession.
Today, they get just 30 cent, which means that they are losing thousands of euros, and at the same time they are having to contend with ever-changing bureaucratic regulations that make their lives even more difficult!
The 'health check' envisaged must therefore serve only one purpose: to create a better, more reliable and longer-lasting framework, not to bring about reform by brute force and cause our last remaining farmers to throw in the towel.
In view of the massive exodus from farming in Europe, the idea that unspent agricultural funding could be used for prestige projects such as Galileo must be vigorously rejected.
We must retain our self-sufficiency capacity at all costs, and should not offer ourselves as hostages to fortune to the genetic engineering companies.
in writing. - (SV) Jorgo Chatzimarkaki's report further reinforces the Commission's initiative to increase the legitimacy of EU policies through disclosure of full details of expenditure practices and improved accounting and budgetary control in the agricultural sector, among other things as a result of a number of changes.
I supported the parts of the report that sought to enhance public transparency regarding the use of Community funds and the publication of information on beneficiaries.
I likewise supported the need for Member States to ensure annual ex-post publication, via the Internet, of the beneficiaries of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the amounts received per beneficiary under each of these Funds.
However, I opposed the provisions under which those using or looking at information are required to sign on or register because this runs counter to the Swedish principle of the right to anonymity in connection with the use of such public information.
My intentions to vote against Amendment 20 in view of the strong Swedish principle of public access to official documents have been entered in the minutes, after a vote on my behalf was cast incorrectly.
in writing. - UKIP abstained on this report as we do not recognise the legitimacy of Parliament.
This in no way reflects our views on the content of the report.
UKIP wish to see the common agricultural policy abolished.
Therefore, under no circumstances can we vote for a report that gives even more power to a Commission whose legitimacy we do not recognise.
in writing. - (PT) The negotiations conducted by the European Commission under a mandate received from the Council have the central objective of establishing an Open Aviation Area (OAA) between the EU and the US, going beyond the bilateral agreements that currently exist between individual Member States and the US.
The aim is to create a single liberalised market for air transport between the EU and the US, 'in which investment could flow freely and in which European and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties'.
The EU's aim is to ensure reciprocity by the US in the liberalisation of air transport, in particular with regard to removing 'the existing legal restrictions on foreign ownership and control of US airlines and on cabotage' and also with regard to the 'right of establishment' and 'State aid'.
This is why we reiterate that it should be the Member States and not the Community concluding this type of agreement, all the more so as this issue is of such strategic importance and 'could serve as a model for further liberalisation and regulatory convergence worldwide'.
We therefore restate our opposition to the pursuit of the liberalisation of this important public service in each country.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a decision of the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council, on the conclusion and temporary implementation of the Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the United States of America, on the other hand (8044/3/2007 - - C6-0210/2007 -.
Mr El Khadraoui rightly pointed out the importance of creating an Open Aviation Area between the EU and the US, thus allowing the emergence of a single market for air transport between the EU and the US.
I support the view that this would enable investment to flow freely and EU and US airlines to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties.
That represents a mayor step forward.
It was entirely appropriate to raise the issue of environmental protection in this context.
The aviation sector has several negative environmental effects, in particular as a source of noise and as a contributor to climate change.
I therefore agree with the provision calling on both the EU and the US to take effective measures to reduce the negative environmental impact of aviation.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which endorses plans to liberalise air transport arrangements between the EU and the United States of America.
This levels the playing field for European airlines flying to the US, and should allow more rational construction of routes, leading to better services and more efficient routing of flights.
In increasing the number of possible transatlantic routes it may even lead to lower fares for passengers.
in writing. - (PT) The conclusion of this agreement is intended to meet long-standing needs on both sides of the Atlantic, with obvious benefits for consumers resulting from further liberalisation and regulatory convergence worldwide.
For the EU, it will also serve to guarantee compliance with Community legislation.
The work carried out to conclude this agreement must therefore be applauded as the new legal framework ensures wide-ranging agreement on the creation of an integrated transatlantic aviation market that will be to the benefit of both consumers and companies.
However, on reading this agreement, it is apparent that the removal of restrictions on foreign control of US airlines is somewhat disproportionate and, in addition, cabotage has not been included.
The European Parliament's suggestion to include subsequent stages, deadlines for conclusion and consequences of any non-compliance in this phased approach to the agreement is therefore crucial and should be applauded.
Furthermore, conditions have been laid down for re-establishing full reciprocity in the EU-US aviation market if the negotiations do not achieve the balance desired by both parties.
To sum up, this is a good start towards objectives not yet achieved.
in writing. - I am convinced that there is a need for such an agreement but it has to be one which can be delivered on both sides.
Airports in south-east England have had to open 'aircraft slots' for USA partner airlines and potentially many others.
The reverse is not true in the USA.
'Freedom rights' are not granted to EU airlines for intra-USA flights.
This means that flights emanating from Gatwick to New York cannot fly to Los Angeles, but USA flights to Gatwick can fly to anywhere they want in the EU.
Similarly, there is no relaxation of the foreign ownership rules of USA airlines.
There is a clear lack of balance in the first stage agreement; this lack of balance against the EU has to be addressed urgently in the second stage negotiations.
I will be looking to reinforce this effort within the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue.
(NL) Madam President, I am not going to go over yesterday's debate again.
I explained then that for us the Lamassoure report is tantamount to putting the cart before the horse, as we still do not have a valid transitional treaty, we still do not have a new treaty.
The problem with this report it that it lets loose the typical Loch Ness monster of the Eurofederalists again, that is the spectre of transnational lists, on the basis of which some Members of the European Parliament would be elected.
Well then, I still proceed from the assumption that we here are representatives of our electorates in the Member States, of our populations in the Member States, and not just abstract citizens of the European Union.
(PL) Madam President, I believe a house should be built upwards from its foundations, not the other way round, which is effectively what the report by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin is doing.
The Treaty on European Union constitutes the foundations.
The Treaty must first be ratified, and I believe ratification is to take place within the next few weeks.
That is one reason why I voted against this report, even though it contains many good points.
Another reason why I voted against it is that I do not agree with my country being represented by as many as three fewer Members than it currently is.
The number of Polish Members would be reduced from 54 to 51.
These are my reasons for voting against the report.
(ES) Actually, yesterday I submitted my explanation of vote in writing and I received a response to the effect that it was still being dealt with, and so on.
That is one thing. However, my name is Irujo Amezaga.
'Amenaza' means something completely different in Spanish: it means 'threat' and I am do not think I am that just yet.
In any case, my explanation of vote was on the Lamassoure report.
I voted against this report and I acknowledge that the composition of the European Parliament is a difficult issue.
My amendment on supra-state constituencies that recognised political and cultural realities and went beyond the borders of the current Member States was rejected in committee.
If we really want a Union of the European people, as stated in the EC Treaty, this Parliament should be open to other types of realities.
I am sorry for my pronunciation - my Spanish lessons are continuing.
in writing. - In regard to the future composition of the European Parliament, I voted against the unwarranted attempt (Amendment 26) to inflate the representation of the Republic of Ireland to 13 MEPs.
Northern Ireland has a population of 1.7 million and three MEPs; the Republic of Ireland's population is 4.3 million, yet under Amendment 26 it would have 13 MEPs, meaning a representative for every 330 000 citizens, whereas in Northern Ireland the ratio is one MEP to every 630 000 citizens.
Clearly, the Republic of Ireland already is very generously provided for and should count itself lucky to hold 12 seats.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report.
We believe that the principle of degressive proportionality is reasonable and has good chances of being supported by the EU's Heads of State and Government.
The other proposals that have been put forward have no realistic chance of being accepted at the summit.
The report gives Sweden 20 seats rather than the 18 we would get if the Treaty of Nice were to apply.
It is therefore important for the treaty to be adopted.
Otherwise the Treaty of Nice will apply, which would mean that all the Member States except Germany would lose seats.
The questions of how to define the concept of citizen and how to work out the population base governing the distribution of seats must be investigated.
We are very doubtful about trans-national lists for European Parliament elections.
If the matter is investigated, however, we may accept it.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my colleagues Alain Lamassoure and Adrian Severin on the composition of the European Parliament.
They both knew that the current EP composition, established by the 2005 Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, was to be modified, even if that meant going back to the provisions of the Treaty of Nice.
I applaud Alain Lamassoure's bid to rally his political family and regret that a number of national attitudes in disagreement with the Council decisions required some awkward debate, and eventually arbitration in plenary.
This debate has highlighted the extent of national selfishness in some cases.
Although I have my reservations about the idea of examining the possibility of electing some Members on transnational lists, I am happy with Annex 2 of the resolution, which requires the IGC to ask Parliament for a draft providing for the election of its Members by direct universal suffrage that provides a more accurate definition of the notion of 'citizens' in Article 9(a)(2) of the Treaty on the EU.
The concept of a European citizen must certainly be defined.
in writing. - I voted against Amendment 25 because, while the UK is still a member of the EU, the number of MEPs representing the UK should not be reduced at all.
Therefore, to vote in favour of 74 MEPs would have been to vote for a reduction of four.
Under the proposed principle of 'degressive proportionality', which is yet to be defined, small countries and microstates would be disproportionately represented while larger states, such as the UK, would be under-represented.
Considering that large numbers of the population of Eastern Europe have migrated to the UK since 2004, and that they are currently entitled to vote in European Parliament elections, the number of UK MEPs should at least remain at its current 78, if not be increased.
in writing. - During the vote on the Lamassoure report we have voted consistently for a fair distribution of seats between the Member States and in particular for 13 seats for Ireland.
We campaigned throughout this process for 13 seats for our country.
The arguments in favour are well known.
We have a rapidly growing population in Ireland - it is the fastest-growing population in Europe, both in terms of natural increase in population as well as overall growth.
We were also one of the biggest losers proportionally under the Nice Treaty in terms of seats in the European Parliament.
Unfortunately the Irish Government did little to support the campaign to retain our current allocation of 13 seats.
Our vote today will at least ensure that Ireland's allocation of seats will not fall below 12 for the next mandate, with provision for a full review before 2014 including on the vexed question of the use of a 'population vs. citizen' statistical basis for assessing the MEP allocation in Member States.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Lamassoure report on the distribution of EP seats after the legislative elections in 2009.
The new distribution balances out the number of seats in accordance with population trends in the Member States.
I am glad that France has two more MEPs than those envisaged by the revised Treaty of Nice.
I also support the idea that the new distribution ought to be reviewed well in advance of the 2014-2019 parliamentary term in order to ensure a fair and objective system for the distribution of seats in Parliament, taking account of population changes, which would prevent the usual log-rolling between Member States.
in writing. - (PT) The Members elected by the Social Democratic Party (SDP), although they consider that this is not a perfect solution and that it fails to impose a requirement for further negotiations in the context of future enlargements, support Mr Lamassoure's report on the composition of the European Parliament for three reasons:
1.
Some Member States do not agree with simply defining the general principles and require, as a condition of approval, the strict definition of the EP's composition before they will accept the Reform Treaty.
This could compromise the main priority of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.
2.
Mr Lamassoure has proposed a balanced compromise solution, which provides for a minimum limit guaranteeing the plurality of the representation of the smaller states and which takes account of the demographic size of the other states through a principle of degressive proportionality, ensuring a fair relationship between the states.
3.
It therefore blocks the unacceptable attempts of the German, Polish, Spanish and Italian Members to reinforce the weight of the more populous states by reducing the representation of the medium-sized states such as Portugal.
in writing. - I have to express my disquiet about the principle embodied in the very notion of presenting this report to plenary.
Having a Parliament determine the basis of its own composition seems to me to be fundamentally flawed.
As one of my Irish colleagues said in the debate, 'Turkeys don't vote for Christmas'.
I have been a Member of this House since 1984, when we had 434 Members, and now we have 785 Members.
With each successive growth in numbers of parliamentarians, working groups, committees and plenaries have become unwieldy and increasingly ineffective.
This is to be institutionalised here with a supposed 'reduction' to 750 Members, a size 30-40% too large to be effective, unless we want to model ourselves on China's largely ornamental 3 000-strong National People's Congress.
The other anomaly that strikes me is that, while we are allowed to select our composition, a vitally important institutional decision for the whole of the European institutions and the Union itself, we are not allowed to choose our own meeting place because of the recalcitrance of one Member State and instead are 'sold a pup' by the City of Strasbourg that is riddled with asbestos.
in writing. - (PL) I am sorry it has not proved possible to find a new and permanent solution for the distribution of seats in the European Parliament between the various Member States of the Union.
The current method of distribution is temporary, and only applies to the next parliamentary term.
The method applied for distribution of seats is not clear and comprehensible to EU citizens.
In addition to application of the principle of degressive proportionality, political criteria also had a significant bearing on the distribution of seats in Parliament. This was detrimental to representation of the citizens, which should actually be the governing principle.
Furthermore, the proposed distribution of seats is based on the number of inhabitants of a given Member State, rather than on the number of citizens of the state concerned.
My country, Poland, for example, would therefore lose out due to the temporary economic migration of some two million of its citizens who are currently employed in other Member States of the Union.
Incidentally, it should also be pointed out that this is illogical, since the EU encourages worker mobility.
We would like to reiterate our warning that the principles by which the Union is governed appear overly complicated to its citizens. The latter are therefore feeling more and more misgivings about the Union's institutions.
in writing. - (SV) We are firmly opposed to the idea of one constituency across the entire EU with perhaps 10% of the European Parliament's seats.
Creating a separate EU constituency is an artificial way to try to create a European demos.
There is no common political arena in Europe with media or debate covering all the Member States.
Each country has its own political agenda.
An attempt to break barriers of language and tradition by creating EU parties, entirely dependent on EU contributions, is doomed to failure.
We recall that 54.4% of voters stayed at home in the 2004 European Parliament elections.
The 'stay-at-home party' is the biggest party in the European Parliament elections. There is no enthusiasm for European Parliament elections in the new Member States either.
In Slovakia the turn-out was 16.96% in 2004.
With any enlargement of the EU to countries such as Ukraine and Turkey the present Member States will have their delegations cut back. This affects the smaller groups and reduces political diversity.
There will be no place for regional parties or minority parties in the European Parliament.
Both the Christian Democrats/Conservatives (PPE-DE) and the Socialists (PSE) would seem to have a hidden agenda of trying to create a two-party system in the European Parliament.
We are voting in favour of the report, not because it is excellent, but because it represents an improvement.
in writing. - (PT) We must be clear on this as there are many numbers:
1.
This proposal means that, since 1999, Portugal has firstly gone from 25 to 24 Members and will now be reduced to 22, whereas Germany kept its 99 Members, which will now be reduced to 96.
In other words, Portugal has lost 12% and Germany has lost 3%.
2.
The six most populous countries currently hold around 56% of the seats in the European Parliament.
With this proposal their control is fully maintained at 56%.
In other words, they have given nothing.
Therefore, through the current reform of the Treaties, the major powers are reasserting their control over the Council, by applying the demographic criterion without any weighting, and are maintaining their full control over the EP.
Portugal is losing out!
If some are in control, others must be...
In order to conceal their connivance with such an unacceptable situation, some are saying that it could be worse.
Others think that it is natural that only some countries should be able to defend their interests..., at the expense of the interests of others.
Finally, but without forgetting other important aspects - such as the rejection of the creation of a supranational electoral body or the fact that the fewer Members Portugal has, the less they will represent the political plurality existing in our country - we reiterate that a fair solution at institutional level must without question respect the principle of cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights.
in writing. - I am voting for Amendment 26, which argues that Ireland should retain the 13 seats it currently has.
Under the Nice Treaty, Ireland was allocated 12 seats; however, since the Nice Treaty, Ireland's population has increased by 12%.
It is the fastest-growing population in the EU, in terms of national increase and overall growth.
This report gives Ireland an allocation of 12 seats - three less than the 15 that Ireland had for the 1999-2004 term, which means we will lose 20% of our quota from 2004.
in writing. - British Conservatives are opposed to the EU Constitution and to the draft EU Reform Treaty.
We do not agree with the terms of the draft IGC mandate delivered by the European Council or the text of the draft Treaty published on 5 October.
In the context of the request by the Council for an opinion by the European Parliament on the future composition of the European Parliament, British Conservatives have abstained on the Lamassoure-Severin Report.
We have done so because we disagree with the model and methodology proposed by the co-rapporteurs, which we believe is unsustainable in the long term.
We also disagree with the call for the election of MEPs on transnational lists.
We also deeply regret the fact that the important historical parity on this issue that existed between the UK, France and Italy has been abandoned.
We are nonetheless determined to pursue the best interests of the people of the United Kingdom who we believe are currently numerically under-represented in the European Parliament.
These factors have determined our position in voting on this report.
in writing. - (FR) How can a report be submitted to the representatives of Member States using legal and institutional notions that are simultaneously hazy, new, dangerous and utopian?
Degressive proportionality, the main feature of the report, means nothing beyond the fact that larger states will again lose seats to smaller states.
It is true that at the European Council meeting in Nice Mr Chirac originally initiated the process by agreeing for the first time to uncouple France with respect to Germany, contrary to the spirit of the Treaties.
As for electing Members from transnational lists, it is obvious what the aim is here: to get rid of politically incorrect parties that do not accept the languid social-democrat consensus, and to remove any reference to anything that is still the regal domain of the nation states.
We obviously cannot accept this.
The notion of European citizen put forward by the rapporteurs is both dangerous and utopian, and in fact it is totalitarian.
It implies that nationality is a thing of the past and that the brave new world consists of a new 'denationalised' man, bereft of his roots, his history and his culture.
For all these reasons, we feel that the Lamassoure report is an unacceptable legal, political and institutional regression.
The distribution of seats in Parliament between the Member States is not based on objective population figures but on promises made in the past and on negotiations that have been won or lost.
That is why the large countries - France, Italy and the United Kingdom - always have the same number of seats despite having different populations, as do Spain and Poland.
The same applies to Greece, Portugal, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
Some countries are underrepresented, such as the Netherlands, which was foolish enough in 2000 to settle for fewer seats in Parliament in exchange for more votes in the Council.
We support the rapporteurs' proposal because it is closer to a fair distribution than previous proposals.
We reject all the amendments that want a less fair distribution, no matter who they favour, or that make a distinction between 'citizens' and other inhabitants when calculating the population of each country.
We support the amendments that automatically couple the future distribution of seats to the populations of the Member States.
We reject future reductions in the number of seats per Member State if they do not result from population decrease, but from the maximum of 750 seats or from the search for scope to elect a proportion of Members from transnational lists.
With that proviso we vote in favour.
in writing. - I voted for and welcome the Lamassoure-Severin Report on the composition of the European Parliament.
However, I find it rather strange that Parliament has the right to decide on the distribution of its seats but not on where it sits.
It is clear that the Council is incapable of sorting out the mess of Parliament having three locations and I call on it to follow the logic of giving Parliament the right to allocate its seats by giving it the right to decide where it meets.
This report recommends a new, fairer composition for the European Parliament to apply to the 2009-2014 Parliament.
The report's operating principle of degressive proportionality, which calls for bigger Member States to accept fewer MEPs than a strict proportional distribution would allow, is one I agree with.
It will ensure that smaller Member States have viable parliamentary delegations, and that Parliament can return to a slightly more reasonable size of 750.
in writing. - (PT) Given the need to alter the composition of the European Parliament due to past and future enlargements, I believe that the solution adopted in this report has the virtues of being consistent with what has already been agreed (Nice), of not increasing the control of the most populous states over the others, by maintaining a model of balance between states which is quite understandable, and of helping to reduce the difficulties associated with the adoption of the Reform Treaty.
Therefore, despite having preferred, as apparent from the voting, a model based on the concept of citizenship and not residence - given that the link between citizens and the European Union must be one of citizenship and not residence - I voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - Today's vote was crucial for the future working of the EP.
It was necessary to have, on such a sensitive issue, a firm political indication from the EP towards the European Council, showing that national interests can be overcome to agree on a better system than the one laid down by the Nice Treaty.
Even if the proposal made today is far from being perfect, it is fairer than the distribution of seats laid down by the Nice Treaty.
After the EP unanimously called on the Council to define the term 'citizens' as provided in Article 9a(2) in good time before the next elections in 2014, I decided, in the interest of my country and the working of the EP, to vote in favour of the report, as this shows some progress in relation to what had been agreed upon before.
in writing. - (SV) The importance of the issue should not be overestimated.
A new distribution of Members among the Member States will not change the current developments in the EU.
The majority will continue to remain with the economic liberals and federalists in Parliament.
However, the report clearly expresses principles governing a distribution that by its nature will be approximate in the final analysis.
The distribution will be even better than the current situation, as the biggest country gets fewer members whilst the smallest ones get more.
I therefore voted in favour of the report, even though there are individual paragraphs that I do not support, in particular the provisions on trans-national lists and European parties.
The Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament voted against the Lamassoure-Severin report because it further strengthens the confrontational nature of the European Parliament.
in writing. - I voted against Amendment 25 because, while the UK is still a member of the EU, the number of MEPs representing the UK should not be reduced at all.
Therefore, to vote in favour of 74 MEPs would have been to vote for a reduction of four.
Under the proposed principle of 'degressive proportionality', which is yet to be defined, small countries and microstates would be disproportionately represented while larger states, such as the UK, would be under-represented.
Considering that large numbers of the population of Eastern Europe have migrated to the UK since 2004, and that they are currently entitled to vote in European Parliamentary elections, the number of UK MEPs should at least remain at its current 78, if not be increased.
in writing. - (SV) Sweden should hold a referendum on the new constitution in order to obtain exceptions and an 'opt-in' clause (like the United Kingdom).
With such an opt-in clause, for example, Sweden gets the right to decide itself whether, and if so when, to introduce the euro and to sign up to the Social Charter.
However, this does not mean that I do not want a clear document as the basis for the EU which plainly defines the EU's field of competence.
Such a document must contain, among other things, rules on the distribution of seats in Parliament.
I am therefore prepared to support this part of the proposal for a new EU constitution specifically relating to the distribution of seats.
The fact is that unless the proposal on the distribution of seats comes into being in accordance with the proposal for a new EU constitution, there is a great risk that we will have to go back to the Treaty of Nice.
The consequence of the Treaty of Nice is that Sweden gets only 18 seats, two fewer than Sweden gets under the proposal for a new EU constitution, and two fewer than Sweden is entitled to given the relative sizes of the EU Member States.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the resolution on the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
I am concerned by the deterioration of health indicators in Palestine and aware of the difficulties posed by closure of border control posts, thereby curtailing economic activity and free circulation of goods, and I request that emergency and humanitarian aid be allowed to continue unhindered.
I condemn the increasingly difficult living conditions that are rife in Gaza: the blockade preventing the movement of people and goods, partial privatisation of access to water, food and electricity, destruction of agricultural land, and basic services such as refuse collection that no longer operate properly and are on the point of collapse.
I feel it is urgent for human rights to be fully respected in Gaza, and I wish to call for an international peace conference to be organised to usher in a fair and lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians; a peace based on the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions concerning the Israelis' right to live within secure recognised borders and the Palestinians' right to a viable state.
in writing. - I support this resolution.
The current humanitarian situation in Gaza can only cause deep concern.
The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip must be lifted and electricity and fuel must be supplied.
Also, Israel must guarantee the flow of financial assets to the Gaza Strip suspended since September 2007, the lack of which has seriously impacted the economic, social and daily life of the Palestinian people.
The Council and the Commission must use all the pressure they can exert to persuade the Israeli Government to move and to guarantee future essential humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people.
in writing. - (PT) Given the terrible situation in which the Palestinian people have been put, the European Parliament has adopted a resolution which, while recognising the extremely serious situation not only in the Gaza Strip but also in the other Palestinian occupied territories, does not hold Israel liable or condemn it for its deep-rooted responsibility, particularly for the destruction of the Palestinian National Authority and its supporting institutions and infrastructures, including those meeting the most basic needs of the population, and for seeking to prevent the creation of a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian State.
Israel has imposed a brutal blockade on the Gaza Strip, thus creating, as denounced a long time ago by UN officials, a gigantic prison for the Palestinian people, depriving them of the most fundamental human rights and preventing the provision of humanitarian aid by UN organisations.
It is imperative that this inhumane blockade be lifted, with Israel being ordered to end its aggression towards the Palestinian people and to fully respect and comply with international law and UN resolutions.
It is also vital for urgent humanitarian aid to be provided to the Palestinian people.
A fair and lasting solution for the Middle East will only be achievable through respect for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to their own independent and sovereign state, respecting the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution, which draws attention to the plight of people in the Gaza Strip.
It calls on Israel to fulfil its international obligations under the Geneva Conventions to guarantee the flow of humanitarian aid, humanitarian assistance and essential services, such as electricity and fuel, to the Gaza Strip.
In calling for an international peace conference, an end to the blockade, and in asking for the Commission and the Council to work towards this, I join most other MEPs in advancing ideas that can make the situation on the ground better for those suffering the consequences of the status quo.
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the EP resolution on the Gaza Strip.
The measure taken by the Israeli Government to declare the Gaza Strip a 'hostile entity' paves the way for economic sanctions.
This measure comes at a time when the Gaza Strip is plunged into a humanitarian crisis, aggravated by the suspension of direct international aid to the Palestinian Authority and Israel's failure to pay back taxes outstanding to the Palestinian Authority since March 2006.
Even if the Israeli authorities have allowed food trucks into Gaza, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East reports shortages of basic foodstuffs caused by frequent closures of the Karni border crossing.
We would not be faced with a humanitarian crisis of such proportions if we had not cut off our aid to the Palestinian people in the first place.
Many other organisations maintained their cooperation with Palestine, particularly a large number of European local authorities.
Is it not time we reviewed our policy of sanctions against Palestine so that this does not hinder supplies of the most essential humanitarian aid to the local population?
in writing. - I wish to stress the importance of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.
Whilst I accept that the political situation is one that is dictating the plight of the people of Gaza, nevertheless it is the people - men, women and children - who are suffering, and heaven knows what long-term effects this will have.
I agree that Israel must feel secure in its own borders, but there are also obligations on Israel to ensure that humanitarian aid and assistance are given to the Gaza Strip.
In Gaza there is a responsibility to end attacks on Israel, and we all have a responsibility to support a viable state for Palestinians, so that the Palestinian people can live securely in peace.
I support this report because it is absolutely essential at this time that we in the EU make our voice heard on behalf of the people of Gaza.
They need help and we should deliver.
in writing. - I wish to support the endeavours of those in this House who have brought to our attention the crucial problems particularly facing those in the Gaza Strip and in the State of Israel and Palestinian areas.
The only way ahead is to move within the United Nations Security Council resolutions and to convene an international peace conference along these lines.
(FR) Madam President, they are killed because they are women.
These murders known as feminicides are caused by a social context influenced by a patriarch mindset that prevents women from becoming socially independent.
The extremely well balanced report by Mr Romeva, although it refers more specifically to feminicides in Latin America and Mexico, forms part of a global strategy to eradicate and prevent violent deaths of women all over the world.
That is why I voted in favour: the EU must promote and defend the values of gender equality.
My amendments, which were in fact taken over by the rapporteur, had focused on support for the victims' families, who are often completely helpless and, to make matters worse, they endure the pain of seeing these murders go unpunished.
I therefore wish to call for awareness and training programmes dealing with gender problems and for measures to promote the creation of effective protection systems for witnesses, victims and their families, psychological support, and free legal aid.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by our Spanish colleague RaÃŒl Romeva i Rueda on the murder of women, or feminicides, in Central America and Mexico and the role of the EU.
I am sorry we are focusing here on Central America and Mexico, for there are many places all over the world where the matter of female murders has not been solved.
I support any global strategy striving to bring about the worldwide eradication of violence against women.
The suffering of women cannot be treated with indifference, and we must support them because their revolt will be at the root of many geopolitical trends in favour of the ideals promoted by the European Union, notably gender equality.
in writing. - UKIP abstained on this report because we do not recognise the legitimacy of Parliament.
This in no way reflects our views on the content of the report.
in writing. - (PT) We voted in favour of this report, which expresses the European Parliament's solidarity with women suffering violence throughout the world, including in our own countries of the European Union, but with particular emphasis on the serious situation in Mexico and certain Central American countries, where there is a real culture of feminicide, with thousands of violent deaths of women in recent years, which cannot simply be attributed to a widespread climate of violence.
This situation stems from cultural causes and socioeconomic contexts that are unfavourable to women and is worse in the case of indigenous women who suffer from high levels of economic dependency.
However, it is also aggravated by the actions of criminal gangs.
We hope that this report will turn the spotlight on this serious situation and therefore help to ensure that, in the various countries concerned, the necessary steps are taken to end feminicide and violence against women.
in writing. - (SV) The June List believes that human rights must be upheld in all societies throughout the world, both in the EU Member States and in other countries.
The report is a motion for a resolution which calls on the Member States and the states concerned to work to uphold women's rights.
This is a deserving cause, but this is not the right forum in which to discuss the matter.
As usual, paragraphs are included where the EU seeks to act with a single voice in foreign policy.
With the report's proposals for new budget headings, campaigns and increased responsibilities the EU is seeking to appropriate more power and to use issues like these as means in that quest.
Crimes against women are unacceptable and a dialogue between sovereign states to put an end to this is to be welcomed because it is important to improve the vulnerable position of women in much of the world.
However, the EU must not pursue a single foreign policy and for that reason we chose to vote against this report.
in writing. - I fully support the report.
Sustainable development is impossible without taking account of gender equality and the right to dignity and peaceful existence.
Such crimes should not be viewed as simply an expression of culture; nor should they be dismissed if they are committed against women who may earn their living as sex workers.
If no serious and consistent efforts are made to investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators, this indicates that violence is acceptable and then no one is safe.
The proposals outlined in the report deserve our support and I trust that Parliament will monitor their progress.
The human rights dimension of our external policies is extremely important: we have to work for the rights of people to live safely and securely in order to exercise their democratic rights and freedoms at all levels of society and whatever their occupation and status.
in writing. - The report by Mr RaÃŒl Romeva i Rueda on the murder of women in Central America and Mexico and the European Union's role in preventing this is a well balanced report.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and his engagement.
He led the negotiations in a very sensitive and positive political style.
I would also like to thank him for the attention he devoted to this topic.
Human rights enjoy a high-ranking importance in the European Union.
Luckily, between the EU and Mexico, human rights topics play an important role; as part of the Free Trade Agreement they even have a kind of formal character and they also play a crucial role in our Joint Parliamentary Delegation, which I have the pleasure to chair and which is now chaired on the Mexican side by Senator JosÃ© Guadarrama MÃ¡rquez.
in writing. - I voted for this report, which I strongly support, and which is part of a global strategy for the eradication and prevention of feminicide and proposes EU actions in the framework of partnership agreements.
I hope to see this issue taken up by the national governments in the framework of their bilateral relations with the countries of Latin America, and European institutions within their strategic partnership, to support the prevention and protection policies relating to violence.
in writing. - (DE) I have supported the report by Mr RaÃŒl Romeva i Rueda because he clearly identifies, in a few points, the main causes of the murders of women in Mexico and Central America: the murders are occurring unhindered in a social and economic context which is geared solely towards economic interests.
A high percentage of them have happened in the so-called free trade zones with their maquiladora industry (sub-contractor companies which produce for the export market), in which the absence of a social infrastructure and high poverty rates are accompanied by impunity for semi-legal security forces.
These structures are reinforced, too, by the EU's relations with Mexico and Central America, with their focus on trade facilitation.
The EU's Association Agreement with Central America, which is due to be concluded before the end of this year, already shows, in its present form, that the EU is mainly interested in market liberalisation and deregulation.
However, the 'creation of a climate favourable to trade and investment', as championed by the Commission, leads to precisely the structures which the report rightly identifies as constituting the unfavourable social and economic context that is conducive to the high rate of murders of women.
The report also sends out an important signal that the human rights clause agreed in the so-called 'Global Agreement' between the EU and Mexico must finally be acted upon.
The work of the relatives' and victims' associations must also be strengthened.
in writing. - I voted for this report recommending that, in order to prevent fraud, transit movements be computerised, the legal framework be revised and the Commission and the Member States improve physical checks based on common risk analysis.
The UK is affected by this issue: up to 4% of potential VAT revenue is being lost to fraud in this area.
in writing. - (DE) The removal of borders very quickly and demonstrably makes itself felt in a massive decrease in turnover from cigarettes, not only in the border region but in the interior as well.
Desolate labour market conditions tempt numerous private individuals to smuggle small quantities of tobacco products across the border on foot as a way of boosting their incomes.
Fantastic profit margins, despite the high transport costs, have also contributed to the massive increase in tobacco smuggling in recent years.
A practice which is written off as a minor crime in some quarters is providing a livelihood for criminal gangs, and a very good one at that: after all, it is easy to bring these black market products to smokers in the EU.
The traffickers know that information campaigns are hardly likely to change the situation, for studies have shown that most buyers are well aware of the higher concentration of harmful substances in these products and the risk of penalties being imposed.
Montenegro's role is especially inglorious, for it has become Europe's main hub for tobacco smuggling, with the State taking a generous cut.
More pressure will have to be brought to bear here through the talks currently under way, and of course the penalties need to be much stiffer and a uniform labelling system introduced to put an end to a state of affairs in which the tobacco producers' lucrative export business ends in illegal re-imports.
in writing. - The EPLP supports the aims of the Philip Morris agreement to combat fraud and illicit cigarette trade in the EU.
However, the UK Government has not signed up to the agreement since it could conflict with existing UK legislation on tobacco smuggling.
Existing legislation applies to all tobacco manufacturers, which is important in ensuring that smuggling activity is not simply displaced into products manufactured by companies that have chosen not to sign an agreement, or who might at some point choose to withdraw from one.
This legislation also contains no significant exclusions, which better allows the UK to address the particular types of tobacco smuggling problems that it encounters.
(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the enterprising report by the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, because the decreasing quality of ground handling services has, over the last while, become an increasingly urgent issue and the true Achilles' heel of the aviation industry.
There are many causes of this.
I would like to address those related to the increased security measures practised in some airports throughout the EU.
Such measures often border on degrading human dignity and increase the risk of spreading infectious diseases, without any tangible impact on security.
I am referring, for example, to the requirement for female passengers to remove publicly any jacket-type items clothing, even when worn over undergarments only.
Similarly, standing barefoot on freezing floors often follows the removal of footwear before going through the security detector.
In addition, when going through passengers' personal items staff often have no respect for basic hygienic rules.
It is evident that if we do not take notice of these issues and demand a better travelling culture as well as respect and politeness during security controls from ground handling personnel, civil aviation will become, as far as ground handling is concerned, a sometimes appalling and unpleasant experience.
in writing. - (PT) Pointing to a rapid rise in goods and passenger air transport, the Commission has decided to produce an 'action plan for airport capacity, efficiency and safety in Europe' in which it puts forward a series of measures.
This European Parliament resolution, despite containing aspects with which we agree - for example, its references to the need for respect for social laws and collective agreements, training or the needs of the most remote regions - subscribes to a concept of liberalisation of the sector and creation of the so-called 'Single European Sky'.
Although it highlights that responsibility for planning airport infrastructures must lie with the Member States, it advocates a 'global EU approach as regards the need for extra capacity, the constraints on future investments in additional capacity and the strategic axes'.
The resolution confirms the primacy of the 'Community competition rules', particularly with regard to the provision of ground handling services whose further liberalisation is not excluded.
It therefore advocates increasing the minimum number of service providers admitted at airports, not setting an artificial limit on the number of third-party handlers and removing constraints preventing ground handling service providers from entering the market.
This is our critical position.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Jensen on 'Airport capacity and ground handling: towards a more efficient policy'.
The report gives appropriate consideration to the issue of ensuring that airports have the required capacity.
Air transport movements are increasing by 5.2% annually.
It has been calculated that by 2025 more than 60 airports will be unable to cope with the demand for flights.
The report provides for the growth in air transport to be accompanied by technical and regulatory programmes to limit its external impact.
The rapporteur rightly points out that the European Union can only meet its requirements in this area by providing different types of airports and responding to the specific needs of each country.
in writing. - I voted for this report, which calls on the Commission to present before 2009 a master plan for enhanced airport capacity in Europe, in order to promote and better coordinate European initiatives for building new airport capacities dedicated to international traffic and to make better use of existing capacities.
Only the cohabitation of various airport models according to national specificities will enable the EU to fulfil its need in this field.
in writing. - (SK) I voted in favour of the Jensen report on 'Airport capacity and ground handling: towards a more efficient policy' because I regard it as fundamental for ensuring sustainable regional development.
Transport infrastructure is often the decisive factor for the location of regional investment, tourism development and rapid transportation of goods.
Air transport offers important value added, especially for less developed, peripheral and island regions.
Globalisation and rapid economic development are giving rise a rise in the demand for flights in the EU.
The current and future development of air transport in Europe urgently require the foresight to anticipate the necessary steps to be adopted at EU level for the benefit of EU citizens and its economy as a whole.
In my opinion, the image of all European regions can be improved by the construction of new airports, the modernisation of existing ones and the conversion of former military airfields into civil airports.
Building and expanding airport and logistical infrastructure requires appropriate assistance from national and regional authorities.
Airports must be included in regional spatial development plans; they must also be part of regional development strategies and be subject to territorial impact assessment with a rigorous environmental impact assessment.
I regard as paramount the financing of airport infrastructure from national and regional funds with the inevitable financial support of the trans-European transport network, the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund.
in writing. - (PT) By identifying 'the construction of relief airports in the vicinity of their congested counterparts' as one of the solutions to situations of airport congestion, as seen in Lisbon, and by noting that 'traditional airlines, low-cost airlines, charter companies, freight companies and business aircraft have different requirements in terms of airport services and slot allocation', the European Parliament is promoting those options presented as being less costly and, at the same time, able to respond to the growth in air traffic, bearing in mind the particular characteristics of that growth.
I therefore voted in favour of this report as I consider that its ratio is contrary to the position defended by the Democratic and Social Centre/People's Party (CDS-PP) for Lisbon which involves the 'Portela +1' option.
in writing. - (SV) Anne Jenssen's report deals with a problem that is trans-national to the highest possible degree.
In other words it was not the lack of EU relevance that made me finally vote against most of the amendments and, in the end, abstain on the report as a whole.
The biggest problem with the report was that in its final version it became too detailed.
I find it hard to see the need for a master plan at EU level governing the way ground-handling services at airports are organised, less still why Brussels should create extra rules and charges in connection with employee training or the location of airports.
Without getting into the issue of the location of Bromma airport, for example, I conclude that it must reasonably be a decision for Stockholm and Sweden, and not for the European Parliament.
in writing. - (SV) The own-initiative report on airport capacity contains high-flying plans for what can be achieved through central planning on the part of the EU.
According to the report, Europe is facing a substantial increase in airport use and there is a need to 'optimise' existing resources.
It is claimed that future developments highlight the need to intervene at EU level 'for the benefit of Union citizens and of the EU economy as a whole'.
It even goes into the infrastructure for connections to airports.
In the vast majority of cases there is national competition, between countries and airports, and strategic decisions must be taken at national level.
In some countries airports are private, and investment decisions are guided by profitability assessments, whilst other countries have public ownership.
The idea of EU planning in this area is therefore entirely unrealistic.
We do not know future demand; and it is changing all the time and shifting between different areas and countries all the time.
Nor can we prophesy how technical developments may affect growth.
We do not know the costs entailed either.
In addition, normally all cost forecasts for infrastructure tend to be two to three times higher than estimated.
Likewise the question of ground-handling services should be a matter for each specific airport and not be regulated at EU level.
The report is inspired by planned-economy thinking.
I cannot support this report, which most recalls the systems to be found in the old socialist countries, and I have therefore voted against it.

Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, last Thursday and Friday we had a very successful summit meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the European Union with the President of the Commission, the President of the European Parliament and our three Intergovernmental Conference representatives.
Whilst I have no wish to anticipate the content of tomorrow's debate with the President-in-Office of the European Council, JosÃ© Socrates, I would like to stress that, in the eyes of the European Parliament, the summit was a truly resounding success because the entry into force of the Treaty, which is scheduled for the start of 2009, will give our Parliament equal rights in almost all areas of legislation.
We in the European Parliament have not wavered from the course we adopted for the Convention and followed in spite of the setbacks in the referendums in France and the Netherlands, and if this Treaty now materialises we shall have played a key part in its creation.
We hope that the ratification process will be successfully concluded in all 27 countries of the European Union.
The signing of the Treaty will take place in Lisbon on 13 December, and on the previous day - the twelfth of December, as agreed with the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission - we shall proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights at a formal sitting here in Strasbourg.
That will be a significant event.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the work of our three representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference - Elmar Brok, Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo and Andrew Duff.
(Applause)
I am pleased to see that Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo is with us, but I cannot see the other representatives.
In that case we shall defer the approval of the Minutes.
(DE) Mr President, I have a question for Mr PÃ¶ttering: will you still have the right to vote in this Parliament?
I am well aware that Mr Cohn-Bendit's thirst for knowledge knows no bounds.
Let me say to you that there was not one second in the entire process when this was in any doubt.
Nor was the matter raised at all during the open session at the summit meeting.
But this rumour was being spread in other circles.
Wherever I could, I acted immediately to quash it.
There can never be a situation where the European Council or any other body could withdraw the voting rights of the President of the European Parliament.
This is not about me personally but about the office of the President of Parliament.
I would vigorously oppose any such move, and the House is united on that stance.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to say, on behalf of my group, that we fully endorse your position.
It goes without saying that every Member of Parliament elected by the people has full voting rights, including the President.
We entirely agree with that.
Excellent!
I am deeply grateful that we are in complete agreement on that point too.

Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday, 17 October, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments to this draft have been tabled:
Wednesday:
The Green Group has moved that the tabling of motions for resolutions be permitted at the end of the debate on the Council and Commission statements concerning the EU-Russia summit.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we spoke about this at the Conference of Presidents and said that, in view of the EU summit with Russia, Mr Putin's trip to Iran and the very real nature of the disputes that are taking place there, it would surely be absurd for this Parliament to debate these matters and not adopt a resolution in which the position of Parliament is set out.
Who are we, in point of fact?
We always want to have powers of codecision, yet now, when we have the opportunity to take a decision, we choose not to.
We are in favour of a resolution prior to the EU-Russia summit and, if need be, another resolution after the summit.
It is the duty of Parliament to scrutinise the Commission and formulate political guidelines and not simply to behave like a debating society.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it has indeed been the practice of this House in the past, on matters of major importance such as the EU-Russia Summit, to have a debate followed by a resolution.
There are many things that need to be said and many messages that this Parliament needs to send to those who will represent the Union at that summit.
We should indeed send a firm message to the Russians and a firm message to the people who will represent us at the summit, with the beliefs of this House behind it.
My Group would therefore support that move.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, if nobody else is speaking against, I will speak against.
Those who are putting forward this motion for a resolution seem to believe that the debates of this House only matter if we adopt a resolution at the end of the debate.
They are actually devaluing the debate itself, because all of them are outside negotiating the text of a resolution instead of being inside the House debating it.
The points they and others wish to make ahead of this summit can be made in this House by a very vigorous debate, by people making articulate and intelligent points, instead of going out and working all night in a drafting committee to add to the huge book that we write at the end of each part-session, with pages and pages of resolutions.
It is about time we changed our priorities and revalued the debates on the floor of this House.
I plead for Members to have vigorous debates in this Parliament.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(DE) Mr President, I am not noted for intervening to any great extent on points of order, but we hold this debate every Monday at five in the afternoon.
I have started to wonder why we have another debate on matters of political importance on Thursday afternoons.
Maybe this very question could be discussed again by the parliamentary powers that be, because we have this same discussion every time about whether some item, such as a summit that some people are holding somewhere or other, should or should not be added to the agenda.
I would very much welcome a question of this nature being placed on one of the agendas of the House.
Mr Bosch, all of you, all Members of this House, are the 'powers that be'.
As you will have seen, those who sometimes regard themselves as such are subsequently outvoted here in plenary.
That is just the way of our democracy.
Thank you for your comments.
Thursday:
Regarding the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, the EPP-ED Group has moved that the item entitled 'Uzbekistan' be replaced by an item entitled 'Pakistan'.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I will speak on behalf of my Group.
As you will realise, a few days ago there was the most monumental suicide bomb attack against the party with the returning Ms Benazir Bhutto, with over a hundred civilians killed.
There has been the recent deportation by the Government of Pakistan of another returning civilian politician, Nawaz Sharif.
All sorts of things have been happening in that very key strategic South Asian country which need to be urgently debated by this Parliament.
I am not aware of any recent changes in the situation in Uzbekistan, other than the fact that the Council is deliberating on whether or not to remove the travel bans on Uzbek leaders.
That pales into insignificance compared to what is going on in Pakistan, so I would urge this House to support the need to debate the Pakistani situation on Thursday.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is always so difficult to decide between the pros and cons.
We were in favour of this motion, and we could subscribe to it if we had an undertaking from the EPP-ED Group and other groups that Uzbekistan really would be put on the agenda and discussed at the next opportunity.
In other words, changing the agenda should not mean losing sight of Uzbekistan and the developments that are taking place there.
Given such an undertaking, we could support the motion.
That is surely a splendid compromise.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, there can be no doubt that Pakistan is a very important issue.
It is too important, however, to deal with it as an item in Thursday afternoon's debate on breaches of human rights.
Discussing Pakistan is clearly not just a matter of examining human-rights violations but a real opportunity to debate aspects of EU foreign policy in that entire region.
I believe we would do better to put Pakistan on our next agenda as a proper debate with the Council and the Commission, because that, in my view, is what we need most.
The subject of Uzbekistan is of more immediate concern, because the Council intends to lift certain sanctions today.
In the present situation, I believe we should adopt the position that what is happening in Uzbekistan is a human-rights issue which dictates that sanctions should not be lifted.
That can be quickly decided on Thursday afternoon.
Pakistan is a very difficult and crucial foreign-policy issue and should be placed on our next agenda.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(The order of business was thus adopted.)
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
(BG) Bulgaria's Abandoned Children, the documentary screened on BBC 4, describing the conditions in and attitudes to the inmates of the social care home for physically and mentally disabled children in the village of Mogilino, has evoked tempestuous response in the Bulgarian and international community.
This makes me tell what steps have been undertaken.
First of all, we sent inquiries to the Minister of Labour and Social Policy and to the Chairperson of the State Agency for Child Protection.
We demanded that the home be closed down and the de-institutionalisation process be accelerated.
The Ministry sent an answer to our inquiry.
Secondly, we appealed to international non-governmental organisations providing social services to disabled people.
Among them is Betel, the largest charity organisation in Europe with 150-year-long experience in providing care to mentally disabled people.
Its experts responded to my request to visit the home in Mogilino together and seek specific solutions to the problems.
The government is primarily responsible for the provision of the necessary material and technical conditions at these homes amd for the support of the children.
What we need, however, is a changed concept of social services to children with severe mental disabilities and changed attitude to them on part of society and institutions.
The isolation of these children in hardly accessible villages and small towns is a practice long abandoned in Europe.
Problems will not be resolved by hiding the truth but by the concerted efforts of all of us.
(ES) Mr President, this Parliament is internationally recognised as an institution of freedom and human rights which respects international law and the United Nations system.
In view of this, many of us would like to hear Parliament's own assessment, and that of its President, of the outcry produced by the public disclosure of conversations between Presidents Bush and Aznar in 2003 at Crawford Ranch shortly before the invasion of Iraq.
Aspects of that conversation are extremely serious because they demonstrate a total lack of respect for the United Nations, disdain for trans-Atlantic relations and disregard for international law.
We all had suspicions that something had occurred along these lines but never before has the evidence been so clear; so clear that it requires Parliament to take a stance if only to state that such a shameful thing must never occur again.
- (LT) The fact that reports by European politicians on global warming, energy saving and similar issues are received with indifference in most European countries is cause for concern.
Similarly, regions, provinces and other administrative units do not give these problems the consideration they are due.
Cases where energy is wasted and the consequences of global warming are neglected can easily be seen everywhere.
For example, almost every day on my way from Brussels to Luxembourg I see street lights stretching over tens of kilometres, but no-one, neither Wallonia nor Belgium or the provinces, admits responsibility.
On the other hand, very often, even within the European Parliament, our words do not match our deeds.
It is beyond my comprehension why, at every sitting at Strasbourg, each Member is handed around 200-300 pages of stenographs and protocols.
In my opinion, we should have this material only on the Internet and put a stop to printing it out.
(PL) Mr President, on 10 October two activists from the Polish Association in Belarus, Angelika Borys and Igor Bancer, were arrested again in Grodno.
They were charged under the pretext of hooliganism and Bancer was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment, whilst Borys was fined the equivalent of about fifteen times the average monthly salary in Belarus.
It is well known, however, that the real reason for their arrest was the planned demonstration by the opposition against the authoritarian regime of Alexander Lukashenko.
The Belarus authorities have again demonstrated that organisational independence and freedom will not be tolerated in that country.
Fear, arrests under any pretext, and maligning western countries are the methods that Lukashenko has used for a long time to maintain his tyrannous rule.
Mr President, we cannot allow such widespread breaches of the human rights of personal dignity and freedom to take place right next to the European Union.
Europe cannot be democratic if Belarus is not a free country.
Let us increase our spending to help Belarus society to escape from the tyranny of dictatorship.
Let us demand that the rights of ethnic minorities be respected, that arrests without just cause be stopped and that political prisoners be freed.
This is the only way to change the one tyranny and dictatorship in Europe.
(SV) Thank you Mr President.
I would like to speak about the Turkish Parliament's decision to authorise the Turkish military to go into the only relatively calm region in Iraq.
It now looks as though we will be able to include these events in our discussion on the general report on Wednesday.
I hope that everyone will have the opportunity to be involved in the process and to table amendments, as this is a big threat to peace in the region.
It highlights the problem of the military exerting pressure and pushing through decisions.
We must now ensure that the government resists, that there are no troops and that no one is provoked into going into Iraq with military forces.
If there is anything they have too much of, it is the military.
If there is anything they have too little of, it is normal discussion between people and that is what we must support.
Thank you.
(ES) Mr President, it is almost as if the European Union were subject to a news and activity blackout with regard to the systematic violations of human rights perpetrated by the Kingdom of Morocco in relation to the occupied territories of the Western Sahara.
They have us well trained.
None the less, Parliament deserves an explanation from the Kingdom of Morocco concerning the delegation, which was not able to visit those occupied territories.
Two further pieces of information should be added to those already given: first, Morocco refused to allow the Human Rights Association - the association is called 'CODESA' - to hold its Congress in the occupied territories and, secondly, the United Nations has still not published the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights who was visiting the occupied territories to compile a full report on the situation there.
That report has not been published to date.
I urge the European institutions - this Parliament, the European Commission and the Council, to bring this situation to an end.
Mr President, Gordon Brown said today that there will be no need for another EU Treaty for at least 10 years.
He knows full well that there will never be a need for another Treaty.
The proposed Reform Treaty is a self-amending Treaty.
What little will be left of sovereign power can be transferred to the EU by decisions of the European Council without recourse to Parliament, let alone the people.
The Reform Treaty formally states the legitimacy and supremacy of EU law over national law.
If the British Houses of Parliament accept and practise the provisions of the Reform Treaty as superior and at the expense of existing English and Scottish law, then it is an act of treason under the existing treason laws.
Any member of the House of Commons or House of Lords that votes for ratification of the Reform Treaty is therefore, literally, a traitor to their country.
(Laughter)
Go and look at the treason laws if you do not believe me!
We should exercise caution in the use of such terms, Mr Batten.
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year before the start of the Beijing Olympic Games, worrying messages are being daily given out to the public at large.
This time it is not a case of human rights or environmental pollution, but the decision by the Organising Committee and the authorities of the People's Republic of China to ban any type or form of religious worship by participants in the Olympic Games.
In contravention of the agreements adhered to since the beginning of the Olympic Games and signed by the Chinese authorities and the International Olympic Committee, and religious symbols such as the Bible, the New and the Old Testaments, places of prayer and even the crucifix on a chain round the neck of a male or female athlete will be banned.
As a Christian I am deeply saddened.
I hope that the international community and the EU will duly prevent the Organising Authority of the 2008 Olympic Games from implementing these unprecedented measures.
(Applause)
(FR) Mr President, colleagues, on 3 October the Michelin group announced that it is to cease tyre production at its Toul plant.
More than 800 jobs are likely go by 2009, although neither the company's industrial performance nor its financial results indicate any crisis behind these redundancies.
Shareholders are selling off equity at a profit, on the back of the restructuring announcement, while ordinary men and women come to terms with the fact that they alone will bear the brunt of the situation.
I should like to put on record before the House how much I respect the trade union representatives and workers who, despite the deeply gloomy prospect they face, have shown a tremendous sense of responsibility from the outset.
The issue now is not about finding a humane way of closing a factory; it is about finding ways of retaining jobs in areas such as this, which can be extremely hard hit.
The workforce in Toul expects the EU to create systems of protection and organisation that will be capable of securing workers' social rights, helping people to get back into employment, and putting compensation funds to good use in relaunching industrial projects.
What they need is the flexisecurity that we, as European Socialists, have been urging; but it is also essential to encourage adaptation to industrial competitiveness and explore ways of promoting an integrated industrial policy for the benefit of all the areas in Europe currently affected by restructuring.
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the deteriorating situation on the border between Iraq and Turkey.
On Sunday morning, 12 Turkish soldiers and 32 Kurds were killed in a Kurdish ambush.
As we already know, the Turkish Parliament has approved the invasion of Kurdish-populated areas in northern Iraq.
At the same time, the Prime Minister of Turkey, Tayyip Erdogan, has said that his Government is ready to give orders to the army to attack the bases of the Kurdistan Workers Party in northern Iraq.
Hence, there is a strong probability of an escalation into a serious military conflict in northern Iraq.
Since Turkey is officially an EU candidate country, is it not time for us to act to try to stop a military conflict between Kurdish fighters and the invading Turkish troops?
Otherwise the situation might really destabilise in this fragile region and bring about frightening and unforeseeable consequences.
(PL) Mr President, last week the European Parliament welcomed to a group of people with multiple sclerosis.
There was an exhibition, concert and conference dedicated to the issue of people who suffer this terrible condition.
They were looking for assistance with their difficulties from Parliament, but, in Brussels, they were met with extreme discrimination.
The chairperson of the association, who has severe impairment of sight and hearing, and who is in a wheelchair, has a guide dog to help her.
The airline Wizzair refused to allow the dog on board, even though their regulations state that it is possible to transport guide dogs belonging to blind or deaf persons, and the online purchase of the ticket also included the dog.
It was only after an hour of discussions that it was finally decided to treat the situation as exceptional and the passenger and the dog were taken on board.
This situation undoubtedly had a negative impact on her health.
(BG) My country Bulgaria is on the eve of the first local elections to be held after the accession to the European Union.
Therefore they are different and charged with lots of expectations derived from the new European realities.
Capable and active people should be elected to local authorities to work skilfully with EU funds.
Bulgaria stands a good chance to absorb almost seven billion Euro over the period 2007 - 2013 as a full EU member.
However, it is much more important for these resources to reach the people who need them most rather than to sink into the coffers of companies or political parties.
Since Europe is Europe of the regions and decentralisation is an irreversible process, the role of the people involved in local government is growing.
Bulgaria has repeatedly and justifiably been criticized for its insufficient administrative capacity and for the shortcomings in the work of institutions.
Having received the trust and confidence of our European partners and having become part and parcel of the big European family, we should make the next important step, too, i.e. to elect mayors and municipal councillors capable of working not only at the regional and national level but at the European level, as well.
As a representative of Bulgaria in the European Parliament, I find it very important for highly qualified and competent people to be elected to local authorities.
Entering the common European home, we have to make our personal efforts to gain our well deserved place rather than receive it as a gift.
(HU) Mr President, tomorrow Hungary celebrates the anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and fight for freedom.
The past few years, and the debates that have taken place on the nature of Hitlerism and Stalinism and the damage they caused, including debates in this House, have demonstrated that Europe's more fortunate western half experienced history very differently from the ten newly acceded central European Member States.
Likewise, 9 May has a different meaning for us.
For us it was not just the date of liberation, but also the start of occupation.
Three central European events, acts of opposition to the Soviet Union and Soviet-style Communist dictatorships - the Hungarian Revolution of '56, the Prague Spring of '68, and the Polish Solidarity (SolidarnoÅÄ) movement - have nevertheless become part of our common European history.
The uniqueness of 1956 lies in the fact that no other uprising involved a people taking up arms against the world's largest army, the Soviet army, and no other case involved a country declaring its neutrality.
All the goals for which the heroes of 1956 were fighting - democracy, the rule of law, and liberty - were realised with the regime change.
If we Hungarians can be proud of anything in the 20th century, we should be proud of the 1956 Revolution and the role we played in Germany's reunification.
Thank you for your attention.
(RO) The use of cyanides is one of the current gold and silver mining methods.
I would like to emphasize that the effects of such a mining process may lead to the irreversible destruction of ecosystems and seriously harm the human body, since cyanide is one of the substances that pass unchanged into underground waters, the main existent source of drinkable water.
In the context of global warming, cyanide has the role of changing the temperature and precipitations pattern, generating floods and landslides.
The accident that happened in Romania, in Baia Mare, in the year 2000, when, following the crack of a tailing pond, approximately 100,000 m3 of water contaminated with cyanide and heavy metals was spilled, caused the biggest catastrophe in Eastern Europe since Chernobyl.
This triggered a mining law reform in Romania by introducing an amendment to the Parliament, which prohibited the use of cyanide in mining.
Mr. President, I express my wish to see Romania's example followed by the other European Union countries, as well, so that the prohibition of cyanide shall become an European rule eventually.
Mr President, on Thursday this week, this House will vote on the 2008 budget.
Bearing in mind that the Court of Auditors is due to report back next month, I want to draw your attention to the Interinstitutional Agreement signed between the three Institutions in 2006.
Under Article 44 of that agreement, all Member States are obliged to give certification for financial transactions involving EU monies.
I am advised that under the current programme the Commission will not receive relevant information from the Member States until 15 February 2008.
Only at that point can the common standards in accountancy and internal controls be identified.
This means that it is unlikely the Court of Auditors will receive the required information for a further two years.
That is not acceptable. Not only does it contravene the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement, but the ongoing failure to achieve a satisfactory audit report seriously undermines the credibility of this House.
I urge you, Mr President, to take every opportunity to insist that Member States attach far greater urgency to this matter in the future.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United Nations has set 10 December next as the deadline for determining the future status of Kosovo.
However, with the Kosovan authorities threatening to declare independence unilaterally, Serbia arguing for a system of broad autonomy and Russia vetoing the UN special envoy's proposal for supervised independence, the situation is critical.
My concern is to highlight the key role that the European Union will have to play in resolving the crisis.
It is our collective wish that the Union should have a High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
But what credibility can that appointment carry if we are incapable of playing our part in finding a specific solution to the Kosovo situation, which is still officially classed under foreign affairs although it is in fact a matter of internal concern to the Union?
The EU therefore needs to demonstrate a sense of direction and a clear vision that reflects compromise between the Serbian and Kosovan demands, while taking care not to open the Pandora's Box of partition; and it needs to speak out on the future of Kosovo and make its voice heard in the concert of nations.
(HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President.
The European Parliament delegation to Chile met not only with Chilean MPs, but also with environmental organisations earlier this month in Santiago.
In their view, the behaviour of European Union companies locating in Chile is very far removed from the environmental principles they espouse in Europe.
The legal and ethical positions on this are clear, but unfortunately the two are diametrically opposed.
What these companies are doing may be legally above-board, but ethically it is damaging.
A lack of environmental legislation often entices European capital abroad.
Relocation of this kind is detrimental to our interests in many ways.
We must therefore push for environmental rigour not only within the European Union, but also outside it.
The European Union must be the initiator, because a failure to take responsibility towards the next generation on the global scale is now inflicting material and non-material damage on Europe's citizens.
(SK) Allow me to praise the fifth edition of the European Week of Regions and Cities that took place in Brussels from 8 to 11 October 2007.
This event provided a unique platform for regions and cities of the entire European Union.
They exchanged practical experience and gained knowledge about innovative initiatives in the field of regional development.
We, the Members of the European Parliament, also had the opportunity to meet regional politicians in the course of interesting events.
I would like to thank the Committee of the Regions, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy and the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development for organising this event.
I want to thank our President, Mr Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, for his speech that conferred dignity on this event.
Only dynamic European regions with a strong human potential, with brave and enthusiastic regional politicians and well-prepared projects focusing on innovation and the creation of new jobs and cooperating in regional groupings, will be able to cope with the challenges of a globalised world.
(ET) Friday will see the opening of the second European Union-Russia summit this year.
We do not meet any other country so frequently, yet problems persist.
Friday's summit is not Mr Putin's farewell visit: he will still be holding Russia's reins in the future.
Instead of singing his praises we should be debating how to bring substance to the strategic partnership between Russia and the European Union.
For Europe's security it would be very important to launch the cooperation on crisis management agreed at the meeting of November 2003, especially in respect of frozen conflicts.
In Portugal Russia should be asked to treat Transnistrian separatists declared personae non gratae by the European Union as a genuine partner would, by prohibiting the Transnistrian elite from travelling across Russia's borders.
Currently a gang which is sowing instability among Europe's neighbours can travel freely through Russian airports.
This step would not be difficult for Russia, and at the same time would be a sign that Russia will listen to Europe and that we are genuinely partners.
Mr President, following the unifying outcome of the Lisbon Summit last week, it is sad to be reminded that Nicosia is still a Berlin-like divided city in Europe.
Since 1963, a so-called Green Line has divided the city and its people into a Greek Cypriot and a Turkish Cypriot sector.
This line is closely guarded by Turkish troops on one side and Republic of Cyprus troops on the other.
The division is most absurd at Ledra Street, a busy shopping road in the centre of Nicosia, which is cut in half by a glass wall running across it, separating Greek Cypriots from Turkish Cypriots.
Mr President, I beg of you to make an urgent personal plea to the governments of Turkey and Cyprus to take the historic step, without any complicated preconditions and seemingly cheap political excuses, of opening Ledra Street and allowing Greek and Turkish Cypriots to move freely across their capital city.
Let the opening of Ledra Street in Nicosia become another symbol of peace and unity for the people of Europe and the catalyst for the solution of the Cyprus problem.
(EL) Mr President, the EU's internet site is today publishing the news that OLAF, in collaboration with the Austrian authorities, has broken up a cycle of illegal Chinese clothing and footwear imports.
Damage to the Community budget amounts to EUR 200 million.
In view of this breaking story, which is not an isolated event but happening all over Europe, I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to petition the Commission.
Customs checks need to be increased and import restrictions extended beyond the current year.
Commercial protection measures for footwear imports need to be made more effective.
(DE) Mr President, I am very pleased that Commissioner Stavros Dimas is here.
On this occasion I would like to offer a word of praise for the action taken by the Commission last week on the illegal spring hunting of wild birds in Malta.
We have devoted a great deal of attention to this matter, not only in the Chamber but in our Committee on Petitions too.
Serving a final warning to the Maltese authorities is, I believe, an important step.
I hope that we shall see the fruits of this valuable and judicious political measure next spring and that European laws will be put into practice in the form of an enforced ban on illegal spring hunting.
(PL) Mr President, last year 25 countries in the European Union signed a joint stabilisation and association agreement between Albania and the European Union.
Today, 16 months after that agreement was signed, only 10 countries have ratified the document.
It is telling that, of this ten, six are new EU Member States: Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania and Latvia, and there are four countries from the old EU: Spain, Ireland, Sweden and Luxembourg.
I would therefore like to call on the 17 remaining EU countries to ratify this agreement as soon as possible, unless we want the concept of European solidarity to be seen as empty platitudes or slogans.
(SK) Italian authorities have informed the Member States of the European Union, through the European Early Warning and Response System, about an outbreak of tropical fever spread by the chikungunya virus in the Emilia-Romagna region.
They have reported 197 cases of the tropical virus.
Laboratory tests have confirmed that 14% of the total number of ill people have contracted the virus and it has claimed one victim.
Although there is no reason to panic yet, the European Commission must once more take steps to prepare for the possibility of a large epidemic.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, monitoring communicable diseases, notes that favourable climatic conditions allow the virus to spread, in particular in the Mediterranean region.
The risk of the virus being transmitted to other European countries is also high.
Infected people can initiate new transmission cycles in other regions of the Union.
(EL) Mr President, last week Arat Dink, son of Hrant Dink, the murdered Turkish journalist , was found guilty by a Turkish court because of a series of articles he had written on the Armenian genocide.
Mr Dink, the editor of 'Agos' newspaper, was found guilty according to Article 301 of Turkish Penal Code.
This was the article which had been used to condemn his father.
Hrant Dink has been given a one-year suspended prison sentence.
It is therefore justifiable to ask ourselves what the European Commission is doing to urge Turkey to remove this article from its penal code.
Further, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of Turkey's continuing intransigence, how much more time do we believe Turkey needs before it finally understands that it has European commitments and should therefore behave like a democratic state?
Mr President, there is disturbing news from Slovakia.
The Director of the Danube Museum in KomÃ¡rno, Csaba FehÃ©r, has been threatened with dismissal.
Among the charges is that he was co-organiser of an exhibition in the European Parliament last year.
That exhibition documented the sufferings of the Hungarian minority under the Czechoslovak Government after 1945 on the basis of collective guilt.
The concept of collective guilt is wholly irreconcilable with the civic norms and human rights that are at the heart of the European Union's democratic underpinnings.
Slovakia, as a Member State of the European Union, has accepted those principles in full.
So, what the Slovak authorities are doing not only flies in the face of human rights normativity, but implicitly criticises the European Parliament.
Slovakia must resolve these contradictions as rapidly as possible.
(RO) Statistics show that the European Union population is aging.
Only 35% of the European Union citizens are over 50 years old and only 16% of the European Union population is under 14 years old.
The European Union's demographic policy is a policy that Europe's future depends on.
The demographic policy should refer to accessible health services and decent pensions for pensioners, measures to increase the birth-rate in all Member States, as well as to decent, stable and well paid jobs.
For this reason, I ask the European Commission to develop, together with the Member States, a Community policy and national strategies as regards the demographic policy.
The result of such measures will be seen in the next 20-30 years.
Social Europe needs all its citizens and, especially, it needs each citizen to be integrated into society and have a decent living.
This is why we have to correlate the population protection and development policies with the demographic policies.
(SK) The Hungarian Guard was once again one of the main topics in Slovakia and Hungary this weekend.
All people of good will strive for peace and conciliation between all nations.
The present governments in Hungary and the Slovak Republic being what they are, there is the need for a strong Christian-Democratic opposition in the interest of democracy.
However, we will not win if we succumb to sentiments and emotions.
I am asking the Hungarian Government to respect the Treaty of Peace signed with Hungary in Paris on 10 February 1947.
In this Treaty Hungary pledged never to suffer in the future on its territory the existence and activities of fascist-like political, military and semi-military organisations, spinning revisionist propaganda.
I can see nothing better that could be done in the name of peace and mutual understanding between our nations.
Mr President, I would like to comment on a letter that was printed in an Irish national newspaper last week and was signed by, among others, several Members of this Parliament.
The context is that Ireland will probably be the only country to have a referendum on what will now surely be called the 'Treaty of Lisbon'.
In this letter three demands were made. One of the demands is that the Treaty must be submitted to the citizens in a referendum in each Member State.
The second demand goes so far as to demand that the EU national parliaments make appropriate legal and constitutional provisions to allow for referenda.
I have to say that I find these demands astonishing.
What about the principle of subsidiarity, where decisions are taken at the most appropriate level, in this case, at the level of the Member States?
I suspect that, in some convoluted way, those who want less interference from Europe are in fact themselves promoting the ultimate interference in the business of Member States by demanding that national parliaments change their constitutions and legal provisions to suit the wishes of the letter-writers.
That would surely be a democratic deficit!
(EL) Mr President, every year 650 000 people die from smoking-related causes in the EU.
It is like a small-scale war.
Of these, 80 000 deaths are due to passive smoking.
Smoke has been found to contain 4 000 substances, of which 50 are carcinogens.
Decades ago the medical community documented the adverse and possibly fatal consequences of smoking.
It is our duty to try and reduce smoking and especially to prevent young people from starting.
If we are to succeed, strong legislation is needed.
Smoking in public places must be banned.
Industrial additives in tobacco have to be monitored, researched and restricted.
We need monitoring and rigour at sales points.
We owe this to the 70% of EU citizens who do not smoke and to the overwhelming majority of smokers who want to give up.
Mr President, along with many Members of this House - perhaps most Members, in fact, given our resolutions - I am dismayed that the European Union intends to allow the Zimbabwean tyrant, Mugabe, to be invited to the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December.
Commissioner Michel tells me that the reasons for this - and I would suggest rather perversely - are that we should try not to isolate Mugabe, as this just reinforces his image, and that the EU wants to be seen as a global strategic player.
To invite Mugabe to Lisbon is an affront to our principles and is a direct contradiction of the EU's own stated positions.
It is a failure of our Africa diplomacy that any African government still has any regard for Mugabe.
Mr President, I know you share our concerns about the appalling situation in Zimbabwe.
Can I ask you to do two things: first of all, to convey yet again the strong feelings of this House that Mugabe should not be invited to Lisbon in December, and secondly, to respect the wishes of this House and not attend any EU summit to which Mugabe or any other banned Zimbabwean politicians are invited?
(PL) Mr President, during today's discussions in the European Parliament we shall be considering the report by Richard Corbett on the amendment of Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament concerning verbatim reports.
In my view, the committee is not going in the direction that it should.
I feel I can say this because of Article 96, which states that 'Parliament shall ensure the utmost transparency of its activities', thus any attempts to restrict the provision of information to European Union States, as well as access to it, undermines this fundamental right and is contrary to the idea of the Union, to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, to existing agreements and breaches fundamental human rights in the European Union.
Surely we are not constructing a European Union in order to have discrimination against smaller nations with less resilient cultures, or, if we are, this should have been stated prior to accession.
It is no argument, either, to talk about costs, about financial resources.
We spend so much on unnecessary facilities and on administration that we should be able to afford at least to communicate with society.
(PT) Mr President, the largest demonstration in Lisbon in the last 20 years took place on 18 October last, when more than 200 000 people called out by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers condemned the European Union's neoliberal policies, said 'no' to flexicurity, protested against unemployment, social exclusion and the poverty in which over 20% of the Portuguese people live, and demanded a social Europe.
European leaders cannot ignore this important demonstration.
We therefore salute the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers and its members and express our commitment to the struggle to protect the dignity of working people.
Mr President, Howard Stern - sorry, the Stern weekly showed the 'private parts' of the German society by publishing in its latest issue that every fourth German still believes that National Socialism had good sides.
Well, if this is true, it may mean that either every fourth German in this hemicycle finds good sides of National Socialism - which would be scandalous in itself - or this German delegation to the European Parliament is not the voice of its whole nation.
Recently, Germany was allocated 96 seats.
Having taken into consideration the statistics in Stern, it would be wiser, perhaps, to allocate only three seats to that country so that there would be no chance for the fourth one!
However, I agree with Mr Schulz with regard to one thing: in a united Europe, there is no place for the doctrine of nationalism in any dimensions.
However, Mr Schulz should take a closer look at the backyard of German hooliganism.
As for me, being from Poland, I wish all German Members would speak against nationalism as much as Mr Schulz.
(PL) Mr President, within the psychological framework, feelings such as responsible love for another person, family or one's country - which is given the name of patriotism - are evidence, together with other higher emotions, of a high level of personal development.
In contrast with primitive emotions that we share with animals, higher emotions even have a separate area in the brain.
Patriotism expresses itself as love for and a desire to nurture national traditions, culture and language, attitudes of respect and devotion to one's own country.
These are completely opposed to nationalism and chauvinism, which are characterised by hatred of other people.
Patriotism does not permit offence to nations or countries.
It is characterised primarily by openness to other countries and respect for their right to sovereignty and independence.
I would like to remind you of the nature of patriotism, particularly after the speeches made by certain left-wing MEPs who have insulted national governments and patriotic attitudes, perhaps because they do not understand the difference between love for one's country and the hatred that characterises such attitudes as chauvinism.
In a situation of European integration it is particularly important to differentiate between these completely different concepts that are confused by many people.
Mr President, addressing concerns about energy supply is one of the major and most important issues facing the European Union, linked as it is with concerns about climate change.
Security of supply and rising cost, with prices up 100% in the last five years, are major worries.
Well, for Ireland the challenges are particularly great.
We face growing demand for energy and yet a high dependency on imported fossil fuels. We are 90% dependent.
We need to invest heavily in our infrastructure, work towards liberalising the market and reduce our carbon emissions.
Parliament is looking at an action plan on implementing energy policy for Europe.
Within Ireland we are establishing an all-Ireland energy market with the merging of electricity markets north and south.
That is positive, but it is not enough. The scale of the market is too small.
To achieve a harmonised energy market, inter-connection with the rest of the European Union is vital for Ireland - but that will cost money, and I would urge the Irish Government to look at the use of cohesion funding to make that investment, because it is necessary for the continuation of Irish economic growth.
That concludes the item.
Framework directive on the sustainable use of pesticides - Thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides - The placing of plant protection products on the market (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Christa KlaÃ, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides - C6-0246/2006 -,
the report by Irena BelohorskÃ¡, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, and
the report by Hiltrud Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market - C6-0245/2006 -.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, first let me thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteurs, Mrs BelohorskÃ¡ and Mrs KlaÃ, for their exceptionally thorough work.
Thanks are also due to the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee, to Mr Ebner and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and to Mrs Corbey and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for the reports and view they expressed at first reading.
Over the last thirty years the EU's policies and laws on the protection of public health and the environment have enabled us to make significant progress, considerably reducing the risks of pesticides.
Current legislation, however, focuses on the one hand on approving and placing products on the market, and on the other hand on monitoring product residues in food and animal feed.
Between these two points of focus no law covers the period when pesticides are used.
This, however, is the crucial stage; during it human health and the environment are at risk.
The monitoring programmes implemented in Member States have exposed traces of pesticides not only in food and animal feed but also in the environment itself, in concentrations exceeding the limits values set by European legislation.
Additionally, it has become clear that pesticides are an issue of serious concern to European citizens.
We ought therefore try harder to increase the protection of European citizens and our environment.
The thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides and the framework directive accompanying it are covered under the general heading of tackling the human health and environmental due to pesticides.
The main elements of the Commission's proposal for a framework directive are as follows.
Firstly, each Member State will draw up national action plans establishing targets, measures and timetables to reduce risks and dependence on pesticides.
Secondly, professional pesticide users, who are mainly farmers, distributors and advisers, will need to have access to appropriate training.
This will teach them enough about the risks of pesticides and about using alternative means.
Public awareness-raising about the risks of using pesticides will also need to be increased.
Thirdly, professional equipment for pesticide spraying will have to undergo regular checks and be correctly maintained.
Fourthly, aerial spraying will be prohibited, but Member States will retain the option to make exceptions in limited cases where aerial spraying is the only feasible solution.
Fifthly, special measures will be taken to protect the general public and vulnerable sectors of the population, as well as water systems and geographical areas, such as those of the Natura 2000 network.
Such measures may include, among others, creating buffer zones, or prohibiting or restricting the use of pesticides.
Sixthly and finally, but just as importantly, we must support agricultural techniques which have recourse to low pesticide doses.
This is to enable the implementation of integrated pest control, which ought to become compulsory from 2014.
Other measures envisaged by the thematic strategy have been incorporated or will be incorporated shortly in other legislative acts.
These include a proposal to regulate the placing of plant protection products on the market.
The regulation will bring about an ever greater restriction of harmful active substances circulating in the market, particularly through comparative assessment and adherence to the principle of substitution.
This is my colleague Mr Kyprianou's proposal, which we are also discussing this evening on the basis of the report drafted by Mrs Breyer.
There is also a proposal to regulate the collection of statistical data on plant protection products.
This proposal is of crucial importance; it establishes indicators to measure progress on risk reduction.
The proposal is now being discussed by the relevant Parliamentary Committee.
There is also a proposed new directive laying down basic specifications for spraying equipment to be placed on the market.
The proposal will add to the existing provisions on the maintenance and regular inspection of spraying equipment.
In conclusion, Mr President, let me stress how important an aspect of the proposed directive on the sustainable use of pesticides integrated pest management is.
This is a fundamental measure of the Commission's proposal; it has been debated by the other parliamentary sub-committees.
Nobody doubts that we must reduce dependency on pesticides and turn to more environmentally friendly alternative means of protecting plants and controlling pests.
Integrated management and pest control are the most effective way to achieve this goal.
It is thus particularly important that this element should be maintained in our proposal and should become compulsory in all Member States from 2014.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, we shall be debating a really difficult but important issue today.
let me first of all thank all those who have worked to make this debate possible today, and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer.
The subject has always been difficult.
A balance needs to be struck.
Protection of health and the environment need to be increased, while procedures are simplified and administrative costs are reduced to allow for greater competitiveness and innovation.
I am convinced that the Commission's proposal will help achieve these two goals, for it supplements the internal market.
It does this by setting up a system of flexible mutual recognition of zones, and allowing Member States to take measures and to adopt restrictions, in cases of special health or environmental hazards, whether in throughout a Member State or in parts of it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that plant protection products play an important role in agriculture, crop growing, silviculture and market gardening.
I wish we did not need them, because they certainly affect human and animal health, and the environment.
We must therefore ensure that the relevant rules are effective and balanced.
The legislation in force dates from 1991.
On the basis of a 2001 report by the Commission on the legislation's function and where it can be improved, both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive.
I daresay nobody doubts the need for the existing legislation to be updated.
Allow me to thank the interested bodies in all sectors and mention the vital contribution they have made in the framework of this proposal's preliminary draft .
The Commission has also carried out a comprehensive impact assessment.
The first priority is indisputably to achieve the highest possible level of protection for human and animal health, as well as for the environment.
This will be achieved through a number of provisions: establishing clear, strict criteria for the approval of active substances; giving a central role to the European Food Safety Authority in the assessment of active substances; and obliging farmers to maintain files on the use of plant protection products, to be made available on request to their neighbours and the water industry.
The Member States' authorities will also have to intensify checks on the commercial exploitation and use of plant protection products, and the Commission will examine and verify how effectively Member States are carrying out these checks.
Further experiments on animals will be banned outright.
So as to promote sustainable agriculture, the safest alternative solutions will replace the most hazardous products.
The proposal will thus create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment.
The proposal does the same as the Lisbon Strategy because it will also reduce administrative costs.
The procedure will be shorter and more efficient, while, more importantly I believe, preserving levels of safety and protecting the health of the environment.
The Member States will no longer be working in isolation because mutually recognising approvals will now be the rule, rather the exception.
This will avoid dividing the internal market over plant protection products and stop splitting the market over agricultural products.
The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer competition without hindering research and innovation.
The proposed regulation is one of the keys to the Commission's overall strategy in the pesticides sector.
It complements the proposal for a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, which has already been analysed by my colleague, Mr Dimas.
Finally, let me to mention the large number of amendments which have been tabled.
This is hardly surprising for such a complex subject and perhaps we have not yet reached complete agreement in our views.
I am optimistic that we will shortly be able to do so the next stages of the procedure.
Meanwhile, the Commission can accept certain amendments while rejecting others.
The complete list, with the Commission's view on each amendment and the relevant explanation, is available to Parliament and MEPs.
It is not for me to analyse every amendment separately here because there is certainly not enough time.
I ask for this list to be included in the Minutes of the sitting.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to a constructive and interesting debate.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioners Dimas and Kyprianos, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commission's proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides, and my remarks here today will be confined to that part of the overall package.
This is a vast field, in which a great deal of adjustment is still needed throughout Europe for the sake of consumers and users and particularly for the sake of the environment.
Differing rules in the European Union not only create divergent safety standards but are also confusing and distort competition.
The possibility of pests destroying a whole year's harvests is, thankfully, a thing of the past in Europe.
Today, however, we face new major challenges, to which we must respond with a sound policy on plant protection.
The global population is growing, and food is becoming scarcer worldwide.
Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place: new pests are appearing, and natural disasters decimate harvests.
It is still essential today, therefore, to safeguard harvests, and the use of plant protection agents helps to do that.
With plant protection, as with many other things in life, it is the dose that makes the poison.
Whilst a sleeping tablet is a boon, many sleeping tablets can be fatal.
Care must be taken to ensure that plant protection products are used properly and professionally, because improper use is dangerous.
That is true not only on farmland but also in public spaces such as parks, playgrounds, sports fields, pathways and railway tracks.
Information, education and knowledge of the implications of pesticide use, of its benefits but also of its risks, are at the heart of this directive.
Sellers and users of plant protection agents must be trained and informed.
By means of national action plans, the Member States must ensure that plant protection products are used sustainably.
In so doing, they must strive for consistency with other Community provisions.
Well-tested and safe application machinery will ensure targeted plant protection, the aim being to minimise any risk.
An arbitrary percentage reduction across the entire range of plant protection agents runs counter to the aims of good agricultural practice and integrated pest management.
We need both these factors, Commissioner Dimas, and we shall continue to need good farming practice and integrated pest management, because we need dynamism.
The stringent regulation on authorisation, moreover, has been reduced to absurdity.
Products with harmful effects must not be authorised at all; it is not enough to cut their use by half.
If, however, plant protection agents have come through a stringent approval process, reducing their use by a certain percentage across the board would be illogical.
Moreover, no one has yet been able to explain to me precisely how such a reduction is supposed to be managed and quantified.
The same applies to protection of the aquatic environment.
The arbitrary establishment of standard buffer strips next to water bodies serves no purpose.
A differentiated approach remains necessary here.
Buffer strips must be right for the geographical situation, the soil properties and the plants that require protection.
This kind of approach has already been adopted in the instructions for use that come with the various plant protection products.
You mentioned crop spraying from the air, Commissioner.
For the steeply sloping vineyards along the banks beside the Moselle in my home area or indeed for the rice plantations in southern Europe, there is no alternative.
In those places crop spraying from the air is indispensable.
The use of crop spraying helicopters, however, must be regulated.
Particular care is needed in sensitive areas, such as parks and public or school playgrounds.
The use of pesticides there must be kept to an absolute minimum, and non-chemical alternatives should take precedence.
In my opinion, that could even mean sending out an entire school class to weed the school grounds.
Banning plant protection altogether in areas that are home to particular species of flora and fauna would be inconsistent with the aims of habitat conservation.
Pesticides are actually essential if these habitats are to be preserved.
Plant protection products are expensive, and no farmer will apply more than is absolutely necessary.
Additional taxes distort competition in the world market.
They would result in the purchase of cheaper products from outside the EU, which would ill serve the cause of sustainability.
We want the same protection and the same standard throughout the EU.
In many countries the proposed measures have typified good practice for some time.
For this reason, harmonisation of the rules governing the use of plant protection agents is imperative, which is why the Commission's approach is the right one.
It is up to all of us now - and we can take this as an invitation - to initiate a directive that keeps red tape to a minimum while matching our aspirations.
I ask for your support.
(FR) Mr President, I have asked for the floor because I am not quite sure what is going on.
I took part in the discussions on these various reports in the Committee on the Environment but it seemed to me that what Mrs KlaÃ has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously, but rather a reflection of her personal position.
I would therefore like to know whether we may hope for a more objective presentation of the Environment Committee's position on this very important report.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, may I say to Mrs Isler BÃ©guin that there was no unanimous vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, that we definitely took the opposite view and that most of my group opposed the position to which she refers.
I have certainly stressed that I support the Commission's proposal.
rapporteur. - (SK) The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, being a non-legislative political document that accompanies the directive, responds to the fact that the risks of pesticide use are not decreasing.
Today's residue levels in food products exceed acceptable values: 44% of fruit is contaminated with pesticides, 5.5% of which contains the maximum residue level.
