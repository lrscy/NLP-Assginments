With this oral question, which will also be followed up during this part session by a compromise resolution by the main political groups, we want to ask the Commission how much humanitarian aid there is and what it intends to do with it over the course of this year, and what schedule of commitments the Commission intends to promote for Darfur and for Sudan in general.
We should also like to know whether we can work in conjunction with the Organisation for African Unity to set up a no-fly zone in Darfur, which will be the only way to stop the violence to any serious and credible degree.
Even though there was no room for my next point in the compromise resolution, I also want to ask whether the Commission considers it worthwhile to try to raise Europeâs level of political involvement by appointing a special representative for Darfur and Sudan â as we did for the Great Lakes and for Kosovo.
Essentially, if the European Union is investing such great political and material resources to solve the problems in that area â it is the largest donor â it seems fair to ask whether it now intends to raise its presence politically.
Â Â  . The Commission is closely following the general situation in Sudan, particularly in Darfur.
In conjunction with the Member States, it has promoted intensive diplomatic activity in Sudan and international fora with a view to fostering tangible progress in the North-South peace negotiations that led to the signing of the overall peace agreement on 9 January, and to finding a solution to the Darfur crisis.
The Commission is determined to support the implementation of the January peace agreement and to back the reforms planned for the six-year transitional period.
In line with the international community, the European Union feels that these agreements offer an initial platform for tackling the various crises besetting Sudan, thereby providing a comprehensive and lasting solution to Sudanâs various crises, Darfur among them.
The Commission and the Member States therefore provided political and financial support for the negotiations that led to the ceasefire agreement of April 2004 between the Sudanese Government and the rebel movements.
The EU has also been the main contributor, especially in financial terms, to the two African Union operations to monitor the ceasefire in Darfur.
Though it recognises the benefits of the African Unionâs operations in Darfur and the need to reinforce its mission, the Commission sees the immediate priority as being to make the African Union mission fully operational.
At present it is operating at only 50% of its capacity.
That calls for increased cooperation between the African Union, the European Union and other organisations, in particular those of the United Nations.
The European Union has repeatedly shown its support for the African Unionâs efforts to find a political solution in Darfur and is attending the Abudja negotiations as an observer.
The presidency has sent a special envoy to monitor the negotiations closely.
The parties could also be offered technical support to facilitate the progress of the negotiations.
As for humanitarian aid, the European Union, through its Member States and the Commission, is one of Sudanâs biggest donors.
The European Union has earmarked more than EUR 370 million in humanitarian aid for 2005, more than EUR 120 million of it in the form of food aid.
The Commission has also earmarked EUR 60 million to support the African Union mission in Darfur.
Since the Darfur crisis figures among the international communityâs main concerns, the European Union has targeted a substantial share of its humanitarian aid into that region.
Since 1994, the Commission has granted Sudan approximately EUR 700 million in humanitarian aid.
Â Â  . Mr President, there has for decades been no shortage of hotspots in Sudan; the fact is that, outside Khartoum and Omdurman, the whole country has been systematically neglected by central government, and so it is hardly surprising that crises can break out all over the place.
Nevertheless, we are glad when things go in the right direction, and the conclusion of the peace treaty with the south in January is one example of this.
All the parties to it must implement it without delay, and the 10Â 000 UNMIS soldiers deployed by the UN Security Council will help them do this.
We thank those in Darfur who are helping the displaced persons, the injured and the victims of rape in their hour of need, and welcome the African Unionâs reinforced presence there.
Nor should we forget to mention the support we have given, enabling them to receive logistical help and other facilities from the European Union and individual Member States.
I am glad that the Security Council has brought the situation in Darfur to the attention of the International Criminal Court.
I see this as sending a clear message to everyone in Sudan, and also to those beyond its borders, that they cannot â contrary to what they evidently believe â go about doing the things that they are doing in Darfur without being punished for them.
The Commission has â as the Commissioner has just said â earmarked some EUR 400Â million in resources for Sudan, and I do hope that this will be paid out only when the peace treaty is implemented in the south and when there have been objective improvements in the situation in Darfur.
I have to say that I still regard the Sudanese Government as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.
For example, we heard yesterday that a human rights activist had been arrested shortly before he was due to travel to Dublin in order to receive a human rights prize.
I therefore call for him, and the other persons arrested with him, to be released without delay.
It is with this sort of contradictory behaviour on the part of the Sudanese Government in mind that I ask the Commission whether there are safeguards to ensure that none of the EURÂ 400Â million can under any circumstances be paid out as budget support and that the resources are not, in so far as possible, distributed through governmental structures or taking them as a basis; instead, the attempt should, if at all possible, make use of the aid organisations from abroad that are present in Darfur and elsewhere.
Â Â  Mr President, I also support the questions that my colleagues have asked the Commission, which are extremely important in terms of how we deal with the continuing crisis in Sudan, in the North-South negotiations as well as in Darfur.
As Mr Gahler said, Dr Mudawi, a brave defender of human rights in Sudan was once again arrested by the Sudanese Government, by its National Security and Intelligence Agency.
He was about to board a plane, ready to go to be presented with an award by the President of Ireland.
That is continuing evidence â as if we needed it â of the determination of the Sudanese Government to harass human rights defenders and arbitrarily arrest, without trial, people who have the audacity to speak out.
That evidence needs to be taken into account in the attitudes we take in terms of the EUR 4 billion of budgetary spending that has been allocated.
We need to be absolutely clear that we reject and are prepared to speak out about the attitude of the Sudanese Government to anyone who wishes to fight against oppression and for rights and freedoms.
The suffering and agony of the Sudanese people demands a renewed and much more determined international effort on their behalf.
What we are talking about in Sudan is the real tragedy of our time.
It is the failure of the international community to deal with ethnic cleansing, with mass rape and killings in that country.
I was looking only this morning at recent reports by NGOs about how banditry continues and how the difficulties of delivering humanitarian aid are exacerbated by this situation.
The IDPs in Sudan are reporting very clearly to NGOs â and British NGOs are reporting to me â that they are identifying Arab militias that are now being absorbed into the army of the Government of Sudan and trained as soldiers.
The NGOs have reported continuing attacks, again this week, on women collecting firewood.
Those women are now so desperate that they are selling part of their food rations in order to buy wood in the markets to try to avoid the attacks they experience as they leave the camps to get firewood.
We understand that ethnic cleansing has virtually now stopped. However, if you ask the African Union, they will tell you that it has largely stopped because ethnic cleansing is largely complete in Darfur.
Two million people are homeless, and they are still being terrorised by the Janjaweed militias.
It is estimated that 197 000 people are seeking refuge in the inhospitable deserts of Chad, which we visited last December.
Those people have lost everything but are still prepared, in desperation, to leave their country to go to Chad.
The desperation of those people in Sudan puts into perspective some of the debates that we have in our countries in Europe about asylum and immigration.
Peacekeeping remains the key issue.
The African Union is hopelessly stretched at this time and cannot fulfil its mandate unless we see much more concerted efforts to beef up the military support that they need in that country.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree wholeheartedly with the assessment and the proposals made by MrÂ Pistelli.
Much has been said about the tragedy, horror and suffering of the Sudanese people because of the war in Darfur.
The United Nations commission of inquiry was rigorous in detailing the crimes committed and the responsibility of the various actors in the conflict, who must be judged by the International Criminal Court.
Such crimes, and the criminals who perpetrated them, must not go unpunished.
I should like, however, to talk about the positive things that I saw during the visit by the European Parliament-ACP delegation in March.
Aniala Fatima, a displaced person, still frightened, who had been driven out of her ruined village, was waiting with thousands of other displaced people for her turn to tell the commission set up by the government what she had lost so she could receive compensation.
In Fashr, during the meeting with the heads of families and tribes who together were deciding on a reconciliation pact, there were the fathers of the controlling militia and the fathers of rebel sons who were saying: âThey are our sons; we have to make peace!â
In Juba, in the south ravaged by war, which is, however, experiencing hope because of that amazing, vital agreement, members of parliament and NGOs told us of the need to work fast, to clear the roads of landmines, to reunite divided families and to open the university under the watchful eye of UNMIS.
In Khartoum, the SPLM, which is no longer in hiding or is trying to develop a political movement and no longer a military one, has its offices open, and they told us that it was not a problem for them to be in Khartoum, and the African Union is also there, talking to both the rebels and the army and learning what to do to resolve the situation.
I cannot say any more because I only have two minutes, but I think it is essential that the role of our Parliament and of the European Union should be not to condemn, but to seek solutions to the conflict, poverty, injustice and lack of democracy that are still ravaging that country.
In that respect, the financial aid promised at the Oslo conference of donor countries is decisive, as is the aid from the European Union.
We need to work fast because peace needs to be nurtured and, in Darfur, in addition to the desertification and poverty, thousands and thousands of people are waiting to be able to return home in safety.
I therefore believe that we must act as I have suggested and work for peace.
Â Â  Mr President, the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed leaders, like Musa Hilal, seem singularly immune to Western criticism.
Having burned the people of the Darfur region of Sudan into graves and refugee camps, they have created a militarised zone â a terror zone â that separates Sudan, north and south.
In all our peace initiatives, we must be constantly aware that, for the perpetrators of terror, peace is a threat that they will resist with all their might because peace will mean eventual conviction in the war crimes courts.
Agreements are for the honourable; the Janjaweed are not honourable.
They will not cooperate.
People are suffering.
We cannot wait for a cooperation that will not come.
We will have to supervent Hilal and those like him.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, EURÂ 400Â million is a lot of money.
It will allow the EU to do a great deal to stabilise the situation in Sudan, but MrÂ Pistelli is right to ask how humanitarian aid for Sudan is actually being distributed.
The EU must not dole out money indiscriminately, without asking whether the authorities in Khartoum are ensuring that basic standards are met.
We are still waiting for a clear answer to the question of whether the rights of religious minorities in the country are observed.
The concern is that Christians are being persecuted, as they previously were in a number of other African countries.
This issue was raised by the European Union and by the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries during the Parliamentary Assembly.
Neither Sudan nor Africa said anything in reply, but I hope that the EU will not follow their example.
It would be a mistake for us to donate money without investigating the situation regarding human rights, and in particular that regarding the rights of religious minorities.
This issue should be and needs to be considered as part of the equation.
Present and future relations between the European Union and the African Union must be built on the basis of respect for human rights standards.
In my opinion, this is the main point to emerge from the current debate.
I share the reservations voiced earlier in this Chamber by MrsÂ Kinnock.
Â Â  Mr President, no sooner had Sudan emerged from 21 years of bloody civil war between the Islamist Government of Sudan and the Christian/Animist south, finally ended by the comprehensive peace agreement signed in Nairobi this January, than another appalling humanitarian situation emerged in Darfur in February 2003, whose importance internationally must be reinforced now that attention may be drifting away following the tsunami in South-East Asia.
A recent estimate by the British House of Commons Select Committee put the casualty figures as high as 300Â 000, with 10Â 000 people dying each month from disease, starvation and atrocities, and two million people homeless and displaced, destabilising neighbouring Chad.
Whether one calls it genocide or not, it still amounts to the most serious systematic violation of fundamental rights probably anywhere on the globe.
The African Union urgently needs to help stop the killing in Darfur, where whole villages have been bombed and torched, where mass executions and rape are common and where an Aids crisis is now looming.
Millions have fallen victim to a scorched earth struggle between Sudanese President Omar al-Bashirâs Arab-dominated regime, and its Janjaweed militias, and ethnic African secessionists in Darfur.
At last, the United Nations is acting, under Security Council Resolution 1593, with a referral of those accused of war crimes to the ICC.
China, a traditional ally of Sudan because it has oil investments there, and the United States, which opposes the ICC, have both acquiesced and abstained in the Security Council.
While the fighting has cooled off, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan this week appealed for an African force of 12Â 000 troops, up from the 7Â 500 expected by August and the 2Â 500 African Union troops who are already in the region.
Kofi Annan also wants non-African states to supply more troops, and Canada has been one of the first to agree.
Representatives from the two groups â the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement â declared on Monday their commitment to a ceasefire and to unconditionally resuming talks with the Sudanese Government.
I welcome the release of the EURÂ 450Â million of EU humanitarian aid, and do not accept the pleas of innocence and, to date, impunity of the brutal regime in Khartoum, which must be held to account for its brutal crimes.
Â Â  Mr President, the author of the oral questions, Mr Pistelli, has described the problems in Sudan very well: for a very long time, the problematic North versus South situation in Sudan led the international community to turn a blind eye to the problems in Darfur.
As has already been said, this House exists not only to analyse and criticise â very important though I believe these things are in this case â but also to supply answers and to help secure justice.
It is for this reason that I echo our motion for a resolution in saying that I welcome the UN Security Councilâs decision to mandate the International Criminal Court to examine the situation in Darfur.
The conflict in Darfur has made refugees of over a million men, women and children.
The UNHCR is working on the assumption that there are over 200Â 000 refugees from Darfur in Sudanâs neighbour, Chad.
While there are frequent reports of attacks on refugees, the UNHCR is also very concerned about those on internally displaced persons in Darfur, where women tell how they are raped when they go in search of firewood or water.
This makes it important that those traumatised by being displaced within their own country should be spared the further trauma of being forced to return to their homes.
Any movement on the part of persons displaced within their own country must be purely of their own free will.
That, too, is something for which we call in our motion for a resolution.
We also call on the Sudanese Government to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, ensuring that those charged with crimes against humanity are brought before it.
Only when these people stop getting off scot-free will there be a chance of stability and peace.
The culture of impunity must be brought to an end; that will do a great deal to help establish justice.
We have also been told that, following the signature of the peace treaty, the Commission and the Sudanese Government together hammered out a country strategy paper.
As the object of such country strategy papers is the promotion of peace, democracy and human rights, the recent arrest of the human rights activist Dr Mudawi is more than disturbing, and gives cause to question the willingness of the Sudanese Government to pursue these goals.
This House must send out a clear message by demanding that Dr Mudawi be released without delay.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the UN is the international organisation best placed to bring about a lasting solution to the conflicts in Darfur.
It is important for the EUâs actions to take place within the framework of UN cooperation and for the EUâs efforts to be made in cooperation with institutions that have extensive experience and legitimacy such as the WHO or the UN World Food Programme.
I welcome the UNâs efforts in the Sudan conflict, such as the recent creation of the 10Â 000-man strong UN mission, UMIS.
I am also well disposed towards the proposal to increase the African Unionâs presence in Darfur.
For my part, it has always been important that it should be the UN that, in the first place, acts in this conflict.
The UN should act in cooperation with the African Union.
Possible EU actions need to be focused upon humanitarian aid following consultation with the UN.
The UN plans to contribute aid totalling USDÂ 1.5 billion during 2005.
That is the single largest UN appeal of this year.
It is important that the EUâs aid efforts be coordinated with those of the UN and that they take place in consultation with the UN.
In that way, the worldâs total efforts in Sudan will achieve their maximum effect.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I made my first statement on the situation in Darfur on 14 September 2004, since when â as you said â there have been some crucial changes.
After 21 years of civil war and raging ethnic conflicts between north and south, a peace treaty has been signed between the government and the Sudan Peopleâs Liberation Army.
For this country â the largest in Africa â this is a great opportunity.
What is vital now is that millions of refugees should be helped to return to living conditions worthy of human beings, to provide themselves with the basic necessities of life, which means not just food and drinking water, demining and the return of land to its owners, but most of all ensuring their physical security.
Although the European Unionâs strategy, which involves supporting the Sudan to the tune of EUR 400Â million, is the right response, it is necessary, above all, that the release of these resources be made conditional upon the implementation of the peace treaty and, in particular, on the improvement of the situation in the south-western province of Darfur.
A number of things have been happening in this province since our debate last September.
The UN Security Council has handed over the grave violations of human rights in Darfur to the International Criminal Court.
The UNâs commission of inquiry into the war crimes in this province has unequivocally described them as no less serious in their cruelty than genocide.
The fly in the ointment, in terms of what is happening in Sudan, is that the situation in Darfur remains extremely precarious and is capable of dragging Sudan as a whole headlong into the abyss again.
It is alarming that the human rights activist Dr Mudawi has been arrested along with a colleague and his driver, and I can do no other than endorse the call for his immediate release.
A third element that is having a positive impact is the role played by the African Union, which has built up its forces to a significant degree, although the size of Darfur makes its 7Â 700Â men no more than a drop in the ocean.
Both the EU and Nato should, though, be cautious about committing themselves militarily to peacemaking operations.
The European strategy, which is founded upon the secure supply of food and education, repatriation and the building-up of administrative and governmental capacities, whilst also planning demobilisation, disarmament and the training of security forces, is surely the right way to stabilise the situation in the long term.
Â Â  . Mr President, on the specific question of Darfur, the Commission has repeatedly called on the two warring parties to put an immediate end to the violence and the suffering inflicted on the civil population and to the inexcusable acts committed in clear breach of international law and conventions.
We believe, however, that even if desirable in absolute terms, peace in Darfur alone would not be sustainable and that it should be part and parcel of a political solution for the entire country.
It should be stressed that nothing short of full compliance with the ceasefire agreement by all the warring parties will facilitate resumption of the political dialogue between the Sudanese Government and the rebels in Abuja.
It is important that these negotiations resume as soon as possible and that all the parties stop insisting on unrealistic preconditions that block the whole process.
The Commission also considers that the post-Naivasha political agenda is the right framework for reaching a lasting political solution for the whole region.
The Commission favours a balanced approach towards the Sudanese Government and the main political actors in Sudan.
This balanced approach consists of positive and negative measures, depending on the course of action taken by the government and the other main political actors.
Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the Commission has decided gradually to resume its development cooperation with a contribution of EUR 400Â million.
The Commission is also ready to support the parties seeking a peaceful solution for Darfur and other regions of Sudan through the political framework of the Naivasha process.
However, as the Commission stated at the recent Oslo Donorsâ Conference on Sudan, the speed at which it resumes its cooperation will depend largely on the degree of progress in effective CPA implementation and a real improvement in the situation in Darfur.
At the same time, the Commission supports the recent UN resolutions, including the threat of sanctions and the referral of cases of perpetrators of crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court as a necessary means of putting an end to impunity and to violence in Darfur.
An AU evaluation mission carried out from 10 to 22Â March, with the participation of the United Nations and the European Union, assessed the need for enhancing peace-support efforts in Darfur, including exploring ways of strengthening AMIS 2.
The missionâs findings acknowledged the positive role of AMIS in the areas where it has been deployed.
However, as I mentioned previously, it estimates that AMIS is currently operating at only about 50% of its operational capacity.
It is important to bring AMIS up to full operational capacity before deciding on its reinforcement.
The Commission is ready to contribute to meeting the challenges in Darfur, together with the AU and its partners.
The sustainable reinforcement of African capabilities could be fast-tracked if the lessons learned from this operation were applied to the security sector as well.
Â Â  Â I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (B6-0300/2005), the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (B6-0301/2005), the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (B6-302/2005), the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (B6-0303/2005), the Union for Europe of the Nations Group (B6-0304/2005) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (B6-305/2005).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the World Bank.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I can indeed confirm, in the context of this Council statement on the World Bank, that the World Bank plays a very significant role at global level in the field of development financing.
It is clear that the political and administrative management of the World Bank is thus an extremely important subject.
However, as a representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I am unfortunately not able to set out a position on behalf of the Council, or to report on the work carried out by the Council on this matter.
Indeed, the EU itself Â and I would say that this, too, is unfortunateÂ  has no part in the policy-making or operation of the World Bank.
It is therefore down to the Member States of the EU that are also members of the bodies of the World Bank to set out their position with regard to the Bank.
For this reason, the Council has not taken a position on the matters in question, because it has no authority to do so.
None of the bodies of the Council have discussed a strategy for the World Bank, or the coordination of a possible common European position in this regard, or the decision-making procedures within that institution.
I would also like to add that the Member States are working to coordinate their positions in order to have greater weight within the international institutions, including the international financial institutions such as the World Bank; this exercise does not, however, involve the Council as an institution since, as I said, the Community has no competence in this field.
It is also true that MrÂ Wolfowitz, who has been nominated for the post of President of the World Bank, came to Brussels, where he met the President of the Ecofin Council, MrÂ Juncker, and the representatives of the other European governors of the Bank.
At this purely informal meeting, the future strategy of the World Bank in relation to development financing was indeed discussed with the president nominated by the US Government, as is customary.
I can therefore only regret that the Council has no competence in this matter.
Maybe one day we should consider improving coordination between Member States of the EU within these international institutions where they actually represent, thanks to their collective weight, a greater number even than the United States.
Â Â  . Mr President, as Commissioner responsible for relations with international financial institutions, I am grateful for this opportunity to explain to Parliament the Commissionâs views on our institutionâs relations with the World Bank.
The World Bank and the European Union are the two main world players in the fight against poverty and in the funding of development aid.
This Parliament is well aware that the Union provides around half of the total public aid to the developing countries, and that, furthermore, in the majority of cases, the Union is their main trading partner, which reflects the emphasis placed on solidarity within our international policy.
The main objective of the Communityâs development policy is to reduce, and ultimately to eliminate, poverty.
This means supporting sustainable economic, social and environmental development, promoting the gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and combating inequality.
As the honourable Members are aware, the Union has made a firm commitment to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Objectives, by means of more and better funding of development aid, greater coherence amongst development policies and, in particular, greater attention to Africa.
In relation to each of these issues, on the proposal of my colleague Mr Michel, the Commission has recently proposed specific actions, which I believe Louis Michel has had the opportunity to debate in this Parliament.
I would like to comment briefly on the first two issues: levels of funding and the need to improve coherence amongst our development policies.
In relation to funding, at the Monterey Summit, the Union announced its commitment to increasing official development aid from the level we were at in 2002, 0.33% of GDP, to 0.39% in 2006, as a first step towards compliance with the objective of 0.7% in 2015.
Last month the Commission proposed two additional and interrelated objectives for 2010: an intermediate objective, for the whole of the Union, of 0.56% of GDP in development aid, and an individual objective in official development aid for each of the Member States, which would be a minimum of 0.51% for the Member States which belonged to the Union before enlargement and 0.17% in 2010 for the new Member States.
Nevertheless, however important it may be to make this effort, it is not enough.
Apart from aid, the policies of the developed countries have an enormous influence on the possibility of the developing countries achieving the Millennium Objectives and, in this regard, the Commission is stressing the importance of the coherence of development policies and for the first time is making commitments in this regard in these communications.
With regard to relations with the World Bank, I would like to refer to two issues: operational cooperation between the Commission and the Bank, and the European Union's representation in the governing of the World Bank.
Relations between the Commission and the World Bank are long-standing.
We share the same agenda in terms of reducing poverty and, of course, we share the same Millennium Objectives.
The World Bank is working to achieve these objectives, by means of its principal operational lines and by assessing the progress made towards achieving these objectives within the context of the Global Monitoring Report.
The Commission and the Bank cooperate closely in the provision of aid, by means of the Trust Fund Agreement, signed in 2001 and amended in 2003.
This cooperation led to the Union's participation in various trust funds, with a total contribution of more than EUR 1Â 500 million since 2000.
Other examples include the funds for combating AIDS and specific funds, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC).
Furthermore, both the Commission and the Bank increasingly work on the basis of national poverty reduction strategies defined by the developing countries themselves.
In addition to these global objectives, cooperation with the World Bank also focuses on certain priority geographical areas, with regard to which we carry out joint analyses, hold joint dialogues on policies and work to coordinate financial programming for the countries closest to the Unionâs borders.
We are not, therefore, just talking about coordinated action between the World Bank and the European institutions in countries that already belong to the Union, but also, of course, the candidate countries and the neighbourhood policy countries, such as the Western Balkans, North Africa and the Middle East, and countries belonging to the Community of Independent States.
With regard to these countries, the Unionâs cooperation, by means of the Commission and the World Bank, is aimed at ensuring that the policies applied are complementary and contribute to the incorporation of the , and places particular emphasis on institutional development, the environment and its infrastructures, economic reform and development of the private sector.
To this end, over the last five years, the Commission and, sometimes, the European Investment Bank have signed three memorandums of understanding with the World Bank.
These memorandums serve as a practical framework for enhanced cooperation in terms of economic dialogue and technical and financial assistance.
They cover the coordination of our activities in the fields covered by the Unionâs neighbourhood policy and over the coming months the memorandum of understanding is going to be extended to the new Member States and the candidate countries, with a view to including the Western Balkans.
I would like, finally, to comment on the Unionâs representation in the governing bodies of the World Bank.
184 States currently belong to the bank, including the 25 Member States of the European Union.
In the Bank, the percentage of votes for these Member States of the Union is 28%, whilst the United States have 16%.
Nevertheless, that 28% does not in practice reflect the Unionâs real weight.
The European Unionâs contribution to funding granted is even greater than that 28%.
In this regard, the example provided by the latest review of the International Development Association (IDA) is revealing.
On this occasion, there has been a spectacular change in the contributions of the donors, with the European share increasing from 48 to 60%, while that of the United States has dropped to 13.8%, the lowest in the history of the organisation.
Despite these figures demonstrating the Unionâs participation, both in the Bank's capital and in its funding, we are not taking full advantage of that weight as a result of the lack of unified Union representation in the Bank's governing bodies.
And thus, despite the fact that, numerically, the Member States of the Union dominate the Bankâs governing council, overall they have less influence than the United States.
The Commission currently participates solely as an observer in the meetings of the Bankâs Development Committee, the main decision-making body of that institution.
This situation is the same as the situation in the International Monetary and Financial Committee of the International Monetary Fund and is in clear contrast with the European Unionâs influence on development cooperation compared to its effective influence in the World Bank or in the life of the international monetary system, by means of our single currency, in the case of the International Monetary Fund.
The Commission has been insisting that, if the Union wishes to put an end to the disparity between its influence and its contributions and aspires to a greater presence on the international stage, it must speak with a single voice.
If it is able to present a single European position, the Union will increase its visibility and its influence.
In this regard, it should be noted that there has been a little progress in the Unionâs coordination with the Bankâs governing bodies.
For example, since last year, the executive directors in the World Bank from the European Union have been holding annual meetings with Members of this Parliament, with the Commission and with representatives of non-governmental organisations.
The Unionâs executive directors in the World Bank have agreed to meet on a weekly basis to exchange opinions and a Commission official from our delegation in Washington participates regularly in these meetings.
The Commission is working to improve the coordination of the European executive directors in Washington, but the ultimate objective must be unified representation of the Union within the governing bodies of the World Bank.
Before taking that decision, of course, it will be necessary carefully to examine its legal and budgetary implications, but this must not prevent us from seriously analysing how to make progress towards this objective.
In conclusion, our cooperation with the World Bank is long-standing and intense, particularly in terms of supporting the developing countries.
The Commission wishes to maintain and enhance these excellent working relations and to improve coordination, both with the World Bank at operational level and amongst the representatives of the Member States in the Bank's governing bodies.
In this way, the Union would be speaking with a single voice and would have the influence it deserves within the Bank.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank MrÂ Schmit and MrÂ Almunia for their contributions.
There is a lot that can be said about the World Bank, its governance and, in particular, how its managers are appointed.
The recent election of MrÂ Wolfowitz shows that qualifications for the specific task have played a smaller role than political merits.
It shows that the appointment of senior managers in the international system still leaves a lot to be desired.
I have little time, however, so I shall focus specifically on relations between the EU and the World Bank.
Both MrÂ Schmit and MrÂ Almunia indicate the current weakness that lies in our not acting in unison and not speaking with one voice.
In the case of Parliament, we recently had a meeting with the European directors of the World Bank, and they were completely united in calling emphatically for a higher degree of unified action from the EU on development issues, both across the board and specifically when it came to work in the World Bank.
About a month ago, we also had a meeting with Jeffrey Sachs in the Committee on Development, and he asked why, given that the flow of money by way of aid from the EU is hugely greater than that from the rest of the world, the EU does not take more concerted action.
In that way, he said, our work would be more effective and produce better results, and we would also have greater influence in every dimension of this important context.
The fact is that both MrÂ Schmit and MrÂ Almunia emphasised in their contributions that something is missing at present.
How are we to take more concerted and unified action in foreign policy if we continue to act in such a divided way in these international institutions?
It is also typical that, in the talks now being conducted on the future composition of the Security Council, we have no discussion at all about whether the EU, as a unified body, should have a place on the Security Council and about the fact that what still counts is, instead, the Member States acting on a national basis.
I can only emphasise, on the basis of where I stand, that we must bring about change at this level.
We need to cooperate in a more concerted manner and we must harmonise our efforts in a quite different way in order genuinely to obtain the results we want from action taken by the EU and to be able to accept greater responsibility in the global arena.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Schmit and MrÂ Almunia, may I thank those last two gentlemen for their contributions today concerning the World Bank.
I really feel that they focused upon what is fundamentally needed.
There is no doubt that, five years after we signed the Millennium Declaration in 2000 concerning the developing countriesâ basic needs up until 2015 â I was myself one of the signatories â we now have to note that matters have not moved in the right direction.
Instead, they have unfortunately moved in the wrong direction in most areas.
Nor is there any doubt that, over the last 15 years, 54 countries have become poorer and one billion people now live on less than two euros per day.
The World Bank does not operate as well as it could.
It has a series of important reforms under way, but we are still not tackling a number of problems.
I completely support MrÂ Almuniaâs emphasis on the fact that Europe can speak with one voice, and I would propose four tasks for consideration that I believe are urgent.
The first task proceeds from the real need we now have in Europe to find a way of taking concerted action in the World Bank.
If we do so, we shall have 27.98% of the votes, compared with the United States with 16.39%.
At present, the European country with the most substantial share of the votes after the United States is Germany, with 4.49%.
I am not talking about a new conflict of interests; I am talking about a far better balance in the World Bank and about our needing, as the second task, to ask for a reform of its lending rules and conditions and, indeed, to insist that this takes place.
We must ensure coordination between the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and UN aid to the developing countries.
In that way, our efforts will be along the same lines, rather than overlap.
The third task relates to the need we have for reform of the Washington consensus.
We need now really to stop making the same demands of poor countries as we make of rich ones and to help construct healthy and strong states in the developing countries which can then embrace the right to share the ownership of development policy.
Our fourth and final task, MrÂ President, is genuinely to take the ILOâs report on world poverty seriously, something that the World Bank too should do.
âDecent jobs for allâ is the crucial tool for eradicating poverty.
May I conclude by concurring with MrÂ Almunia and MrÂ Schmit in saying how important I believe it is for Europe now also to assume the genuine responsibility stemming from the fact that we are the worldâs largest organisation providing aid to developing countries.
We should share responsibility for ensuring that the World Bank too acts accordingly.
Â Â  . Mr President, when the World Bank was set up in 1944, the seven richest countries, the G7, produced the lionâs share of all goods in the world by far; nowadays, they produce barely half of them.
At the time of the World Bankâs formation, the United States was the biggest lender of money; today, it is the biggest debtor.
Sixty years ago, the developing countries were still incapable of standing up for themselves, today, their influence in multilateral negotiations, for example those in the context of the World Trade Organisation, can no longer be ignored.
All this indicates that the World Bank is in urgent need ofdrastic reforms.
As long as the developing countries have no real say in its policy and decision-making, the World Bank will continue to be perceived as a control instrument in the hands of the so-called rich, instead of an international institution that is geared towards stability and development, in a spirit of mutual respect and solid partnership.
The World Bank now has an external relations department, which employs more than 300 people, and which is described by the Bank itself as one of the most important departments for brushing up its image, but the question remains whether this cannot be done in a different way, namely by involving the developing countries in its operations more effectively, by finally making decision-making more transparent and by better monitoring spending.
In short, I am among those who believe that the World Bank is in urgent need of âresourcingâ â not financially, but internally.
Indeed, within this international organisation, which is considered one of the biggest and most authoritative, time appears to have stood still for more than 50 years in terms of structure, operation and mentality.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am most grateful to the members of the other groups who have given their support to our proposal to debate the issue of the World Bank, even though I was perfectly aware, like the majority of us, that the Council could not say anything very different from what Mr Schmit has declared this morning.
We must, however, be aware of the fact that an unsatisfactory situation can and must be changed, moreover because this seems to me to be a sector in which political will can assist us.
We do not have to resort to major articles of the Treaty in order to ensure that the Council and the Commission, together with Parliament â and that is absolutely crucial â can work to improve the question of European coordination, or at least to put it on the agenda.
European coordination should not, however, be confined solely to the perfectly worthwhile work of technical and financial cooperation, but it must also be focused on the policies of the World Bank â policies precisely on which we have no say at all â on appointment procedures and on the criteria for granting funding.
I believe that those are the three points on which the actions of the European Parliament should be better focused: we can do so if we want to.
I believe, MrÂ President-in-Office â and you can correct me if you should choose to respond â that this is not an issue of competence, but of political will: if the Council so chooses, it can act, as can the Commission, and the same holds for Parliament.
With regard to the appointments procedure, we very well know that directives were issued between 2000 and 2001 to make it more transparent and acceptable.
Those directives have been ignored and that has a powerful political significance: once again it is not an issue of a procedural or institutional nature.
The United States turned down the first candidate proposed by the Europeans to head the International Monetary Fund; the countries of Europe did not do the same when MrÂ Wolfowitz was presented as the candidate to direct the World Bank.
They could have done so.
Two telephone calls were enough to convince a couple of European prime ministers or Heads of Government, and the executive directors were completely bypassed: I believe that that would have been perfectly preventable if we had so desired.
As regards the quality of World Bank policies, today we have no particular guarantees that certain small breakthroughs initiated by MrÂ Wolfersohn will be continued: I am referring to governance and to the issue of corruption.
I believe that we should also seek to make an impression in this area.
There is a series of extremely controversial projects, such as the large dam on the Nam Theun river in Laos or the mining project in Guatemala, that stir up opposition right across the board, and yet our executive directors have given them the green light.
If this Parliament and public opinion had been aware of these issues, they would in all likelihood have acted differently.
In addition to claims of powerlessness, I would also like to hear some evidence of a willingness to act.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank MrsÂ Frassoni for having clarified in such a direct manner the issues brought to the table.
I believe that the appointment of MrÂ Wolfowitz as head of the World Bank has once again highlighted the lack of democracy and transparency that characterises the process of selecting and appointing the head of the worldâs most important financial institution for development.
It has also put the Committee on Development of this Parliament under the spotlight.
We would like to think that the President of the World Bank had a positive approach to resolving intercultural conflicts, in addition to an unquestionable commitment in support of multilateralism, together, of course, with a personal involvement in ensuring social equality and in the fight against poverty.
Aside from passing judgment on the person, however, who is well-known in any case for being one of the most effective proponents of the doctrine of preventative war, not to mention exporting democracy through weapons â one never knows, even Saint Paul converted on the road to Damascus â it would seem that the World Bank has not evolved much from the framework established at Bretton Woods, now more than 60 years ago.
That is also the case as regards the system of votes and seats, which needs to be reviewed, partly in response to requests from countries of the South and movements that have been calling in recent years for a different South and for involvement.
The European Union has pledged to guarantee and to facilitate a greater level of co-partnership from developing countries in global economic decision-making processes, including international financial institutions.
Leaving aside those agreements and the commitments undertaken by the EU â in Monterey, Barcelona and Johannesburg â however, it would be correct and logical to ensure good governance in the running of an institution that requires co-partnership as a foremost condition for gaining access to financing.
The lack of compliance with the criteria of democracy and transparency undermines the foundations, the legitimacy and the credibility of international institutions, in a world in which we feel the need for strong and legitimate international institutions that promote involvement: one only has to read Aminata Toureâs book, which uncovers her tragic experience of the conduct of the World Bank in Mali.
The European Union can play a fundamental role in ensuring this legitimacy; indeed, the European Union must carry out this very role, but in order to do so, it must speak with one voice: greater coordination among the European directors must be developed, given that Europe holds 30% of the votes on the Boards of the World Bank and of the International Monetary Fund.
The European Union, let us repeat, is the largest donor in the world, and yet it often forgets to supplement the donations with effective political action.
A significant role can be carried out by Members of the European Parliament, and in a meeting held in New York that has already happened.
Clear responses are needed: democratic reform of the processes must, however, also aim at overturning the asymmetry between the economies of North and South.
I believe that we must bring about development; in contrast, the policies of the World Bank have very often had devastating effects on populations.
This refers in particular to privatisation and basic needs, given that it would appear futile, as MrÂ Watson said, for the markets of developing countries to be full of goods that the people cannot buy because they have no jobs or money with which to buy them.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the European Union, we are very good at sanctimonious rhetoric about the need for poverty reduction in poor countries.
But whatever the appearances, this is not what todayâs discussion is about.
As MrÂ Almunia has made clear, it is about influence.
I will not comment on MrÂ Wolfowitzâs suitability to lead the World Bank, but the European Unionâs initial hostility to him has softened.
The EU needs support for Pascal Leumi to head up the World Trade Organization and for its candidate â perhaps Baroness Amos? â to lead the United Nations Development Programme.
Hence the comment of Action Aid that EU support for Mr Wolfowitz is a stitch-up, and similar remarks from other NGOs.
Whilst I will not diminish the value to poor nations of assistance from the World Bank and the European Union, fair trading conditions would be of far greater value to them than any amount of aid or debt relief.
Trade, rather than hand-outs, allows poor nations to help themselves, as the Indonesians were pleading after the tsunami.
Unfortunately, the EU seems to excel in poverty creation in pursuit of its own agenda: for example, paying cash to Mauritania, Angola and Mozambique for the right to fish out their coastal waters and impoverish their fishermen; or economic partnership agreements under which the European Union tries to buy poor nationsâ acquiescence to its protectionist policies.
No doubt the rhetoric will continue.
The reality is that self-interest rather than philanthropy drives the EUâs actions, and this self-interest is best served by the EU having its own people in the top jobs.
Â Â  Mr President, if I may, I should like to use the short time available to me to make a suggestion.
On 18Â May, the Commission will turn its attention to the European Transparency Initiative.
A great variety of ideas are on the table, one of which is to redesign the EUâs websites.
Might it not be possible for the Council and the Commission, and by all means Parliament too, to take the very practical step of launching an improved website setting out in very clear terms what the World Bank actually does and what progress we Europeans have achieved so far within this institution, as well as the representatives we have within the Bank, the specific projects that are involved and the opportunities that are available to us to make our voice heard?
Why am I saying all this?
Having followed the debate on screen, I was forced to draw the regrettable conclusion that nearly everything that was said had already been said 20Â years ago.
In my opinion, it will only be possible to bring about the necessary reforms â and the majority of Members believe that the World Bank urgently needs them â if transparent procedures are used to bring matters out into the open.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what has been said so far in this debate has proved once again quite clearly that we are a big payer in global terms, but not yet a big player in political terms.
It is not enough for us to merely offer explanations as to why this is so, and to express our regret; we are called upon to take action, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that this happens without delay, in order to close the gap between what we are and what we would like to be.
Unless this happens, we will be unable to honour our commitments, both within the EU and outside of it.
Both the Council report and the Commission report were not so much reports on the World Bank as a thorough analysis of our shortcomings.
The two reports make it quite clear that the problem does not lie with the World Bank, but with us.
As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, our problem is that it is the Member States that bear responsibility for this issue, rather than the Council, even though one could be forgiven for thinking that the two are one and the same.
In their capacity as Council members, the Member States should do everything in their power to ensure that the Council initiates measures to remedy this shortcoming.
A comment was made to the effect that we should start this process at some point in the future.
Rather than leaving it until some point in the future, however, we must start it now, and without delay.
The Constitution provides us with an opportunity to do so, as it grants legal status to the European Union.
We must take advantage of this status in order to address the failings of our external representation.
As I see it, the policies we pursue within the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the UN and the EIB are interconnected.
All of our representatives in these institutions must speak with one voice and be coordinated by one person if we are to be able to perform the duties incumbent upon us throughout the world.
The increasing influence of globalisation on our actions means that there is a growing need for a global order, for a social and economic order and for an order of principles.
We will be unable to play our role properly within these organisations if we do not start by establishing an order of this kind in the EU.
It is up to us to act, not the World Bank.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Wolfowitz, in a past life, adopted a rather unilateral stance and was known to us as a hardliner; he has now become the Chairman of the World Bank, a multilateral development institute.
This is surely â to put it in money terms â a remarkable example of laundering.
This has also been embarrassing for Europe; as someone said a moment ago, there are new procedures in which we have a say, but all it took was a few phone calls from the US to get him in the chair.
We had not agreed beforehand on a joint candidate, unlike in the case of Mr Lami for the WTO.
As far as the World Bank was concerned, we came too late and were not united.
I think that that was our failing, and a report by the Council and the Commission has been honest enough to say so.
Needless to say, it is not just about a joint candidate, but also about policy.
Everyone knows that, where Washington consensus is concerned, the international, multilateral financial institutions have lines and priorities that are often at odds with development and poverty policy which we in Europe would like to adopt at international level.
It is not necessarily about having it all one way or the other.
What we need is a balance.
In order to strike this balance and to be able to place social objectives, poverty reduction and millennium objectives on the centre stage in the World Bank, it is necessary to speak with one voice.
This requires joint action.
I agree with what was said a moment ago: the new Constitution may give us more scope and a duty, in a way, to act in those institutions as Europe and to speak with one voice.
It is quite something: we provide 60% of the loans under favourable conditions and have a much greater share of the votes, but are, to all intents and purposes, absent at the same time.
We would never tolerate this in the area of trade.
I think that this is at the heart of the matter.
We also need coherence.
In Africa, for example, the World Bank has been involved in the priority initiative on education.
The Commission does not want to have any part in this, though, because the national strategy documents for that area provide for roads and infrastructure and not for education.
We are therefore not delivering, while in this House, we are crying out for coherent, joint action.
There is therefore a problem on both sides.
Can the Council and Commission not reconsider whether, on the basis of the new Constitution, an initiative could be taken, at least in political-economic terms, on behalf of the World Bank?
We must also occupy a stronger position than is currently the case in terms of the way we cooperate.
The position at the moment is very depressing indeed.
Neither the Council nor the Commission is prepared to occupy it.
After all, both have spoken very convincingly and sounded pessimistic at the same time.
Let us head for the future .
Â Â  Mr President, it is clear that the World Bank is an effective instrument, and could be even more so, and I do not believe that the new leadership is the problem.
I have no particular fear that the new leadership of the World Bank may redirect energies, which to date have been directed towards other areas, in order to make the World Bank operate better.
The problem is with us, the hypocrisy of European discourse, in which we spend our time explaining to our citizens that Europe wants to carry influence in the world, how we want to contribute to peace in the world.
And the governments say this to their own voters and then do not make the least effort to turn these words and promises into real actions.
The European Union as such carries no weight in the World Bank.
We do not need a new Constitution for that; it is a problem of political will and coherence.
Commissioner Almunia has described this perfectly.
We have 25 Member States that do not talk to each other in the World Bank, and that is something we must condemn here.
It is very easy to protest against the appointment of Mr Wolfowitz, and perhaps we should do so, but it should be much easier for all of us to condemn our governmentsâ inability to coordinate themselves in relation to policies, appointments and criteria for granting funding.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most pressing problem we face with regard to the World Bankâs policies is its policy on structural adjustment.
The World Bank has supported structural adjustment programmes for many decades, and yet these have often had grotesque results, for example in the case of the privatisation of services.
A good example of this is water supplies, in that, even though these have been privatised and infrastructure put in place, the price of water has risen so rapidly that the poorest groups in society can no longer afford it.
Another example is trade policy, as making the granting of loans conditional upon forced liberalisation and the opening up of markets means that the negotiating position of developing countries in the WTO rounds is weakened.
All this stands in stark contrast to the EUâs development policy goals, which, for example, give water supplies a key role in the fight against poverty and strengthen the negotiating capacity of developing countries in WTO rounds.
This is therefore a key line of attack to take in changing the World Bankâs policies.
The reform that is now in its initial stages will change absolutely nothing.
What is termed the new selection policy for loans, which is meant to be about to be introduced, is essentially an admission of defeat for over 30Â years of World Bank policies; it means, in short, that those countries that have participated in the World Bankâs structural adjustment programmes over recent years or decades without having achieved good results and without having gained anything will now get money to tackle their most urgent social problems.
Those countries that did not participate properly will receive less money.
This distinction between good performers and bad performers is extremely questionable, and in my opinion the Commission and the Council have a duty to insist that it is made according to clear, transparent and easy-to-understand criteria, if nothing else.
I believe that they also have a duty to urge the World Bank to make far-reaching changes to its poverty reduction strategy, in the framework of UN reform and the Millennium Development Goals.
Â Â  Mr President, I have to say that I am shocked by the Council statement here today that not a single body of the Council has made any effort whatsoever to reach a common position in relation to our stance in the World Bank, or indeed to use the clout we clearly have financially and in voting terms on the World Bank; despite the fact that every Head of State recently signed up solemnly to the European Constitution, which declares that we want to end world poverty, and despite the fact that each Member State has signed up to the Millennium Development Goals.
We still have states that welsh on their commitments to reach the development aid target of 0.7% of GDP, which has been in place for decades.
My own Member State solemnly declared last year at the United Nations General Assembly that it would reach the 0.7% of GDP by the year 2010.
This year, it has announced that it will not reach that figure, not because we do not have the money, but because the Government wants to spend the money on winning the next election!
It is clear that the governments of the Member States of the European Union are more interested in trade than they are in eliminating poverty.
They are more interested in securing their position in the World Trade Organization than they are in securing the position in the World Bank to pursue the objectives of the Union.
Could I ask that this House move from making declarations to establishing an ad hoc committee so that we can prepare a common position for the European Union and the World Bank and then drive the Council and the Commission to adopt Parliamentâs position on this issue?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like to start by thanking the honourable Members for this extremely interesting debate and for the very useful messages that they have given not only to the Council but also to the Commission.
I would like to single out two or three issues, and I will start with the influence of the EU in the financial institutions, and particularly within the World Bank.
Let me speak for a moment on behalf of the Presidency and not as a representative of the Council.
It is true that, if we were share-holders in a private company, we would be managing our share in that companyâs capital very badly.
However, as you know, it is a bit more complicated than that, and we are not in that situation.
We are in a different situation, which is political in nature.
Nevertheless, I must say that the message that the European Union must improve coordination of its positions within those organisations, and particularly within the World Bank, is based on absolute necessity since, as several of you have said, we are far from exercising our full influence, not only in financial terms, but also politically.
On that subject, I would like to point out that there may be an article in the Treaty that we should take a second look at and possibly take advantage of to follow up this morningâs debate.
I am referring to ArticleÂ 99 of the TreatyÂ âÂ which is also included in the draft ConstitutionÂ âÂ and which provides that Member States may, on the basis of a proposal, improve coordination of their positions within financial institutions and international financial conferences.
I therefore think that the question of representation of the EU in international circlesÂ âÂ and especially in international financial circlesÂ âÂ remains to be answered.
I do not need to return to the difficulties associated with it.
The second issue that you raised, which is perhaps linked somewhat to the first, is the reform of the international financial institutions, and in particular the World Bank.
I think that, on this point, the European Unionâs role is extremely important.
We do needÂ âÂ and this was, in part, the aim of the informal meeting with MrÂ WolfowitzÂ âÂ to urge the new President of the World Bank to pursue reform, not only of the operation of the World Bank, but also of its policies.
I think that, here too, the European Union could have an even greater role if it spoke with one voice.
This brings us back somewhat to the issue of the influence of the EU in the international institutions.
It is certain that, within those institutions, it is necessary to take better account of new balances of power in the world, and to integrate better a number of new international players, new economic powers, without forgetting the developing countries.
The final point relates to development aid policy.
The Commissioner also provided a certain amount of information in that regard.
The European Union is the biggest donor, giving more than 50% of development aid.
I must say that we have started to look into new forms of development aid financing.
The most recent Ecofin Council worked on these methods of financing.
You are all aware of the idea that was put forward of creating certain taxes specifically in order to meet, or increase, levels of development aid, and I can tell you that, during its informal meeting that will take place on 13 and 14Â May in Luxembourg, Ecofin expects to return to these new methods of financing development aid, particularly with a view to ensuring compliance with the objectives of the Millennium Summit which will be held in September.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would firstly like to express my agreement with all the speeches that have referred to the need for closer coordination of the Member States of the European Union in the activities, in the decision-making, in the orientation of the policies and in the strategy of the World Bank.
By means of the instruments available to it, the Commission tries to influence and guide the policies of the World Bank in line with our objectives in terms of development policy and official development aid.
In my initial speech I spoke about those memorandums of understanding, those trust funds, by means of which we take action, combining the resources of the World Bank with the budgetary resources of the European Union in a whole series of activities and regions of the world, whenever we consider that those actions are in line with the objectives set by the European Union and with our priorities in the field of development aid and our policies for supporting development in the poorest countries of the world.
Secondly, I will repeat what I said in my initial speech and something that has also been taken up by many of you: the need to make progress towards creating a single voice for the European Union in the World Bank and in other international institutions.
Some of you have said that the entry into force of the Constitution will act as a lever for moving towards that objective, and it is true that the entry into force of the Constitution, the single personality for the Union and the political impetus represented by the implementation of the Constitution must help us to progress towards that goal.
But it is also the case, as the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has just pointed out, that, under the current Treaty, with the provisions currently in force, the Union should already be speaking with one voice in many bodies, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, at least in relation to the Eurozone.
There is, however, another element that will help us.
I do not know if it is in line with the will of all the Member States, but I do believe that it is in line with the collective will of the Union, of this House, of the Commission and of the Council.
Europe wants to be a global player, as Mr Karas has said, but there are certain countries which are going to be global players and which are demanding reforms within the governing bodies of the way in which the different countries and regions of the world are represented in the international financial institutions and, in particular, in the World Bank.
Faced with this pressure, the European Union cannot respond in a divided manner, it must respond in a united fashion, moving towards that single voice.
I would like to make a comment on the appointment of the new President of the World Bank.
As you know, the European Commission does not participate in any way in that procedure, but Mr Wolfowitz will become President of the World Bank on 1 June.
From that date, we want the World Bank to continue working on the positive aspects that have characterised the presidency of MrÂ James D. Wolfensohn over the last 10 years.
And on the two occasions I have been able, as a member of the Commission, to speak personally with Mr Wolfowitz over recent weeks, that is what I have said to him: from 1 June, the European Commission and the whole of the Union wants the World Bank to continue in the positive direction taken during the years of the Mr Wolfensohnâs leadership.
And I must tell you that, so far, MrÂ Wolfowitzâs response indicates that he is committed to continuing to work on these positive aspects.
I hope that, after 1 June, we will see that that is the case.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased to have been given the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Council about these important matters with regard to the vital region of Central Asia.
That region is important for the European Union from several points of view: geopolitically, geostrategically and also economically.
Despite a certain degree of improvement recently, the situation in Kyrgyzstan remains critical.
The new political dynamic is structured according to personal and regional allegiances and the political parties have a purely nominal role.
The presidential election is scheduled for 10Â July, and the second round could take place on 24Â July.
The risks connected with security and the uncertain economic situation could complicate the presidential campaign.
Indeed, the presidential election campaign is increasingly turning into a competition between the two main candidates on the political scene in the country, namely MrÂ Kulov and MrÂ Akaev.
Because of this, the stability of the country depends to a considerable extent on a possible rapprochement between these two political leaders.
A compromise between them could include a commitment to respect the election result, which should be the usual case in a democracy, on the condition that the losing candidate can take the position of Prime Minister.
However, at the moment, informal contacts between the two camps have not yet produced tangible results.
On this matter, the main message from the international community, including the OSCE and the European Union, during this presidential campaign should stress the importance of holding free and fair elections.
Nevertheless, the holding of democratic elections will not automatically guarantee that the democratisation process is completely successful.
Many political issues will remain on the agenda, in particular constitutional reform, the expected parliamentary elections, the independence of the media and the development of a political system based on the natural development of political parties.
The issue of constitutional reform has already been mentioned in the electoral debate.
The parliament has set up a constitutional council, which is to set out the principles for constitutional reform to be implemented following the election results.
Nevertheless, various political players are taking completely opposing positions in this regard.
The economic climate is not improving significantly and public order is still precarious.
The seizure of land around Bishkek increases the risk of disorder.
Ethnic issues are at the heart of political debate.
In general, the situation for ethnic minorities remains a cause for concern.
All the most important international players, including Russia, favour the maintenance of internal security and stability in Kyrgyzstan.
The new leaders of the country have successfully maintained good relations with all their neighbouring countries, particularly with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
The OSCEâs work for Kyrgyzstan will soon be finalised and the Kyrgyz Government will need to approve it in the coming days.
The European Commission recently announced its intention to allocate EURÂ 25Â million to Kyrgyzstan in 2005.
As you know, the general situation in Central Asia remains a matter of concern.
A number of factors are creating an atmosphere of uncertainty around the countries in that region.
First of all, the most serious threats to regional stability in Central Asia are a lack of economic reform, the continuance of authoritarian regimes and the widespread phenomena of corruption, organised crime and drug trafficking.
We spoke yesterday about the problem of drugs in Afghanistan.
Well, these countries are on the drug-trafficking route.
The political rights of the people are being eroded in the majority of these countries.
Regional cooperation has not reached an adequate level due to the lack of trust and of political will among the states in the region.
Poverty and lack of growth in the countries of Central Asia have exacerbated socio-economic tensions.
The geopolitical proximity of Afghanistan and certain domestic factors have allowed Islamic extremism to spread and, as I have just stated, have increased drug trafficking.
Potential conflicts on the doorstep of the States in the region and between them could be stirred up by the mixing of ethnic minorities on the territory of these countries.
Various specific issues need to be raised with regard to the situation in certain countries in the region.
I will summarise them briefly.
In Kazakhstan, the parliamentary elections which took place in SeptemberÂ 2004 did not meet normally accepted international criteria.
The opposition, in spite of growing support among the people, gained only one seat.
The current President is inclined to call a presidential election before the end of his presidential term in JanuaryÂ 2006.
The governmentâs interference in the legislative process, the opposition, the media, civil society and the financial systems is worrying.
The human rights situation is getting worse.
In Uzbekistan, the legal opposition was unable to participate in the parliamentary elections on 26Â DecemberÂ 2004.
The programme of reform in the country has not moved forward and poverty has increased further.
There is a real risk in that country that Islamic fundamentalism will spread further and further within the population.
In Turkmenistan, the lack of freedom of expression and of democratic debate, the impossibility of maintaining an effective opposition to the government and the non-existence of any programme of structural reform are major causes for concern.
Finally, the situation in Tajikistan is characterised by two main problems: endemic squabbles between provinces and a prolonged economic crisis.
In spite of the problems and difficulties in the region, as I have just detailed, the European Union believes that relations with the region are of vital importance and is prepared to support the transition of these countries to effective market economies and also to functioning democracies.
The Deputy Director-General for external relations of the European Commission recently visited four republics in Central Asia.
On 12Â May, the EU-Turkmenistan Joint Committee will meet in Ashgabat.
In connection with the joint committee, an meeting will be held with the aim of advancing the dialogue on the issue of human rights.
A European Union troika will meet the representatives of five countries in the region in Tashkent at the end of the month.
In Brussels, the EU-Kyrgyzstan Cooperation Council will take place in June and the EU-Kazakhstan and EU-Kyrgyzstan Cooperation Councils will take place in July.
Â Â  Mr President, before the Commissioner takes the floor, I think some more clarity is what is needed, because I have heard two dates for presidential elections in Kyrgyzstan, namely 10 and 18 June.
These are, as far as I am aware, obsolete.
As far as I know, the presidential elections will be held on 10 July.
Before the parliamentary debate starts, I think it would be useful, if the Council or the Commission âŠ
Â Â  Mr Maat, that is not a point of order.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is an honour for me to be here at this plenary sitting to discuss with you the situation in a region of great strategic importance: Central Asia and, in particular, the situation in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan.
Following the overthrow of President Akaev, as a result of the mass protests of 24 March, which were caused by the violation of international and OSCE standards in the parliamentary elections of February and March, both the EUâs High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, and the Commissioner for Foreign Relations, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, who is unfortunately unable to attend this debate, have urged the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to seek a path towards national reconciliation based on the construction of a dialogue and a consensus allowing progress in the process of political reform.
The Republic of Kyrgyzstan has a unique opportunity to establish a genuine multi-party democracy in Central Asia and to eliminate the corruption that contributed so much to the recent crisis.
This opportunity is in the hands of the political leaders of that country, who must demonstrate their firm commitment to true progress in the field of political reforms.
The best way to achieve this is to take measures to guarantee the establishment of a multi-party democracy, respect for human rights and the existence of the rule of law, in accordance with the international commitments made by Kyrgyzstan.
I would like to emphasise that political liberalisation and the preparation and holding of free, fair and transparent elections must be applied to the coming presidential vote; according to our information they are going to take place on 10 July.
These elections will be closely observed by the Union and by the whole of the international community.
The democratic credentials of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan will improve if the interim government applies the recommendations of the final mission report of the OSCEâs Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, published in March of this year.
Under the umbrella of the OSCE, the Union is preparing, by means of its rapid reaction mechanism, a range of measures for assisting in the elections and in legislative reforms in the electoral field.
The Union is urging Kyrgyzstan to create an environment in which the media and journalists of that country can exercise their rights and freedoms fully, in accordance with international commitments.
I believe that the OSCE is in a position to provide the authorities with advice in this field.
It is important to fight more effectively against corruption in all the countries of Central Asia, since this has been identified as one of the main causes of the events in Kyrgyzstan.
I would now like to talk to you about cooperation between the Union and all the countries of Central Asia.
At the end of last year, the Union launched an initiative intended to improve political dialogue with the region.
To this end, the of the Unionâs Regional Directors met with their Central Asian counterparts last December in Bishkek.
This political dialogue between the European Union and Central Asia can undoubtedly help to change the future of the relations between the two regions, provided that it takes place in a constructive manner.
The Commission takes a positive view of the interest demonstrated by the five countries of Central Asia in this process.
The success of the dialogue depends on the extent to which both parties are involved in it.
In this regard, the Union will always be in favour of economic liberalisation and, of course, of political democratisation in Central Asia.
The process of dialogue could focus on concerns that are common to both regions: the fight against terrorism, trafficking in drugs and people, money-laundering, illegal immigration, energy, transport and increasing economic cooperation.
The political dialogue between the Union and Central Asia would facilitate regional integration in the area and would provide a political orientation for the cooperation between the two regions.
The Union is studying which steps to take next.
The meeting between the Union's and the Foreign Affairs Ministers of Central Asia that will take place at the end of June in Tashkent will be a good opportunity to continue discussing the process of dialogue.
The Union is urging the five countries of Central Asia to persevere in the process of political liberalisation.
The only way for a country to prosper to the benefit of its citizens, to enjoy stability and security, and to significantly promote regional integration, is to ensure that economic development goes hand-in-hand with political liberalisation, the rule of law and the development of an active civil society, one of the essential components of which is freedom of the press.
I am convinced that that is the best way to strengthen the links between Central Asia and the Union.
The Commission is expecting an improvement in cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the Caspian Sea region, as agreed at the ministerial conference on energy and transport that took place in Baku in November of last year.
From a political point of view, energy has become a security issue.
It is in the interests of both regions to cooperate in order to achieve more effective and in-depth integration of our systems and our energy markets.
The intensification of cooperation between the Union and Central Asia depends on both political and economic aspects and, within this context, the Union remains willing to assist in this important region.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we often overlook this region because it was formerly hidden in the shadows of the Soviet Union, and did not therefore develop in any independent way.
Today, however, the region is of enormous strategic importance due to its reserves of gas and oil, and its significance in terms of energy supplies and so on. This strategic importance is also a result of Chinaâs increasing interest in the region, the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and the fact that a number of these countries are getting caught up in the drug trade.
We must face up to the fact that this erosion of democracy, of the rule of law and of human rights is making it increasingly difficult to cooperate with the region, to honour existing partnership and cooperation agreements and to conclude or ratify new agreements.
We must also realise that regimes of this kind are turning into islands of instability rather than stability, as we have seen from the elections in Kyrgyzstan and the earlier events in Ukraine.
The more unstable the situation in a region of such critical geographical importance, the greater the impact will be on our interests.
It is for this reason that I should like to invite the House to think much more along the lines of a common strategy on this matter rather than tackling individual issues, and I would emphasise how important it is that genuine support be provided for the democratic process in these countries.
My next comments are intended for the Council and the Commission.
As I see it, it is in everyoneâs interest for us to reach an agreement with the United States, which no longer merely views the country as a short-term base camp for Afghanistan, and with Russia, whose attitude towards developments of this kind is often influenced by old beliefs.
It is in the interests of all three partners that the region should be stabilised, but we will be able to achieve this only if we work together to establish democracy and the rule of law.
We should make this a new priority.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think that we are all readily agreed that we are obliged, in view of what is happening in Kyrgyzstan, to face facts with regard to the entire region and to have a debate on what should be done about Central Asia, what the EUâs interests are and what we can do to improve the situation and make the region more stable.
The developments in Kyrgyzstan are, in themselves, memorable; there is a striking resemblance to what we saw in Ukraine.
At the same time, we have to remember that what happened in Kyrgyzstan, was, of course, not an orange revolution and we have to wait and see how the developments in that country will pan out, particularly in the light of the fair and free elections that are due to be held there.
While I am on the subject of the elections, the European Union and the OSCE must play a central role in observing them, thereby giving the people of Kyrgyzstan the subsequent certainty that the elections were fair and that the government in power is legitimate and capable of contributing to that countryâs development.
Should all of this go to plan, we think that the European Union should also give some thought to how it can help Kyrgyzstan in its new circumstances, for this will have a positive effect on other countries in the region.
Without entering into a long analysis of how Uzbekistan and other countries in Central Asia are doing, I would like to mention the fact that Kyrgyzstanâs neighbouring countries also have major problems about which the European Union should be concerned.
This is, indeed, our key question to the Commission: we have a strategy for Russia and we have the new Neighbourhood Policy for many countries, but what to do about Central Asia?
To what initiatives, partly geared towards supporting the developments in Kyrgyzstan, can we look forward in the next few years?
As we see it, this is not just about safeguarding the energy supply, but also about whether we can strengthen ties with those countries and how we can, to some degree, Europeanise Central Asia, by which I mean spreading and anchoring values that we in the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE share.
We hope that the Commission and the Council will table further initiatives in this respect.
Â Â  I am the head of the delegation to the republics of Central Asia and Mongolia, and shortly we will be going to this region, to Central Asia and, namely, to Kirghizstan.
Most of the representatives of Parliament believe the news that has spread over the world about a tulip revolution in Kirghizia.
I would like to express my opinion on this matter, maybe from a slightly different perspective.
I think that indeed a movement took place in this country, a movement of people; however, to name that a revolution, which has happened in the Ukraine or Georgia, would be hasty, to my mind, and I would invite Parliament to be more careful by choosing such words.
Why do I say so?
Because the role of the people is not clear enough.
What does the nation want and what do the leaders want?
This is the point where a difference should be seen.
However, this region is particularly important to the European Parliament and to the European Union for two reasons.
Firstly, some countries in Central Asia, namely, Kazakhstan, is one of the biggest trading partners with the European Union in the field of energy resources.
As you might know, the neighbouring countries of this region, such as China, are also very interested in attracting them to their side.
Therefore, we have to pay particular attention to our regular cooperation, purposeful cooperation in helping those countries to create democracy.
We have to learn from the United States of America in respect to active participation in this region, and it is a pity to say that the European Union is not really very active, is not really effective with its programmes; we have to admit that.
Although the Commission states that we are one of the main financial supporters in this region, that is, we accomodate large financial funds, from the point of view of effectiveness those funds are not appropriately used.
What is our objective?
What objective should the European Union pursue in Central Asia, in all countries and in particular today in Kirghizstan?
That is ensuring democracy, stability and order.
That is close cooperation between those countries.
As I have already mentioned before, the visit of the delegation will take place on 14 - 20 May.
After the visit we will be able to inform the Members of Parliament of the real situation in Kirghizstan and in the region.
I would also like to mention that on the 2 June a meeting with the US representatives on coordination of activities in this region will take place.
I invite all the Members of Parliament to participate.
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as I have only one minute in which to speak, I should like to focus on just one aspect of this issue.
I would endorse the comments made by the previous speakers, as I too believe that our primary concern should be to acknowledge the key role played by the OSCE in Central Asia.
This holds particularly true for conflict prevention, but it also applies in the case of crisis management and enforcement of the rule of law, human rights and democratic standards.
We should not forget that the OSCE also does a great deal in other fields, such as support for civil society or measures to protect minorities.
We should particularly welcome the OSCEâs activities in this region, especially those relating to election observation and preparations for the forthcoming elections, due to be held in Kyrgyzstan in June 2005.
The aim of these activities is to ensure that the elections can be held in accordance with international and European standards.
The issue of police training also plays a key role in this connection, particularly in Kyrgyzstan.
In conclusion, I would ask the Council, and the Commission too, to ensure that we cooperate closely with the OSCE.
In particular, we should put to good use the experience gained in this field by MrÂ Peterle, who is the OSCE special envoy for the region.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his introductory remarks.
I should also like to say how much I welcome the political changes that have taken place in Kyrgyzstan, as they will also provide us with an opportunity to clarify our foreign policy goals.
At first glance, everything would appear to be quite straightforward.
Elections held in Kyrgyzstan were rigged, following which the president was forced from power by popular protests, with Bishkek the next to be hit by the domino effect that had already seen the governments in Tbilisi and Kiev overthrown.
Moscow backed an undemocratic president, and suffered defeat.
Yet at the same time, it is also becoming apparent that there was a strong social dimension to the revolution in Kyrgyzstan, which was very much an uprising against the rule of an oligarchy that had come into being during privatisation.
This has in fact been a common phenomenon in all post-socialist countries, where groups have existed that were or are at the centre of political power, whether as a result of their past contacts, or their ethnic or party-political ties to those currently in power.
The members of these groups made undreamt-of fortunes from privatisation, which not only caused major rifts in society, but also gave them the necessary means and the desire to enter into politics.
There are however further aspects of the uprising in Kyrgyzstan that distinguish it from others of its kind.
This uprising took place in the country with the most liberal regime in Central Asia.
The conclusion that any oligarchy would draw from this would be that the more restrictions are imposed on a societyâs freedom, the greater the chances it has of remaining in power.
Furthermore, the situation in Kyrgyzstan differs from that in Ukraine, for example, because Russophobia played no part in the Kyrgyz uprising.
In this connection, I should like to reiterate my call for us to ensure that EU policy reflects the fact that the European Union is an institution that upholds the ideals of the rule of law and social justice.
We should therefore support those forces that wish to strengthen constitutional order and social justice, both in Kyrgyzstan and elsewhere.
Â Â  . Mr President, at a time like the present, when we are celebrating the Allied Forces liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany, many Europeans will do so with mixed feelings.
After all, throwing off the German yoke cleared the way for decades of oppression by the Soviet Union, which was endured also by Central Asia.
Last month, Kyrgyzstan disposed of an authoritarian leader following unfair elections.
Both those in government and the people of that country are fearful of the possibility that Muslim extremists will take advantage of the politically unstable situation.
Islamic terrorist organisations in particular, Hizb ut-Tahrir among them, which pursue Islamic domination worldwide, constitute a threat to the whole of the Central Asian region.
It is therefore to be welcomed that the region, in the fight against international terrorism, combats this Islamic radicalisation.
Unfortunately, the authoritarian regimes in the region are not addressing this issue appropriately, with the consequence, among others, that they face many problems in the area of religious freedom.
It is right that the Central Asian governments should try to keep a grip on radicalising developments within Islam, but to require Christian churches to register with the government is, in my view, excessive.
There should not be any fear of attacks from that quarter.
On a regular basis, we receive reports that both registered and non-registered Christian communities are faced with major problems, including persecution.
Allow me to quote just one example.
In Kazakhstan, Valery Pak of the non-registered Baptist community of Kyzyl-Orda has been threatened and persecuted for years.
This must end, for indeed, all Central Asian countries make provision in their constitutions for religious freedom.
I would urge the Council and Commission to support those countries in their fight against Muslim fundamentalism, while also calling them to account about the problems related to religious freedom, the requirement that churches be registered, and particularly the situation of the non-registered Baptist communities, as well as the wrongs committed against Valery Pak and others.
Â Â  .Â Â Â I should like to start by congratulating the presidency on its excellent work drawing up a detailed analysis of the situation in Central Asia, and in particular in Kyrgyzstan.
If I may, I should like to make a number of additional comments regarding the situation in that country.
Although over one and a half months have passed since the coup in Kyrgyzstan, the situation there is still far from stable, and this is a source of much unrest in neighbouring countries.
We have noted a number of encouraging signs that things are returning to normal, and I believe that one such sign is the fact that a diarchy has not been established at either parliamentary or Head of State level.
Here I refer primarily to PresidentÂ Akayevâs resignation in April.
Yet events have also taken place that could cause a great deal of disquiet.
These include a number of incidents surrounding a mysterious and politically motivated death, which have meant that an increased number of questions have been asked about the real nature of the changes that have taken place.
In my opinion, the way in which the forthcoming presidential elections are conducted will serve as a litmus test for these changes.
At this point, I should like to highlight the key role that the OSCE has played, is playing and undoubtedly will continue to play with regard to Kyrgyzstan.
Monitoring of the pre-election situation and of the elections themselves should be particularly focused on those aspects of the electoral process which were a direct cause of the protests in Kyrgyzstan and which led to the coup, such as the exclusion of candidates and vote buying.
The Kyrgyz authoritiesâ attitude towards the calling of early parliamentary elections will also be a key yardstick.
If I may, I should like to make one further comment on the basis of my own experience of public life in Poland.
Once a society begins to fight for its inalienable rights, this becomes an irreversible and inevitable process, no matter how long the struggle lasts.
The support provided by the EU for these changes should therefore make allowance for this fact, and it should be focused on civil society.
I am in favour of the EU providing financial support, but this should be conditional on compliance with criteria relating to human rights and the rule of law.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I still have vivid memories of the visit I made to Kyrgyzstan a few years ago.
It is a country of great natural beauty and boasts an abundance of water, which is a great natural resource in that part of the world.
The eyes of the world were recently drawn again to Kyrgyzstan when its long-time leader, PresidentÂ Akayev, was overthrown.
Some people, including some of those present in this Chamber, have rather naively interpreted this as an event similar to those that had previously taken place in Georgia and Ukraine.
The truth is rather different, however.
The new Georgian and Ukrainian governments are going to great lengths to ensure that their countries pursue policies of independence from Moscow.
In Kyrgyzstan, however, the new political set-up is just as pro-Russian as its predecessor, if not more so.
The situation in the country remains far from stable, as evidenced by the recent assassination attempt on MrÂ Erkinbayev, who is running for president.
Current events in Kyrgyzstan cannot be viewed in black and white terms, even though some Western observers appear to wish that this were the case.
It is essential for the EU to play a more active role in this part of the world, and it must not leave the peoples involved to the mercy of the Russians and the Americans.
That said, we should of course cooperate with both of the latter on this issue.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has cleared up the misunderstanding about the Councilâs communication with regard to the election date: it is 10 July.
All credit to the Commission, therefore, which was better informed.
I should like to echo the words by the chairman of the Delegation for Central Asia who has already indicated that we should be careful not to compare the situation in Kyrgyzstan with that in Ukraine.
Time will tell whether the revolution is the same, or whether a number of leaders have brought another process in motion.
The situation in Kyrgyzstan is significantly different: its democracy is divided along ethnic and regional lines, which does not, in itself, make matters worse, nor does it alter the fact that the European Union would do well to invest in Central Asia.
At the moment, too little is being invested and the striking thing is that until recently, the two poorest countries, Mongolia âa country deserving credit for the absence of any problems in the areas of democracy and human rights â and Kyrgyzstan, were doing best of all.
Now that a revolution in Kyrgyzstan is underway, we should capitalise on it.
I am pleased with the 25 million from the Commission, but it does seem to be a pittance.
In the short term, the European Union should do as follows.
I call upon the Council and the Commission, together with Parliament, to invest in the elections by sending a solid observation delegation on 10 July and by supporting the OSCE, to ensure that the elections go well.
Indeed, elections that go well will instil trust in the people, also for subsequent parliamentary elections.
In addition, it is important for the European Union to invest more in education and economic cooperation, because it is too crazy for words that the lionâs share of foreign investments in education are currently being made by fundamentalist Islamic groupings.
That situation must end.
It is a challenge for Europe to invest more in Kyrgyzstan, particularly in the areas of education and economic cooperation.
The country also requires sound free trade agreements to this end.
I would like to add another critical note about that region.
I should like to find out from the Commission what it intends to do about increasing repression in Kazakhstan, including the recent closure of the biggest opposition newspaper and the imprisonment of its journalist Irina Petrusheva in Russia at the request of the authorities in Kazakhstan.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, many things have been said in the previous speeches to which I will not return.
Overall, I agree with the content of the draft common resolution that has been proposed.
Nevertheless, I would like to stress the importance of three points.
First, economic and social difficulties were a major trigger for the events in Kyrgyzstan.
This is because the situation of considerable uncertainty and poverty formed fertile ground, favourable to the spread of demonstrations and to the overthrow of the government of MrÂ Akaev, who had been making himself rich off the Kyrgyz economy since 1991.
Unacceptable practices, including corruption and nepotism, increased the silent but legitimate discontent of the people, who aspire to an improvement in their situation, and we must pay attention to these aspirations.
Thus, if we are going to support the ongoing process of transition to democracy, we must pay particular attention to the honesty and transparency of the elections, and to the implementation of a policy of dialogue and national reconciliation.
Only a stable, legitimate government will be able to successfully complete the reforms that are necessary to improve the situation of Kyrgyz citizens.
Next, the stakes in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute another crucial aspect of the current situation.
The European Union must satisfy itself that the democratisation process is based on true political pluralism and also allows the media and NGOs to operate freely and independently.
The cooperation projects launched by the OSCE and as part of the TACIS programme must be supported and encouraged.
Finally, I think we need to broaden our thinking in relation to the events in Kyrgyzstan to a regional perspective encompassing the whole of Central Asia.
The democratisation of Kyrgyzstan could thus be seen as a hope, an example that the other countries of Central Asia, suffering from violations of human rights, can follow.
The recent toughening of legislation aimed at NGOs and opposition groups calls for an attitude of attentiveness and of particular vigilance by the European Union faced with the changing political situation in the region.
Â Â  Mr President, Kyrgyzstan is a small, central Asian Muslim republic of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions.
Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864, but it achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
It has recently been in the news, following the 27Â February parliamentary elections, when election irregularities caused widespread protest, starting in the south of the country.
The president was forced to flee, accused of corruption and stealing the election.
Yesterday, on a state visit to Georgia, PresidentÂ Bush called for freedom and democracy everywhere in the Communist world.
Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with a predominantly agricultural economy, but it has carried out significant market reforms under ex-President Akaev.
He has distinguished himself by adopting relatively liberal economic policies, and has introduced an improved regulatory system and land reform.
Kyrgyzstan was the first CIS country to be accepted into the WTO, and most state companies have been sold off, although, regrettably, cronyism and corruption have been rife.
It is hoped that its revolution â if it is a revolution â will place it on a firm path to democracy, respect for human rights and good governance.
It could be a model for surrounding states like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan which maintain authoritarian systems that are only in partial transition.
But border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and its neighbours are delaying the process of frontier delimitation with Tajikistan in particular, but also with Uzbekistan.
There is also the problem of the illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppies for the CIS markets and limited government eradication of illicit narcotic crops.
Kyrgyzstan also serves as a transit point to south-west Asian narcotic markets and narcotics bound for Russia and the rest of Europe.
Presidential elections are scheduled for July: I have confirmed this from the Internet.
The European Parliament should definitely send observers to watch Kyrgyzstanâs transition to democracy.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is plain to see that the European Parliament is very keen to cooperate with Kyrgyzstan, as well as with the other Central Asian countries. Evidence of this can be found in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded in 1995.
Issues of interest to Parliament include human rights, the democratisation of everyday life, environmental protection and energy, and these should be the focus of particular attention.
A great many hopes were pinned upon the Kyrgyz Constitution when it was adopted in 1993.
Even though it has since been amended four times, it would still appear to be a potentially good basis for further democratic changes in the country.
Yet although according to the Constitution the judicial system is officially independent and responsible for ensuring that human rights are observed in the country, observers have made it clear that not enough reforms have taken place within it, that corruption is still endemic and that judges are not paid enough.
According to these observers, the appointment by the president of the members of the Constitutional Court, the judges of the Supreme Court and the arbitrators of the Arbitration Court violates democratic principles.
They have warned that human rights must not be curtailed on the pretext of combating terrorism.
The European Union can and should provide the financial support it always does in order to reverse these negative trends.
Furthermore, it can and should provide its customary moral support by being present wherever it is needed and wherever democracy must be supported and the rule of law reestablished.
Â Â  Mr President, the new millennium appears to have ushered in a wave of change, particularly in the successor states of the former Soviet Union.
Outside factors, such as the struggle for power and for control over oil pipelines, were not the main cause of the âcoloured revolutionsâ in Central Asia, even though covert attempts were undoubtedly made by the USA and Russia to exert influence; instead, it is much more likely that these revolutions were a result of the gradual modernisation of the former Soviet republics.
The peoples of Central Asia have grown frustrated with the old and rigid structures, and they want rapid change without bloodshed.
Of course, the public also hopes that such change will result in an economic upturn and bring prosperity.
In principle, reforms of this kind can bring about positive changes.
It would appear, however, that a partial power vacuum has now emerged in Kyrgyzstan, and this brings with it the risk that the mood will change and that the country will descend into chaos and civil war.
It is in the EUâs interests to lend a helping hand and to offer advice in order to stabilise the political situation, but excessive interference on our part could have the opposite effect, by upsetting the balance that is gradually being established in the country.
After all, Kyrgyzstan wants to prove that it is capable of pressing ahead with reconstruction measures under its own steam.
The fact that a wave of revolution of this kind could spill over at any time should also give us pause for thought, as it would come as no surprise if this trend were to continue in other countries with similar conditions, such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
The EU should start preparing immediately for such an eventuality.
I would also endorse the comment made by one of the previous speakers to the effect that this area must not be left to the sole care of the USA and Russia.
Â Â  Following the political upheaval in Kyrgyzstan, which is not entirely comparable with the developments in Ukraine and Georgia, the key causes of instability in the economic, social and other areas are still in place.
Of course the new government cannot resolve the accumulated problems by the presidential elections on 10 July, nor indeed for several months after that.
I myself experienced the revolution as a special envoy of the chairman-in-office of the OSCE, which in my opinion is working there quite successfully with the support of the European Union and the United Nations.
I am grateful to you for the attentive words in connection with the work of the OSCE, which is currently striving primarily for fair elections, improvement of security and political dialogue between the presidential candidates.
We know that there exist major differences between the north and south, and on this basis, although not only on this basis, political instability could arise before the actual elections.
And after 10 July there will of course be an urgent need for long-term assistance from the international community to implement reform in the political, economic and social spheres.
I am very pleased that today Commissioner Almunia has already pointed out the strategic aspect, followed by MrÂ Brok and other speakers.
I myself have advised several times of the need for the European Union to re-think its relationship with that area, which is not a part of the wider Europe but is closer to us than it might seem.
I think that in this relationship, as Mr Brok already stated, we also need to take into consideration the trans-Atlantic and Russian dimension.
In any case I am in favour of Parliament demonstrating its attention to Kyrgyzstan with a strong team of observers, and I would also like to assure you that the Kyrgyz parliament is eagerly anticipating the arrival of our parliamentary delegation.
Â Â  â Mr President, the announcement of presidential elections next July does not constitute, for the time being at least, the to the establishment of political stability and the democratisation of the country.
All the members spoke earlier of the serious problems faced by Kyrgyzstan.
However, the European Union should work closely with the OSCE to organise and supervise the elections and increase humanitarian aid and financial support through the TACIS programme and the system of generalised preferences.
The region of Central Asia must not constitute new ground for conflict between the major powers â the United States, Russia and China â for strategic control of energy resources.
Within the framework of combating terrorism, Central Asia has become the host area for new military bases and its militarisation is being dangerously reinforced.
The European Union has an interest in being the stabilising force in the area.
The strategy report adopted by the European Union in 2002, for the period from 2002 to 2006, for the countries in the area needs revising and enhancing, taking account of the new situation which is arising.
I believe and I call on the Commission to start preparing a new strategy report for the area right now, without waiting for 2006.
Democratisation, regional cooperation, combating drug trafficking and rising religious fanaticism are important challenges which will need to be met over coming years.
More active involvement on the part of the UN is considered important in this direction.
Â Â  Mr President, the positive domino effect that began with the democratic awakening in Ukraine and Georgia has now spread to a third country.
What has happened in Kyrgyzstan is another good example of the way in which the post-Soviet is falling from power, even though the events in these three countries are not necessarily comparable.
The Akayev regime collapsed without any outside intervention, as a result of a spontaneous popular uprising.
The publicâs patience had quite simply been stretched too far by such things as electoral fraud and the enormous fortunes amassed by a nepotistic political family that treated the country as though it were its own private property.
The Soviet Union collapsed almost 15Â years ago, yet this was not a geopolitical disaster, as the Russian President, MrÂ Putin, would have us believe, but a geopolitical opportunity.
The much-needed action taken by the OSCE and the ODIHR, an OSCE agency currently headed by an Austrian, is the only external factor that can be said to have had any influence on events.
Putin would appear to have learned from the mistakes he made in Ukraine, and the Kyrgyz opposition also acted shrewdly by giving him advance notice of the then Head of Governmentâs imminent overthrow.
It was for this reason that Putin neither intervened as a supporter of the system, nor backed the wrong horse, as he had done in Ukraine, even though PresidentÂ Akayev sought refuge in Moscow after he was toppled from power, and was in fact smuggled out of the country in a rolled-up carpet.
Stable and non-corrupt democracies can only be good news for Russia.
What lessons should the EU learn from all of this?
The first is that we must support democratisation in this area, and the second is that we should ensure that democracy is strengthened and civil society supported, particularly in Kazakhstan, so that financial assistance does not fall into the wrong hands.
Kazakhstan is much larger, richer and a great deal more important in geopolitical terms than Kyrgyzstan, which, although scenic, is only a small country.
Â Â  As has already become apparent from this debate, there are two trends that can be observed in Kyrgyzstan, and indeed throughout Central Asia.
The first of these is a deterioration in the political situation and an erosion of human rights and civil liberties.
The second is the growing strategic importance of the area as a whole, a far from negligible cause of which is the energy resources located in countries such as Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
As I only have one minute to speak, I should like to focus briefly on two areas where assistance should be provided by the European Union.
There can be no question that the first of these is support for human rights, civil liberties, the electoral process in Kyrgyzstan and civil society.
The second area, and one that has not attracted so much attention in this House, is support for regional cooperation, or in other words for the Central Asian states in their fight against terrorism and drug smuggling, and in energy cooperation and water resource use, for example.
Both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan possess energy resources, and there are considerable water resources in Kyrgyzstan.
To put it another way, I should like to know in what way the Commission believes that it and the European Union can support this regional cooperation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as we must also discuss the resolution before us, and since I believe that no one has done so up to now, it would seem to me that the resolution is realistic and objective.
I am pleased that it has been endorsed by nearly all of the political groups; that demonstrates the unity of the European Parliament and increases its credibility.
First and foremost, however, Europeâs decision to turn its attention to Kyrgyzstan is to be welcomed since, the European Union has been absent for far too long, as MrÂ Brok has just pointed out, and it has a certain share of responsibility for having tolerated the Akayev regime and other similar regimes in the area.
It is also true that, when we met with Askar Akayev in Bishkek two years ago with the European Union delegation, he appeared sincere and convincing in asserting that his objective was a more democratic and transparent State.
We perhaps believed him back then, but that is certainly no longer the case.
The resolution refers to the fragile situation in Kyrgyzstan and that is only right since, unlike the Ukraine and Georgia â as MrsÂ Stenzel has pointed out â the final outcome has by no means been achieved.
At this moment in time, there is a dangerous power vacuum.
A further issue pointed out in the resolution concerns the in-fighting within the opposition that would currently appear to hold power, united solely in its fight against the Akayev regime, whilst its democratic credentials are tainted by its former collaboration with the Akayev dictatorship.
For this reason, point 4 of the resolution is extremely significant, as by hoping for a substantial reform of the constitution, it warns against the dangers of a system of power taking over that is similar to its forerunner, differing only by way of the political figures involved.
This danger exists; for many years the United States has provided financial and moral support for the democratic forces in Kyrgyzstan, and we must also begin to do the same.
Â Â  Mr President, the changes the NIS region has undergone during the past year indicate that the post-Soviet systems are facing a crisis and they have not met the expectations as far as economic, political and social reform are concerned.
The most conspicuous example of this in Central Asia is Kyrgyzstan.
Unfortunately, we are obliged to observe that some leaders have drawn the wrong conclusions from the colourful revolutions again, and instead of trying to mend their mistakes made apparent by the events, they have barricaded the possible roads leading out of crisis for themselves, their countries and their people.
We were sad to learn that the Kyrgyz developments forced the leader of neighbouring Kazakhstan to introduce certain rigorous measures.
It seems that motions for a resolution amending the electoral process and the work of the media are leading in the wrong direction and that the draft bill on national security has been criticised by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at an open forum.
This is especially regrettable, as the international community has gladly acknowledged Kazakhstanâs progress in social and economic restructuring and in ensuring peace and harmony between different nationalities and denominations so far.
We were filled with hope to see Kazakhstan be the first country from the NIS region to deserve the honourable and responsible appointment of Presidency.
This is, perhaps, what makes it even more regrettable that the opposition paper, , has been shut down for a bogus reason, and the potential opposition candidate, Zharmakhan Tuyakbai, has suffered brutal physical attacks twice within less than a month.
The fact that the police have done absolutely nothing while dozens of young musclemen have carried out assaults cannot be accidental.
We can only hope that the Head of State has serious intentions to find and punish the perpetrators.
Democracy means honest competition between political opponents and such attacks are incompatible with it.
We must declare that an authority is always responsible to provide the conditions for equal opportunities and honest means in political battles in its own country.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would first of all like to correct a mistake that I made with regard to the date of the elections in Kyrgyzstan.
MrÂ Maat has said that these elections are scheduled for 10Â July.
This information was provided on 6Â May; please therefore accept my apologies for this error.
I would also like to thank the honourable Members who spoke for all the analyses they put forward, which were very useful and completely appropriate to the importance of the region.
The geopolitical and geostrategic importance of this region for the European Union has been clearly expressed; this means that the European Union must have a greater presence in the region.
We all have an interest in seeing greater stability in this region, which first of all means that the aspirations of these countries to consolidate their fairly recent independence must be supported.
I think that, in this context, the European Union can play an important part in maintaining the necessary balance between Russia, on the one hand, and the United States, and possibly China, on the other.
As several speakers have stressed, stability is all the more vital because these States are still internally fragile and are consequently particularly prone to the threats of terrorism and fundamentalism.
We therefore need to work with these States so that they can evolve into democracies where human rights are respected to a greater extent and where the democratic system becomes stronger.
This will only be possible if we help these States to promote economic growth.
These countries are very diverse; the economic situation in a country like Kyrgyzstan is very different from that in a country like Kazakhstan, which could potentially be one of the richer States.
In this regard, too, the European Union can play an extremely important role.
We have had cooperation agreements with these countries since the 1990s and, within the framework of those cooperation agreements, we regularly hold meetings both with regard to the cooperation that we are in the process of building and with regard to a form of political dialogue.
The message that also came out in your resolution, which I welcome, is that the European Union has a very important political role.
We can play this role in close cooperation, in particular concerning issues to do with human rights and democratic transition, with the OSCE.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to thank all the honourable Members for their contributions to this debate, by means of their speeches, with a view to identifying the most accurate possible view, shared by all of the Unionâs institutions, of the real situation, of the challenges and of the strategies and instruments available to us in order to bring freedom, a guarantee of human rights and a democratic process to the countries of Central Asia.
For that, of course, will not only be crucial in terms of the aspirations of the citizens of that region; the stability, prosperity and democratisation of the States of that region will also undoubtedly be a very important element of our own security.
Firstly, the elections of 10 July are very important.
It is vital that those elections take place in an atmosphere of tranquillity, with the guarantee that the will of the citizens casting their votes will be respected.
From that point of view, as I said in my initial speech, which many of you agree with, intervention by the OSCE is crucial, and the Commission believes that the role it must play in terms of the good conduct of those elections must be coordinated with the leading role played by the OSCE.
In any event â as I also mentioned in my initial speech â the mechanisms available to us have been used and EUR 1.3 million has been allocated to ensuring that the electoral process takes place properly.
It would also be desirable, if there is not yet any decision in this regard, for a delegation from this Parliament to attend those elections as observers and to provide a guarantee, or try to improve the conditions, for the popular elections to be carried out with every democratic safeguard.
I would also like to make a second comment on the need for a regional strategy, a regional approach.
Many of you have mentioned this and the Commission agrees and, since 2002, there has been a strategy drawn up following the visit of the former Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs adopted at the end of 2002.
Its main objectives are to promote stability and security in the region, sustainable economic development, prioritising in particular the reduction of poverty and the defence of human rights.
In implementing that strategy, given that one of the European Union's main interests in the region, from an economic point of view, involves energy resources, the meeting of energy ministers that took place in November last year is very important, and we believe that we must continue to progress in that direction.
Next June, the and the foreign ministers of that region will hold another important meeting to assess the situation and to continue moving forward with the implementation of that strategy.
Anything, therefore, that means making progress on shaping the elements of our strategy, of a common regional approach for the region, with all its dimensions of democratisation, combating poverty, defence, guaranteeing our economic interests, the protection of human rights, will have the support of the Commission, of course, and all the contents of this Parliament's resolution will be welcome in this regard.
Finally, with regard to the particular case mentioned by Mr Maat in his speech â the case of violation of human rights â we do not currently have precise information about the case he has referred to.
I would ask Mr Maat â although I know he is not present in the Chamber at the moment â to let us know so that our representatives in the area can gather all the necessary information, which we will then make available to this Parliament.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions(1) to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Amendment 54, which is part of Block 1, provides for the insertion into Annex 5 of additional tables, to be considered supplemental to table 22 in the Councilâs common position: not alternative, but supplemental!
I have made this clarification because as it stands it is not clear, and so that it can be placed on record that it is an agreed position.
Â Â  Your comments will be recorded in the Minutes, and the language services will be asked to carry out detailed examinations of the various language versions and their contents.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to table an oral amendment.
I am calling for two adjectives, âpublic and privateâ to be added to the term âsecurityâ in order to further extend this fitting safeguard to employees in the private security sector, who are often penalised and inadequately protected at trade union level.
Â Â  Your Royal Highnesses: It is a great honour for me, as President of the European Parliament, to receive here today the Head of the State currently holding the Presidency of the European Union.
, on behalf of my fellow Members and on my own behalf, I welcome you most warmly.
Your presence here in our House is evidence of your interest in European integration and the important role being played by your country in this process.
Your visit has an historical link to the visit of your father, Grand Duke Jean, on 22 November 1990, almost fifteen years ago now.
The European Union then had twelve Member States and the European Union had 340 million citizens.
Today we have more than doubled, 25 countries and 455 million Europeans.
These figures demonstrate how long a road we have travelled, and during this time we have managed to reunify a continent and share the same values.
Your country, Luxembourg, has always been a loyal and committed advocate of European integration, and your Presidency has demonstrated once again that the so-called âsmallâ countries, small in size but great in history, are able to hold great presidencies and provide additional for Community integration, thanks to the work of intelligent politicians who have made themselves constantly available to this Parliament.
Looking back to the past, we must remember that the name of your country, Luxembourg, is associated with important moments in European history, such as the Luxembourg Compromise of 1966, which managed to bring France back to the Community table.
This is a magnificent moment in the history of Europe and it carries the name of your country.
And today, with three quarters of your mandate complete, the Luxembourg Presidency has already been a great success, and I am sure this will become even more the case over the rest of your Presidency.
your countryâs government has achieved an agreement on the Stability Pact during its Presidency of the Union, respecting its fundamental principles; it has redirected the Lisbon Strategy and we have just signed the Accession Treaties with Romania and Bulgaria in Luxembourg, although there is no hiding the fact that the most difficult issue, that of the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, has yet to be concluded.
Let us have faith in the efforts of the Luxembourg Presidency to conclude it well.
,since you were proclaimed Grand Duke in October 2000, you have always expressed your concern for all the inhabitants of your country, in particular by ensuring the proper integration of the different nationalities living there and preventing any form of social exclusion, and we know that you are joined in this task by your wife, the Grand Duchess MarÃ­a Teresa, and it is our honour to receive her here today as well.
Together you are perpetuating the links uniting your family with your people and continuing along the path opened up by your father, reconciling tradition and modernity.
That is perhaps the best summary of what Luxembourg represents today: the best combination of tradition and modernity that human beings have ever been able to create.
, you have the floor.
Â Â  On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you, , for your words, which have demonstrated your profound knowledge of our political integration, in which your country has been a privileged player and witness.
Your words have also served to encourage the work of all the days celebrated by this Institution, and it only remains for me to wish you and your wife a happy stay in Strasbourg during the rest of your visit with us.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, firstly because all of the rules in force ensuring that the Member States will duly be taking part in this process were complied with, and secondly because Parliament has made a favourable assessment of the approved candidate.
Â Â  We are opposed to the common agricultural policy as it stands and object to changes that, in terms of principle, are of trifling significance within the prevailing system.
We demand a comprehensive review and overhaul of the common agricultural policy in its entirety, hence the difficulty of removing individual areas such as the subject that is now to be voted on.
Our view is that the quota system for potato starch, which is now to be voted on, should definitely not be extended.
Instead, the EU must abolish quota systems of all kinds within agriculture.
Â Â  . Today Parliament adopted the common position on the proposal for a directive tabled by the Commission in 2002.
A great deal of water has passed under the bridge in that time, and a number of aspects not contained in the original proposal have now been introduced.
In the current version, a number of situations â salaried and liberal professions, temporary provision of services and the so-called âregulatedâ professions, such as doctors, nurses and architects â are covered, albeit from different perspectives.
There is also a series of amendments aimed at defining the role of the professional associations dealing with the recognition of qualifications and at setting up a single committee for this purpose.
The amendments also advocate that the professions should be represented in the new body, and that an individual professional card should be introduced containing information on the personâs career development.
Â Â  We support structures and rules that prevent discrimination in the labour market against people from other countries.
We are sincere supporters of a flexible and open internal market in the EU.
We believe, however, that individual Member States should judge which professional qualifications are to be mutually recognised.
Unfortunately, the directive takes insufficient account of national needs and basic conditions.
Education systems vary from one Member State to another, and, in practical terms, it is thus difficult mutually to recognise all professional qualifications.
We support the amendment recommending that the directive should not apply to notaries exercising official authority.
Â Â  . This directive does not, as yet, provide a satisfactory solution to a problem that exists with regard to German professional qualifications.
Following amendments to German legislation, the directive will mean that the German qualifications of journeyman (ââ) and master craftsman (ââ) will be placed in the same category, even though master craftsmen are required to complete a demanding additional training course that lasts many years.
It would still be possible to add the qualification of master craftsman to a higher-ranking category, however, by including it in Annex II of the directive.
We have voted in favour of the compromise in the hope that the âCommittee on the Recognition of Professional Qualificationsâ, which will be responsible for such matters according to Article 58 of the directive, will comply with this request before the deadline for transposition.
Â Â  . The recognition of professional qualifications within the EU would constitute real progress if it did not form part of a wider strategy aiming to eliminate national borders, which are seen as nothing more than barriers to the free movement of goods and persons.
Nomadism has now been given the status of a Community virtue, making geographical and professional mobility the be-all and end-all for the New European.
The system for recognising qualifications will have to adapt to changes that may occur in the world of work or in education systems, in accordance with the ultraliberal philosophy that drives the European institutions.
In this spirit, the Commission has defined a very peculiar social policy which encourages the training and mobility of workers under minimal training conditions that are supposed to ensure greater adaptability to labour markets.
On the other hand, the regulatory and professional bodies have expressed a number of concerns regarding the future of certain occupations and the quality of training given in some countries, in particular with regard to public health.
Finally, the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is the consequence of the directive on the liberalisation of services.
That is to say, the Bolkestein directive is topical now more than ever!
Â Â  . We need a directive on the recognition of professional qualifications in order to guarantee the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services in the single market without discrimination concerning the level of professional qualifications.
This principle is not disputed.
We must avoid mixing it up with the infamous âBolkesteinâ proposal for a directive, the aim of which is to create a true single market in services and which we will discuss here in the coming months to amend it where necessary.
With regard to the amendments submitted to us in the context of the draft recommendation for second reading, I share the concerns of the craftsmen in my country, who are worried that the professional qualifications required for establishment will be devalued, which is incompatible with the Lisbon Strategy and the importance of training stressed therein.
The legitimate concern to create a true functioning single market must not lead to levelling down.
It is in the interests of both companies and consumers to provide qualified services and products.
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments that, quite rightly, aim to strengthen the legal security of people involved in business activity.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this report, because it proposes to improve the running of producer organisations by introducing a crisis management system and by promoting fruit and vegetables, and local varieties thereof, given that eating fruit and vegetables makes a positive contribution to public health.
I agree with the rapporteur that we must foster the setting up of producer organisations in regions where such activity is very low, as in the case of Portugal.
I also wish to highlight the importance attached to assuring the producer organisations legal certainty and to simplifying their control procedures, with the establishment of uniform criteria for the implementation of the checks conducted on the operational programmes by the various national and Community authorities.
We also welcome âthe introduction of an effective system for managing market crises in order to prevent abandonment of the sector in the face of major price collapsesâ.
As for its practical implementation and the âsafety fundâ mentioned in the report, this should be made up entirely of Community funds, given that this would be the fairest way of resolving the situation.
Â Â  The report is aimed at simplifying the EUâs organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables.
It retains the common agricultural policyâs existing structures, however.
We cannot, therefore, support the report.
Â Â  . It is well known that agriculture is of major importance to Portugal.
In this context, my country should seek to protect an area that is beyond the interests of one specific professional class; it is of interest to the nation as a whole.
In this context, I voted in favour of this report, because I feel that this proposal meets the expectations of the producer organisations, and because I advocate a suitable model for the support scheme for processed products.
Â Â  â I voted against the removal of the opt-out possibility so that an individual worker may work more than eight hours overtime a week because of practical reasons according to the needs of the workers and the Maltese industry.
On this there is a consensus between all social partners in our country.
I am in favour that we limit working time and that a better balance be created between working time and the family.
However you have to understand that in our country there exists no renting market, while land is scarce and very expensive.
Each family nucleus, especially young people, borrow thousands of pounds so that they may have a place where to live.
They commit themselves for a long number of years where they pay huge sums of money, and a large part of all their income including overtime, to pay the apartment or house where they live.
A great number of these families are in a situation where it is not because they want to, but because the market so dictates, where they depend in a substantial way on the income derived from their overtime not for capricious spending but to satisfy these commitments.
The most vulnerable families are those with a low income.
If we limit their overtime we would not be helping them but we would be further nailing them to a cross.
And who is going to give them the money they need?
The European Union?
The Labour Party had warned about this problem and we are here to try and solve it.
I am much afraid though that the road is uphill.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to explain why I did not vote in accordance with the party line on most of the amendments to the Cercas report.
The reason was that, after taking into account informal meetings with the largest trade unions in my country, it emerged that, at present, Malta is not in an economic position to be able to implement the directive on working time.
As explained by my colleague who has just addressed this House, the lower-income social classes would be unable to honour their commitments unless their incomes were supplemented through overtime and other allowances.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I asked a representative sample of the 20Â million senior citizens from Italy, a large number of whom voted for me to be here as a Member of the European Parliament to represent them, how I should vote on the reduction in working time.
The sample replied: âSome people want to make us work all our lives, every year of our working lives, plus as many months, weeks, days and hours in the day as are possible and imaginable, and as if that were not enough, they also want us to collect our pensions for as few years and months as possible, and to collect the minimum amount possible.
The only thing we can hope for is at least to be able to work as little as possible during the working day.â
I have therefore voted in favour of the Cercas report and of the amendments reducing working time.
Â Â  . I voted against the report on the Working Time Directive because individual workers should lose their right to opt out of the maximum 48 hour working week.
This proposal is an intolerable interference with personal freedom of choice and liberty and typifies Brussels' mindset of wishing to dictate every facet of our socio-economic life.
Unfortunately, the amendment to preserve the opt-out clause was defeated and thus the rest of Europe is lining up to foist upon us a Working Time Directive which is largely unsupported within the United Kingdom.
This is one of the insufferable burdens of EU membership and a salutary warning against the increasing Brussels' control which the new Constitution would bring upon us, given the socio-economic dogma which it contains in Part III.
Â Â  . UKIP MEPs voted AGAINST Amendment 37 because the Working Time Directive is already operating and will continue.
We therefore aim to mitigate its worst aspects.
Currently it is possible to opt-out of the 48-hour week by way of either an individual, or a group, signing an agreement with the employer.
The European Commission wishes to retain the opt-outs, the CERCAS report eliminates them.
Amendment 37 was listed as, âProposal to reject the Commission proposalâ.
By voting against this amendment UKIP was seeking to restore the commission position, hence retaining opt-outs.
Â Â  . At a time when the Constitutional Treaty requires the left to fight for a âyesâ vote, I believe that the amendments that the Cercas report has been able to impose on the Working Time Directive constitute a victory, given how strong the pressure from the right has been.
However, this victory cannot disguise the social backward step that remains in the text voted on today.
In particular:
1) the opt-out will stay in place for three years
2) the annualisation of working time will no longer be negotiated by the social partners.
This is therefore a backward step in a vital area, that of monitoring flexibility.
3) although periods of ânon-productivityâÂ âÂ for example, being on callÂ âÂ are still accounted for in the working time, exceptions could make it possible to calculate them specifically.
The Constitutional Treaty aims to introduce more social dialogue, but the current directive reduces it.
In addition, this directive affects one of the fundamental achievements of the battles of the last century: the reduction in working time, and the regulation of the working day.
That is why, while welcoming the efforts of MrÂ Cercas and of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to push back the ultraliberalism with which the directive is stamped, I have abstained.
Â Â  . I fully support the CERCAS report as a meaningful step towards a 48-hour working week in all 25 member states, from 2010.
It will eliminate the current opt-out, and introduce strict new conditions on how âon callâ time can be counted towards the 48-hour week.
Working time will still be calculated over a 4 month period, with exemptions available to calculate over 12-months â subject to stronger control through collective bargaining.
Proper regulation of working time is a cornerstone for social Europe.
It reconciles work and family life and addresses an important health and safety issue.
It is totally wrong that an opt-out is available on health and safety law, and important that it is ended as soon as possible.
The greatest risk is that this opt-out is extended to all Member States which would render regulation of Working Time redundant, resulting in a race to the bottom.
The implementation date of 2010 gives both sides of industry time to negotiate new agreements that take account of the 48-hour week.
The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) fully supports the Report as offering a fair deal to workers across the EU.
Â Â  . I abstained during the vote on the Cercas report on the revision of the Working Time Directive.
The approved compromise text cannot be considered as progress for social Europe.
We will need to remain very vigilant about holding onto social achievements.
Firstly, the directiveâs guiding principle is flexibility, not workersâ health and safety.
Secondly, even if the opt-out which allows Member States to deviate from the working time provisions will lapse in time (three years), this does not prevent Member States, at their request, from having working time stipulated on the basis of individual contracts and thus from by-passing social guarantees of negotiated agreements for three years.
Thirdly, the possibility of annualising working time also by means of legislation is the undoing of an exclusive right for social consultation.
Although Parliament describes stand-by time (on-call duty) as working time, the inactive part of stand-by time can be calculated in a âspecific wayâ (via a collective agreement or statutory arrangement), without there being guarantees for the workers involved.
Moreover, the division between active and inactive stand-by time is also threatening to extend to other sectors.
Â Â  .
We welcome the fact that Parliament has not adopted a large number of the proposals contained in the Commissionâs position on the new directive on working time. This is one of the most dangerous aspects of the attacks on workersâ rights and jeopardises the gains made in a struggle that has lasted over 100 years, affecting millions of workers and their families.
We welcome the scrapping of the opt-out, three years after a new directive, to which we contributed, was adopted.
We are very disappointed that a classification of inactive time has been accepted, and that the rulings of the Court of Justice are to be disregarded.
This gives rise to the possibility of the work place being subject to still further deregulation, leading to even greater difficulty in reconciling working life and family life and in protecting workersâ health and safety.
There is also the possibility of working hours being annualised.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  We believe, fully on grounds of principle, that the EU should not make decisions concerning the Member Statesâ working times.
That is an issue for the parliaments and both sides of industry in each Member State to decide about.
We have chosen to support those amendments that open the way for increased national self-determination, but are voting against the resolution as a whole.
Â Â  . In principle I do agree with the majority of views and arguments expressed in this report.
However in Malta many workers work long hours because they need to do so either to make financial ends meet or to fulfil other commitments.
In certain areas the Directive is inflexible and would have adverse repercussions on our small Island economy and to all its stakeholders.
The implementation of this report could damage our attempts to try to retain and possible create jobs without eroding the social model.
Workers choice and competitiveness, on the one hand, and the effective delivery of public health care and safety on the other, are both vital for the wellbeing of the Maltese people and it is not possible to trade one of against the other.
Its crucial for Malta therefore, to retain the individual's right to choose to opt out.
This position enjoys broad consensus in Malta, including the trade unions.
A wide spectrum of our population do not see the report as being beneficial for Malta.
For these reasons I feel therefore, that is not yet opportune for me to vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  . My own region â the East of England â suffers the longest working hours in the U.K., with one-in-ten of people in transport working over 60 hours per week; the same numbers of machine operatives working more than 56 hours per week, of skilled tradespeople more than 53 hours per week; and of construction and storage workers more than 50 hours per week.
Just as it was right to bring in the minimum wage to combat the problem of poverty pay, it is now time to call time on excessive working hours, which see workers bullied and exploited, fuel stress and other health problems, and which damage family life.
That is why I fully support the end, with necessary safeguards, to the British opt-out from EU Working Time rules.
Â Â  . The Cercas report, which the MEPs have approved despite numerous gaps, calls for the deletion of the âopt-outâ clause that the Commission proposed to keep.
This clause, allowing certain Member States to push the legal working week beyond 48 hours, worsened social dumping in Europe.
In a Europe without borders, French companies bound to the 35-hour week will not be able to compete with their competitors based in European countries that make use of the opt-out clause.
However, we do not have any illusions.
Adoption of MrÂ Cercasâs report is just a first step.
At first reading today, the European Parliament has forced back the European Commission because many MEPs are afraid of the French electorate expressing their displeasure on 29Â May.
Â Â  . I voted for AmendmentÂ 37 calling for the rejection of this draft directive, which retains the negative points of the previous legislation such as the opt-out and begins the process of dismantling the working time rules.
The rapporteur, MrÂ Cercas, however, is attempting to demonstrate the European Parliamentâs intention to secure abandonment of the opt-out, a real poison for the future of European social law, within three years.
I think we need to support him in this aim.
Nevertheless, I cannot accept that, in return, he is allowing the 48-hour maximum to be calculated over a 12-month period and is allowing working time to be calculated and annualised as employers have demanded, as well as reducing the extent to which time on call is taken into account.
This compromise is not satisfactory and is in no way a step forward as we have the right to expect in the European Union.
It even includes some backward steps.
We are in the early stages of the legislative procedure, and a vote in favour of the Cercas report is nothing more than support for the approach taken towards abandoning the opt-out.
Nonetheless, at the end of the codecision stage, I will not approve a working text based on 48 hours.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs proposal to amend the Working Time Directive is, in practical terms, detrimental to millions of workers in Europe.
The opt-out remains in place, although it is proven that it leads to longer working weeks and affects workersâ health; it should be repealed as soon as possible, preferably in 2008, and I support MrÂ Cercasâ compromise to that end.
We regarded the extension of the reference period from four months to a year, with peaks of 65-hour weeks, as a feudal 19th century phenomenon, and that is why we must hold onto the four-month reference period.
Finally, the ruling by the European Court of Justice in respect of on-call duty must be adhered to.
The Commission is accommodating the wish of companies to become more flexible in a unilateral manner.
The maximum 48-hour working week as we know it is, in fact, already archaic.
The current working week is around 40 hours, with the large majority of workers wanting an even shorter working week.
That is why I would argue in favour of a European Working Times Standard to further redistribute the work and better reconcile work, family, care and education.
Â Â  . I believe that we must amend the 1993 working time directive so that it may better fulfil the realities of todayâs world.
It will, however, have to ensure a high level of health and safety protection for workers, offer businesses greater flexibility in how they manage working time, and allow greater reconciliation of work and family life.
That sounds as though we want to put a square peg in a round hole.
I feel that our contribution should allow the reference periods to be lengthened.
I am in favour of annualisation, which can also affect workers and which will enable us to accommodate fluctuations in demand, particularly seasonal fluctuations.
With regard to on-call time, I could have lived with the Commissionâs proposal respecting the subsidiarity principle, because it stipulates that the inactive part of on-call time is not considered working time, unless national law or a collective convention insists otherwise.
Finally, I believe that keeping the opt-out is at odds with the aim of the directive.
Â Â  Working time is something that lends itself to national legislation and that the EU should not regulate.
There is, however, now already a directive at EU level that regulates working time, and the present directive is designed to update the existing directive.
The Liberal Party has therefore voted in favour of ensuring that individual rules in the working time directive are as constructive as possible.
We have defended the principle of subsidiarity and a flexible labour market in which employeesâ health is simultaneously protected.
Unfortunately, a host of detailed regulation, which we believe may damage small enterprises in Europe, was voted through.
We therefore voted against the proposal as a whole.
Â Â  . Further to the adoption of Amendment 10, the Dutch delegation of the Peopleâs Party for Freedom and Democracy thought it wise to vote against the amended Commission proposal on the organisation of working time.
According to the VVD delegation, the fact that Europe prescribes that the total on-call duty, including stand-by and rest times, should be considered working time, is an example of interference from Brussels which will only lose Europe even more support, at the very time when it needs even more of it.
Â Â  . I congratulate my colleague Mr Cercas on his excellent report.
He has struck an admirable compromise between the needs of a flexible labour market and the protection of individual workers from the damage long hours can do to their health and safety and work-life balance.
Annualisation of the 48 hour week will allow businesses to cope with seasonal fluctuations, sudden increases in demand or crisis situations.
The employee will be guaranteed reasonable hours over the whole of the year.
Ending the individual opt-out will give protection to those workers who under the present Directive face pressure to sign away their rights.
Â Â  . The solutions we applied successfully in the past are no longer enough to overcome the problems we are currently experiencing in the shape of rising unemployment and a shaky economy.
The âstandardâ employment relationship is becoming less and less the norm, and the society in which we live is becoming ever more flexible. This fact is reflected in new ways of organising working time, such as part-time work or working time accounts.
Anyone who wishes to progress up the career ladder has no choice but to be flexible.
At the same time, however, we are also faced with the problem of decreasing birth rates in Europe, and it would be a disastrous mistake to attempt to reverse this trend by means of immigration.
Work-family balance will play an ever more crucial role in this respect.
Parents are often pushed to their limits by the task of reconciling work and family duties.
Flexitime will only benefit businesses and families if we make the necessary changes to support structures such as childcare facilities, in order to ensure that allowance is made for such changes.
If it is the case that some fathers and mothers of young children have to stop working, then Europe may well already have missed the boat.
Â Â  . Today the European Parliamentary Labour Party voted in favour of a compromise package on working time proposed by the PES the EPP groups in the European Parliament.
It will now be put to the governments in the EU Council for consideration.
It is in line with our vote in 2004 and supports the principle at the heart of this directive, the health and safety of workers and the aim to reconcile work and family life and increase productivity.
The EPLP understands the adjustment difficulties faced by the United Kingdom and others, but thanks to certain flexible provisions in the report, such as the extended reference period of 12 months, these difficulties are overcome.
We recognise that on call time is the same as working time, as ruled by the ECJ in the SIMAP and JAEGER cases.
These landmark rulings have implications for the NHS and member states' health care systems, but by allowing member states themselves to calculate this part of working time, the compromise package we have achieved is sufficiently flexible.
The EPLP hopes a positive vote at the first stage of the process will ensure the adoption of a report on working time that safeguards workers' health and safety, makes work-life balance a reality whilst containing the requisite degree of flexibility.
Â Â  . The fact that there was a clear discrepancy between the majority vote in the committee responsible for employment-related matters and the committee responsible for industry-related matters is, in itself, symptomatic of the imbalance to be found in the version put to the vote and in many of the amendments put forward.
I personally have confidence in a model that, first and foremost, upholds the subsidiarity principle, giving the Member States sufficient leeway to adapt the rules on working time to their own economic situation.
The priority is to be able to adapt to each countryâs economic reality and specific needs, in all circumstances, provided that core values are adhered to, because this is one of the main guiding principles of national legislation, and is certainly true in Portugalâs case.
In any event, excessive rigidity in any regulation in this area is damaging to the economy, to industry and to the service industry, and consequently affects both workers and people seeking work.
Â Â  . In the Working Time Report and every work related report, I look to see if the largest work force in Europe, home carers are included.
They aren't.
This is particularly sad because a document that deals with the amount of hours someone works in a week applies to them more than any other group of workers in the EU.
We could and should have looked at issues like âon call timeâ in relation to home carers.
This is more than a missed opportunity.
It is discrimination and exclusion of people who work long, long hours, people who are always on call.
Can we resolve that we will examine the situation of carers and that we will include them in our recommendations on work in future, and that we will no longer discriminate against this important workforce which is already discriminated in the area of pay.
Â Â  .Â Â My position on this issue is inspired by the belief that weekly working time, a key aspect of social and economic life in EU Member States, should not be regulated at European level.
Working time comes under the heading of employment law, which is adopted in every democratic country by a parliament that represents all parties involved in the employment process.
This provides a sufficient guarantee that employeesâ and employersâ rights will be respected.
Todayâs vote is a black day for European entrepreneurship and prosperity.
The âyesâ votes cast by the Left and the Liberals meant that the proposal to tighten up the Working Time Directive was adopted by the House.
The latter will now become one of the most damaging pieces of European legislation, as it amounts to nothing less than a decision to transfer the problems experienced by the French and German economies to all the other countries. This includes those countries opposed to such measures, such as Poland, Great Britain and Ireland.
Doctors, nurses and some journalists will be hit hardest by restrictions on weekly working time and the inclusion of on-call time in working time, and the end result will be that the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole will be reduced even further.
In this instance, Parliamentâs attempts at justification through references to the Lisbon Strategy are the height of hypocrisy.
Â Â  .â The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the 'organisation of working time' directive, because it is a vengeful attack by the EU, the urban governments and big business on the rights of the working class.
The aim of the proposals by the Commission and the rapporteur is to undermine working time by introducing two new terms â active on-call time and inactive on-call time â and more flexible working time in order to increase the profits of big business.
The time referred to as inactive on-call time does not count as working time, despite the fact that the employee is at the employer's disposal.
