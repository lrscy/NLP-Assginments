I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 May 2003.
I have a number of announcements which I would like to make to the House
As regards the calendar of part-sessions for next year, I have received from the Conference of Presidents a proposal to hold an eleventh part-session from Monday 3 May to Thursday 6 May 2004.
The deadline for tabling amendments to this proposal is tomorrow, Tuesday, at 4.00 p.m.
The vote is scheduled for Wednesday at 12 noon.
Mr President, I know you are respecting Parliament's wishes concerning the number of part-sessions and our votes at previous plenary sessions on where they should be held, but could you confirm where we are going to have the meeting on 1 May 2004?
A number of political groups and parties within this Parliament will decide how they vote on the eleventh plenary and its siting.
Their vote will determine whether we meet in Brussels or in Strasbourg on that particular day.
There is a precedent for us to meet in Brussels because the part-session on Saturday, 2 May 1998, when Parliament gave its verdict on the Ecofin decision on which Member States should join the euro, was held in Brussels.
I regret that I am not in a position to give you a clear answer, because the current position of the Conference of Presidents is that there is no plan to hold a meeting on 1 May.
I regard the absence of this event to be most unfortunate, but that is the current position.
There is currently no proposal before us regarding a meeting on that date.
Mr President, I would just like to ask you to check whether, for legal reasons, a fully valid part-session is possible at all after 1 May, as the new Treaty of Nice stipulates 732 as the fixed number of Members.
However, as far as I am aware, there are 788 of us.
I would be interested to know how the qualified majority is meant to be worked out if there is a part-session in May.
I would ask that it be checked whether this proposal is at all legal.
Thank you.
The point which you raise is perfectly correct.
In the discussions in the Conference of Presidents it was agreed that since we will then be in an election period it would be appropriate to deal with political rather than legislative matters.
If we were to deal with legislative matters then the question you raise would be unavoidable.
The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday 28 May 2003 has been distributed.
The following changes have been proposed:
Wednesday
As regards the oral questions to the Council and the Commission on a transatlantic partnership tabled on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I propose to extend the deadlines as follows:
motions for resolutions: 12 noon on Thursday 12 June
amendments and joint motions for resolutions: 12 noon on Tuesday 17 June.
The proposal is thus have the debate this time, and the vote at the next part session.
Mr President, the matter I raised on Wednesday's agenda is linked to the Council's non-participation in the debate on the Nigerian elections, at which the Commission will be represented.
We cannot understand why, when the Council is represented in the Chamber, it will not participate in a debate during which it just so happens that the Chairman of the Delegation of Observers, Mr Van den Berg, who was proposed for that appointment by the Council, is going to report.
It is surprising that Council should not want to make a statement about such an important matter, even more so since it is represented in the Chamber.
I ask you to repeat Parliament's request that the Council participate in this debate.
I am happy to repeat the request, and should like to inform the House that to the best of my knowledge the Council will indeed be present.
Under current indications, it does not intend to participate in this debate.
I shall reiterate the request made in the Conference of Presidents which you have repeated here today.
Mr President, I wish to raise another matter, although I leave it to your wise judgement as to whether, if it gains majority support in this House, it should be dealt with on Wednesday or during the short sitting on Thursday.
I refer to the need for information from the Commission concerning the events surrounding Eurostat.
These cases of fraud - which I will describe as matters of suspicion - have not yet been considered by the Members of this House, although they are receiving blanket coverage in Europe's media.
Our group requests that we should have a communication from the Commission, on the basis of which we could discuss the Eurostat problem, either on Wednesday, or during the short sitting on Thursday.
Mr President, I understand that the Group of the Party of European Socialists' proposal has been accepted, which is to say that the Commission will participate in both debates, on the Middle East as well as on the illegal small arms trade.
Is now the moment to talk about the point Mr Poettering has raised, or will he submit it later?
It seems to me that the most appropriate way to deal with this would be to take it as a proposal to the Conference of Presidents this week, to see what the groups wish to do, and then to choose to invite the relevant institutions to be here.
Mr President, I think it would be appropriate for the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control to participate, since it is essential to respect the work of this House's committees.
When preparing the Conference of Presidents for this week, could the groups please consult the Committee on Budgetary Control and see whether there is a consensus to move forward with regard to Mr Poettering's suggestion.
Mr President, as you are aware, on 14 June the Convention will conclude its work, on 20 June there will be a Summit in Thessaloniki and we, most appropriately, will be holding a mini part-session in the week between the two events, on 18 and 19 June to be precise.
My group therefore felt it was important that we should hold a preliminary debate on the outcome of the Convention, maybe inviting the Chairman, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, to be present.
I would stress what Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said, namely that this does not mean there would be any less need for a more in-depth analysis after the Thessaloniki Summit, carried out according to whatever procedure Parliament decides to follow.
Given the public nature of the Convention's work, I believe it would be politically appropriate to discuss it in this House, even if we are not the first to do so, publicly and transparently at least, and, if possible, in the presence of the Chairman, but even without the Chairman if he is not available.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having considered this matter, our group supports this proposal.
We would very much have appreciated it if the resolution of the Conference of Presidents, which was - as I recall it - unanimous, could have been acted on this week, and if the Chairman of the Convention could have visited Parliament this week.
I do not know why this has not been done.
The reasons for this remain to be clarified, but I would very much welcome it if the Chairman of the Convention were to join us for our short sitting.
Mr President, I thank you for proposing that we deal with the Eurostat affair next Thursday, as well as the flax case, which is also under discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and is attracting public attention.
In relation to Mrs Frassoni's point, I think that, since the members of my political family are in Amsterdam and will be continuing their work in Brussels, we could consult them to gain a fuller knowledge of the facts, and then discuss the issue at Thursday's Conference of Presidents, when we could also repeat our request to the Convention President.
I feel that we should debate this on Thursday rather than take a decision at this precise moment.
Mr President, I know that a number of Members of the House had wished to have a discussion with the Convention President in advance of Thessaloniki but he clearly is not going to come, so I support Mr BarÃ³n Crespo's suggestion that you put this item on the agenda of the Conference of Presidents on Thursday.
Mr President, I would like Mr BarÃ³n Crespo to clarify for us the relationship between the flax case, which is being tried in Spain, and the Eurostat affair.
It is akin to my asking us to debate the result of the Madrid city council elections now.
There were winners and losers in those elections, but, to be quite honest, I can see no connection between the two points.
Please reply, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, and then we will move from this Spanish tennis match back to our European agenda.
I would like to thank Mr Galeote for his desire for information.
Council elections in a country are one thing; financial irregularities affecting the Community budget, which have given rise to reports in this House and related legal actions, are quite another, Mr Galeote.
I believe that this does indeed fall within the competence of the European Parliament and that you, who are as concerned as I am for there to be no financial irregularities affecting the Community budget, will also support this proposal.
Furthermore, you will support the involvement of the Committee on Budgetary Control and of Parliament in this matter.
I should like to avoid being drawn into domestic affairs.
In the light of all current indications, it is improbable that the President of the Convention will be available to appear before any body of the European Parliament before the work of the Convention is complete.
Indeed, he has pointed out, as we well know, that the Convention is now entering its own critical moment of definition.
He is determined to focus all his attention on that exercise.
We have the option of discussing this at the Conference of Presidents, or, under the Rules, you may press for a vote on it now.
Mr President, quite frankly, I believe it is the European Parliament's duty to be the first to hold a public debate on this subject.
Politics, I regret to say, has its idiosyncrasies, and so I do not feel it would be very wise to put this proposal to the vote now, for it would certainly be rejected.
We will therefore wait for all the various exceedingly important decisions to be taken within the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and then we will see whether we shall be able to convince the Socialists to launch the debate, with or without the Chairman, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing.
I would stress that it is not so much a question of deciding our position on the Convention as carrying out an initial assessment of the outcome of the Convention as soon as its work is finished and before the governments can do so.
I feel that this is the very least we can do politically, not least for the sake of public opinion.
Mr President, let me just reiterate the point that, as I recall it, the Conference of Presidents resolved unanimously - something it very rarely does - to ask the Chairman of the Convention to join us for this part-session.
I do not know whether an official summons or invitation was issued, or whether it was declined.
That may well be the case, but I would like clarification - which we are not going to get right now - as to whether, if the Conference of Presidents' resolution was unanimous, that resolution was implemented as regards our procedure, and I would be obliged if we could be given more precise information on the subject on Thursday morning.
Mr President, both Mr Watson's and your own comments would lead one to assume that somehow an invitation was conveyed to Mr Giscard d'Estaing and that he indicated he would not come.
Can we not invite him?
I know Members would wish to discuss the issue, even if not to decide on it.
For yourself and the leader of a political group to invite him and for him to turn you down would imply that somehow he is refusing to come before this House.
This is a serious matter.
I can only offer you the facts.
He is not here and he is detained doing the work that he is meant to do: chairing the Convention.
These are the facts of the matter and I do not want to make any interpretations as regards his willingness to engage with us.
I suggest that we put this item on the agenda for Thursday's Conference of Presidents meeting.
We should take note of it from today and then try to make a recommendation, hopefully on a consensual basis, on how to proceed on Wednesday 18 June or Thursday 19 June in Brussels.
The order of business was thus established.
Mr President, as Chairman of the College of Quaestors, I have been asked to help arrange transport to Parliament tomorrow for assistants coming from Brussels.
I would be grateful if colleagues whose assistants are experiencing difficulties in their travel arrangements and, indeed, colleagues in the same predicament, could contact my office as soon as possible.
A train leaves Brussels at 7.20 a.m., and we are considering the possibility of arranging transport from Luxembourg, where the train arrives at 10.00 a.m.
Could I ask colleagues who have problems with this to contact me in my office here as soon as possible.
For colleagues who are not aware of it, there is yet another general strike in France tomorrow, so the trains will not be able to get here.
I presume the planes will not be able to get here either.
Mr President, I should like to ask your help once more regarding a very human problem: the problem of the Roma refugees from Kosovo.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international organisations admit that these refugees cannot go back to their home country.
They are also being deported from Germany and Belgium.
My question is as follows: around 600 refugees in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have been turned out of a reception centre.
They made their way to the Greek border and requested political asylum, but received rough treatment at the hands of riot police.
Could you use your authority to contact not only those international organisations, but also the Commission, to confirm that these refugees cannot return to Kosovo?
They also have problems in connection with their property in Kosovo and with asserting ownership of that property.
The Roma are human beings belonging to the European Community, but are repeatedly being reminded in an inhuman manner that they are second-class citizens.
Can we not use your authority to do something about this?
I should be grateful to you for your intervention.
I will take up the matter, Mrs Maes.
Thank you for raising it.
Mr President, we made a decision earlier that we would have an urgency on Zimbabwe.
However, since this Parliament has taken an extremely principled view on this issue, it would be appropriate if you were to find the time to write to the Council to urge it to make a strong statement on the situation, which is in danger of escalating this week into a final showdown between the democratic movements in Zimbabwe and the regime led by Mugabe.
There is enormous mass action going on, there has been tear-gassing of people, at least one person has been killed.
Morgan Tsvangirai has been arrested as has his deputy Welshman Ncube.
I would ask you, Mr President, to express regret that the Council made a statement very early this morning, which was extremely weak.
Certainly, it was not unequivocal in any sense in the way that it dealt with the situation in Zimbabwe.
We need strong action and since the G8 is meeting and President Mbeki is there, we need to see our representatives in the G8 urging Mr Mbeki and other African leaders to distance themselves from the kind of actions we are seeing in Zimbabwe at this time.
Mr President, I endorse the remarks that have just been made.
When you write to the Council perhaps you could also point out how hopelessly ineffective the Council's own sanctions have been in respect of Zimbabwe and how they need to be toughened up.
I would like to say a word about the situation in Cyprus.
For a long time many of us who have wanted reconciliation in Cyprus with due regard to the interests and concerns of both communities have called for some serious confidence-building measures on the part of the international community in relation to Turkish northern Cyprus.
In particular, measures need to be taken to lift the wholly unfair international embargo on the north, which has been imposed for so long and which has been directly responsible for holding back economic development.
I wish tentatively to welcome proposals which are anticipated from the Commission to provide a goodwill package of economic assistance, along with measures apparently to lift the embargo.
I trust these measures are being made on a genuine basis and that they have been worked out in full concertation with the Turkish Cypriot authorities.
Furthermore, I hope that the easing of travel restrictions by the Turkish Cypriot authorities between the two parts of Cyprus will be reciprocated by the Government of the Republic to enable the free movement of all people coming from the north.
Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to a case of blatant discrimination that is about to take place in the county of Northamptonshire, which I and my colleague, Mr Helmer, represent.
The Labour-controlled county council has decided in its wisdom to cut the number of free school bus passes it gives out.
However, instead of doing this fairly and across the board, it has vindictively decided to target denominational and single-sex schools.
This Labour council conducted a listening consultation exercise with parents across the county and, out of over 1 120 replies, only 17 concurred with their plans.
At this point, 119 parents complained that they felt this policy amounted to either religious or sexual discrimination.
Many of these parents have now decided to petition this Parliament.
Mr President, through you, I ask that the Committee on Petitions investigate these complaints as soon as possible, as I am sure that no one in this House would like to see such discrimination tolerated.
Mr President, following on from the comment made by my honourable friend on Cyprus, I should like to say that we must not forget that the northern part of Cyprus has been under Turkish occupation as a result of the invasion in 1974.
Now to my point: just as official spokesmen are admitting that Iraq's famous weapons of mass destruction were no more than the pretext for the invasion, new threats to world peace are emanating from the metropolis of imperialism.
The United States Congress has in fact given its approval for research into so-called mini nuclear weapons and for new nuclear weapons that penetrate the ground, causing ten times as much damage.
This development comes just 18 months after the Nuclear Post Review calling for ways to be found so that nuclear weapons can be used within the framework of the new American preventive strike strategy.
At the same time, Mr Bush himself is making headlines on the continuing campaign against Cuba, with his well publicised message on 20 May, while the United States of America are jamming the country's radio and television network in order to broadcast their cheap propaganda.
As I condemn the foregoing, I wonder what those who directly or indirectly supported and support imperialist aggression have to say.
I also wonder to what extent those who called American agents in Cuba human rights activists will articulate even one word in protest against the new escalation of aggression against the island of the revolution.
Mr President, on a point of order, I hope I may be forgiven for raising two relatively domestic matters.
Firstly, when I arrived I found my office was furnace-like in its heat: this is not the first time this has happened, but it is particularly acute today.
It is really not appropriate to ask MEPs or their assistants to work in these conditions.
The air conditioning system does not appear to be working properly.
We set standards all the time which we expect other people to live up to, but the standards in these premises are not adequate.
It is not fair to ask our colleagues and employees to work in conditions like that.
Could we not get something done to improve it?
Secondly, I cannot be the only one who is increasingly distressed by the amount of often off-colour or even obscene unsolicited email that keeps pouring through the system.
Again, it adds an awful lot of work to colleagues who have to delete it every day.
I hope we can get something done to make the email system work as it is intended to do - for effective communication and not for that sort of fearful junk!
Regarding the issues of offices and heating, and spam on e-mail, let us revert to you and other Members.
Both matters are worth examining.
Mr President, on Wednesday 21 May 2003, I was sent as a European Parliament delegate to the United Nations in New York to speak at the Permanent Forum of indigenous peoples from all over the world, which meets once a year in the UN headquarters.
I did, of course, convey the greetings of the European Parliament, and I emphasised the consideration we have given over the past three years to all the indigenous and aboriginal races of the United States of America, Canada, South America, Africa, Oceania and so forth, and all the representatives of the world's indigenous peoples asked me to inform the European Parliament that they are waiting for us to speak out resolutely to support them and to provide practical aid to promote respect for their human rights.
Above all, however, they are waiting for Europe to make its voice heard so that it is not just the United Nations which takes any notice of them, for we all know that the Europe of yesterday was responsible for situations which are causing them to suffer today.
I hope that you, Mr President, will listen to me personally when I pass on to you the requests made by these peoples to the European Parliament.
Mr President, during the European Union-Russia Summit in St. Petersburg, we faced a cornucopia of totally unacceptable statements from the Council, but even more so from the Commission.
At this summit, indeed, Mr Prodi drowned the Chechen question in vodka and caviar.
These positions are fundamentally opposed to those of the European Parliament.
I am astonished (I address these remarks to chairmen of groups, and of course also to you, Mr President) that the question of a report by President Prodi and the Council on Chechnya, and on European Union-Russian relations in general, is not on the agenda either for this part-session or for the Brussels mini-session.
Mr President, I would like to point out that the Andalusian fisherman AgustÃ­n GarcÃ­a has been held in prison in Faro by the Portuguese authorities since 8 May last.
I would like to point out that the means used to arrest him were entirely disproportionate and that he was subjected to excessive violence and poor treatment.
A simple offence was handled as if it were a terrorist act.
It should be noted that he has been held in preventive detention since then, among dangerous criminals.
Furthermore, he is unwell and has not received adequate medical treatment.
The imprisonment of Mr GarcÃ­a has already led to a general strike by the Andalusian fishing community and I believe that Portugal is trying to make an example of Mr GarcÃ­a, making a simple fisherman, who has only committed this one offence, carry the can for a lack of political will.
Mr President, I would ask you to intervene in order to solve this problem.
Perhaps you might be able to contribute to resolving this lamentable situation.
Mr President, there is one problem whose urgency is clear for millions of workers in the European Union: attacks on pensions.
This problem is not limited to the workers of France, who will be on strike and holding demonstrations tomorrow: it also concerns the workers of Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and everywhere in Europe, where governments are trying to raise the retirement age while reducing pensions.
Raising the retirement age means that people who have retained their jobs to the end will die in harness, and that people no longer wanted by their employers will finish their active lives on the dole.
What can the reason be for this retrograde step on the part of society?
Can the European Union have become such a poor and underdeveloped region that it cannot provide for the twilight years of those worn out by work?
I maintain that it is possible to provide proper pensions for all, if more taxes are imposed on employers.
I should like to pledge solidarity with all those, throughout the European Union, who refuse to favour capital and who do not agree that it should be possible to possess capital at the expense of salaried employees.
Mr President, I am pleased that Commissioner de Palacio is here, because this will perhaps be of interest to her.
I should like to draw attention to a series of serious accidents involving lorries that have occurred in Belgium on the E17, that is, the motorway from Antwerp to Lille, in recent weeks.
The cause is always those lorries using cruise control, which is a kind of autopilot enabling drivers to drive without keeping their feet on the pedals.
Careless lorry drivers are driving into traffic queues because their reactions are too slow.
The balance sheet for the last 7 weeks shows 6 dead and 13 seriously injured, indicating that this is very bad technology.
Problems and accidents involving cruise control can be seen all over Europe.
The relevant directive on technical regulations for heavy goods vehicles must be amended to contain a provision banning this.
Belgium wants to ban cruise control on its territory and should be given the chance to do so.
I think that the Commissioner should take the necessary steps.
Mr President, it is with great concern that I note - as do many of our fellow citizens - a decision taken by the US Congress, which makes the implementation of an aid package for Aids amounting to USD 15 billion in value conditional upon the willingness of the recipient countries in Africa to accept supplies of genetically-modified food.
Although this composite measure is not legally binding, it is clear to me that it puts African countries under a great deal of pressure.
This, in my view, amounts to a trade policy pursued at the expense of the poorest, and that is to be repudiated!
This decision by the US Congress has made that plain, and one wonders how much leverage the biotechnology and agriculture lobbies, with their business interests, are exerting on the American administration's humanitarian aid policy.
There is no doubt that recent decades have seen many millions of dollars poured into the development of genetically-modified seeds, and now, as I see it, every market is to be pressured into opening up to them.
Humanitarian aid can, however, be effective only if it does not play second fiddle to commercial interests, and so I would like to ask the Commission what it is contemplating doing about this, or what view it takes of such a development in this area.
Mr President, the rich and powerful of the world gathered in Evian in order to discuss international security, development and economic stability.
Basically, they want to coordinate in the face of the crisis plaguing the capitalist system and leading to huge unemployment, poverty and exclusion.
They want to consolidate their authority and take further measures to concentrate the wealth of the planet in their hands in any way they can, even with the fear of fanaticism and terrorism which they have created.
The eight are concerned not for the poor and how they live, but with how to stop them rising up against them, against miserable exploitation and injustice, which is why they also took harsher repressive measures, preventing thousands of protestors from coming to express their opposition to the globalisation of capital and their predatory exploitation.
The Presidency and the Commission must make a statement to the House both on the content of the discussions in which they participated and on the repressive measures taken against the protestors, the same and perhaps worse measures that are also being taken for the European Council in Thessaloniki.
Mr President, I believe it is my duty to draw attention to the fact that, only today, 12 African migrants have disappeared, and must surely have died, while they were trying to reach the Spanish coast close to Africa, looking for work.
Once again, I think that the European Union will have to take the necessary political steps, doing everything possible to avoid such frequent, terrible disasters.
Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the situation in Guinea-Bissau, which is extremely serious and has been dragging on for some months.
The parliament was dissolved last year; the elections scheduled for April have now been postponed until July, and it is expected that they will be delayed further.
The situation is extremely delicate and sensitive: the country is experiencing a general crisis - economic, financial, social, political and even military.
That is why we placed Guinea-Bissau on this week's agenda.
I would like to express my regret at the discourtesy of certain groups, who proposed that Guinea-Bissau be replaced on the agenda by Zimbabwe without communicating any of this to us; I received this surprise in my office just after I arrived from Brussels.
For that reason, I was unable to take the floor just now.
I understand the feelings of some of my fellow Members on Zimbabwe.
We have always shown our solidarity with those fellow Members over this problem, which is very serious and which we have already discussed four or five times in Parliament.
It is important for us to remember, however, that Zimbabwe is not the only country with problems: other countries have them too, and we must find time to discuss them.
We will reschedule this important debate for July; I would appreciate the understanding of my fellow Members.
I am certain that a gesture by Parliament will be timely and effective in this very sensitive case of Guinea-Bissau.
Mr President, respect for human rights has proven to be the most effective mechanism for democracy anywhere.
This formula asks for an improvement of the actual implementation of the rule of law, meaning respect for such fundamental freedoms as political association and peaceful assembly, the independence of the judiciary, the right to a fair trial and the exclusion of all forms of torture and ill-treatment.
This must apply everywhere, the Basque country included.
Now, in a telegraphic manner, I shall put forward some other recent outstanding events concerning human rights in the Basque country, in addition to those you mentioned, Mr President:


Last Wednesday, 28 May 2003, the suicide of a young Basque in a French prison; the case of JesÃºs MarÃ­a EtxebarrÃ­a, who has already lost 20 kg and is in the 41st day of his hunger strike; the refusal of several Basque prisoners to use the toilets for almost two months in order to attract the public's attention to their situation - Mr President, you will remember Bobby Sands and his colleagues; the arrest and imprisonment of the Mayor of Ondarrua, Loren Arkotxa, and other elected representatives of Udalbiltza; the Amnesty International report 2003, which refers to the period from January to December 2002, during which Spain kept prisoners incommunicado, a situation which facilitates torture; resolutions of the Bilbao and San Sebastian Lawyers' Associations, denouncing ill treatment in police headquarters; and the banning of 225 local lists of candidates for the municipal elections.



Apparently, it makes no sense in this House to mention the outlawing of Batasuna.
Mr President, I do not know whether Mr Gorostiaga has something to do with this and is also trying to restrict my freedom of speech.
I am very happy that Mr Gorostiaga is concerned about the right to freedom of speech and assembly and I hope that from now on he will also be concerned about the representatives of my party and the Socialist Party assassinated by a terrorist group supported by his political group, which thank God is now defunct.
I am sure, therefore, that from now on he will also defend the rights of my political party and the Socialist Party to assembly and freedom of speech.
It is incredible that you are able to speak in this House following the assassination of two members of the national police force, carried out by the terrorist group that you are unable to condemn.
I am able to condemn and regret all the deaths that have occurred, including the deaths of the prisoners, whose rights I recognise, except for the right to restrict our freedom of speech and assassinate us in such a despicable manner.
Mr President, I would like to remind the House that elections should have taken place very recently in Northern Ireland and regrettably, unlike in Scotland and the Welsh Assembly, those elections did not go ahead.
I would like this House to urge the participants to please come together and hold those elections as soon as feasible.
Nature abhors a vacuum and while, hopefully, we will not go back to condemning killings and burying the dead on the island of Ireland, undoubtedly street events will occur with increasing frequency if we do not hold elections.
We are all agreed that the way forward is through the democratic process.
I hope we can see those elections held very soon.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are nearing the end of a long journey, an odyssey that has, from time to time, seen us wandering far afield and sometimes finding ourselves in choppy waters.
The attempt has been made to persuade us that this statute was about nothing more than reforming the reimbursement of travel costs, that it was about money and nothing else.
A statute dealing only with money, with its reimbursement, and with costs, is not, though, the sort of statute that the European Parliament needs at the present time.
We were told that primary legislation would run aground on the cliffs of the Council, and that our ideas on tax law would drag us down to the depths of the ocean.
Now, if I may pick out these as examples, I think that we have good arguments on our side.
The two problems that remain to be resolved are taxes and primary law, and - as far as taxes are concerned - the Council thinks it can leave it to each individual Member State to decide whether or not it wants to levy an additional national tax.
It so happens that, in 2000, the three legal services - those of Parliament, the Council, and the Commission - met to discuss this issue.
The minutes of their deliberations record their conclusion that they could find no justification for a derogation for a Member State, and then they continue in the following terms:
So what the Council is now proposing to us is precisely what the three legal services unanimously ruled out.
It is obvious that we cannot go along with this!
There is a similar situation as regards primary law.
Why is it that this House is in this difficult position?
It is because, in 1976, when the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage was introduced, the Council fought shy of harmonising the general conditions applicable to the exercise of the mandate.
It found that too much of a hot potato.
That is why the European Parliament retained the structure of a parliamentary assembly even after it started to be directly elected, a structure it retains to this day.
The object of this statute is to break down this parliamentary assembly-style structure and for us to become a real Parliament.
That is what the Statute is for!
The fundamental issue is of whether this European Community is a real community or an international organisation.
If it were merely an international organisation, then the Council would indeed have the prerogative as regards Members' privileges and immunities.
The question as to whether or not we should now regulate MEPs' privileges and immunities boils down to the question of whether this European Community is a community or an international organisation, of whether we are a parliamentary assembly or a parliament worthy of the name.
That is what it is about!
(Applause)
The rules we have now date back to 1965, when the Protocol was introduced.
In that year, Charles de Gaulle beat Mitterrand to win the French presidential elections, and it was in that year that the first contraceptive pill was put on the market.
(Laughter)
And now the Council - it is apparently the Council, although I am unsure, as it used to be only the Permanent Representatives who dealt with these matters - is trying to tell us that it is these rules by which Parliament should continue to be governed in the future, almost a quarter of a century after it was first directly elected.
If we do not get to grips with this issue now, then when is it going to be dealt with?
After all, it is not as if the Council thought that the system of privileges and immunities had to be reformed.
It expressly confirmed that only last year, when the uniform right to vote was introduced.
It is clear that the Council sees this as a long-term solution, and of course Parliament cannot accept that.
As I have said, the Council has not previously given this issue its serious consideration.
The governments are showing themselves to be something less than interested in it.
That is why it is no bad idea to say that the Statute should enter into force at the same time as the European Union's new constitution.
We would then have a guarantee that both the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference would do intensive and serious work on this topic, and also that the issues of taxation and of primary law would be discussed at intergovernmental level in an appropriate way.
If we now dispense with these rules - which we do not want to come into effect, something they can of course do only after those provisions in the Protocol that are contrary to them have been suspended - then we will remain, for an unforeseeable period of time, in the Council's Babylonian captivity.
That is what this Statute is about!
I am very grateful to the Bureau for coming up with rules on the reimbursement of costs, general expenses, the daily subsistence allowance, and the lump sum for staff.
That was very helpful and a step in the right direction.
I am very grateful to you, Mr President, generally, for having taken more trouble over this Statute than any previous President.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the PPE-DE Group's Mr Lehne,
(Applause)
who, with his criticisms, his solidarity, and his reliability, has been with this project every step of the way.
Many thanks for that, and many thanks to you all!
(Applause)
.
(ES) Mr President, I shall be very brief.
I would like to say that this is a complex issue.
Clearly we are talking about an issue which has not changed since 1965, despite the spectacular progress which has been made in the institutional elements of European integration and particularly with regard to the capacities and duties of Parliament, such as its means of election.
Nevertheless, we have been unable to adapt the Statute for Members of the European Parliament to today's circumstances.
As a former Member of this and other parliaments, I understand the importance and the implications of the Statute for Members and of the report presented to us today by Mr Rothley.
I would like to congratulate him on his work and, on behalf of the Commission, wish him the best possible results.
We hope that tomorrow there will be a concrete response so that we can vote on this matter.
Our objective is to cooperate actively so that, ultimately, we achieve an agreement that might be accepted by the Council, because otherwise we all know that it will serve little purpose.
We hope to be able to achieve this agreement once and for all.
Mr President, I am deputising for the draftsman, Mr Wynn, who has unfortunately been delayed.
If the Statute for Members is to be implemented, an agreement as to the rules applicable between Parliament and the Council is not enough. What is also required, of course, is for the budgetary authority to make the necessary financial resources available.
Those of us in the Committee on Budgets have therefore gone through the proposal for a new Statute and tried to analyse the budgetary consequences.
Unlike at present, the draft budget would mean future expenditure having to be taken out of the EU budget.
In view of this, we have now also created a budgetary structure for this purpose, a new Chapter l02 ('Reserve for the Statute for Members').
Parliament has until now kept its expenditure within the self-imposed ceiling of 20% of heading 5 ('Administrative expenditure') of the financial perspective.
We have also said, however, that, if more is required in order to cover expenditure related to the Statute, enlargement or other important objectives, we do not necessarily need to respect this 20% ceiling for ever.
It now remains for us to see how high the costs of enlargement, buildings policy etc. will be.
Until now, of course, the idea has been already to begin entering the appropriations for the Statute in the 2004 budget in order at least to cover expenditure for a second half-year.
That still applies inasmuch as the rapporteur's idea is not taken up of postponing adoption of the budget until we are able to accept the Constitution.
If the idea were, in fact, taken up, appropriations in the 2004 budget would not of course be appropriate.
All that has really caused us concern up until now is the point concerning everyone's right to direct interpretation which, strictly construed, could have entailed unreasonable costs.
I appreciate, however, that a compromise with the rapporteur is on the way, meaning that the proposal is now in accordance with the estimates for the European Parliament's budget.
The conclusion of the Committee on Budgets is therefore that the possible consequences of the aforementioned decision for the budget are compatible with the ceiling of heading 5 ('Administrative expenditure') of the financial perspective, without this needing to entail any restrictions on other contributions to the policy under heading 5.
Mr President, I would just like to start by expressing my gratitude to Mr Rothley, who has, with almost boundless patience, steered this tanker through the sandbanks ever since 1998, and has done so in a way that commands admiration.
I also think that, without him, this tanker would have ended up on the rocks more than once.
Mr Rothley, in his speech earlier on, addressed in a few words the important issues, some of them of a constitutional nature, that this statute raises.
I would like to say something about some rather more down-to-earth problems.
I also believe that the statute, as it has emerged, is a very balanced piece of work.
In the Committee on Legal Affairs, we were, essentially, guided by the instructions that we had been given by the experts and wise men that Parliament had mandated.
The fifty per cent of a judge's salary that is at issue here corresponds, more or less, to what an Austrian, French, German or British MEP currently receives, after health insurance and old age pension contributions have been taken into account.
It is less than what our Italian Members currently get, and so I would like to express my thanks to them for their understanding and for their willingness to accept a reduction in income, as it were on behalf of future Italian MEPs and in the interests of common European rules.
In addition, I would like to thank MEPs from the Greens, the European United Left and the Liberals, who have not, in this part-session, submitted any amendments aimed at reducing the 50% or resubmitted the amendments put to the Legal Affairs Committee, as I believe there to be no objective argument against what it has produced.
This has been unequivocally confirmed by the wise men, from whom we received clear guidance.
There is, however, one amendment tabled by a number of Members who basically want future MEPs' salaries to be based on those of their national counterparts.
I regard that amendment as nonsensical, to put it mildly.
The fact is that the whole point of the statute is to create equal conditions for this country's parliamentarians in accordance with Article 190 (5).
It follows that those who submit such amendments must, in order to be consistent, be opposed to the statute as a whole, in that they in fact seek to retain the legal status quo.
Let me turn now to the issues of primary law.
A number of Members have tabled amendments - Amendment No 28 is one example - aimed at adding to the Statute the old protocol on privileges and immunities.
That, though, makes no sense.
For example, Amendment No 28, which I have just mentioned, refers to MEPs' customs privileges, which, as we are living in an internal market, no longer exist.
That shows how old this law is.
This issue calls for new law.
I might add that it is also the case that the way is now at last clear for us to have transparent rights to indemnification.
This is something on which the Bureau will decide.
I will conclude with an appeal to the Council, which now has a real opportunity to ensure that we get a forward-looking Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
Putting it simply, it must act swiftly to approve what this House has decided, and it should not block a decision by using flimsy and superficial arguments on tax law that have all been conjured up from nowhere.
What I expect of the Council is that it should, as soon as possible - by which I mean before the elections - decide in favour of what Parliament demands.
Once we have taken our decision tomorrow, the next move will be for the Council.
(Applause)
Mr President, I am very happy to be here today to support the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, and I would like to join Mr Lehne in thanking Mr Rothley for his work.
As Mr Lehne has said, Mr Rothley's proposal is balanced and received the support of a broad majority of the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I believe it should be adopted in plenary.
A total of 36 amendments have been tabled in plenary.
Mr Lehne has referred to them.
There are not too many for a subject such as this, but the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided to support the rapporteur's direction as a whole, with some of the amendments which the rapporteur has also suggested to us in plenary today, so that we might remedy some of the flaws that were still present in the final version of the proposal.
As the rapporteur has said, the aim here is essentially to create a Statute that allows Members of the European Parliament to be recognised, not as an extension of the various national parliaments, but as representatives of the peoples of the European Union as a whole.
Mr Rothley said that the European Union is more than simply an international organisation and that, consequently, the Statute for Members of the European Parliament should be based within a Community framework rather than a national framework.
That is what we are currently addressing.
It is not a simple decision on remuneration.
Our current, somewhat flawed, system supplements the flaws in national legislation with Community legislation on allowances, which has been the subject of a great deal of criticism.
I believe that if we adopt the rapporteur's proposal, if the Commission also adopts it and, in particular, as Mr Lehne has said, if the Council adopts Parliament's proposal, we could soon have a Statute which would effectively allow Members of the European Parliament to be differentiated from members of national parliaments, with their own status, which would be appropriate for the kind of European Union that we are currently trying to create.
Mr President, I hope we do not have to come here again to talk about our employment conditions.
When I looked at the UK press over the weekend I could not recognise myself or indeed any of my colleagues in the lurid descriptions of our supposed lifestyles and endless perks.
Many journalists have telephoned me with the opening line 'Oh, so you are about to vote yourself a 25% pay rise.'
When I explain the whys and wherefores, they suddenly lose interest, it is not an interesting story any more.
Surely this is the point.
Our conditions of employment and our expenses should not be the story, they should be transparent, a matter of public record: proper recompense for a job well done and reimbursement for monies paid out in doing that.
Colleagues, I believe this is our last chance to reach the stage where we are no longer the story, but our work is.
We have a package before us that in most ways represents a compromise for all of us.
It is a package that should get through the Council if we are reasonable regarding items of primary law, but the Council too must compromise over tax.
Some Members of this House may be uncomfortable about the level of salary: for some it is too much, for some too little, but finally we seem to have a figure that we can all just about live with.
Then the expenses: again at last we seem, thanks to your work, Mr President, to have a proposed system that is much more transparent than hitherto.
For some it may not go far enough, but it is a vast improvement.
There will have to be some compromise and understanding on all sides.
What we will have finally established, the big prize, is a single statute for MEPs.
This is our last chance.
It was hard enough to get here, and the circumstances will not arise again.
We have a chance for interest in this House to focus on our work and not our pockets.
I hope sufficient numbers of us will have the courage to bend a little and vote for this package and the amendments by the ELDR and other groups.
Quite frankly, colleagues, although I pay absolute tribute to the work of our rapporteur, I do not want to listen to him in committee meetings on this subject for another five years.
His very considerable talents and our time could be much better employed on other legislative work which directly benefits all Europe's citizens.
It is now five years since Parliament embarked upon the negotiations concerning the Statute and, for some of my fellow MEPs, this is a significant political process that, at one and the same time, secures Parliament's power and legitimacy, with Parliament's right to adopt its own statute an expression of a federal, European democracy.
For others, however, it is a farce of almost surrealistic dimensions.
Behind the democratic principles of parliamentary self-determination, we in fact find another agenda, one as prosaic as MEPs' personal financial interests.
It is difficult to make democratic principles credible when the real agenda is MEPs' own money.
This Parliament has no impressive, democratic legitimacy to begin with.
The turnout in every single election has been low.
In a democracy as rich in tradition as Sweden's, turnout at the most recent election was less than 35%, and in the UK was less than 24%.
I can assure you that this shaky legitimacy would be further undermined through the adoption of the proposed Statute.
At least in the Nordic countries, people find it completely baffling that the Members of this Parliament are to be paid significantly more than national parliamentarians, especially when we are also safeguarding the possibility of maintaining or reintroducing the absurd expense systems which, in the Nordic countries, have been central subjects of criticism.
Certainly, the Praesidium decided last week that travel expenses would be reimbursed as per account rendered, but Article 29 states clearly that the current absurd systems can be reintroduced.
I would also observe that the issue of the national taxation of remuneration has now entered its final phase.
At least for the Nordic governments, that is a crucial issue.
The point is, of course, that national taxation would possibly be in conflict with EU law, and so the problem has not been solved.
Those of us in the Danish People's Movement are unable to cooperate.
Mr President, I only partly agree with Mr Krarup.
I agree with him in the sense that there is a democratic crisis.
This Parliament is in a crisis because we come under permanent attack by many of the public media in all the Member States for the indefensible state in which we are made to work at the moment.
We all know that people in this House doing exactly the same job are paid a huge range of different salaries for it.
There is only one thing which has made this tolerable. That has been an expenses regime which would otherwise be totally indefensible because it is absolutely untransparent.
We are greatly indebted to Mr Rothley for bringing us so far down the road.
We must take the step that will make it possible for this Parliament to stand tall and stand legitimate with a proper scheme on a common salary and a common, defensible and transparent expenses regime.
Putting it quite simply, I would like to see to it that we have a system that can be understood, that pays people the costs they incur and that pays us all a fair day's wage for a fair day's work.
It should be slightly smaller but it would just have been gesture politics to retable the amendment we put in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market since it was obviously not going to be carried.
I respectfully disagree with Mr Rothley on the issue of privileges and immunities.
I would like to see it in the Statute in something like the way he suggests, but frankly the provisions there strike me as much too sweeping, covering far too much.
Immunity in these Berlusconi days is a difficult concept and we should not challenge our electorate.
It is better to stick with the regime that we have, with the primary law that we currently have.
Most of the amendments that we, the liberals and others have put forward seek to keep that basis for immunities.
With these crucial amendments, the resolution can be carried.
Finally, with great respect to everybody here, I do not regard myself here as an employee of the European Union: I am a representative of my constituents.
I do not ever wish to pay tax on my income at a different level or on a different basis from my constituents.
The permissive Belgian compromise that would let Member States bring a Member's taxation liability to the level of his constituents is a good one.
I hope that we can find a way of making it legally valid.
Mr President, the debate on a Statute for Members has now been running for five years, since the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Before the European Parliament elections in 1999, Parliament and Council seemed unable to agree.
In a year's time the elections are coming around again.
Will there be unambiguous rules in place regarding the legal position of Members then?
I fear that that will possibly not be the case.
The Rothley report still contains elements which are controversial as far as the Council is concerned, but, even worse, there are amendments which would postpone entry into force until 2009.
Does the European Parliament really think that this is the way to seek the confidence of the electorate in May and June of next year?
The rapporteur has shown himself to be a tough negotiator over all these years.
Why is he putting the matter on the line, however, by describing not only the position regarding primary and secondary law, but also the privileges and immunities, because the latter constitute primary law.
It would be a good thing if a majority tomorrow supported the series of amendments by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and others to abolish these.
What is really important is that all Members receive equal remuneration.
As far as we are concerned, reimbursing travel costs on the basis of the costs actually incurred is even more important.
The latter is essential if we are to be able to face the electorate, and therefore we must do something about this quickly.
What do we see, however, but amendments proposing waiting for a new Treaty, or until 2009.
With all due respect, this does not make any sense.
25 years after the first direct elections, it is high time we cut the Gordian knot on this issue; it is high time we put the interests of Parliament's work above our personal interests.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all aware, the issue of the Members' Statute has been on Parliament's agenda for countless years now, and, like other Members, I am doubtful whether, despite tomorrow's vote, we will succeed in resolving the matter completely under your presidency, President Cox - which is not to say that I do not hope it will be possible.
We Radicals have consistently maintained - and continue to do so - that, with the Members' Statute, we need to look beyond the scope of Mr Rothley's report, to look beyond the administrative, bureaucratic status of European Union employees, to use Mr MacCormick's expression, and consider the rights of MEPs, first and foremost.
It is intolerable, for instance, that, after 25 years of direct election, MEPs should still be forced to bear the consequences of the decision on the location of Parliament's seat.
It is intolerable that they continue to be denied the same rights as national members of parliament, such as the right to visit prisons and other rights related to the electoral mandate to represent the European people.
I hope that, pending the outcome of the European Convention, the Rothley report will spur us on to launch a wider debate on the need for the MEPs of the 25-Member State Europe to be granted, in addition to administrative status, rights which make them genuine elected representatives of the European people.
Mr President, a Committee chairman can only feel great satisfaction at seeing colleagues congratulate each other, as Mr Rothley and Mr Lehne have done, on work carried out under his guidance.
I am genuinely pleased because we have been working on this project for years.
In actual fact, when I had the honour of taking on the chairmanship of the committee, I found areas of strong disagreement which it has only been possible to resolve through debate.
As you can see from the speeches, we have worked together harmoniously, never losing sight of two important things: on the one hand, our desire to support the constituent process which is to give shape to a Parliament, its rights, responsibilities and privileges, and, on the other, the fact that the provisions of the Treaty are antiquated and obsolete, as Mr Rothley explained clearly, dating from the sixties, when Parliament was just a consultative assembly.
Mr Rothley's draft, which we are about to adopt, seeks to lay down a new legal framework for the European Parliament and rules governing the exercising of its mandate.
I too want to stress that it really is a Statute for a genuine Parliament, which covers not just the financial side of things and, if I may be so bold as to mention it, remuneration, which were fairly minor issues on which the debate in committee had reached an impasse, but the structure and organisation of Parliament's function, role, characteristics and mandate as well.
I would like to be able to quote a major point of a report dating from 1986, which was tabled by Mr Georges DonnÃšs, a great liberal.
As far back as 15 years ago, this report stressed that the European Parliament was an institution destined to play a crucial role in the Community's activity and in the process of producing Community documents, and that there could therefore be no opposition to changes deemed to be necessary for the Community bodies.
Even then, it was clear that some bodies would have to undergo a process of change.
As regards the possibility of genuinely equal conditions of immunity for all the Members of Parliament, the author of the report wondered whether it would not be possible to define a position of genuine autonomy and immunity for Members of the European Parliament as such, for as long as the current distinction made in Article 10 of the Protocol - which we are now attempting to amend - was preserved.
It can be inferred from the report I have just mentioned that such equal treatment is necessary not just to avoid the negative psychological effects of there being first and second class MEPs, but also because it is the fulfilment, a good sixteen years later, of a dream, a plan: making the Parliamentary institutions independent of other powers through the protection of the individual Members.
This protection concerns our work and the image we want to give Europe of MEPs who, after many years, first and foremost after this Parliamentary term, through and under your presidency, are establishing a firm point of reference, which, not least, can only benefit enlargement by giving MEPs the effective role they should have.
Mr President, this report is all about bringing respect back to this House.
We should not forget that this is only the halfway stage, because when this report leaves here it has to be approved by the Council.
The principle behind this report is good: equal pay for equal work.
However, I have to ask whether we are all equal.
According to some of the amendments tabled, I do not think we are.
One of the amendments talks about the considerable economic differences which exist between the existing Member States and the accession countries.
Is it not the case that there are considerable economic differences even within the 15 Member States?
So when we set out the principle of equal pay for equal work, the 10 accession countries do not fit into that principle.
So we have got this wrong.
The big issue for me is the whole question of the expenses.
I congratulate the working group on coming up with a formula.
Transparency in expenses is essential.
We must stick to the principle of travel at cost.
That is an issue which is in our hands and we can approve it without going to the Council.
Let us not squander it and let us not waste it.
Mr President, our aim today is to remove all those rules that make our work ridiculous.
We must also appreciate the work done by our President to improve Parliament's reputation.
Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore appeal to you not now to permit the use of legal quibbles, hair-splitting and primary laws to prevent what in this case is most important, namely that everyone who votes in the European election in 2004 should do so with pride and that our work should be easy to understand and our rules transparent.
That is what is most important.
Even though we all believe there are details that are not quite perfect, we must adopt a global perspective and take the opportunity that now exists and that many previous speakers have said will not perhaps be there again.
A vessel runs aground if its crew has a false perception of the seabed.
I am afraid that many people have a wrong idea of what is possible.
We must use a proper map, a genuine maritime-style map.
The correct way forward in this case is to approve the liberals' and others' amendments.
That is the right course to follow.
Mr President, what this boils down to is that this Statute for Members of the European Parliament, with which we are dealing, is a never-ending story, and the way in which it has gone backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards, in this House for years on end, actually passes all understanding.
I cannot do other than agree with the rapporteur when he says that, politically speaking, the core issue is whether we are a parliamentary assembly or a Parliament.
If we consider how it is that the European Convention is discussing the Constitution, while we have for decades been unable to sort out the issue of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, then the public will have every right to ask just what is actually going on here.
It has often been my experience that the public are quite amazed by the differing salaries paid to MEPs for their work, and, above all, by how large the differences are.
I am certainly in favour of this one House, by way of a Members' Statute, adhering to the principle of 'equal pay for equal work'.
It goes without saying that I also expect the Council to take up this issue and very speedily take the decisions that will enable the Members' Statute to enter into force with the minimum of delay.
I wish to associate myself with those speakers who have made reference to the issue of reimbursement.
The fact that, in future, it will be our actual travel costs that are reimbursed is something that I see as being a core issue in terms of the credibility of the work done by this House and by us ourselves.
I want briefly to discuss Article 20 of the Statute, which deals with old-age pensions.
Our group has very lively discussions around this issue, as we, of course, cannot do other than note that discussions are going on in many Member States about raising the retirement age, and by a substantial margin.
This goes hand in hand with an attack on social security systems.
The proposal for the Statute, however, provides for us to have a retirement age of 60, which is low indeed.
I believe this to be a contradiction, and one that we will be unable to explain to the public, and I see the application of differing standards to the pensionable ages of Members of this House and members of the public as amounting to privileged treatment.
Mr President, this report is not about drafting the most ideal version of the Statute for Members.
It is now about taking the negotiations with the Council a step further, and I am starting to despair of this.
The Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, said that spectacular progress had been made in other fields, but that that was not the case here.
In my opinion, that is very true.
Why was the Belgian Government's compromise involving a supplementary national tax rejected?
Why do the major groups persist in wanting to regulate the new immunity and rules in this Statute?
Why must the language regime, too, come up for discussion in this Statute?
This contamination makes the negotiations too difficult.
Objections of principle are all very well, Mr Rothley, but an acceptable agreement is even better; not only for the sake of principle, that is to say, a European rule for Members of the European Parliament, but also in order to put an end to the current questionable expenses practice.
Last week, the Bureau adopted a new rule which will enter into force when the Statute does.
My group grades the present rule an emphatic 'unsatisfactory', but gives the new one a good seven out of ten.
It is true that we find the tiredness surcharges absurd and regrettable, but we welcome the fact that travel costs would be reimbursed only on the basis of the costs actually incurred.
That is a considerable step forward.
If an agreement on the Statute is rendered impossible, we are back to square one as regards the travel costs, too.
That cannot be the intention ... can it?
I do not wish to intervene in the debate, but when that issue of the time allowance was discussed at great length in a working party, the idea was first commended to the working party by the Eminent Persons' Report to this House in June 2000.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see this debate and the resolution as being about self-respect.
This Parliament has been directly elected for twenty-four years.
In a year's time, these direct elections to Europe's citizens' chamber will involve the citizens of twenty-five Member States of the European Union.
In a few weeks' time, the Convention on the Future of Europe will be presenting a draft treaty for a European Constitution, and the next Intergovernmental Conference will be getting underway.
There are important roles to be played by parties - including European parties - by the European Parliament as the only EU institution directly elected by the European public, by the citizens' representatives, all of which are an important part of the European project.
To this day, nevertheless, there is no Statute for European Political Parties; despite that fact, there is to this day no Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
The time for them has come; indeed, the resolution is overdue, and I tell you that today's debate is important, because it is not only the Council that needs to do its homework on many issues - we do too, transparently, determinedly, comprehensibly, and in full awareness of our responsibilities, and, if the game of ping-pong is to be brought to an end, then it has to be spelled out that we decided that seven hundred MEPs were sufficient; it was the Council, in Nice, who arbitrarily increased our number.
We are enacting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament on the basis of a report produced by outside experts.

So far, the Council has not made the choice as to whether to go for a uniform European Statute or twenty-five differing assessments of the same work, and so, to put it briefly, our development from a parliamentary assembly into a European Parliament has not yet been completed.
The public nature of this debate also means that we have to openly address the point that no member of a national parliament - exceptions prove the rule - travels as much as we do.
No national parliament has more democratic freedoms than we do.
No national parliament is as consistent as we are in increasing the amount of work it does.
Although nobody can say that he does not need to improve, to become more efficient and more professional, most of us in this House do good work, work that has a value of its own and requires framework conditions specific to itself.
In the coming weeks, the new European order will come into being.
This will also involve a new role for the European Parliament and the revaluation of its freely elected members.
All these things justify a transparent and uniform statute for the Members of the European Parliament.
There is nothing to be said in favour of deficient self-confidence or of populist self-laceration, nor indeed of superciliousness or arrogance.
It is important and right that the fundamental issue that Mr Rothley and I have raised should be decided rather than continuing to be postponed.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us, with all the representatives of the Member States, not be afraid of making decisions or of the decisions that may be taken.
Mr President, it seems that this time we are genuinely making progress and we are going to take an important step in solving one of the most flagrant anomalies that characterise the functioning of this House, by achieving something as simple as each and every Member being subject to the same system.
It goes without saying that the text proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, whom I congratulate most sincerely, is a balanced text and naturally we are going to give it our full support.
This fact, however, does not prevent me from making a few comments.
In my country we say that military justice is to justice in general what military music is to music.
There are times when I think that this Parliament is to a parliament what military music is to music.
Tell me, ladies and gentlemen, if in any parliament of any Member State you are subject to the rules to which we are subject in this Parliament or whether it would be acceptable for any parliament to be subject to the degree of control and monitoring - for example in areas as important as drawing up its own rules - to which we are subject with the intervention of the Council.
This, therefore, is not acceptable.
I understand that there is cause for debate here, such as the subject of tax, and I believe we could debate this within this House.
What I would like, however, is for the result of this debate to be the final decision, rather than, regardless of what we decide here, always having to be subject to the will of a body, the Council, which, ultimately, is only partially legislative, and to the will of the governments of the Member States.
Mr President, the starting point of this debate is incredibly simple.
It is that the terms and conditions of Members of this House are not satisfactory, either from a Member's or from the public's point of view.
Not only should MEPs receive a fair day's wage for a fair day's work, we should be taxed on the same basis as those who send us here.
As a number of speakers have already said, we are not civil servants - we represent the citizens of the four corners of the European Union, here at its centre.
The arrangements put in place should be appropriately drawn up and transparent, and the expenses regime which is back-to-back with them should not be disguised remuneration, and in particular travel should be reimbursed on a cost basis.
Although politically, expenses and remuneration are two sides of the same coin, their legal bases are distinct.
We must not be pompous, hypocritical or self-serving about this.
For obvious overriding political reasons the Council and Parliament must reach a political agreement about the two together.
If either steps back from this it is breaking faith with the electorate and is culpable of wrecking the process.
As a Member, I am sick and tired of cheap jokes about the 'gravy train': let us recall that the basic salary we, the UK Members, receive is, so I am told, about the same as that of a decent-sized supermarket manager in a provincial town.
Such jibes degrade Parliament as an institution and the European Union as a political process.
Quite simply, I say, let us stop the talk and sort it out, because if we do not, we demean ourselves and degrade the process of which we are part.
As far as the contents of the Rothley report are concerned, we British Conservatives have deep reservations about some of them.
The only way to break this impasse is to vote for the report as a whole, to take the process a step forward.
We shall continue to work for a final outcome which will meet with our stated policy requirements.
The immediate priority is to stop talking incessantly about the Statute and take some steps to do something about creating it.
Mr President, the new rule the Bureau adopted last week stipulates that only travel costs actually incurred will be reimbursed.
That is good news, and is also largely thanks to you.
There is a fly in the ointment, however.
The new rules will only enter into force when the Statute does.
The chance of that ever happening is very small.
The draft Statute provides for a common salary for all MEPs, but the proposal also stipulates that MEPs will pay European income tax from now on.
That is unacceptable to many Members, myself included.
I live in the Netherlands, I was elected by Dutch people, I use Dutch public services, and I therefore wish to pay Dutch taxes.
Two years ago, there was a consensus on that point between the Council and Parliament.
Member States would be given the freedom to supplement European taxes with national taxation.
The rapporteur has swept that compromise off the table, however.
Thus, the proposal does not stand a ghost of a chance, and everyone in this Chamber knows that.
Last week's decision by the Bureau will not enter into force, therefore, and we will be back to square one.
At a time in which budgets are under pressure and citizens are having to tighten their belts, we are opting to live it up, with outdated expenses rules.
Although it may have been naÃ¯ve of me to think that it would indeed be possible and that the political will existed, I sincerely hoped that within my own group, of all groups, a majority would opt in favour of the public interest and against self-interest.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
Mr President, it is important for the European Parliament to obtain a Statute governing MEPs' conditions.
It is also important for us to obtain a system that is transparent and that our electorate can scrutinise.
What, above all, have been stumbling blocks for us, as Swedish Social Democrats, are the cut-and-dried travel allowances, the salary level, the Community tax and the lack of transparency.
We have set down a number of absolute requirements as conditions of our supporting a new Statute for Members: firstly, that we can continue to pay tax in Sweden; secondly, that there be reformed travel allowance systems based upon actual expenses; and, thirdly, that we obtain a system that is open, that can be monitored and that our electorate can scrutinise.
The proposal now before us contains a great deal of what we wished for, but it departs from what we want on one crucial point, namely when it comes to the possibility of paying national tax.
In the vote, we shall support an amendment aimed precisely at retaining the right to pay national tax.
If this proposal is rejected, we shall unfortunately be forced to vote against the whole proposal.
Mr President, on behalf of the French socialist delegation, I offer our full support for the draft Statute for Members proposed in Mr Rothley's report.
The success of the enlargement process renders the adoption of this report even more urgent.
We approve of the approach taken in it and its underlying principles, above all those of openness and equal pay.
The transparency of the system through which Members are paid must be increased: citizens are far from unconcerned about this issue.
They demand answers from us.
We should, moreover, apply the principle of equal pay for all Members as rigorously as possible.
In order to put this principle into practice intelligently, allowances need to be adapted to reflect differences in living standards among the Member States.
This is the means by which we will achieve truly equal pay.
Similar mechanisms for adjusting pay according to the location of the workplace already exist for European officials, and are considered fair.
The French socialist delegation has accordingly tabled an amendment to Article 16 of the draft Statute to this effect. We invite you to join us in supporting it.
Please allow me to make an appeal to caution: democracy has a price, as we all know, and citizens must understand that.
I would like to close by saying to you that this Statute, although not perfect, is a step forward, a step towards true European democracy.
I hope that the Council will respect Parliament's work.
I should like to thank all those who have taken part in the debate and the Commission for the positive tone of its contribution.
In particular, I thank the rapporteur for his endless endeavour on behalf of the House in this regard.
The vote on the draft decision will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at 12.30 p.m. and the vote on the motion for a resolution will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statement on competition policy in respect of decommissioning funds and
4 recommendations for second reading:
A5-0136/2003, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC (15528/2/2002 - C5-0034/2003 - 2001/0077(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Turmes)
A5-0135/2003, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 98/30/EC (15531/2/2002 - C5-0035/2003 - 2001/0077(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Rapkay)
A5-0134/2003, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity (15527/2/2002 - C5-0036/2003 - 2001/0078(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Mombaur)
A5-0132/2003, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision laying down a series of guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decision No 1254/96/EC (15767/2/2002 - C5-0033/2003 - 2001/0311(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Clegg)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today's debate is an important one.
We are about to enter the final phase of the legislative process relating to the range of measures on the internal energy market.
I would insist that I consider it important to bear in mind that this package is emblematic within the Lisbon process, the objective of which, we must remember, is to create a more competitive Europe, with an economy which by 2010 will place the European Union at the cutting edge of international economic activity, with a knowledge-based society, full employment and also respect for the environment.
I would particularly like to stress the extremely positive role the European Parliament has been playing throughout this procedure, in the quest for the result which I hope we will achieve during this part-session.
The European Parliament has always firmly supported the Commission in its efforts to create a competitive and integrated internal energy market, which furthermore means moving beyond national markets.
I would sincerely like to thank the three rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Rapkay and Mr Mombaur, for the fantastic job they have done.
And I would also like to mention the shadow rapporteurs and the other members of the committee who have participated actively over recent months in particular in order to achieve this positive result; I would particularly like to express my gratitude for the efforts of the delegation which has been negotiating within an informal tripartite dialogue so that we could hold this discussion today and on Wednesday reach an agreement in this Parliament allowing us to achieve a definitive text.
The compromise we are reaching does not differ substantially from the Commission's initial proposals.
What is more, these proposals have subsequently been reinforced by a series of points following first reading by Parliament, particularly with regard to the public service aspects laid down in the Directives.
Once this series of measures has been established, all European Union consumers will be able to choose their provider from 2007.
Small consumers will not therefore be deprived of this right and of these internal market advantages.
From a structural point of view, many of the obstacles to fair competition will be removed, in particular the lack of independence of system operators and the absence of effective rules.
At the same time, the public service requirements have been reinforced, largely, I would insist, at the request and on the initiative of this Parliament, with the universal service obligation in the electricity sector and strict protection measures for vulnerable consumers.
The range of measures includes an essential component relating to the internal electricity market, that is, the Regulation on cross-border electricity exchanges which lays down clear rules in order to facilitate trade in the European Union.
Although Parliament and the Commission would have liked to have made quicker progress with regard to a series of points, such as the opening up of the market and legal separation, I consider it essential that the directives establish unconditional dates and that the regulatory framework is clear for the industry.
Everybody now knows what the rules are going to be and I would therefore insist that this is a very important step forward.
The common positions have improved the results of the parliamentary amendments, above all with regard to labelling and the competences of the regulatory authority.
The degree of influence of the parent company over the activities of the network operators has also been clearly defined.
There is an aspect which I would like to deal with expressly this afternoon, because it is one of the most controversial aspects.
It is of course the issue of the funds for decommissioning nuclear power stations.
We all know that it is an essential part of the agreement reached. So much so that the last Conference of Presidents has included it as a specific point in this afternoon's debate, Mr President.
I would like to present the Commission's positions with regard to it.
Firstly, as I said on the occasion of the debate on these texts at first reading, the Commission fully shares Parliament's concern that the funds reserved for decommissioning and waste management should be spent as they were intended to be.
On 30 January 2003, the Commission adopted two proposals for directives relating to a Community strategy and standards on the safety of nuclear power stations and the treatment of waste.
The first of them focuses specifically on the issue of funds for nuclear decommissioning.
I would like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that I committed myself to this before Parliament at the first reading of the legislative package, and that in January 2003 I gave the response I had committed myself to at that time.
Secondly, following our contacts during the tripartite dialogue, we have reached an agreement amongst the co-legislators on the basis of an interinstitutional declaration and a Commission declaration on control and transparency in the management of those funds.
In particular, Mr President, and in accordance with the request of the Conference of Presidents, I would like to refer to the statement which the Commission will make, a statement which corresponds to the Commission as a whole and which has been debated within the College of Commissioners.
In the statement, the Commission points out the importance of guaranteeing that the funds established for decommissioning and waste management activities relating to the objectives of the Euratom Treaty are managed transparently and used solely for those activities.
Within this context, and within the limits of its responsibilities in accordance with the Euratom Treaty, the Commission intends to publish an annual report on the use of the funds for decommissioning and waste management.
In particular it will stress the need to guarantee the full application of the relevant provisions of Community law.
Therefore, the Commission will review the situation of the funds and their use in an annual report, which will be transparent and will be communicated to this House.
Thanks to the specific directive and the Commission's report, I am satisfied that this issue is coming to fruition and that it will impose greater transparency in relation to these funds because, ladies and gentlemen, although you proposed it here, in Parliament, I believe it is something that concerns all of us, and that in the meantime the facts have proved us right with regard to the need to deal with this issue, and I am thinking specifically of something that happened over recent months in a company in Great Britain.
Mr President, I would like to repeat that the Commission accepts all those amendments which are in line with the agreement reached.
I would like to end by thanking Parliament once again and in particular the three rapporteurs and the delegation which has participated in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission within this informal tripartite dialogue which we have carried out and for the constructive work they have done with regard to all these measures.
I believe that, without this fundamental contribution, we would not be on the point of creating the most integrated internal energy market in the world, a market which means, furthermore, implementing the Community model, that is to say, liberalisation together with regulation, something which previously was thought to be contradictory, but which, as we in Europe are demonstrating, can be combined: the advantages of the market and the maintenance of a cohesive society, from which nobody is excluded, which not only looks after the weakest, but which also thinks of the future, of future generations and specifically of the protection of our environment.
Mr President, after three years of intense debate, Parliament will this week vote on the second directives on the electricity and gas markets.
What did Parliament and the rapporteurs try to achieve?
Instead of focusing only on the quantitative aspects of market opening, Parliament and the rapporteurs have made efforts to ensure that equal importance is given to the qualitative aspects.
I am proud to be able to say today that we have managed to re-regulate and to make this market 'greener' in many areas.
Those who are sceptical about the process of liberalisation will have to admit that this second directive on electricity implies a much better regulatory environment than was the case with the first directive from 1996.
What have we achieved?
The objectives of the market today give equal status to competition, security of supply and the environment.
Secondly, we have stronger regulators and we have taken the first step on the way to unbundling the separate interests of grid generation and retail.
We were able to strengthen the public service obligations and impose stronger obligations on grid companies to ensure the necessary investment.
There are strong requirements on the suppliers of electricity to inform customers in the contracts.
I am particularly happy that we have obliged the suppliers to give full information on the mix of electricity and on the environmental consequences of their production.
This will allow consumers in Europe to make an informed choice.
It will also allow society to continue the debate on energy services.
We also have a universal service, but not only that, we now also have the obligation to establish a supplier of last resort.
All these measures will not be enough, however, to ensure that small customers will receive the benefits of the liberalised market.
A single domestic customer will have to compete with big industrial consumers to get a fair price.
It is only because we will favour and encourage small customers to bundle together in order to form sales communities that small consumers will now be able to get a good price.
We were also able to strengthen the status of decentralised energy producers.
We managed to establish the concept of long-term avoided costs.
This will mean that the practice in certain countries, where you pay as much to transport energy for 200 metres from a co-generation unit to a neighbour as you pay to transport energy for over 500 kilometres will change and this will give small generators a real chance.
It is the small generators, the innovation which we have through the miniaturisation of engines, the intelligent grids we have through the development of software, together with new independent power producers, that will be the panacea of the market.
But these innovations will only come onto the market if, as politicians, we have the courage to impose a real level playing field.
Innovation will not come from dinosaurs.
Therefore we have to be careful over the next few years to ensure that the large integrated companies are not allowed to play too many games.
We need ownership unbundling.
We need ring-fencing of the decommissioning funds.
It is absolutely nonsensical to speak of a level playing field if we allow the EDF to use EUR 30 billion, Eon EUR 12 billion and RWE EUR 10 billion from the decommissioning funds in the market.
We also need a much more stringent merger policy against these oligopolies which are coming onto the market.
Finally - and probably the most important point - we need one competition policy for one market.
We cannot allow double standards in a single European market and we therefore need the DG Competition competences under the EU Treaty rules on competition.
The game which the Commission, and especially Mr Lamoureux, as head of DG TREN played with the Council and Parliament over the last weeks is not right.
This was an attempt to remove the decommissioning funds from Mr Monti's competences on competition policy.
Commissioner, you did a good job on ensuring the establishment of an internal market.
The games must stop.
We as a Parliament will not accept double standards on competition policy.
Finally, I want to thank all the rapporteurs for their good cooperation.
Often it was trust in the rapporteurs that secured this important piece of legislation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by making the point with which my friend Mr Turmes concluded his speech, namely that we owe a debt of gratitude to our fellow rapporteurs and to the shadow rapporteurs.
We have a total of two years of work behind us, and I have found the cooperation between the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs right across the groups to be highly collegial, very frank and full of trust, something I believe to be reflected in the outcome that we have achieved.
I think this is a good result.
Let me make four observations following on from what Mr Turmes has just said, with which I can only agree.
Firstly, this legislative package opens up the way for more competition in Europe's energy markets.
In opening up the way for a truly integrated internal market in energy, we are making a contribution - our contribution - towards our shared goal of making the European Union the most competitive region in the world.
We have to make use of the efficiency gains arising from an integrated internal market and its capacity for bringing about political integration in order to achieve this goal, but also especially so that our small and medium-sized enterprises should benefit from this internal market, and so that other consumers benefit more than they have done in the past from its outcomes and from its positive effects.
Secondly, the essential consequence of previous directives on the internal market was that markets were opened up in an unbalanced way.
They certainly brought about greater competitiveness, enhanced efficiency and reduced prices, but the unbalanced development of the opened markets and substantial deficiencies in the detailed rules mean that we now have to enact specific measures to speed up the process of opening up markets still further.
This means that we have to ensure equal conditions for all participants in the market, minimise the danger of the market being dominated, and, as far as possible, put a stop to predatory practices, for example those engaged in by the big players to the detriment of small enterprises.
The fact is that we are not aiming at the replacement of public monopolies by private ones, but at a wide-open internal market in energy.
My third point is, therefore, indisputable.
An essential component of what we have submitted to the vote in this House is to lay down an ambitious timetable for the complete opening-up of the market.
The timetable that we have now laid down jointly with the Council is ambitious, and, if we can make it work, this will be a great leap forward in comparison with what we have had so far.
My fourth point is that the access of third parties to the network - competition, in other words - has to be regulated, with transparency but without discrimination.
One of the essentials for this is unbundling, the use of company law to unbundle the network from production on the one hand and retailing on the other.
We need one or more regulatory authorities with supervisory capacity, with the capacity and obligation to report, but, above all, the power to give instructions and the capacity to impose sanctions.
We have also established the need for the State to be able to impose obligations for the general benefit without at the same time nullifying competition.
Although the basis on which this will be done is laid down in an appropriate way in the directives that we will be voting on the day after tomorrow, it remains incumbent on the Commission to keep a very watchful eye on market developments.
It is the Commission that must take appropriate measures to prohibit anti-competitive conduct by companies, and, above all, the Commission that must see to it that the Member States transpose the directive properly and promptly.
It must be conceded that the Council has, in the informal trilogue, moved some way from its original position and closer to that of Parliament, but that was urgently necessary in view of the fact that a number of detailed rules in one or more of the Common Positions were, in my view, somewhat problematic, containing openings whereby competition might be nullified.
The tight time-frame therefore means that prompt transposition is of the essence; everything has to be transposed into national law within the space of a year.
With reference to this, I want again to make it clear that it is for the Commission to monitor the market and the terms of competition.
Let me again underline what Mr Turmes has just said, that the internal market in energy must be subject to Treaty competition law and must be evaluated by reference to it.
The Treaty instruments must be applicable to it, especially where state subsidies and the control of mergers are concerned, and I think that, on this issue, the Commission can depend upon the political support not only of my group - I can promise them that - but also of this House as a whole.
Mr President, I have to start by making a statement in addition to my speaking time as acting chairman of the responsible committee.
The voting lists for Wednesday that have been circulating here so far are wrong, or at least misleading.
Let me say, referring to my own report, that Amendments Nos 1 to 5, are not the compromises they are described as in the lists.
The Committee officially withdrew them.
Amendments Nos 7 to 10 are compromise amendments, but Amendment No 6 is not, contrary to what is stated on the prepared voting list.
Amendment No 6 is not part of the compromise; indeed, as I see it, it is out of order.
I ask the Bureau to check whether it is out of order, so that Wednesday's vote can proceed in a correct manner.
Mr President, please do not include this in my speaking time.
Mr President, I would like to start by reiterating, with reference to the legislation on cross-border exchanges in electricity, that this law uses a number of measures to benefit a truly EU-wide internal market.
There are to be funds to compensate transit networks for their services.
In the Member States, charges on producers in respect of cross-border exchanges in electricity will be harmonised in order to avoid different competition conditions prevailing in different states.
Bottlenecks in the networks will be apportioned in accordance with the laws of the market rather than on a territorial basis, and tariffs will no longer be determined by the distance between the contracting parties, but solely on the basis of the physical flow.
It is also a good thing that this law opens the way for new electricity plant to be properly sited, specifically in the vicinity of centres of consumption, and not, for example, where the primary energy used is especially cheap, thereby giving rise to massive new transport networks.
Taken together, all three laws that we are adopting are milestones for the EU's internal market.
After fifteen years of discussion, they are putting into practice the freedoms in the area of energy that the Union's citizens were guaranteed in the Treaties - freedom of establishment, free movement of goods and freedom to provide services.
These directives make these quite explicit.
Moreover, they mean that the competition will put pressure on European firms to perform well, and it is to be hoped that these will soon, to an ever-increasing extent, discover their roles and capabilities in the global market.
Let me make it abundantly clear, however, that those who make laws can do no more than grant citizens freedoms; it is the adult citizen alone who can make use of them.
It is like an election. Voting in one is a right, but it is for the citizens to decide whether or not to exercise it; the reciprocity of supply and demand in the areas of electricity and gas is likewise something that the public have to understand and of which they have to avail themselves.
This legislation hinges upon the question of how the remaining technical monopolies - the networks - are to be brought to market in such a way as to make competition possible.
These laws contain important provisions for this purpose, in that, firstly, they put the networks themselves under the aegis of their own companies; secondly, they create regulatory systems in the Member States to guarantee neutral management of the networks; and thirdly - something that has been particularly important to Parliament - they govern the way in which these regulatory authorities in the Member States cooperate with one another and with the Commission, so that we do not end up with fifteen - and soon as many as twenty-five - different approaches in the Member States' regulatory authorities.
There is one thing I want to make perfectly clear, and in doing so I am following on from what Mr Turmes said.
If, after a number of years, Parliament or - Madam Vice-President - the Commission should find that this legislation has still not brought about a truly Europe-wide internal market in electricity and gas, then let nobody be surprised if the concept of a European regulator is mooted and then actually brought to fruition - which we are not doing right now - along with the unbundling of property rights over the networks, which we are not doing now either.
Both these options are still under consideration.
It is now for the participants in the market to avoid the situation in which the legislature would have to take such action.
In view of that, my hope is not only that the legislation will be adopted, but also that the participants in the market, the consumers and service-providers, will bring it to life in a tremendous way.
Finally, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs and draftsmen, who have worked together in a quite remarkable way on these issues for years on end.
Likewise, Madam Vice-President, I thank the Commission, you yourself and all its members.
Many thanks to all my fellow workers, whom I congratulate on doing a difficult and first-rate job.
I would ask Mr Mombaur to provide the Presidency with a written version of the initial statement he made regarding errors in the voting list, in order to avoid further errors.
Mr President, as regards the written text, I believe that I am no longer able to do that, as, firstly, the coordinators and rapporteurs agreed everything verbally, and, secondly, members of the Committee's secretariat were present, and they will certainly be able to sort this out.
I will see to it that this is done.
Fine. Let us trust that everyone will act correctly and that tomorrow there will be no problems.
Making the internal market in electricity and natural gas subject to regulations applicable to the whole of Europe is a fundamentally sensible approach.
The European Union's energy supply will be a central issue over the coming years and decades, one that will be ever-present and will demand our attention.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy takes the view, and environmental considerations demand, that the primary objective of any directive dealing with the generation and supply of energy, or with trade in it or the distribution of it, should be that the primary energy used should be, and be capable of being, derived in as socially compatible a way as possible and that its ecological aspects should be acceptable.
That the generation of energy is, in itself, a fundamental ecological problem, is an important insight, one that is reflected in this directive and, above all, in the rapporteur's and draftsman's positions and reports.
It is therefore incumbent on Parliament, the Commission and the Council to ensure that the conditions under which electricity is produced in the medium and long term are such that the primary energy is derived exclusively from renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, sunlight and biomass.
The same goes for the production of gas, where we should do everything possible to replace the old system of gas supply, with all its weaknesses, with indigenous biogas derived from non-food crops.
This will work if we succeed in compensating for the present disadvantages of renewable energy sources in competition with current fossil and nuclear energy sources, and if we manage to make the production and use of energy reflect the costs involved.
Mr President, I must say first of all that I find it an absolute disgrace that the services were not able to present a package of compromise amendments with which to communicate with the public and the press.
I hope and expect, therefore, Mr President, that you will instruct the services to ensure that we have the right package tomorrow.
It is really disheartening for something like this to happen.
The importance of the issues we are discussing was expressed eloquently by the Commissioner, and I shall not repeat it.
I should like to give sincere thanks to my fellow Members, the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, and the Commissioners, too, of course - everyone who contributed - for this result.
Above all, however, I also wish to commend the Greek Presidency - as it has not yet been mentioned for its tremendous commitment, because it has done sterling work.
We in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have fought hard with the Council.
In all fairness, I must say that Parliament has invested a great deal of effort, and I was not expecting the result that we have now achieved.
I believe we owe this to the flexibility, commitment and constructive approach on everyone's part.
Let us focus on a couple of points.
Parliament has invested a great deal of effort in strengthening the position of the supervisory body.
We want the supervisory body to be independent not only of the industry, but also, as far as possible, of the national authorities, because we want to avoid the PET problem, as it was then known.
In any case, we have increased the gap between supervisory body and government.
We have tightened up the competences of the supervisory body, and we have obliged it to contribute to the development of the internal market and the creation of a level playing field, in order to avoid the prospect in many people's imaginations of there being 25 partial markets instead of a single internal market.
My colleague Mr Mombaur also pointed this out earlier.
The second point for which we have fought hard is of course unbundling: functional unbundling, obligatory as from July 2004, and legal unbundling, obligatory by 2007 at the latest.
It has been made clear that not one Member State may deviate from this, because there is a requirement for the Commission to produce an amended directive, which then has to pass through the whole parliamentary and Council process once more.
This is the way it should be, too.
I am also very grateful that we have strengthened the independence of the subsidiaries, that is to say, the transportation undertakings, from the parent company, so that the parent companies, that is to say the production or distribution companies, cannot just dip into the coffers at the expense of the maintenance of the networks, thus de facto frustrating a level playing field in Europe.
The third point is that a great deal more attention has been paid to the level playing field.
We have fought with the Council, and the Council has been well-advised enough to take over specifically those compromises that we have reached in the electronic communications sector.
That will be the crux of the matter.
The question - the key question - will also be whether the Commission is able to look into whether that level playing field has been achieved on an annual basis, by means of concrete analyses.
There is an enormous amount of anxiety that we will end up having perhaps five, six, seven, eight oligopolistic undertakings - large undertakings - in Europe.
On that point I throw down the gauntlet to the Commission to take hard action in cases where there is a lack of 'fair play', in cases of market distortion.
Only then will we be able to convince our citizens that liberalisation is a good thing.
I also think that the compromise on the decommissioning funds was a very significant achievement.
I still do not understand why Member States do not dare to simply put down on paper, in legislation, that a decommissioning fund must be transparent, that it must be used for the intended purpose and that the normal competition rules are to be applied.
Mr President, why do Member States not dare to put that down on paper?
I still do not find convincing the legal drivel - forgive me - to the effect that all this belongs in the Euratom Treaty.
I can endorse the interinstitutional agreement, I welcome the new declaration by the Commission, but the Member States that prevented that from becoming law, from being incorporated into the directive, have got a lot of explaining to do to their citizens.
We also welcome the fact that, as regards the public service obligations, there is not just an incredibly long list to be seen, but also a provision preventing public service obligations constituting a barrier to newcomers.
This seems to me to be another important point for the Commission to note.
In summary, I think that we have achieved an excellent result.
Of course, as a parliamentarian, one wants more, but, given the point of departure, we have achieved an enormous amount.
We can be proud of this, and if we do have any explaining to do to our citizens, it is that there are going to be improvements in quality and in service provision.
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe will soon be alone in continuing to advocate total liberalisation of the electricity market.
Even the United States is recovering from the California and Enron affairs.
In Latin America, liberalisation has been marked by failure.
In the United Kingdom, the state is facing the bankruptcy of British Energy.
In Sweden, prices rose this winter by over 50% because of tensions between supply and demand.
Electricity is a sector which requires long-term investment.
It is concerned with security of supply, environmental protection and providing a public service.
It cannot be governed by market forces and competition alone.
In a number of our countries - my own, for example - the public electricity service means, in particular, equal pricing, access for all households, whatever their rate of consumption or geographical location, to low-cost electricity at the same prices.
The mandatory total liberalisation planned for 2007, which you are proposing to us, will not allow preservation of the social and pricing adjustment mechanisms which safeguard this equal pricing.
That is why we are going to vote for an amendment rejecting the motion which we, the French Socialist delegation, have tabled together with the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Belgian Socialist delegation.
We believe that the plan to open up the market in two stages, without even an assessment of the first stage - the 2004 stage applying to all non-residential customers - being carried out before the sector is then opened up to competition for all residential customers in 2007, is an approach to liberalisation that is more dogmatic than pragmatic.
Moreover, as regards competition, what we are witnessing is more a powerful trend towards concentrations of companies and the establishment of a market of oligopolies and cartels rather than of a genuinely competitive market.
We consider it to be absurd that total liberalisation is being forced on us when the debate on the Green Paper has just been opened and we have not even had time to examine the possibilities of creating a framework directive to safeguard public services.
Mr President, I am standing in for Mr Clegg, the rapporteur.
I have just spoken to him.
He is ill in bed, but, you will be glad to know, he will be with us again shortly.
He wanted me to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes this very strongly because it is a major breakthrough in the single market and for the Lisbon agreement into a sector which has previously been closed.
We welcome strongly and fully support the compromise on labelling and unbundling and on the dates of market opening.
However, the principal point that the Liberal Group would like to make is about the funds for decommissioning in the nuclear sector.
We want to support and thank the Commission for its revised declaration.
Previously the Commission had told us that funds from the Euratom Treaty would be sufficient for the decommissioning.
However, as everybody knows, the Euratom funds are not subject to proper transparency and accountability.
Now that the Commission has told us that the competition provisions will apply fully in this sector, we are extremely pleased because this means openness and transparency and proper rule for the single market.
My group will vote in favour of this tomorrow.
Mr President, the liberalisation of the energy markets has been an ideological project.
A smokescreen of market confidence has been cast to cover up certain real problems.
Markets are always about just one thing: they always operate in the here and now.
Prices take no account of the structural changes that happen when resources peter out.
Liberalisation of the gas market will not guarantee investment over the next twenty or thirty years.
As it is gas that is to meet the EU's entire need for additional energy, and as gas is imported from the east, those that need gas should share in the investment costs of new gas fields.
In a liberalised market only the short-term benefits are taken into account.
We should be able to conclude long-term delivery contracts for gas.
In a market of short-term benefits they are not made.
Network ownership patterns might become a problem in the electricity market.
Unless a government invests in or maintains backbone networks the market will not function.
If the government does not invest in the network and take responsibility for it, electricity cannot be transmitted from one place to another.
I am rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy with respect to a report on the safety of nuclear power plants.
In that capacity I see the problems that can impact on the pricing of electricity.
Electricity produced from nuclear energy may be cheap on the spot markets but we cannot be certain as to whether the prices have taken full account of the costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and of waste disposal, which will extend over hundreds and perhaps thousands of years.
If these costs are not reflected in today's market price for electricity, competition will be distorted.
The liberalisation of the markets determines prices in the short term, but will not solve the big problems of the future.
There will be new Iraq oil wars.
Our group would have liked to safeguard the public and universal energy sector services in connection with these directives relating to liberalisation and privatisation.
Mr President, I would like to warmly congratulate all who have been involved in the hard work of bringing these reports to a coherent, positive and even strong conclusion.
I particularly welcome the demands that nuclear decommissioning funds be fully subject to EU competition law.
The management of nuclear decommissioning funds should never have been used or misused by the utilities as a form of state aid and as an excuse for going on a buying spree across Europe for other utilities.
We risked this acceleration and creation of cartels.
Therefore, I welcome the Commission's assurances here today.
Neither the Commission nor the Council has covered itself in glory in the past on this issue but we have a more consistent approach now.
In particular, although many Member States ring-fence these funds, France and Germany are allowed to set aside the funds for waste management and use them for acquisitions.
This amounts to a clear misuse and even corruption with regard to them, and I welcome the fact that competition law will now apply.
It would otherwise have had a very distorting effect on the energy market across Europe.
How can we have a free market when there are three companies with EUR 10 billion or more at their disposal to buy up other companies?
I am glad that logic has obtained and that these funds will be subject to competition law.
I also very much welcome the inclusion of sustainability objectives and the equal status given to sustainability together with competition and with security of supply.
In particular, renewable energies need to be promoted throughout Europe.
For too long they have been the poor relation, particularly to the vast funds that the nuclear lobby has been able to access by fair means or foul, as I have already outlined.
I hope that more funds will be available for renewables in the future.
Mr President, the rapporteurs involved in this series of reports deserve our utmost praise and appreciation for their Trojan efforts which enabled us to agree on the energy package at second reading and avoid lengthy conciliations.
European electricity and gas networks constitute key pieces of strategic infrastructure.
If we want to achieve our Lisbon goals of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2020, we need a truly unified internal market in our major energy resources.
I am satisfied that the compromise adopted by the Council involves an important role for the national regulatory authorities.
I am convinced that the national regulatory authorities will significantly contribute to the development of the internal market and create fair competitive conditions.
Naturally there is need for close, transparent cooperation between the NRAs and the Commission.
I am also pleased that relations between parent companies and subsidiaries have been better defined.
A parent company must have effective means of exercising control over its subsidiaries.
The original wording could have led to the spinning off of subsidiaries and the breaking up of companies by stealth.
This would have been particularly problematic in small Member States like Ireland where there are some naturally imposed restrictions on energy subdivisions due to the geographical isolation and the limited size of the population.
Clearly the way forward for an energy market such as the Irish one is through interconnection.
I am pleased that this point has been taken on board and that it has been recognised that building interconnectors is a valid way of opening up the energy market.
In Ireland's case this will involve both north-south and east-west connectors and, in due course, a giant UK-Ireland market will be created, offering greater consumer choice and more competitive prices.
The European approach in opening up energy markets and making them more efficient is well balanced.
We can learn from the experience of the United States and avoid disastrous mistakes such as the Enron affair.
We must reassure both customers of electricity and gas - in particular domestic users and workers in this sector - on this point.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although separate reports, at the request of Parliament, Mr Turmes and Mr Rapkay's reports amending the gas and electricity directives respectively have prompted me to table an amendment rejecting the common position in both cases.
In effect, although I am not calling into question the work of my colleagues, I cannot resign myself to accepting proposals from a Commission which is becoming increasingly liberal, especially where energy is concerned.
As in too many cases, the Commission is blindly following the dogma of the opening up of the markets to competition.
Indeed, the Commission does not have the courage to create a universal energy service at European level and to explain how it is to be funded.
Without this universal service, however, which is an essential prerequisite, there should never have been an attempt to challenge, at European level, the public service missions defined in the Member States.
These missions follow definitions and methods of funding decided and guaranteed according to specific territorial, legal or constitutional requirements.
Under the principle of subsidiarity, according to which measures are to be taken at the most effective level, only the Member States are capable of carrying out these missions to meet the demands of their citizens.
I would point out, moreover, that even the rapporteur seems to have reservations as to whether the effects of opening up the electricity market to competition will be entirely beneficial.
Therefore, I cannot endorse a Parliamentary debate which does not provide a solution but continues to destroy what does exist.
Furthermore, it is inconceivable that we should presume to pursue the opening up of the energy sector to competition by extending to individuals a system originally designed for companies.
It is irresponsible of the majority of the Member States to have given way to the Commission's proposals in the end.
It is true that the primary responsibility lies with the Commission, which has sole right of initiative and is disregarding the negative economic, social and territorial consequences of its proposals in its endeavours to create a single market which is subject to competition alone.
In conclusion, in view of all these considerations, I confirm my opposition to these proposals seeking to finalise the opening up of the energy sector to competition.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the constructive cooperation of the European Parliament and the other European institutions, we are now on the threshold of the opening-up of the energy markets in Europe.
Many of our fellow Members have dedicated themselves to this for years.
At the very least, then, the result can be described as commendable.
In the first place, the long-awaited liberalisation should provide benefits for the consumer: I am thinking in particular of improved service and more competitive prices.
I should like to point out that there is a paradox inherent in this.
In my view, liberalisation will come at a price.
It is a price which, paradoxically, will primarily be borne by the consumer.
Particular attention will have to be paid to the way in which the distribution network is to be used, therefore.
The price that the consumer will have to pay is of course the sum of the generation price, the tariff for transportation via the high-voltage network and the distribution tariff, plus all the levies on distribution and transportation.
Distribution costs are the largest cost item on the bills of customers of the distribution networks.
Besides, the chance of the average consumer seeing his or her electricity bill go down significantly as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market is very small in some Member States.
The reason is obvious.
The limited increases in efficiency in the sector are too small to compensate for the new levies.
On the other hand, account must also be taken of the fact that the scant connections between the various national networks are not designed for importing or exporting large quantities, but rather as mutual support in the event of the unexpected failure of generation units in one country.
There is still a considerable lack of commercial intercapacity, therefore.
If a genuine internal market is to be achieved, there is an urgent need for us to effect a significant increase in this commercial intercapacity.
In conclusion, it can be said that an important step has been taken in the opening-up of the energy markets in the European Union, but that a close watch will have to be kept over the way in which this opening-up is realised, on an ongoing basis.
Mr President, the energy reports up for discussion today must be understood as an integrated whole, which will have an important impact on the viability of the energy market in Europe.
The European-wide energy networks will heal the market's spine and skeleton.
The liberalisation package will, moreover, improve the market's circulation and digestion.
Liberalisation must be continued and the network improved.
In the first round of enlargement the new Member States must also be involved more fully.
We have really had to wrangle with the Council over both issues.
With regard to the energy networks, a compromise was eventually reached that will guarantee there is the necessary flexibility to amend Annex III, while at the same time ensuring there is sufficient parliamentary monitoring.
Achieving this compromise has not been easy.
The liberalisation of the energy markets is not any dramatic breakthrough, at least not from the point of view of the Nordic countries, although it is good that they are indeed being liberalised.
This is definitely a step in the right direction.
If necessary the Commission will probably make new proposals for further liberalisation of markets.
Contrary to what some of our Socialist friends think they know, the free and open markets of the Nordic countries are functioning well.
Freedom of choice for the consumer has grown, prices have fallen, services have improved and things run more efficiently.
The market mechanisms have been working perfectly.
It has to be accepted that prices can sometimes also rise in a free market.
Rarely, however, are there situations where the same year sees one of the century's driest summers together with one of its coldest winters.
What is most crucial in the liberalisation of the energy markets is that unhindered access to the networks is guaranteed.
Consequently, the clear unbundling of network activity and the fact that the tasks of the regulatory authorities should be sufficiently harmonised are two of the most central elements in this package.
Without them we can forget the word 'competition' when we talk about the electricity and gas markets.
Now is the time to bring the debate on the package to an end: the compromises before us are completely acceptable.
The package is an essential, albeit inadequate, condition for a viable market.
We are now establishing framework legislation, but its implementation must also be monitored.
The Commission must be equipped with the proper tools to monitor the viability of the markets.
It will also be crucially important to ensure there is sufficient investment in the future.
Finally, thank you again to all those of you who have been involved in working on this package.
This has been a long, challenging and arduous process.
Mr President, let me start by saying something to my friend and colleague Mr DÃ©sir, who spoke before me because he had a plane to catch.
Much as I respect him, the great majority of our group backs this resolution, this compromise that we have reached.
I might add that we also take the view that this directive safeguards the service publique or - as we would say - services of general interest.
Indeed, what results from it is a new legal certainty.
Services of general interest are compatible with competition, and, should the public interest so require it, the Member States will also be able to decide on derogations from the law on competition.
What the French may, however, find painful is the fact that pÃ©rÃ©quation will come to an end, so that prices will not be the same everywhere, but I wonder what disadvantage is involved in the possibility of prices falling in one part of a country?
That is precisely the effect we intend competition to have.
I would remind you, by the way, that one of the reasons why we started this debate on the liberalisation of energy markets at the beginning of the 1990s was that prices in Europe were very high, so that it was not only the companies, but also we ourselves, who were complaining that we were at a competitive disadvantage against the USA, our main competitor.
These directives, in fact, represent the end of a long process.
Having been in this House for a long time, let me point out that this process actually began at the end of the 1980s - with the absurd variation, incidentally, that the White Paper on the internal market made no mention of energy - and that, at that time, it was by way of the European Court of Justice that the attempt was made to open up the internal market.
We said at the time that we did not want to leave the opening-up of the market to judges, but wanted to make it a political process, and that political process has now been concluded at European level by the resolution on these directives.
What comes next? That is the question.
Transposing this directive into law will not be straightforward.
It will affect the companies, and - as national enterprises become European enterprises - the work of trade unions as well.
This liberalisation will entail new legislative tasks, especially as regards our obligations in the areas of environmental and climate policy.
We will also have the important task of introducing elements of these into liberalisation, in that it will be a new task to make climate policy compatible with competition policy as embodied in these two directives.
It will, not least, be important to involve the candidate countries in this process.
I too would like to end by thanking all those who have played their part in this.
Let me say this: it is not often that we work together in such a collegial fashion!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have expressed our complete and categorical opposition to the liberalisation of energy being promoted by the European Union on numerous occasions in the past.
The proposed restructuring only benefits the strong monopoly groups and has adverse repercussions on the cost to the average family, national energy planning and the position of the workers in this specific sector.
The Communist Party of Greece considers that energy is not simply a consumer product, but a sector of strategic importance to development and, as such, it cannot be the object of business activity and speculation, but should belong to the public sector.
Consequently, we refuse to discuss the details, the terms and the speeding up of liberalisation and the relevant rules of competition; instead we shall support the proposals for overall rejection tabled by our political group.
Allow me, however, a few comments on the regulation for the networks, which is being used to promote increased exports from strong Community monopolies which will benefit from the reduction in actual transportation costs.
At the same time, it safeguards high profitability by passing the new financial burdens on to the average family, while the increase in exports will limit the development of generating stations in the weaker Member States in order to make use of domestic energy sources.
In addition, control of national grids is being shifted from the Member States to the Commission, thereby cutting the potential for national energy planning in order to reduce energy dependency and ensure the needs of each Member State are satisfied.
Cross-border exchanges in electricity can be used to reduce energy dependency, safeguard cheap energy and make use of domestic sources.
However, the precondition for this is a policy of mutually beneficial cooperation between countries, quite unlike that being promoted by the regulation and the policy of the European Union in general.
Mr President, I cannot help observing that we have ended up with two directives after all, just as we suggested at the beginning.
May I congratulate all my colleagues on their hard work with the Commission and Council in achieving this compromise result.
It is a tribute to the effective working of our committee.
We have not achieved all we want.
Past experience on previous directives shows that a foot in the door can and does lead to more opening than expected.
My particular interest is in the interaction between market opening and liberalisation and the issue of security of supply.
It needs to be said that more effective markets make for more efficient use of energy, and that is an essential element in maintaining security of supply.
We should also stand back from the details to remember the purpose behind these measures.
First and foremost, it is about choice, better value and better service to consumers of energy, both domestic and commercial.
Experience shows that competition drives these objectives forward, and we have seen the benefits in lower prices and improved service in the UK.
We need to see more improvement throughout Europe before we can say that we have done enough.
We have learned over the past 15 years that progress in liberalisation cannot be achieved all at once and a step-by-step approach is more likely to lead to a better outcome in the end.
I would like to advise the Commissioner that the Kangaroo Group working party on energy liberalisation is presently discussing the next steps we need to take in order to address the shortcomings not fully addressed in the current proposals.
We must not think these directives and regulations are the end of the process.
Mr President, I am pleased to announce that in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy this evening the last piece of the jigsaw, Mr Clegg's package, was voted through unanimously.
The Lisbon aspiration has been an ambitious one, and it has taken dogged and indefatigable rapporteurs, as well as a quite determined Commissioner, to reach the stage we are at tonight.
We have considerable experience with the original rather limited liberalisation directive in our Member States.
We have seen that there has been market opening in some countries to 100% of customers, that there has been an unbundling of network operators in all Member States to some extent, but not completely, and there has been a limited increase in clarity and transparency of regulation.
However, those earlier directives were inadequate.
There is still market dominance and predatory, anti-competitive behaviour in some Member States, and some European citizens have not benefited from an enlarged and opened market in particular countries.
I have no fears that what is being suggested is wild and savage liberalisation because we have insisted on regulation unbundling, public service guarantees and labelling for environmental impact which leads to informed choice by customers.
We have seen that cross-subsidies will be prevented, particularly the quite scandalous use of decommissioning funds in the nuclear sector.
That is not an anti-nuclear remark, that is a pro-fair play remark.
There are risks from liberalisation, but they do not concern security of supply.
Types of energy choices can be affected, however. We need to look at that.
Environmental protection need not be at risk, nor need access by the public to energy.
Indeed, fuel poverty has decreased thanks to liberalisation as carried out in the UK.
The risks are to research.
That is an important risk and we must draw our attention to that in future work.
And there is a risk of skills being lost; again this is a risk to which Member States and the European Union must pay attention.
Tomorrow's vote is an historic one, though we call many votes historic in this Parliament.
It is an important move forward.
Amendment No 6 to the Mombaur report should not be admissible.
It is not something that was covered earlier, but I commend those who have worked hard on this package.
We will have a better use of energy in Europe because of it.
Mr President, we believe that the liberalisation of the energy markets illustrates once again the conflict between the European institutions and the peoples of Europe.
It is highly likely that Parliament's vote will serve only to support the strategy for the - rapid - liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets and of the public service sector as a whole.
The exaltation of the alleged positive effects of competition, namely transparency, lower production costs and increased job possibilities, is being contradicted every day by reality.
In actual fact, what are most apparent are non-transparent decisions, the diversion of public funds into private interests, whatever the status of the undertakings, the rapid increase in prices for users, the granting of benefits to unethical private groups and the abolition of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, while, as for workers' statutes, they have gone right out of the window.
For us, energy is an absolutely essential requirement and access to it a fundamental right.
We believe that only genuine public, democratic control would allow us to streamline energy production and consumption while still guaranteeing respect for the environment and flat-rate adjustments.
This would be an initial step towards a European public service which meets the needs of users and employees today.
Parliament appears to be disregarding this concern.
If it is to fully shoulder its responsibility to the citizens of Europe, Parliament must reject the directives on the energy sector and launch a genuine democratic debate on the actual effects of the policy which seems to be taking root in the European Union today.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the energy market is, above all, to the advantage of consumers and for Europe's citizens.
Why is it to their advantage?
It is because they can buy on the market the service that is best for them.
Not only, as they did before, can they differentiate quantities, but now also in terms of quality and, in future, they will be able to do so as regards prices.
I believe that one tremendous thing we have been able to achieve together has been with regard to labelling, in that public utilities will, in future, be under an obligation to indicate the source of the electricity, which will in future be independently monitored by the Commission, with the establishment of a group of European regulatory authorities which will share their experience with one another and thereby promote competition, to the benefit of consumers and of Europe's citizens.
The fact is that competition means service, and that is what the public want; they want service and freedom of choice.
In future the mix of energy sources will have to appear on the bill every year.
What that means is, quite simply, that I, the consumer, will in future - or at least after 1 July 2007 - have the right to choose an electricity company, 100% of whose electricity is generated from hydropower.
I think that is a great leap forward for all of us, and that, in future, greater transparency will result from this as a matter of course.
Energy imports will have to be monitored by the Member States, and their sources will have to be certified.
Ultimately, we regard the full application of Community law as having most especial priority.
We believe that the decommissioning funds, together with the interest they yield, should be applied only to their original purpose, so that the costs must be borne by the form of electricity generation from which they result.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is all too good to be true.
The energy market is different from other markets.
On the one hand, there is a natural monopoly in the distribution and transport networks, which reduces competition.
On the other hand, it is a sector in which the lack of adequate regulation means that price variations can be huge, given the rigidity of demand and the impossibility of storing electricity.
Lastly, access to energy for all citizens must be seen as a genuine right, which brings us back to the question of public services.
Of course, the texts do include the public service obligations but they do not go far enough.
Indeed, the Member States are given too much leeway to organise and define these public service obligations, which means that the behaviour of the Member States which attach least importance to social cohesion requirements and citizens' rights will be legitimised.
In consequence of that, free competition between operators will take precedence in these texts over public service obligations.
This is happening at a time when the Commission, with its Green Paper, is launching the debate on services of general interest!
Why could we not have taken a little time to take stock of the sectoral liberalisation process and to make this issue the focus of a European policy?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those of you who know me will not be surprised to hear me confirm this evening that, not considering energy to be just another commodity, I and my group are firmly against the new proposals to liberalise the gas and electricity markets.
Despite the procedural precautions and despite the undeniable eloquence of our Commissioner and our rapporteurs, we believe that these proposals run counter to the need to save energy and, therefore, to environmental protection.
They will lead to job losses and, above all, to further deterioration of public services, and to the deterioration of energy networks and price adjustments, which are land-use planning tools.
They will run counter to the diversification of energy sources, even though these are becoming more and more vital.
They will favour short-term vision and calculations.
The logic of the internal market is thus particularly inappropriate for the energy sector.
I will end by reiterating that, far from harking back to the days of state control, I am in favour of a regulated world and a future for which we have prepared.
In this sense, energy is a major tool, maybe even the most important tool.
Thus, I dare to hope that, mindful of what is at stake, we will ultimately, one day, progress from a simple market logic to a political vision based on the concept of citizenship which is worthy of the heritage which we will leave our children in this field.
Mr President, without wishing to detract from the huge accomplishment of our fellow Members, this is a subject on which there will never be an end to analysis and debate.
I would like to focus briefly on the electricity market.
The situation in Europe reveals structural differences which I believe the launching of the liberalisation process will not alone suffice to overcome.
The electricity market in Europe has been concerned with linking markets but not with creating uniform conditions for access to generation, institutional systems and symmetry in fuel choices, with a view to establishing competing symmetrical conditions in the generation sector.
The cross-border regulation, through market mechanisms such as specific auctions, for instance, in countries penalised by internal production conditions, prejudices the situations of economic advantage for the end consumer deriving from the availability of imported energy.
Given the differences in cost and the congestion caused by a demand for energy which is considerably higher than supply, the effect will ultimately be convergence of the external and internal prices.
The nuclear issue would exacerbate the situation, creating the strange situation where some people are called upon to contribute to the cost of decommissioning in other countries when they are not actually in a position to benefit, because of the market-based mechanism provided for by the cross-border regulation, from energy produced by nuclear plant.
While we feel that the cross border flow efficiency mechanisms proposed can be endorsed in the long term, we consider that applying them in the short term would be extremely harmful.
Therefore, we would support the raft of directives only if this were achieved by means of phasing-in the market mechanisms, for the cross border regulation cannot produce identical positive effects for the end consumers of the Member States when there are disparities in trade flows.
Mr President, I am an advocate of an integrated market in the network industries which will serve as the basis for a competitive European economy and for social inclusion, particularly by means of interconnection, but on two essential conditions: that the joint networks are treated as public goods and that we are capable of managing a common energy policy.
I endorse and welcome Mrs de Palacio's work to this end.
However, I can see that neither our states nor our institutions are taking on board the concept of public goods as yet, nor are they adopting the idea of a common policy.
Moreover, the Treaties do not give them competence to do so and the outcome of the Convention with regard to this matter is extremely uncertain.
The sectoral directives are undeniably seeking to move towards public service obligations, focusing on universal service, the environment, interconnection and security of supply, but they are only recommendations to the states.
As we are quite aware, we have no legislative authority to enforce a European right.
Without a doubt, we are entering the realms of a regulation too, and by a regulation I mean a public measure allowing us not just to introduce genuine competition but also to bring it into line with public service obligations.
Basically, competition needs to be developed further.
Some Members want to force this.
It is easy to criticise dinosaurs, my dear Mr Turmes, and overlook the contribution made by historic operators and what they did for consumers.
It is easy to call for ever-increasing 'deintegration', but absolutely nobody has any idea as yet how to regulate a 'deintegrated', multinational competition system properly.
It is ten times more difficult than regulating a national integrated monopoly system.
We have not taken into account the Californian experience, price volatility or the inadequacy of long-term contracts.
We are not capable of securing development investment.
In particular, I noted the obligation, which I believe is premature, of separation in respect of distribution, with regard to which the Members are trying to outdo the Commission, for they want to go as far as separating ownership.
We are not the only ones to want to create a retail market for household electricity supply.
There is fierce debate in the United States and Canada.
Do the gains offset the costs?
What are the gains?
Maybe the price of a pizza for an average household once a year.
