TV and the Internet have undoubtedly contributed to this, to a large extent, because they fill youngsters' heads with ideas that have very little to do with reality.
A short time ago, a study was published in a Spanish newspaper, which stated that young people seeing, for example, a person throw themselves off the fourth floor of a building and yet run away unharmed or a person stop a speeding bullet with their bare hands without suffering any ill effects, contributes to many young people being unaware of the real danger of such situations.
It is thought, furthermore, that such images put too many ideas in their heads and that this is, unfortunately, the cause of the increase in violence amongst young people and even children.
Having said this, I would like to express my total support for the rapporteur when he calls on Member States to classify video games using self-regulatory mechanisms set up by the industry, and for them to establish 'abuse departments'.
I would also like, of course, to congratulate the Commission on its intention to carry out a study on the classification of films distributed to cinemas, shown on TV, and available on DVD or video.
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to be aware that we cannot expect to have a world without violence when the adults of the future spend their time watching cartoons, films and news stories that are of an increasingly violent nature.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to focus on the actual task we are to perform as a European institution, but without neglecting the demands also made of the Member States.
I believe that the digital age will see the acceleration of current developments in the services offered by the media, which are far from being limited to traditional television, or even to the Internet, but include many other services, and so it is right and necessary that we give thought to the legal form that control and the protection of young people might take, and also set up the means for dealing with them.
There is no doubt that the legal framework must be adapted to these new developments, at both European and national level.
I speak also for my group when I say that I consider self-regulation instruments to be an important addition to a legal framework.
We cannot do without standards laid down in law, and these are a compelling necessity.
Self-regulation instruments, too, need to be on a legal footing, which means that the promoters, those who provide the programmes, cannot be absolved of their responsibility.
To put it another way, we cannot allow service providers to shirk responsibility for their programmes.
That is the basic premise.
As for how this can be put into practice, there may be - and indeed there are - many ways of going about that.
Regulatory arrangements in the Member States are very diverse, which is ultimately due to the fact that they correspond to conventional media systems as these have evolved, and we are not about nullifying all that.
I emphasise that self-regulation instruments as additions to the law are something we cannot do without.
Technical systems, too, can be indispensable, but they cannot be a substitute for responsibility.
We also know that many children and young people, in an age when adults have not mastered the whole range of technical options, are ahead of their parents in that respect.
That will change in the long term, but that is the way things are today, and we all know that children can get up to all sorts of tricks, for example when it comes to cracking something.
That is why we cannot rely exclusively on technical systems, and why there is a need for contents to be monitored, in which respect there must be restrictions on content, which cannot relate only to real-time transmissions.
The different time zones in a region over which a satellite broadcasts make that obsolete in any case, and so even that method has serious limitations.
I am very glad that this report takes up my group's call for the continuation and extension of the action plan on the safe use of the Internet, which is due to come to an end at the end of the year.
I see this as compellingly necessary.
I will conclude by saying that we must take steps to impart media literacy to children, young people and their parents, as a sound capacity for judgment can only come into being if our measures help to develop it.
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the need to tackle the growing phenomenon of child abuse on the Internet.
We welcome initiatives by the Member States in the EU on safer Internet use for children but we need to step up our actions for a more coordinated campaign to fight against Internet paedophilia.
When it comes to cybercrime, Member States rightly prioritise the campaign against global terrorism and, additionally, focus on Internet credit card fraud, but more can and should be done on Internet-paedophilia.
Last week I met with the Abusive Images Unit of Greater Manchester Police, a small, committed team led by Terry Jones, leading the field in expertise in the UK on tracing and convicting child abusers on the net.
The unit was launched in 1995, when 12 images were seized.
In 1999, 41,000 images were seized and one recent conviction revealed a man with over 50,000 images of child abuse.
This is not child pornography but gross and indecent sexual abuse.
I have seen the pictures.
Behind each image is a real child traumatised by their experiences.
The police I met with are doing an excellent job and being assisted by new software technology designed again by a local company in my constituency, Surf Control.
With this they monitored chat channels for 16 hours.
They picked up 48 offenders right across the EU - offenders in positions of trust (teachers and scoutmasters, a foster parent in Germany and a Swedish army sergeant); babies as young as three months had been anally raped.
Abuse is under-reported.
So what should we do in the EU?
We need to do more.
We need hotlines and to make this a priority at EU and Member State level.
This week we voted for a EU network of national monitoring centres on football hooliganism.
That is a violent and visible form of abuse, but we can do more for those children who are suffering behind the scenes from fear and violent abuse.
Yes, we need self-regulation and partnership, but Internet service providers have to prioritise this.
AOL and NTL have excellent reputations, but others are not doing the job.
They are not answering the request of police to track down these abusers and they are even beginning to ask to charge the police service for it.
I want to see closer cooperation between Europol and EU law enforcement.
I want better research and funding for Internet-tracing software.
We can do more if we make this a priority and we can protect our children from this violent and heinous form of abuse.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by offering my very special thanks to Mr Beazley for this report, because I think he has summed up Parliament's opinions in a particularly constructive way.
You can tell that by the fact that we adopted this report unanimously in committee and that, today in Parliament, there are no amendments to this report left, and that on a topic that involves a very large number of problems and unanswered questions.
So many thanks for it.
The work we are going to do will be on a very good foundation.
Our ongoing efforts will be particularly important because the future convergence of the media - television, computers, the Internet - will mean that we will have to find new ways to really guarantee that young people and human dignity will be protected.
The proposals submitted by the Commission are therefore very much the right thing, and the Member States' support for them is urgently needed.
I would like to again go over the three points that I see as being the most important.
We need, firstly, new and more highly-developed models of self-regulation, enabling the industry and the responsible Governments to work together on a common basis.
It is for this purpose that the model of jointly-coordinated self-regulation has been devised, and we need to develop it further.
Secondly, it is not standards harmonised on a Europe-wide basis that we need, but Europe-wide minimum standards, particularly for video games and the Internet, in order to offer young people real protection.
And, thirdly, media education is needed not only for children but also for their parents.
All these tasks require involvement on the part of the Council, and it is to them, and for that, that I appeal.
Mr President, I would also like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for his work on this very important report.
The explosion in broadcasting technologies has caused many parents to lose control over what their children watch, and the growth of digital, cable and satellite TV, as well as home computer technology, means that parents are increasingly powerless to monitor their children's viewing habits.
According to some reports, parents were not aware of the facilities, such as the blocks on pay TV and Internet filters, which help them control what their children watch.
Parents need to be given more information on how these work and how trustworthy they are.
Children's welfare is primarily the responsibility of their legal guardians, but this does not absolve suppliers and distributors of audiovisual content of their responsibilities.
Both sides must take full responsibility in this regard.
The degree of self-regulation in broadcasting differs from one Member State to another, but we all agree that we must work towards some commonality in this area and that self-regulation must be underpinned by some legal basis.
Finally, child pornography on the Internet is unforgivable, and there are vast numbers of websites with illegal content located outside the European Union.
I commend the report to the House and thank the rapporteur again for his excellent initiative in this regard.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
The constantly growing range of multimedia services surely makes safety arrangements necessary - and of a comparable nature right across Europe - in order to protect our children and young people from harmful content and its consequences.
We have heard about the introduction of technical measures such as filters and acoustic warning signals, and also about the possibility of direct intervention in services that offend against the dignity of young people or are a danger to them. These certainly deserve our full support and should be implemented to the same degree in every Member State.
I would, though, like to remind you that - as the report also points out - many safety arrangements are not there to supplant the responsibilities of the parents, who must, at the end of the day, be the ultimate and most important regulators.
We will otherwise not be able to prevent the situation arising where young people may well be unable to buy swastika banners over the Internet, but can do so in the nearest flea market.
Preventing that is a task for the educator and not for the censor.
Mr President, of course, we wish to thank the rapporteur and the Commission for this work and for the evaluation report.
I am not going to repeat what other speakers have said but I should like to mention, Commissioner, three specific cases that have been brought to my attention this week.
The first concerns the mother of a handicapped teenager who goes out to work.
For some time, every evening, she has had to go and fetch him, because he is supposed to return home from work at around 5 p.m. but there, he has free access to pornographic sites.
This is happening in a major city in France.
As things stand, she cannot turn to the local police to close down these sites.
Secondly, a letter that I received this week informed me of a site funded jointly by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education.
This site states that the role of adults is to allow children to sample everything, to try every experience.
And there are a number of very specific examples - I shall provide the relevant documents later - funded from the public purse, of the type of thing our children are looking at these days.
Thirdly, organisations that fight against paedophilia last week sent me a CD-ROM which brings together a large amount of information that is currently available.
This CD-ROM was sent to authorities such as Europol over a year ago and no progress at all has yet been made on the matter.
Soon, Commissioner, on 8 May, a world summit on children will take place.
This afternoon, we will be voting on a resolution on the matter.
We would like you, between now and this summit, to hold a meeting with all of the competent bodies to tell us what practical measures you intend to adopt in this field in order to combat this phenomenon.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Beazley, for having succeeded in reaching agreement on all the points under discussion.
I must tell you that the Commission supports Parliament, just as Parliament supports the Commission.
We have a shared aim, which is to protect our children.
There are different ways of achieving this, as the honourable Members have rightly stated, and in order to accomplish this objective we must, therefore, join forces.
I have listened with great interest to the specific and shocking examples provided by the speakers.
There are thousands of such examples, which merely confirm our feeling that we must translate our words into action and that we will not be able to resolve the problems in the European institutions alone, but that concerted action by all key players is necessary, including the NGOs working to protect minors and human dignity, at both European as well as national or regional level.
As the report states, progress has already been made in a very short time.
For example, associations of Internet Service Providers have been established in most Member States and the ISPs in most Member States are members of the European Internet Service Providers' Association (EuroISPA), which has promoted the adoption of codes of conduct for the responsibility of providers.
Hotlines have been set up in the vast majority of Member States to deal with complaints about illegal or offensive content.
The European Commission is supporting the creation of these hotlines with its action plan for safer Internet use.
According to the information provided by the Member States, it seems that the majority of Internet sites advocating political extremism or which depict sexual violence, and very many paedophile or pornographic sites are located outside the European Union, hence the importance of a strategy in this field that is not only European, but global.
At the same time, the industry is also working on establishing classification and filtering systems, on the creation of protected areas or 'walled gardens'; portals in which ISPs guarantee the quality of the sites to which they provide access.
The Community action plan for safer Internet use is also encouraging these initiatives.
There have certainly been some very positive experiences, but there have also been sites which are, unfortunately, appalling, and which cannot be effectively closed down.
With regard to the application of the recommendation by radio stations and television companies, all the Member States now have devices available which ensure that programmes likely to harm minors are preceded by a warning sound or have a symbol on the screen throughout the programme.
We know full well that the times that are supposedly 'closed' to children no longer have any meaning today, because our children are perfectly capable of recording programmes that are broadcast whilst they are fast asleep.
Furthermore, filter systems can only be used with digital television.
It will, therefore, be easier to filter programmes when digital television is up and running, but for the moment, this is happening very slowly.
In 1999, the Commission had a study produced on parental control of television programmes, which recommended giving the greatest emphasis to self-regulation whilst making filter devices available to families at an affordable price.
I agree, on this point, with all Members of the House who approve of self-regulation, on condition that this is backed by legislation.
This is the direction we must concentrate on in future.
Mr President, I should like to close by answering some specific questions raised by honourable Members.
First of all, I shall address my comments to the rapporteur, Mr Beazely: it would be premature to present a new report by the end of 2002, but under the review, we shall take all of Parliament's observations into account.
We shall continue our work, but the report will probably not be ready by the end of 2002.
Secondly, with regard to the system of classification, a new study on classification was started by my staff in January and should be completed by the second half of 2002.
It will be forwarded to Parliament and we will discuss it and draw the relevant conclusions from it.
Thirdly, media education: as I have said on many occasions, this is one of my competences, one of my objectives.
Our children learn, to a greater or lesser degree, to read, write and to do arithmetic, but they never to learn to read and to gauge this society of images that surrounds them.
This is why we have launched the first pilot projects for image education.
This is also why the forthcoming 'Net-Days' in November 2002, which will link up hundreds of thousands of school classes in most of the Member States and, furthermore, in other parts of the world, will this year be dedicated to image education and image analysis.
Our approach, therefore, is extremely practical.
To conclude, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that a single Commissioner, the European Parliament or the Commission alone cannot deal with all of these issues.
This is why the proposals will be studied in conjunction with all the Commissioners responsible for the areas affected by this issue, and with institutions other than the Commission that have responsibility in this area, such as Europol, for example.
What is needed is concerted action, which we shall continue to implement.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0035/2002) by Mrs De Sarnez, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, on the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on strengthening cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education [COM(2001) 385 - C5-0538/2001 - 2001/2217(COS)].
Mr President, before presenting my report, I should like, first of all, to thank all my colleagues for their amendments, which have improved this text, and also the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, who has delivered an extremely good opinion.
The aim of the report I am presenting is to consider, on the basis of the communication by the Commission, ways of making the Member States more competitive and attractive in the international training market.
We all know that the issue of training is of great importance for the coming years.
Students the whole world over are increasingly looking beyond their own borders for the training that offers them the best prospects.
Consequently, we are seeing the burgeoning of a real international market in training.
It so happens that in Europe we have fewer students from third countries than the United States, Australia or Canada, to give a few examples.
We therefore have a great deal of ground to make up and this is why my report makes a number of proposals.
Firstly, we must have a detailed survey on the international mobility of students, since none exists at the moment.
It would, therefore, be useful if the European Commission, through the good offices of Eurostat, could work in close cooperation with Unesco and the OECD in order to give us a clear and detailed overview of the mobility of foreign students. And it is finally time, I believe, to propose a harmonised definition of what constitutes a foreign student.
My second proposal is that we must move towards harmonising the quality of higher education and the recognition of diplomas and studies.
The European Union must be able to provide high-quality training, whatever the university or the host country.
It is crucial for students to be able to start a degree in one Member State and complete it in another with the guarantee of seeing the knowledge they have acquired validated by a diploma that is recognised in all Member States.
I therefore propose that the Commission continue to improve and to promote the university studies validation system known as the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and that this should inspire it to develop new programmes for mobility.
We must also promote the creation of joint courses between Member State universities in order to achieve, wherever possible, the award of joint diplomas.
Thirdly, I propose that a European university label be established, which would be awarded to training modules provided in higher education establishments recognised for the quality of their teaching and of the reception they give to students of third countries.
This university label would focus less on the quality of the university as an institution than on the modules it teaches.
I feel sure that this will enable us to help promote European higher education and will send a clear signal to foreign students.
Fourthly, we must also encourage the promotion of language learning.
Language learning is an undisputed factor of mobility and this is why it would be desirable for the Member States to systematically establish the teaching of foreign languages in the form of modules in all institutions of higher education and also for teaching of the language of the host country to be made available to foreign students.
My fifth point is that we must also guarantee high-quality reception facilities.
Universities must now focus their efforts on ensuring that they provide these high-quality reception facilities for foreign students.
They must be helped to deal with the administrative arrangements that they will necessarily have to face.
They must be helped to find accommodation and to obtain grants.
These high-quality reception facilities will be one of the criteria on which the award of the European university label will depend.
My sixth and final point is that we must make use of existing programmes of cooperation that have already proved their value, such as the ALFA programme.
Consequently, the new programmes should take account of the enormous importance of the drawing up of joint study programmes and the development of systems for the reciprocal recognition of courses of study and diplomas and partnership with undertakings, with local authorities or with multilateral organisations.
The aim of this report is, therefore, to urge the European Union and the Member States to take action to make European higher education dynamic, competitive and attractive.
The competitiveness and attractiveness of European higher education must, of course, start taking shape in the Member States first of all.
The Member States' Ministers of Education are aware of this and raise the point at every Education Council meeting.
I am sure that the European Commission and Parliament are today willing to do everything they can in order to achieve the creation of a European area of knowledge that is attractive and competitive, and ultimately able to make its presence felt in international competition.
Mr President, it has now become clear that an international training market does exist; the fact that the European Union's involvement in the evolution of the international market in education is very slight and not in keeping with its cultural traditions is something of which the Union itself is aware, and the Commission was right to raise the matter in its communication.
Mrs De Sarnez's work is excellent and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy has made a positive contribution.
In addition to the communication's huge technical content and the many considerations and proposals we are presenting to the Commission with a view to strengthening cooperation in the field of higher education, there is another, extremely important issue: the quality of the training provided.
The draft resolution contains over ten paragraphs on guaranteeing high-quality higher education, but it can clearly go no further, given the technical nature of the suggestions and proposals.
The issue of the quality of training warrants further analysis, for the quality depends on the extent to which the training fosters the human development of the young generations.
Cultural and vocational development is based partly on the development of the human dimension, on respect for one's own life and the lives of others.
When young people are committing suicide for what appears to be no reason at all - as happens in the West - or when they use their bodies as instruments of death to kill defenceless people - as happens in the Middle East - we must look closely at the causes of this distortion of values and at what we can do in terms of training, understood, not least, to mean fostering human development and an awareness of the dignity of the individual, in order to prevent such unusual behaviour.
This is no longer just a technical issue: it is a question of philosophy and education too.
In this regard, I wonder whether we should not start to extend the Union's responsibilities beyond the limits of harmonising rules and do more than just develop cooperation tools.
We fully support the creation of centres of excellence, towards a European university label, just as we are in favour of the Union taking on a role in promoting high-quality university teaching.
It is worth trying to set every possible wheel in motion to harness the high-quality human resources available in order to improve the quality of training, so that culture and education become sources of life-giving energy which remains with people throughout their lives.
Quality in the sense of providing tools for intelligent living, then: that is the primary goal of training.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, on behalf of our group, to thank Mrs De Sarnez, who has drafted an excellent report.
I would like to point out that this 'Europe of knowledge', which we have come to use as a common expression, has to give an account of itself at an international level.
This is an important challenge, and the declarations at Lisbon and Barcelona, or what was adopted in Bologna or Prague, are also important. If, though, they only result in everything being done, at the end of the day, in a so-called open coordination that bypasses Parliament, then that is something we simply cannot agree to.
We agree with the contents, but also want to be involved.
The challenges we face are great.
As I have said, we have to give an account of ourselves, and I agree with Mrs De Sarnez that we must increasingly see to it that our education becomes more appealing and more competitive.
In the European Union, we need something like a community with a first-rate knowledge-based society, of which we can then make real use.
For that, we need more mobility.
As Mrs De Sarnez has already said, mobility and the quality of our education are the most important things, and so there are of course a number of things we have to do.
We must also make it our concern that more languages are taught and learned in higher education institutions.
We must make it our concern to have more common leaving certificates.
The Franco-German college in Germany, at which common leaving certificates can be taken, could serve as an example for many other European higher education institutions.
In competition, we should stand or fall by whether we get this on the move.
The university label proposed by Mrs De Sarnez strikes me as excellent, and so we must work at making it a reality.
We must also act more quickly than we have in the past to ensure that leaving certificates and diplomas are at last recognised.
We have been saying this for ever and a day and yet progress is being made at a snail's pace.
This is damaging our young people, and I do think this is a challenge for all of us and one that we should take up.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have this report - for which I should like to thank Mrs de Sarnez - the time is right for the European Union to reflect on what it means by the right to education, and more specifically higher education, and how it intends to implement this right.
The twentieth century has seen human rights universally accepted as the main guiding force behind what we do.
Our responsibility has to be to see them fully respected and put into practice, because education is not only an individual right; it is also an essential means of promoting peace - a crucial issue today - and ensuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in general.
If its potential for building a world of peace is to be realised, education needs to be widely available and made equally accessible to all.
It is a huge task, but let us not forget that even today we live in a world where there are more than 800 million illiterate adults and almost 100 million children of secondary school age who do not have access to a school.
Moreover, millions of those in school today are not able to benefit from high-quality teaching that meets their basic educational needs.
It is therefore increasingly urgent for us to meet these needs in a world where the upheaval caused by globalisation and by the revolution in information and communication technology is marginalising entire peoples, who have been plunged into the most extreme poverty and who are easy prey for extremists of all kinds.
Making the right to education a reality is now less a question of access to education than of access to adequate training programmes for everyone so as to meet basic needs.
From this point of view, the right to higher education is - on our own evidence - not yet a reality, in particular for women.
Higher education shall, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit, but in Africa and Asia fewer than one person in ten in the age group concerned is in higher education, and the gulf is continuing to widen between these regions on the one hand and Europe and North America on the other.
There is no doubt that considerable progress has been made in the last 50 years towards making the right to higher education a reality throughout the world, but we should not forget that this vision, which is laid down in Article 26, is not only quantitative but also qualitative because it encompasses the aims and objectives of education and thus its content.
Mindful of the task which remains to be accomplished - and with repeated thanks to Mrs De Sarnez for her report - I therefore think that it is essential, as far as those who are still excluded from any form of education are concerned, for us to be aware that it is not a question of choice, but that a great many people do not even know that they have a choice.
If we are talking about dignity, demands, and equal and inalienable rights, I hope from the bottom of my heart that this report will enable the European Parliament to continue to fight for these things and that it will not stop fighting when the battle is only half won.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Europe, we have been familiar with the phenomenon of the mobility of students and lecturers in higher education for a long time. Such mobility greatly contributes to mutual understanding within Europe.
It is truly the shop floor on which understanding is shared.
The Commission is now calling for this process to be extended and intensified so as to include third countries.
In her thorough report, Mrs De Sarnez makes the correct assumption that high-quality higher education is required.
That the European Credit Transfer System must be improved and promoted in this respect goes without saying. As does the fact that closer cooperation with third countries also requires the development of new cooperation programmes in higher education.
The EU has already set up cooperation programmes with America and with Canada, but I should like to fight for cooperation in the field of higher education with the developing countries.
According to the Commission, one of the objectives of cooperation with third countries is to train highly qualified people.
This is certainly very important for developing countries.
The mobility of people and ideas has an extremely stimulating effect on all participating institutions within and outside Europe.
Education in general is the best way of eradicating poverty in the world, and this certainly applies to developing countries.
Strict exchange arrangements will be needed to stave off a brain drain.
I would therefore call on the Commission, in its incentives policy, to pay extra attention to cooperation in the field of higher education
A second point I should like to bring up is the use of e-learning.
For many universities, especially in Developing Countries, it is not always financially possible to fund extensive exchange programmes.
Precisely for them, the use of e-learning is extremely important, with a view both to gathering knowledge and to spreading their own knowledge.
The Commission should therefore pay extra attention to this aspect in its policy in the field of development cooperation.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this interesting report.
Collaboration at the academic and cultural level in Europe does of course need to be improved, but educational differences in certain areas, which produce different results, form part of Member States' national traditions.
This only becomes dangerous if education fails to reach a certain standard.
In the past, for example, this often led to the situation in which graduates in medicine from one Member States were not, because of educational standards, permitted to work in others.
Crossing borders when changing from one university to another also becomes impossible if the same minimum standard is not guaranteed.
The announcement of academic and cultural cooperation with candidate states is, however, particularly to be welcomed.
We who live on the border with Eastern Europe know these countries very well.
Many here will be astonished to learn that, in the twin areas of culture and education, we might even have a few things to learn from the Eastern European candidate states.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mrs De Sarnez on her report, which gives a sound and clear overview of the present situation in higher education, the existing programmes and the possible forms of cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education.
The summary she gave us a moment ago is excellent.
In the Seventeenth century, some 40% of all students at the universities in the Netherlands were of foreign origin.
With the advent of the national state, education became increasingly national.
We now see another trend towards internationalisation, and this is also necessary.
With the enlargement and extension of Europe, we need more people whose hearts are in Europe and who have a feel for Europe, together with a knowledge of, and a feel for, the various countries, languages and cultures.
But the world extends beyond Europe, and it is becoming, as it were, increasingly smaller due to growing mobility and further internationalisation.
Not for nothing is the term 'global village' used.
The digital knowledge-based society turns the world into a single coherent whole.
This creates a demand not only for citizens who have technical and scientific knowledge, but also for citizens with a feel for world citizenship.
And this is precisely why cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education is important.
A society must be supported by its citizens.
The Ancient Greeks already recognised the significance of education towards citizenship.
They observed that politics, training and education towards responsibility belong together.
Education plays an important role in integration. It is a well-known fact that it can contribute to greater understanding and, as a result, to better relations.
It is important for the EU to seek, and intensify, cooperation.
Even if education is a national competence, more harmonisation is possible and necessary.
This report is about cooperation with third countries.
As has been said before, Europe does not appear to be the first choice of students who wish to study aboard for a while.
The US is still far more appealing.
This is partly due to the language problem, but this is not the only reason.
The quality of the curriculum, the reputation of the institution, as well as the recognition of qualifications play an important role.
I agree with the report that we in Europe must work towards a consistent and high level of education, which inevitably goes hand in hand with a command of languages, international recognition of qualifications, a Credit Transfer System, at least at European level, and more flexible opportunities for students from third countries who study in one Member State to also study temporarily in another EU country.
Finally, I should like to focus on the importance this has for development cooperation.
It is crucial for the advancement of a country.
It is a sound proposal to critically analyse the EU programmes in this respect and to look for other options.
Mr President, the Commission communication, although somewhat late in arriving, seeks to address and resolve the issue of the sensitive relationship between the European Union and the international training market, the principle leaders of which are currently the United States and some European countries, which are, moreover, in competition.
The initiation of this debate and the excellent report by Mrs De Sarnez would appear to be extremely important within the European Union, particularly in the field of higher education, for they highlight how little Europe has been involved thus far.
Evidence of this is the mere existence of national bilateral exchange programmes developed by the Member States.
However, I feel that the two goals identified for cooperation between the EU and third countries are particularly positive: firstly, the development of high-quality human resources, which can only be achieved through high-quality training or education; and secondly, the promotion of a world centre of excellence for study, training and research situated in Europe.
I would also have liked to see some sort of reference to Cedefop and the Turin agency, which contribute a great deal in this field, particularly as regards research.
However, the issue is not just the quality of courses and programmes but the mutual recognition of qualifications too, an area in which we are guilty of being severely behind schedule.
We therefore need to establish transnational training modules of certified, recognised quality, provide incentives for student exchange programmes and language learning and improve the study grant system, providing vocational integration grants for students from third countries, who, although certainly free to choose where to settle down and work, might be more useful if a vocational integration grant were available to enable them to go home to their own States and contribute to their development.
This is certainly a major challenge - a challenge for the Europe of culture and values - which we cannot afford not to take up and in which we must succeed.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate our colleague Mrs De Sarnez on her excellent work on an issue of such great importance to all Europeans.
I am saying nothing new when I tell you that education does not fall within the competence of the Community. Furthermore, in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, of which I am a member, each time we talk about education issues, one of our colleagues takes note of how many times the word 'subsidiarity' comes up in the debate.
However, one of the fundamental rights of EU citizens is the free movement of persons, a right denied to European citizens insofar as there is no recognition of qualifications that enables citizens to go and work in another EU country.
At this very moment, the large number of students on the Erasmus programme who spend a whole year studying in another Member State come back to find that this year abroad has been a waste of time, because it is not recognised in their country of origin.
This is a totally unacceptable situation, all the more so because, when faced with this situation, many of these students, instead of going to another EU Member State, prefer to go to the United States or to Canada and spend a year there to master the language.
I believe that we should avoid this situation by improving conditions within the European Union.
It is very important for students to have the opportunity to spend a year outside their own countries, for the opportunity to live alongside other EU citizens, for the training that this experience provides and for the opportunity this offers them to learn and perfect another European language, which is so important for us as EU citizens.
For these reasons, I would like to express my support for Mrs De Sarnez in her call for the creation of a European university label, for improved international student mobility, the promotion of further language learning and, above all, for the harmonisation of higher education that will, without a doubt, have to lead to the recognition of qualifications.
First of all - and this is sincerely meant - I should like to thank the Members and their rapporteurs for their in-depth work and for studying the Commission proposals in a spirit of solidarity.
It is very important for Parliament and the Commission to work side by side.
As others have stressed, it is not easy sometimes, given the lack of legislation, to establish a system for collaborating directly with Parliament in the field of education.
I regret this and hope that it will change.
I have already said several times to Parliament, when I have appeared before the relevant parliamentary committee, that I will keep it abreast of any new developments and that I would welcome initiatives from Members to enable the Commission to take account of Parliament's proposals, which are very important in this particular field.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication which was adopted last July by the Commission sought to launch the debate on cooperation with third countries, taking into account many of the points which have been made by honourable Members: globalisation, increasing international mobility, Europe's lack of competitiveness in the international education market, and the need to foster an understanding of other cultures amongst our own young people and those in third countries.
The Commission reiterated that cooperation with third countries is based on Article 149 of the Treaty.
I would also add that above and beyond the Treaty this cooperation is one of the ways of fostering dialogue between civilisations.
On this basis, the Commission drew two conclusions: firstly, that if we build bridges between universities within the European Union - which is what we are in the process of doing - we also need to build bridges between these European universities and those in other continents.
This is precisely the subject of the report before us.
Secondly, we must ensure that our work in this area is more visible, so as to promote Europe as a centre of excellence and so as to attract students seeking an international education.
We have identified two objectives: firstly, to train high-quality human resources in the partner countries and in the Community through our system of reciprocal development of human resources.
We do not want a brain drain, but we do want the students who have been trained over here - not in one single country but in several because this is where the European added value that we have to offer lies - to return to their countries and, in a context of globalisation, we want them to know what is at stake when, as adults, they are called upon to make decisions in the private or public sector.
Secondly, obviously we want to promote the Community as an international centre of excellence for studying.
We have centres of excellence - they exist - but we need to link them up and make them more competitive because they will already be well known.
We are making progress, ladies and gentlemen, by taking specific action.
The first specific action is the Tempus programme, which has been extended to our MEDA partners.
This initiative is, of course, part of the Barcelona Process, but it also fits in with the idea of strengthening cooperation in the field of higher education, which is the subject of the communication.
The rapporteur mentioned the ALFA programme.
I can tell her that we are in the process of developing ALFA Plus for the countries of Central and South America.
Within the institutional framework of inter-university relations, ALFA Plus proposes to award more than 3 000 study grants to postgraduate students, who will be admitted to our universities.
You can see that we are working at a very practical level to develop pilot actions in other continents.
Moreover, we intend to continue working on similar initiatives.
We fully agree with the basic analysis of the European Parliament and the Member States.
Here, for once, we have a wonderful unanimity on the issue which concerns us.
Furthermore, the Commission has taken note of the requests to draft a framework proposal in response to the analyses that have been made.
We are already working on this and I might even be able to launch the proposal this year.
You will understand, Mrs de Sarnez, ladies and gentlemen, that I am not at liberty to divulge the details now, but we will most certainly take account of the many ideas contained in Mrs de Sarnez's report.
I will of course keep the parliamentary committee concerned informed.
Mr President, with your permission, I should now like to respond very briefly to some of the proposals made by Mrs de Sarnez.
I think that I have already answered her questions on the pilot actions, ALFA, Tempus, and so on.
The rapporteur asks us to analyse quality in universities and to establish joint courses of study with joint diplomas, using the ECTS validation scheme.
Well, that is what we are in the process of doing.
We are setting up pilot projects whereby three or four universities from three or four countries will collaborate on the basis of a joint curriculum leading to a European Masters degree.
There are plans for the university chancellors to meet for a major conference in Berlin in 2003 where they will make presentations on the pilot actions, which will have been launched by then; some of them will get underway during the current academic year, but in the majority of cases it will be during the 2002/2003 academic year.
We will, therefore, analyse the initial results in Berlin, and I very much hope that the initiative will snowball and that, when they see how positive it is, many universities will want to be involved in this new system.
As far as the detailed survey on international mobility is concerned, I think, Mrs de Sarnez, that this analysis is something that will have to be done mainly by the OECD and Unesco.
We are in discussions with these two institutions, but, to conclude their analyses successfully, they need to overcome problems with the comparability of statistics and statistics which are outdated and which have therefore been overtaken by events.
But we think that these are the institutions that should do this.
We will be collaborating closely with them.
Turning now to the quality of the reception provided, administrative procedures, accommodation and grants, I should like to reiterate that the French Presidency organised a major meeting of education ministers at the Sorbonne who spent a whole day discussing obstacles to mobility.
All of the results were put on paper and signed by our Heads of State and Government at the Nice Summit.
The high-level political decision exists.
The problem that we have is that progress is not being made as rapidly on the ground because these are issues which need to be addressed by national governments.
And I am not even talking about education ministers because often it is Social Security ministers or Home Office ministers who need to get involved here.
We therefore need to exert friendly pressure on our governments to remove these barriers to mobility, which often are relatively trivial.
We are however making progress here too.
Let me give you an example: in some countries the grants awarded by the State to their students were not exportable, which seriously hampered mobility.
However, most of the ministers concerned have taken measures making it possible for their students to continue to benefit from a grant whilst they are studying abroad.
My final point is languages.
As you know, 2001 was the European Year of Languages.
This has set things moving.
I say this full of admiration for the speedy response of many Education ministers, who have undertaken reforms of their school systems to enable children to learn one or more foreign languages from an early age.
I can tell you that at the Barcelona Summit the Heads of State and Government adopted our slogan of 'mother tongue plus two'.
Things are moving then and progress is being made, not quickly enough, but we are going in the right direction.
With Parliament's help, I am sure that we will be able to move forward more quickly towards our shared vision.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the Commission Statement on the Second United Nations World Assembly on Ageing (Madrid, 8 to 12 April 2002).
Mr President, on 18 March, the Commission adopted a communication as its contribution to the Second World Assembly on Ageing, which is being organised by the United Nations and hosted by the Spanish Government in Madrid from 8 to 12 April 2002.
The Commission's communication is entitled, 'Europe's response to World Ageing - promoting economic and social progress in an ageing world'.
This communication addresses the phenomenon of ageing in Europe against the background of worldwide ageing.
First of all, Europe's population is one of the oldest in the world, and European countries will continue to be prominent in the league of ageing nations for several more decades yet.
Ageing is, however, no longer essentially a problem peculiar to developing countries.
Today it is also - and increasingly - becoming a concern of developing countries.
In a number of these countries, ageing will be a much more rapid process and will take place against a background of a level of development which is markedly lower than in Western Europe.
Ageing is therefore a problem which, in the Twenty-First century, will require not a European response but a global response.
The approach adopted by the Commission is based on three points:
Firstly, the population is ageing rapidly.
Enlargement will not affect this situation at all, and neither will immigration, although it may have a slight influence on this process.
Nevertheless, demography is not a destiny.
The political responses to ageing will determine the impact that it has on European societies.
Secondly, ageing is the result of a combination of several social processes and should be considered as a trend which interacts with other phenomena.
The response must therefore constitute an integral part of the global strategy, which is made up of mutually supportive policies.
Thirdly, although the living conditions and possibilities open to the elderly are an important concern at any time, if we are to adapt successfully to ageing, people of all ages will be affected.
A life-long approach can therefore make it easier to put in place adequate political measures.
The main part of the communication describes the way in which we need to act at European level.
The Commission has identified ageing as one of the six common challenges of sustainable development, and the Member States have taken decisive measures to step up cooperation on ageing problems.
The Member States have committed themselves to coordinating their work and we are starting to see a similar tendency for health care.
We have identified the main challenges together.
They are: anticipating an increase in expenditure while guaranteeing sound public finances; adjusting to an ageing and shrinking workforce; guaranteeing adequate, sustainable and adaptable pensions and guaranteeing ageing Europeans access to high-quality health care for long periods of time.
Over and above the experience which the European Union has acquired in considering its response to ageing, the communication also takes account of the problems faced by candidate countries and developing countries at a global level.
Taken as a whole, the communication is a contribution by the Commission to the debate on the new International Plan of Action on Ageing, which is to be adopted.
It is therefore intended to support Member States' efforts to establish a uniform Union position on this problem.
On Monday, my colleague, Anna Diamantopoulou, gave a presentation to the World Assembly in Madrid on recent developments in the European Union's position on the problem of ageing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Reding for coming here today to inform us of the Commission's new strategies on ageing.
This subject, which I strongly urged should be included in today's debate, must lead us all and, in general, the European Union, which I feel needs to show more determination and sensitivity in its approach, to greater reflection.
In the future, our institutions are going to be called upon increasingly to respond quickly and effectively to the new challenges posed by the increase in the average life expectancy, and to provide the elderly throughout the world with an increasingly high standard of living.
Indeed, the phenomenon of the ageing of society affects all countries, both the more advanced and the developing countries, although in markedly different ways, and due consideration of these differences in impact reveals the need for different approaches and initiatives.
I therefore feel that the European Parliament, the institution which is the voice of the citizens of Europe, must adopt an official position at the Second United Nations World Assembly, due to close tomorrow in Madrid, and we shall do this by voting on the joint motion for a resolution today.
Indeed, the protection of and respect for the dignity of this section of the population needs to be fully guaranteed, and a debate must be opened on the future of the third and fourth ages.
This distinction is not based on biological age but rather on the degree of self-sufficiency of an elderly person.
Indeed, it is necessary to distinguish between the elderly of the third age, who are still fully active and have the right not to be excluded from social, cultural, political and economic life, citizens who are a resource for our society rather than just a problem, and those who belong to the fourth age and, although no longer self-sufficient, still have the right to live a dignified life and enjoy full respect for their dignity.
That is why, Mr President, I call upon the House to give its full support to the resolution we are to vote on today.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your contributions.
In actual fact, this is not perhaps the best time for this discussion.
It would have been better either to have adopted a resolution before the assembly on ageing that is taking place right now under the auspices of the UN and so have been able to influence it, or else perhaps to have adopted a resolution subsequently once we had been able to assess the assembly's conclusions.
However, it is encouraging that the European Parliament is so unified in its view of ageing.
All too often, we see ageing as a problem.
I, for my part, cannot see it as a problem that people live longer and are more and more healthy at ever more advanced ages.
Rather, it is very encouraging and an asset to our societies.
However, we in the Member States of the EU are very bad at making use of the skills possessed by the older portion of the population, particularly in the world of work.
In the majority of the Member States, the formal pensionable age is approximately 65 while the actual pensionable age is very much lower.
People are thrown out of work for a variety of reasons.
It is the result of discrimination against older people, something which does in actual fact occur and must be got to grips with, as to some extent it has been.
It is also the result of poor working environments that cause people to become exhausted before their time.
Last but not least, it has to do with the fact that, in our knowledge-based society where it is increasingly important to develop one's skills and engage in lifelong learning, older people are not given the opportunity to do just that.
If they were to be given that opportunity, there would also be a very much greater opportunity to make use of their skills.
It is important that we retain the European social model, that is to say a social security system with high-quality, developed health care and medical services.
This is crucial, especially for the most elderly people of all who have a great need for health care and medical treatment.
In the future, the need will become greater because women, who have previously assumed responsibility for providing a large part of that care, have now entered the labour market and will continue to do so to an ever-greater degree.
This demands even more of society in terms of developing resources so that the elderly receive dignified care when they become really old and have greatest need of it.
We must also adopt a global perspective, as the Commission has done.
It is important that we monitor developments beyond our borders and try to form a global strategy covering the status of the elderly throughout the world.
Mr President, one of the key issues regarding ageing, as people have said, is to tackle age discrimination itself, particularly in the labour market, in healthcare and so on. In our view that is going to need more than codes of conduct, which do not seem to be working particularly fast.
As others have said, it is important, too, that we recognise the contribution of older people who are already keeping society and our economy going, by acting as carers offering childcare, for example, so that their children can go out to work, or by acting as volunteers.
Indeed, in a number of countries the local government system, let alone the parliamentary system, would probably collapse without their input.
The key thing as others have said, is for us to stop perpetuating the image of people, like many of us in this Chamber, as a burden on society and its services, and to see us as much more of an asset.
Indeed, in future we will need to be even more fully involved in our societies.
We look to our societies and to our governments to act internationally to create a sustainable future so that we can change the situation of poverty in which many people live.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strategy of the international action of the United Nations World Assembly advocates the commitment to create a society for all ages, with political and financial means dedicated to achieving this.
It is, therefore, crucial that the European Union and its Member States give this commitment, incorporating issues of ageing into Community policies and including the elderly in their social, economic and development programmes, paying particular attention to elderly people at risk of isolation and by developing the principle of active ageing, promoting opportunities for the elderly to participate in social and cultural life.
There are various ways in which this can be done, as Mrs Lambert has already mentioned.
Although the issue of ageing is generally associated with long-term concerns, it already presents a major challenge for society and for governments because of its profound implications for policies of social security, employment, education, health, immigration and the family. This means that the necessary measures must be adopted to ensure that the income and resources available to elderly and retired people remain in line with average living standards in society.
It is unacceptable that concerns about public spending and pressures for compliance with the Stability Pact should have a negative effect on the living standards of the elderly, as suggested in the recent decision of the Barcelona European Council to increase the age of retirement by five years by 2010, which we find unacceptable, and in the statements by the current President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Aznar, at the opening of the Second UN Assembly on ageing, when he called for changes to the pensions system, to working hours and to the age of retirement, all of which involve the same issues.
It is crucial that we move ahead with integrated social policies, that we promote intergenerational solidarity, that we pay particular attention to issues of universal access to healthcare and of the quality of services provided and that we attach greater importance to the use of the free time of the elderly.
We hope that the Commission will propose an action programme that is specific to the elderly and which takes account of all these aspects in an integrated vision, having listened to organisations representing pensioners and the elderly.
The European Union must also demonstrate greater commitment to providing international aid to developing countries in order to enable them to develop policies in the field of ageing, specifically for women and in order to combat Aids.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and I support the work that has been carried out on a subject of such major importance as the ageing population of our countries, of our continent.
I feel that we should all genuinely see elderly people as our human heritage: their wisdom, their knowledge and the history of which they are the living exponents are not fully valued or exploited.
There have been many sincere efforts in recent years in our countries, in Europe too, to provide systems of guarantees and dignity for all elderly people - and rightly so.
Of course, more has been done in some areas than in others, and I therefore feel that Europe needs to develop policies ensuring a minimum level of guarantees and focus on the world of the elderly, a level which is the same in all the countries of the Union and must be proposed as a goal for the candidate countries too.
Without a doubt, European society took as its starting point the awareness that being in economic difficulties - being poor - is always difficult, being poor and ill is both difficult and complicated, but being poor, ill and old too is absolutely awful.
I feel that less has been done, on the other hand, to attempt to give the elderly a political and institutional position too, to attempt to keep all elderly people in the active world for as long as possible, to make their departure from the world of work more gradual. There you are.
I feel that this is the major challenge facing us all, and that the solution lies precisely in a more flexible vision of the world of work itself, in more intelligent use of the professional skills of the people concerned.
Mr President, we have to address this question of the ageing of our population from the point of view of having a society for all ages, as our motion indicates.
There are real risks if we simply address this question from an economic point of view, regarding and valuing citizens simply for the contribution they can make to the economy or the workforce.
Society, as this House knows, is a much wider concept than the economy, and that must be our starting-point.
The question of income for older people depends on the extent to which we retain the European social model of a contribution from people who are in work to those who, at various points in their lives, either through illness or old age, will no longer be able to take part in the workforce.
It is, therefore, essential to secure an efficient and effective taxation system and efficient and effective social insurance system.
Most of all, we need to have a pensions reserve fund, so that there can be inter-generational solidarity between this generation and not just the next generation but also the generation after that.
It is important that all Member States take this on board.
I also want to draw attention to what I consider to be a mistaken view by Mrs Diamantopoulou, who seems to think that the solution to the ageing of our population is for us all to become more fertile: to have more babies.
That is a cop-out.
This simply will not happen - certainly not in the wealthier parts of Europe.
We have to therefore grapple seriously with the whole issue of immigration.
It is not enough to talk about the need to ensure that developing countries have sufficient resources to feed and to provide for their own people.
Of course, we need to do that, but no matter how often or how well we do that, there will still be a need for people to move into the wealthier parts of Europe.
I contend that we must stop this idea that we can build a fortress Europe and keep out these millions upon millions of people who want to come to Europe.
They want to make a contribution to Europe, and we would all be the better for it, both economically and culturally.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the World Assembly on Ageing organised by the Spanish Presidency, which is taking place 20 years on from the first conference on the subject, is certainly a unique opportunity for the entire world, not just the developed countries, to be able to focus on the extremely important and no less topical subject of the ageing population, which is the result of the new demographic trend, and the increase in average life expectancy, which is due, not least, to the progress made in medical science.
I hope that, when the economic, social and health consequences of the increase in average life expectancy and the ageing population are discussed and analysed, the emphasis will not just be on the role that elderly people must be able to play in modern society today but also on the right, for example, of each elderly person who loses their independence to continue to enjoy a guaranteed quality of life.
We need all the States of the European Union to focus once again, more intently, on promoting the active involvement of elderly people in social and cultural life.
Indeed, it would be very valuable for our society to aim at adopting that approach, for it must treat the elderly person not just as a potential user of services but as a person who is still useful to society as a whole too.
I warmly welcome the new Community programme that the Commission is preparing to launch in the second half of the year - not least because the Commission has not done a great deal on this matter thus far - in an attempt to remedy a situation which the Commission itself has described as disturbing in terms of the preservation of the quality of life of elderly people.
In other words, there needs to be an effective, coordinated action at European level if we are to address the issue of ageing, which is both a challenge and, at the same time, an emergency, a burden on the future of all the European States, particularly my country, Italy, where Genoa holds the record for the city with the greatest proportion of elderly people in the entire Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Saturday, in Madrid, I participated in one of the many round tables organised within the NGO forum that accompanied the Second United Nations World Assembly on Ageing.
At this meeting, it was revealed that ageing is a phenomenon affecting both the North and the South, despite the growing divide and inequality between societies in the developed world and those of countries that are fighting to overcome underdevelopment.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect was understanding that, regardless of location, there are three specific priorities for the elderly.
The first concerns healthcare at an age when people's health requires care that is more and more costly; the second is the guarantee of economic security in order that the elderly can continue to live independently when, because of their age, they have to stop working; and the third is the social consideration, respect and appreciation that society adopts towards the elderly, not only in recognition of the services they have provided - which should also be the case - but also with regard to the role and function these elderly people should fulfil within our social framework.
A satisfactory response to these three priorities will increasingly enable the elderly to live in dignity longer, which is to be welcomed.
In general terms, the EU Member States have managed to respond in a way that basically satisfies the two first priorities: health care and economic security, although benefits are often frankly inadequate and need to be increased, and we must remain alert to any potential threats to such benefits.
On the other hand, little or no progress has been made on the third priority, that of consideration and respect for the role of the elderly in our societies.
The picture in the developing world is even worse.
In these countries, none of the three stated priorities have been satisfactorily met and, if there is any sign at all, this is to be found in the third area, that of respect for the elderly and of assuming shared responsibility for them, in which some positive signs have been reported.
Within the demographic factors that alter migratory flows on a daily basis, these are other challenges we must confront.
This was achieved by the Second United Nations World Assembly on Ageing in Madrid, which set out a whole new strategy that the European Union must resolutely support, as we are doing in Parliament by approving today the excellent proposal put forward by Mr PodestÃ .
We should do this for our own future as well as for the future of a world which needs to demonstrate increasing solidarity, and consequently, treat the elderly with greater fairness.
Mr President, the World Assembly on Ageing is obviously very important in that it is expected to provide policy guidelines to guarantee the rights of the elderly and their quality of life and, most importantly, the fight against discrimination.
As Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou said in Madrid on Monday, with people living longer and enjoying better health, we have room for a new life model, a new society which pro-actively reflects technological and scientific achievement.
However, that is not the case today.
On the contrary, every day Cassandras everywhere are peddling doom and gloom, with prophesies of a planet drowning under the weight of 6 billion people, of wealth-creating resources being exhausted, of the natural environment being destroyed, of poor nations increasing and multiplying while we in the developed world grow old and die out and our insurance systems crumble.
The solution offered by Malthusianists is to reduce the birth rate in third world countries and increase our own birth rates.
Such are the ethics of the developed world.
My own view is that there is a direct correlation between the uneven distribution of people on the planet and the demographic problem on the one hand and the development and distribution of the planet's resources and the question of social justice, education, equality of the sexes, human rights and development standards, on the other.
The future of the planet is clearly not under threat from the starving children of the Third World or the ageing population; it is under threat from consumer standards and the way of life of the third of the earth's population who live in the developed world.
That is where we need to intervene and that is where we need a new demographic policy.
However, until such time as we have the integrated policy of sustainable development which the Commissioner referred to, we should follow the sound advice of those who propose that we abandon our restrictive immigration policy and give immigrants full social and political rights.
The population and workforce in Sweden and Germany would have been seriously depleted without their policy of integrating immigrants and fully recognising the right of women to work.
Strengthening these two policies could resolve the problems in the short term.
However, they will only be resolved in the long term under a fair - and very different - system of economic and social development.
To close this debate, I have received five motions for resolutions
We will now proceed to the vote.
Simplified procedure:
Proposal, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for a Council regulation imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Osama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network and the Taliban, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 467/2001 prohibiting the export of certain goods and services to Afghanistan, strengthening the flight ban and extending the freeze of funds and other financial resources in respect of the Taliban of Afghanistan (COM(2002) 117 - C5-0132/2002 - 2002/0059(CNS))
Before the vote:
Mr President, as regards the first request by the Council for the opinion of Parliament regarding the UN Security Council's freezing of funds, I would like to inform Parliament that the Commission will give its full attention to the amendments proposed by Parliament and promote their adoption by the Council where the EU Treaty, the UN Charter and the urgency of the matter so allow.
Secondly, the Commission is also open to further discussion with Parliament on the tension that will inevitably arise between the continued efforts to eradicate the financing of terrorism and respect for civil liberties and human rights.
Mr President, I have asked for the floor simply to request that this legislative proposal be referred back to the Commission as unanimously voted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. This is not because we do not agree with it, but because it does not include synthetic alcohol and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not found a legal basis to be able to include it.
Therefore, I would ask Members to vote against the legislative proposal, so that it can be referred back to the Commission.
Mr President, the Commission cannot agree at this stage with Parliament's position rejecting the proposal and calling on the Commission to withdraw it.
If Parliament votes in favour of this position, which the Commission would regret, my colleague, Mr Fischler, would have to reflect on the situation and confer with his colleagues on the course of action to be taken.
However, Commissioner Fischler is, I believe, going to discuss this problem with the parliamentary committee.
Thank you, Commissioner.
In that case the matter is referred back to committee.

Terrorism must always be fought on the basis of legal certainty.
We support every improvement along those lines.
There must be an improvement in the right of citizens to go to court in order to have their cases tried.
That right should also apply to human rights issues.
Our vote is an expression of our desire to combat terrorism and does not relate to improvements in legal certainty which, we believe, should go further and be reviewed in a national and European perspective.
. I am in favour of procedures to enable the sanctions list set up by the UN Sanctions Committee to be revised where justified as set out in Amendment No 2.
The list is extensive and we are taking it on trust.
I would like to have had more certainty about the proposed role of the Court of Justice taking into account the role of the courts of the Member States.
I am not sure about the implications of Amendment No 9, which covers the Commission's proposals on the transmission of information received by the Commission to the competent authorities of the Member States.
The further transfer of this information to Parliament and its 'competent committee? and 'in accordance with relevant procedures? is vague.
I strongly support the proposed amendments to the Commission's text on respecting human rights and humanitarian need.
I did not participate in the vote as I consider this to be a serious issue.
Anything to do with tackling terrorism is important.
Blocking off the supply of funds to terrorist organisations and their associates is one of the most important means at our disposal in dealing with the Al-Qaida networks.
I would like to have had more time to examine this aspect of the proposal and, if necessary, to have had time to strengthen these measures even further.
(Abbreviated pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
We confirm our unreserved commitment to combating all forms of terrorism and voted for the amendments we tabled together with the other groups, because they could - by providing for appeal to the European Court of Justice - provide legal protection for the European citizens.
The names of some of the citizens have already been included in the list annexed to the regulation, even though no evidence has been produced of their connection to terrorist movements or involvement in terrorist activities.
However, we voted against the regulation, both because of the procedure employed - this is the fourth time we have voted on terrorism with an urgent procedure, without a report and without a debate - and because of the content of the regulation, for we are voting on a list of names given to the UN by the CIA with no evidence and no possibility of our having access to any evidence there may be.
The procedures for drawing up the list of natural and legal persons, groups and entities laid down in Article 2 of the regulation clearly violate the sacrosanct rules on the right of defence of EU citizens - also enshrined in the recently proclaimed Charter of Fundamental Rights - introducing a freeze on the financial assets and resources of those concerned without any possibility of democratic and/or judicial monitoring of the evidence on the basis of which they are included on the list.
I therefore call upon the Council to take into consideration the amendments adopted by Parliament, at least, and to make the necessary changes to the proposal for a regulation.
.
Yet again, the European Parliament has been asked to apply urgent procedure, concerning the question of fighting international terrorism.
The procedure following a request from the Council is unacceptable, since the crucial questions about the deleting and adding of names to the list of persons and groups suspected of being terrorists has not been solved, leaving it up to the UN sanctions committee alone to decide the procedure.
Furthermore, the EU regulation continuously refers to the resolution decided by the UN Sanctions Committee under the UN Security Council, without clearly specifying the role and part played by the EU Member States and the EU Court of Justice.
Even though we welcome the amendments tabled by the political groups of the EP trying to lift the scope and the content of the regulation, we voted against the regulation in general due to the procedure chosen, the lack of any possibility of changing the content, or the procedures for drawing up the list.
On more than one occasion - this is the fourth - the Commission has asked the European Parliament to vote in favour of restrictive measures against certain individuals and organisations in the aim of combating international terrorism without any prior debate on the issue, either in plenary or in the relevant specialised committee.
This is a method that we reject and hence our vote against this proposal.
We reaffirm our complete and unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist acts that took place in the USA, as well as the need to produce a response based on joint efforts and international cooperation, within the framework of the UN and in full respect of its Charter. We also find it unacceptable that a list of organisations and individuals should be submitted to the European Parliament for its approval without any basis and without any evidence being provided, and this is the second reason for our vote against this proposal.
Furthermore, it is our view that the necessary fight against terrorism cannot be used as an excuse to broach fundamental aspects of the sovereignty of the Union's Member States.
We have abstained in the final vote on the Commission's proposal on freezing the assets of persons suspected of terrorism.
However, we have given our support to the amendments, all of which contribute to improving the regulation.
The fight against terrorism is crucial and has our support.
Freezing the assets of persons suspected of terrorism or collaboration with terrorism is an important element of this overall work.
However, a procedure in which the UN Security Council and sanctions committee decide upon sanctions against individual people, entirely without the latter's being informed of the evidence or being given the opportunity to have their cases tried in court, is not acceptable.
In this way, there is a danger of legal certainty's being eliminated.
Everyone on the UN's list must be notified immediately of evidence against them and of formally notified suspicions concerning them.
They must be given the opportunity to have their cases tried in court.
Clear and distinct criteria governing the way in which people's names are added to and deleted from the list must be established.
The EU countries on the UN Security Council - Great Britain, France and Ireland - bear a major responsibility for upholding legal certainty and demanding that human rights are not compromised away.
The Spanish Presidency and the Member States should take vigorous action in the UN and in relation to the United States in order to ensure that people's rights are respected.
In today's vote, we have supported a new Council regulation on international terrorism, together with important amendments adopted by Parliament which enhance legal certainty and promote respect for fundamental human rights.
We deeply regret the unlawful situation that has arisen for the three Swedes on the UN sanctions committee's list of suspected terrorists.
There is clearly no legally tenable evidence against them. Instead, we are concerned here with a 'preventive' measure.
The legal process in support of the Swedes must therefore be pursued further.
We welcome the express reference in the amendments to the regulation to the fact that 'The Court of Justice of the European Communities has jurisdiction in actions brought by the persons listed [by suspected terrorists]?.
The proposal for a regulation also states that 'a procedure should be established within the Community to amend these lists?.
Our country is bound under international law by the UN Security Council's resolutions on which the Council regulation is based, and it must respect that principle, even when a decision goes against us.
The objective of the resolutions - that of fighting terrorism - is both legitimate and urgent, but so too is the objective of bringing about a change to the way in which they are applied.
The Council regulation is a step in the right direction, but legal certainty and respect for fundamental human rights require continued and intensified efforts to change current rules governing sanctions.
Fundamental freedoms and rights must never be called into question.
That is especially important in the fight against terrorism.
Terrorism cannot be fought by curtailing democracy and human rights.
According to the UN Charter, all Member States are bound by decisions taken by the UN Security Council.
These decisions are binding but can never be absolute.
There must be room for manoeuvre.
The sanctions committee's practice of accepting without qualification the United States' list of individuals and organisations suspected of terrorism is not acceptable.
The fact that the list, which is not made public, is approved by the sanctions committee if no one on the committee protests within 48 hours opens the way to unsubstantiated decisions.
It is a case of fundamental freedoms and rights being eliminated by a non-judicial authority when the individuals concerned are neither informed of what they are being accused of nor given the opportunity to appeal against the decision.
Parliament's amendments are crucial in order to guarantee EU citizens legal certainty.
I am therefore able to support the Council regulation only in such an amended form.
.
(IT) The radical Members voted against this document in order to express their opposition to terrorism and to emergency policies and procedures and their support for democracy and the rule of law and for the dignity of Parliament and the Members of the European Parliament.
We voted against the motion because this is the fourth time the European Parliament has been asked to adopt 'exceptionally' a document containing several gaps which seeks to take steps to combat terrorism, and the second time it has been asked to endorse without a debate or report the decision to freeze the assets of persons and companies on the grounds that they are involved in - unspecified - terrorist activities.
We voted against the motion because it is now clear that, after 11 September, it has become standard practice to exploit the urgent procedure, using it as an emergency measure in situations that do not justify this.
We voted against the motion because, as Members of the European Parliament, we refuse to do the job of the 'naturally' appointed bodies, namely the judiciary and the police, for them, or to take on their responsibility.
We voted against the motion because we are against a measure which should be the remit of the criminal police and which could have been debated and adopted using the ordinary procedure.
We voted against the motion in the hope that an initiative might be produced by Parliament as a whole opposing emergency procedures and policies which undermine the fundamental principles of democracy and the rule of law, doing the terrorists' work for them.
I should first like to congratulate my colleague, Elisa DamiÃ£o, on the work that she has done on this extremely important issue.
All of us remember the long debates which took place in the eighties, when everyone refused to budge from their opposing camps.
Some argued that the fact that asbestos was dangerous was not irrefutably proven, while those exposed to it rightly wanted the precautionary principle - as we now call it - to be applied.
In the end, they had to take account of the various studies stating that asbestos was a particularly dangerous substance and that exposure to it could cause serious diseases.
Since then, too many people have taken risks, risks for which the price is paid in the longer or shorter term.
This is because some diseases have a long incubation period from the time when fibre is lodged in the body until the point of biological degeneration.
The majority of Member States have now banned the marketing and use of products containing asbestos.
Nevertheless in some sectors the risk persists.
I am thinking in particular of work to remove asbestos and maintenance or repair work on buildings containing asbestos.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
First of all, I should like to thank both our rapporteur in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Elisa Maria DamiÃ£o, and the committee as a whole for the work which they have proposed to us.
Everyone is now aware of the significant risks of contracting serious diseases run by those exposed to asbestos, during its manufacture, of course, but also when it has to be handled for removal purposes.
It was therefore a matter of urgency to strengthen Directive 83/477/EEC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.
It was in this spirit that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs worked on the proposal tabled by the Commission: our report thus calls for a reduction in asbestos exposure limits for certain activities, in particular demolition, maintenance, repairs and specialised electrical and plumbing work.
The report also underlines the need for Member States to introduce dissuasive sanctions against breaches of legislation on removing asbestos.
Finally, the report provides for training for workers who are exposed to asbestos.
This is an essential initiative and an effective strand of our policy on health and safety in the workplace.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
With the proposal for a directive we are now debating, the Commission is seeking, albeit in a limited way, to refocus protection measures for the people who have hitherto been the most exposed: to review levels of exposure and re-examine the method of assessing the volume of asbestos fibres in the atmosphere; to insist on measures to prevent or reduce exposure to the minimum and to consider the assessment of risks arising from work in which exposure to asbestos is intrinsic or incidental.
With the work in the specialised parliamentary committee and in plenary we have helped to improve the report with proposals that the rapporteur, Elisa DamiÃ£o, and the plenary have accepted, specifically:
the need to pay particular attention to compliance with labour law, which takes on crucial importance in this sector, specifically the fight against greater job insecurity and compliance with health and safety regulations in the workplace;
the need for the Member States to pay particular attention to workers' rights, specifically where health is concerned, when mines or production plants are closed;
the removal of exceptions unless it is proved that the cases under consideration demonstrate no risk to the workers.
We now hope that the Commission and the Council will accept Parliament's proposals.
. I fully support moves to increase worker protection against the health risks of exposure to asbestos.
Since the numbers of people affected by asbestos are predicted to rise considerably by 2020, legislation must be upgraded to further reduce acceptable levels of exposure.
In order for the EU to show itself to be serious about non-implementation of this legislation, the use of sanctions against irresponsible employers is vital.
I also welcome the move to provide EU funding for training and information about the health risks associated with asbestos.
Essentially, this report should lead to a more sensible preventative - rather than curative - approach to asbestos poisoning and it could potentially result in much lower figures of workers affected.
. (DE) I voted in favour of the report of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and thus against this Commission proposal, because the latter far exceeds the targets set for the Commission in July 2000 by the Agricultural Council.
Rather than presenting a simple and straightforward regulatory framework for the supervision of the EU alcohol market and of trade patterns, the actual Commission proposal provides for the creation of a new Common Organisation of the Market.
This, among other things, includes the provision that, after its entry into force, tried and tested national regulatory arrangements on objectives of importance to agricultural and social policy, such as care for the cultural landscape and the maintenance of meadows of indigenous dehiscent fruit, but not supporting small agricultural distilleries, would have to be repealed on the grounds of incompatibility with the competition rules of the Treaty establishing the European Community, even though they have, to date, been declared by the ECJ to be compatible with the Treaty establishing the European Community and with current Internal Market rules.
The creation of a new COM is also to be rejected at a time when there is general discussion about reforming the common agricultural policy away from market regulation and in the direction of a multifunctional approach for the future, and Agenda 2000 is about to be reviewed.
I therefore call on the Commission to withdraw its proposal for the creation of a COM in agricultural alcohol and submit a new proposal closely adhering to the Council mandate of July 2000.
. (DE) The EU Commission sometimes really cannot stop itself from bothering us with utterly superfluous, unwanted and counterproductive proposals.
The proposal for a regulation on the common organisation of the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin is a truly magnificent example of a mania for inappropriate regulation.
Our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, therefore, did the only right thing in unanimously rejecting the proposal and calling on the Commission to withdraw it.
I would not go as far as to call on the Commission to submit a new proposal, as there is absolutely no need for action in this sector apart from the need for common provisions to deal with the many openings for the substitution of synthetic alcohol for alcohol of agricultural origin.
As, though, our learned jurists have confirmed that a synthetic product cannot be incorporated into a common organisation of the market in an agricultural product, this essentially sensible possibility on which our rapporteur's eye had alighted, was dropped.
It makes no sense, though, to regulate only the market in agriculturally produced alcohol, as overall demand in the Community for alcohol is divided up 50/50 for the two types.
However, it must be said that market forces have, in the meantime, managed to achieve a balance, so that it really is not clear why what the market has arranged for the best should be regulated from the top downwards for better or for worse.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
We are critical of Mrs Ayuso Gonzalez's report on a common organisation of the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin.
In our view, the report represents an outdated agricultural policy inappropriate to the conditions and needs of a modern, global society.
In contrast, the Commission's proposal for an organisation of the market without intervention measures would be a step in the right direction.
On that basis and in the light of the impending general review of the EU's agricultural policy, we have chosen to vote in favour of the Commission's proposal.
We welcome the Barcelona Process and are therefore in favour of the report.
We are, however, opposed to the creation of a Euro-Med Bank, which would only duplicate the work of the European Investment Bank and the African Development Bank.
However, we support the proposal to create a lending facility within the EIB, to be evaluated after it has been in operation for a year.
We advocate closer relations between the Member States of the European Union and the countries of the Mediterranean, and feel that this must be developed on the basis of enhancing economic and cultural relations between these countries, respecting the interests of each and every one in order to achieve development and to improve the living standards of all peoples.
This is why we are critical of the proposals put forward by the European Commission and supported by the Council to use the 'Barcelona Process' to undertake, in the framework of this process of association agreements with these countries and of the creation of a 'free trade zone', the liberalisation of services and of agriculture and, generally, the neoliberal guidelines laid down at the WTO Conference in Doha.
Furthermore, we are concerned at the objective of defining the fight against terrorism as a central political priority, thereby disregarding the necessary consideration of its root causes such as, for example, the resolution of the conflict in the Middle East or in the Western Sahara, in the framework of the UN resolutions, or providing a response to the most basic needs and shortages that affect many populations, guaranteeing economic development and improving social conditions in the countries of the Mediterranean.
Because of its strategic importance and mainly in the context of eastward enlargement and of the new international political context that has arisen as a consequence of 11 September, the Mediterranean region warrants a sustained strengthening and deepening of euro-Mediterranean relations and consequently of the Barcelona Process.
The main aim of the Barcelona Process is to develop a euro-Mediterranean zone of peace and of shared prosperity.
There can, therefore, be no doubt as to the importance of and the need for the continuation, revitalisation and deepening of existing cooperation instruments.
I therefore give my support to the Action Plan which will be proposed by the Commission at the Interministerial Euro-Mediterranean Conference due to take place in Valencia, which I believe accurately reflects the concerns and the challenges currently facing the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
Nevertheless, and to conclude, I should like to stress the three points of the Action Plan to which I feel we should give priority: strengthening the feeling of belonging and of partnership of the Mediterranean countries by reorganising structures for dialogue and working methods; support for the private sector and greater dialogue between cultures and civilisations.
. (DE) I have just voted in favour of Mr GraÃ§a Moura's report on the EU's strategy towards China and have consequently supported various amendments.
Thousands of nuns and monks are continuing to be persecuted, imprisoned and mistreated.
Tibet's cultural and religious autonomy is being denied.
There is systematic settlement by Chinese people, so that Tibetans are increasingly becoming a minority in their own country.
The report is right to take up Parliament's repeated call for the appointment of an EU special representative for Tibet.
It also recalls the resolution of two years ago, in which Parliament called on the EU Member States to recognise the Tibetan government-in-exile within three years in the event of the Tibetan situation stagnating or getting worse.
There is no alternative to a peaceful solution in the form of negotiations between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama - without any preconditions.
As president of the Tibet Intergroup, I see complete autonomy for Tibet as a core objective.
Such a bilateral solution should also be advantageous to the Chinese, who are concerned about their international reputation.
Its starting point is the Dalai Lama's five-point plan and the speech he gave to our plenary meeting on 24 October 2001.
What I find most lamentable is the attitude of the EU, which did not put China's human rights violations on the agenda at Geneva, preferring to deal with them in the context of the dialogue between the EU and China - and hence behind closed doors.
- (NL) As the world's most populous country, China forms a military and economic power.
The governing Communist Party no longer has anything to do with rebellious movements of workers and farmers who fought against exploitation and lawlessness in years gone by.
The opposite is now true.
With the help of the army, the police, the imprisonment of critics and the application of death penalties, it makes efforts only to secure forced economic growth.
A strong state is targeting its own people and is creating as much scope as possible for a new group of entrepreneurs who, thanks to low wages and poor working conditions, will get rich quick.
There is no room for strikes and demonstrations, or for freedom of association, freedom of religion or free elections.
If China were a small country, there would be a broad consensus for putting it under pressure.
Because it is large and important, friendship and trade relations are sought right across the political divide.
I unreservedly denounce this preferential treatment of China which, unfortunately, is also being advocated by some colleagues in my political group.
Earlier in this debate, my Dutch fellow MEP, Mr Belder from the ChristenUnie/Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij [Dutch Christian Union/State Reformed Party], aptly remarked that a critical dialogue is inadequate as an instrument, easing our consciences as we take care of our own economic interests.
I can fully endorse his conclusion in this case.
.
I fully support this resolution which calls for enhanced co-operation between the EU and China.
I believe that the EU has a vital role to play in helping to shape China's economic, social and political agenda.
China's accession to the WTO is to be welcomed, but the EU must not become complacent: human rights and the UN conventions that China has ratified are still far from fully respected.
I feel that the report shows the right balance between encouragement of China's economic and social reforms, as well as denouncing its perennial abuses of human rights and the rule of law.
EU-China relations continue to be hampered by issues such as the oppression of Falun Gong practitioners and the imprisonment monks in Tibet.
Therefore it is equally important that the EU shows itself to be tough on these issues and willing to engage with China.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Members from all the Groups who voted for or, in any case, have taken part in the debate on this report, which seeks to guarantee secure pensions for all the citizens of Europe.
We cannot, of course, work miracles, but the European Union can do something - and I believe it can do a lot - for citizens who have worked all their lives and have the right to have the value of their work recognised when they have grown older and need to receive something from society in return.
It is right for their money to be employed well and for them to enjoy long, very long lives as pensioners.
Mr President, in the end I voted in favour of Mr Fatuzzo's report, despite the fact that some of the amendments that I had tabled with Mr Brok, on behalf of my group, had been rejected.
It is a pity, because they clarified the aspects of pension policy for which the Member States are responsible and the - very few - aspects for which the European Union is competent.
The oral amendment tabled by Mr Fatuzzo to our Amendment No 16 talks about the Commission's support for guaranteeing the right to a pension.
The word 'support' may cause confusion.
It must be clear that there can be no question of the Commission providing funding to enable the objectives laid down in this paragraph to be met, objectives with which all of us agree.
The Commission cannot provide financial assistance: all it can do is support a process, as it does with open coordination.
Moreover, we welcome the Commission's initiative, in the same paragraph, seeking to guarantee safe and sustainable pensions.
This would have been more than enough.
I had not realised that our Socialist colleagues - who are after all quite vigilant when it comes to social security - thought that they had caused confusion here between Community competences and the sacrosanct principle of subsidiarity.
Yesterday the entire Left in this House violently opposed the Barcelona proposal that it would be worthwhile and necessary for many more people over the age of 50 to work.
In this case, we are in favour of subsidiarity, all the more so when we are talking about something for which the Member States have full - and not shared - responsibility, which is the case for the three pillars of our pension systems.
The Fatuzzo report on the sustainability of pension systems in the European Union offers a fascinating insight into how Brussels manages to take over an issue, as if it went without saying that it was competent to do so, when there is not a single word in the Treaty on pensions, which are legally - there is no doubt about it - the sole responsibility of the Member States.
It all starts, as usual, with cautious Commission communications, seeking to show that the sustainability of pensions has a more or less direct influence on certain European competences.
Similarly, in the conclusions of various European Councils (Lisbon, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Laeken) 'brief phrases' are slipped in to legitimise what the Commission is doing.
Then one day the idea has taken sufficient hold for the Barcelona Council in March 2002 to call - to general amazement - for the average retirement age to be increased by five years.
This is bordering on Europe interfering, pure and simple, without any democratic debate having been held.
Admittedly, most of the ideas expressed are more or less along the right lines.
But this is an essential tactic in this method of competence creep: for the transfer of competence to be invisible or painless, the policy line expressed must, first, be indisputable.
Our pay-as-you-go pension systems are under threat.
For clearly identified demographic and economic reasons.
Everyone is aware of this.
In France, a white paper raised the alarm more than ten years ago.
But since then nothing, or nearly nothing, has been done apart from a few reports here and there whose conclusions basically reflected the ideological sympathies of those who had commissioned them.
The only thing that has really changed is the imminence of the predicted financial catastrophe.
The French presidential candidates, Chirac and Jospin, have not made any real proposals to save our pensions, which will no doubt save them breaking their promises.
And in Barcelona, without the electorate's knowledge, they, along with the rest, opposed the idea of the French having the right to retire at 60.
What this government lacks - like those which preceded it and most probably those which will succeed it - is determination and political courage.
But their salvation will not come from Brussels.
It cannot come from the European Union with its free-trade, ultra-liberal ideology, which dreams of allowing private insurance companies to make profits from billions of euro of social security, but which has still not been able to solve the problems of pension rights?
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (NL) As social security, public services and the level of prosperity improve, and the environment becomes cleaner, people's life expectancy grows.
And with it the group that is dependent on a pension.
While pensions are crucial for older workers, there are young people for whom retirement is a long way off and rich people who do not need a pension scheme.
If you deem pensions unimportant, then you will consider them to be a liability which leads to higher taxes and premiums.
Some politicians will seize this as an opportunity to call for freedom of choice, commercialisation and state withdrawal.
Governments look into options for cutting costs or have saved insufficiently for sustainable pension provision.
On this basis, an agreement was reached in Barcelona to increase the pensionable age by an average of five years by 2010.
At the same time, workers are fighting to have the pensionable age reduced to 60 or 55. As was the case here in Strasbourg on 7 February, when public transport ground to a halt for the entire day.
As long as pressure of work continues to rise because the working population is required to deliver maximum productivity, we should not be surprised if people burn out at an increasingly younger age.
This is why I opt for the variant of a guaranteed pension for everyone, so that people can retire at a reasonable age without being condemned to a life of poverty.
The Commission deserves credit for having appropriately addressed an issue which is crucial to social cohesion in a 15-Member State Europe, soon to be a 27-Member State Europe.
It must also be complimented on having done so adopting a line and principles which, preserving the subsidiarity criterion, facilitate the creation and development of common guidelines and goals through the open method of coordination and the national action plans on pensions.
However, we believe that, although the Commission communication covers a wide range of aspects, it fails to give adequate consideration to the scale of the issue or, therefore, to its future assessment.
Mr Fatuzzo, whose work I support, has stressed a large number of specific points, starting with the need to codify in future indicators what is actually pension provision and what, on the other hand, is welfare provision although, by mere political whim, a burden on pensions saving and therefore on the resources of the underwriters.
Two further points deserve a mention: the first concerns the removal of taxation on pension schemes, the second essentially social cohesion within the individual States.
With regard to the first point, it would, in fact, be absurd to consider, as happens in some States, the gross amount of pension expenditure when we know that that amount is subject to taxation in any case, irrespective of the different levels applied.
With regard to the other point, cohesion, there is no doubt that the disadvantaged territories of the Member States can and must benefit from incentives for the development of local economies and therefore of employment.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (EL) Pension rights are not being dealt with as a basic requirement of the working classes which the state has a responsibility to satisfy, they are being dealt with as an 'indicator', an 'expense' which undermines the objectives of the stability pact and prevents big business from increasing its profits.
'Meeting social objectives' and maintaining economic viability are being used to promote a policy which tramples all over workers' social insurance rights in a bid to reduce the price of labour.
The sole purpose of insurance reforms in the context of capitalist restructuring is to abolish workers' rights, extend flexible forms of employment and commercialise health and welfare, while the insurance funds gamble their reserves on the stock exchange.
The need to reduce state expenditure and the need for action to resolve the demographic problem, for which the system and anti-grass roots policies are to blame, are being used as a cover-up in order to abolish basic rights, increase the retirement age, extend working life to lifelong work and convert pensions to welfare benefits, while the problem of unemployment is getting worse and part-time employment is increasing.
Statements about the dignity and independence of the elderly are hypocritical and misleading, given that 70% of pensioners live below the poverty line, as are statements about equality of the sexes, because the way is being paved to increase the retirement age of women and abolish the right to early retirement, maternity protection etc.
We support a social security system which satisfies the needs of the people, with national insurance and a free national health service for everyone, lower retirement ages of 60 for men and 55 for women and 50-55 in professions with serious health risks, shorter insurance periods and full, stable employment.
I have voted against Mr Fatuzzo's report on safe and sustainable pensions.
My main criticism is that the report is designed to open the way for a transition from the open coordination method to a Community method in which all the institutions participate fully.
I believe it would be unfortunate if the open coordination method were to be abandoned through opening the way for a process leading to the Community method's also being applied in the pensions area.
Nor is there any support for this in the Treaties.
I have not therefore been able to vote in favour of the report.
On the pretext of seeking to guarantee 'safe and sustainable pensions', the Fatuzzo report subscribes to the liberal ideology of attacking pensions.
In this report, we are treated to all of the current commonplaces on the subject, the main one being that the pensions problem is above all a demographic issue.
I do not think that there is a 'pensions problem'; the problem which haunts the whole of Europe is above all a problem of unemployment.
A society of full employment would not have any problems with pensions.
That is why I am in favour of a massive recruitment policy in the public services and a ban on mass redundancies in profit-making companies, and why I am against a cut in employers' contributions.
If we defend pensions, we are defending the interests of the world of work, and an increase in the retirement age, as the Barcelona Summit recently recommended, is unacceptable.
It is out of the question to attack the pay-as-you-go pension system with pension funds, as has been proposed.
We are in favour of European workers all contributing for the same period of time, and no pensioner should have a pension that is lower than the minimum wage, which should moreover be increased.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) This report is part, in general terms, of the Financial Services Action Plan and the integration of the risk capital markets, as decided at the Lisbon Summit and followed up in Stockholm, with a deadline of 2003 for the integration of the securities markets and of 2005 for the complete integration of the financial markets.
On the basis of the mystifying idea that venture capital is a means of resolving the financing needs of the SMEs and their start up capital, as if this integration could be a solution to their problems, once again an attempt is being made to move towards an economy increasingly based on finance, by means of the risk capital market and the participation of SMEs in volatile markets, centred largely on the huge pension funds.
Hence the rapporteur's call for the liberalisation of pension fund investments in risk capital, favourable tax treatment for the capital gains of SMEs, the protection of the Community patent and tax benefits for fund investments in risk capital schemes.
For all of these reasons, we voted against the report.
The report seeks to obtain new benefits for capital, an aim which it does its best to dress up with modern justifications.
It cites the supposed difficulties which start-ups have in obtaining funds, and irresponsibly proposes allowing pension funds to invest in more high-risk projects, even though a considerable amount of money has been swallowed up by the fanciful dreams of the 'new economy'.
The report calls for the removal of 'the fiscal, regulatory and administrative barriers? encountered by new small companies, which - if you believe the report - are capable of closing 'the knowledge gap between Europe and the US' practically single-handedly.
The fact that the report stresses the interdependency of risk-capital and the stock exchange shows clearly what this is all about: oiling the wheels of capitalism on the pretext of innovation, and creating a preferential status for small companies, which would allow the large groups to outsource even more of their activities, reduce their taxes and relax the few constraints that the Labour Code still places on them.
For these reasons, I voted against this report.
. I fully support this report to enhance present legislation to protect minors.
It is recognised that a child's welfare is the responsibility of their legal guardians, but children are exposed to all manner of potential malevolent influences in the media, and especially from the Internet.
Whilst the EU has been active in protecting children from harmful media influences, such as the 1999 action plan and the Council recommendation, it is high time that a more concrete action plan was developed which involves not only policy-makers, but also NGOs, consumer groups and voluntary associations.
Controlling the media is a mammoth task and Europe needs to draw on as many expert sources as possible in order to harness what is increasingly a harmful influence on children.
We should never forget that the so-called new media, the Information Society, is a double-edged sword where children are concerned: it is a valuable information and learning resource but can also expose them to detrimental information.
Mr President, it is somewhat regrettable that the European Union does not have the competences in the area of culture and education that we might wish.
Mrs De Sarnez's report is for that reason a slight and modest start at getting appropriate steps underway in the international education market.
I hope that this initiative will be followed by many others.
One of the items listed is the inventory of student mobility, the obvious problem with which is that many students are already not taking the road abroad because they will later have substantial difficulties with recognition.
My own region, which is bilingual and at home in both Italian and German language areas, is also affected by this, but gets into difficulties simply because of the lack of recognition.
We hope that our young people, and many others from elsewhere, will be able to avoid these difficulties in the future.
. (EL) The title "strengthening cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education" conceals a new endeavour to export the European Union's education model to candidate countries, other countries on the European continent and third world countries, witness the report's emphasis on developing "internationally competitive systems of higher education".
This clearly illustrates that education is being dealt with as a commodity, open to the rules of the market, liberalisation and competition.
And what is even more terrifying is that the report proposes a European university label(!) as if education was some sort of electrical appliance or washing powder on a supermarket shelf.
The parliamentary report outdoes even the Commission text at this point.
The report contains the usual mantras of student and teacher mobility, common curricula and even common diplomas, recognition of teaching modules, training courses and diplomas, all of which are used as a pretext for reducing university studies and education in general to the lowest common denominator.
And, needless to say, the report reminds us of the Bologna and Prague declarations spearheading the European Union's intervention in the education systems of European countries, members and non-members alike.
The Communist Party of Greece is fighting for overall improvements to higher education and for subsidised, free higher education and it is fighting to stop education establishments from being commercialised and run on business lines.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
. I fully support this draft resolution to enhance high-education co-operation with third countries.
Education is changing rapidly to fit the needs of the so-called knowledge society and new economy, and it is generally recognised that the US has the competitive advantage over the EU in this domain.
The departure of the best and brightest students overseas is a sad indication of this.
If we focus on assuring the mutual recognition of qualifications and invest in language training for those students who could potentially learn in another European country, we will go some way towards closing this gap.
Education must be seen as a core component of the Lisbon strategy and there must be detailed, continuous and rigorous attention paid to ensuring that our education is open to all and is of as high quality as the American system.
Indeed, Europe must capitalise on the fact that for those people who want to increase their skills base and learn languages, this is the ideal destination to do so.
Mr President, by some mistake my group was not able to speak during the debate and so I will restrict myself to delivering an explanation of vote, which I am very happy to do having been the rapporteur of a report on the subject of old age dealing with the communication 'Towards a Europe for all ages'.
I feel that the European Parliament's undertaking to present a report today, a report endorsed by all, moreover, is extremely positive, for it overturns that wholly negative preconception of elderly people as a burden, a dead weight carried by society, which, indeed, fails to accord them that attention we would wish them to receive.
The elderly are ultimately a resource and must therefore be considered in positive terms.
European Union and world policies must start to be more attentive to elderly people, to show more appreciation of the humanity and culture they have to pass on which is extremely important for the younger generations, culture which can be manifested at the level of work for elderly people who are still active, culture which is expressed not least in terms of awareness and familiarity with history, which humanity must consult increasingly closely if it is to avoid those huge errors which are currently being made, especially at the level of world stability and peace.
I feel that this resolution contains extremely positive points relating to the European Union's active policies on elderly people, in terms of both free time, work and rights of citizenship, and, most importantly, in terms of the potential for action still possessed by the elderly which they can most certainly use to the benefit of the community as a whole.
Therefore, in expressing our support for this resolution, I feel we can say we have also made a contribution to the events in Spain and to the Second United Nations World Assembly too.
I should to take the opportunity offered by this debate and this resolution to reiterate my firm conviction on the important question of ageing in general, which I believe is the positive consequence of longer life expectancy and the ageing of developed society rather than of a fall in the birth rate. We have to move beyond the idea of ageing as a handicap and look on it as a valuable resource to society.
Obviously this means we need more social action and solidarity and benefits tailored to all ages and we need to safeguard pension schemes, but the importance of the elderly to society goes far beyond that.
It takes account of their experience, what they have lived through, their voluntary help and what young people can learn from them.
It imposes a different attitude towards ageing.
We need a real 'cultural revolution' if we want to prevent an ageing society from being seen as a society in regression.
So-called modern society would do well to take a leaf out of the book of traditional societies here.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0210/2002) by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mrs Thors, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Moldavia/Moldova;
(B5-0212/2002) by Mr SacrÃ©deus, Mr Suominen and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the disappearance of a Member of the Moldovan Parliament;
(B5-0219/2002) by Mrs Elisabeth Schroedter, Mr Staes, Mr McCormick and Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the political situation in Moldavia/Moldova and the disappearance of Vlad Cubreacov;
(B5-0232/2002) by Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the political situation in Moldavia/Moldova and the disappearance of Vlad Cubreacov;
Mr President, Moldova's internal political situation has deteriorated fast since Parliament's delegation visited the country last autumn.
Then it seemed that social and economic reform in Moldova was making headway despite the many difficulties and obstacles.
Now the news from Moldova is that the principles of human rights and the rule of law have been violated, the people's democratic right to stage demonstrations has been disregarded, and, furthermore, restrictions have been placed on the activities of the media.
Members of Parliament are particularly worried about the disappearances of Moldova's opposition leaders, which sparked unrest there.
We have reason to fear that there is a connection between these disappearances and the country's political problems.
We obviously hope that everything possible will be done to find the disappeared persons unharmed, and that an independent and thorough study will solve the mystery surrounding these cases.
The motion for a resolution quite rightly calls on the Moldovan government to adhere to the rules and procedures of democracy, and give an assurance that it will respect the principles of human rights and the rule of law.
The Moldovan Parliament must also revise its decision to abolish the parliamentary inviolability of members of the opposition and desist from any renewed suppression of that inviolability.
It also has to be made clear to the ruling party that it cannot abuse the powers it has to disband the opposition.
When considering Moldova's problems we have to remember that the country's economy has collapsed since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Poverty and sluggish social reform have led to an increase in crime and the growth of the shadow economy.
The internal political situation is being aggravated further by the problem of Transnistria.
A return to socio-political stability and a regard for human rights and the rule of law will also be vital if the country's economic problems are to be resolved.
I think it is important that the European Parliament clearly states its position to the Moldovan Parliament and government, as well as the party in power there, which is what is being done in this motion for a resolution.
Mr President, just over a year ago, Vlad Cubreacov visited my office in the European Parliament in Brussels.
We talked about the conditions under which politics was conducted in Europe's poorest country, Moldova.
Vlad Cubreacov told me about assassination attempts to which he had earlier been subjected.
As a Swede and as a Member of the European Parliament in Strasbourg and Brussels, I knew that here was a courageous man. He is prepared to stand up for the values of freedom, as well as for the rule of law, political pluralism and democracy -things which cost so little in our own countries but which, for him, cost so much.
About three weeks ago, I received a telephone call from Brussels, telling me that Vlad Cubreacov had disappeared.
The person who had sat in my office and with whom I had talked warmly and companionably about politics had disappeared.
We in the European Parliament, and not only those of us who are Christian Democrats belonging to his sister party, are deeply concerned about his fate.
Moldova needs a new future.
It is therefore deeply worrying that one of the country's foremost opposition representatives in Parliament has disappeared.
It is also a source of deep concern that the Communist government in Moldova has removed the political immunity of a large number of members of the Christian Democratic Party and that their political activities in Moldova may in the future be completely destroyed.
Moldova is a country in search of its cultural and political identity.
In the struggle concerning whether the country is to be Western- or Russian-oriented, political activity must never lead to political disappearances and to people's lives and health being threatened.
We in the European Parliament are all working for a free and democratic Moldova.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are right: a serious political crisis is at hand in Moldova.
I do not share the opinion of the Council of Europe's rapporteur, who believes that there is still a chance of the government itself finding a solution to this political crisis.
I suspect that, following the vote on the lifting of the immunity of two opposition politicians - something I regard as irregular - the ruling parties see themselves as victors and do not grasp what three months of mass demonstrations mean, namely that they have forfeited the confidence placed in them and that they themselves are no longer in a position to lead their country out of the crisis at the present point in time.
I fear that the crisis in this utterly impoverished country will escalate and thus make it ungovernable.
I therefore believe that immediate action by the Council and the Commission is required and that they should not wait until the chestnuts are back in the fire.
It is my view that the following must be done. The EU, the OSCE and the Council of Europe must form a troika to mount a short-term mission to the country.
This mission must reach agreement with the government as to what steps have to be taken in order for the crisis to be resolved.
Sanctions will also have to be discussed so that the government does not take these steps half-heartedly.
The steps required include, in my view, exemption from punishment for those who have protested peacefully in the past or may do so in the future, the withdrawal of all resolutions on the Russian language and on the teaching of history, the revocation of all the measures that amount to censorship of the media, and the securing of basic conditions for political and economic development.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen - few on the ground though you may be - Moldova is a country with which the European Union has a privileged relationship.
It is also a TACIS recipient country and a country that may still be unstable, but is giving repeated consideration to strengthening its relations with the European Union and to perhaps, one, day, joining it.
Developments in that country are, though, deplorable in the extreme and give grave concern not only to us but also to most of its population.
There were, in any case, 80 000 people on the streets on 31 March, showing that quite a few are still going back on the streets to demonstrate despite repression and obstruction.
What worries us is the relationship between the government and the opposition, which is neither healthy not democratic, nor, in our view, acceptable.
We are, of course, concerned above all at the disappearance of a number of opposition politicians, including a number of highly prominent members of the opposition party and parliamentary deputies.
Some of them were threatened or assaulted before disappearing altogether.
That, as has already been said, is absolutely incompatible with democracy.
That other members of the parliamentary opposition have been threatened with the suspension of their immunity is also a cause for concern on our part.
That procedure is part of everyday normal life, but the way things stand in Moldova makes such suspension contrary to democratic practice.
This being so - and I do not want to repeat all that has been said by Mrs Schroedter - we cannot continue to be bystanders.
We must act, and act together.
It is not on for things to be done in the middle of Europe - and Moldova belongs to this Europe of ours, and is to be respected by us as such - that belong to the darkest days of dictatorship.
We find them unacceptable.
Mr President, the Commission shares your concerns at the current situation in Moldova, as you know from the last urgent debate on this question here in the House a month ago, at which Franz Fischler spoke on the Commission's behalf.
What particularly concerns us at the moment, as it does you, is the disappearance of Mr Cubreacov, one of the leaders of the opposition, the man who in fact visited you, Mr SacrÃ©deus.
This incident, at a time when pressure on the organisers of and participants in the protest movement is being stepped up, is all the more worrying in that the Moldovan parliament has just voted to lift the immunity on several other members of the opposition, as Mr Swoboda has just pointed out.
What do we do when we meet the Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs, as we did in February?
My colleague, Chris Patten, has described the political situation in Moldova, especially the outstanding question of the secessionist region of Transnistria.
The Commission will relay its concerns about the worsening political climate in Kishinev to its Moldovan counterparts whenever the opportunity arises; the next opportunity will be at the cooperation council in Luxembourg next week.
That a politician - and leader of an opposition movement - can disappear without trace is alarming.
We support the urgent appeal in your motion calling for a complete and thorough investigation by the authorities.
We call on all the political players in Moldova to exercise restraint and not to take advantage of the deterioration in what is already a fairly tense political situation.
We shall remind the Moldovan government that it is vital not to exacerbate linguistic and ethnic tensions and to respect the principles of the Council of Europe and the OSCE which Mrs Schroedter referred to.
The fact that the Moldovan government suggested to the Council of Europe that it send an observer to Kishinev is a rare sign of encouragement and we hope that this measure will help calm the political situation.
Nonetheless, we feel that the terrible poverty in this country is not conducive to political equilibrium or compromise.
We are convinced that the main reasons for this poverty and malaise are political, caused by the failure to resolve the conflict in Transnistria, as Franz Fischler pointed out here last month.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0209/2002) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Burma/Myanmar;
(B5-0213/2002) by Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Van Orden and Dr Tannock, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Burma/Myanmar;
(B5-0221/2002) by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Burma/Myanmar;
(B5-0234/2002) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Burma/Myanmar;
Mr President, once again we are reminded of the desperate tragedy that continues to afflict the people of Burma.
Much attention has been paid to the fact that talks have been going on between the military regime and Aung San Suu Kyi since October 2000.
However, in reality, little in the way of substantive political progress has been made.
The military regime continues to deprive the National League for Democracy of its election victory of 1990, keeping its leader and 20 of its MPs under arrest.
Moreover, it continues to violate in a most appalling way the basic human rights of its citizens.
While it is perhaps invidious to focus on any one individual, as so many suffer, I want to draw particular attention today to the case of 74-year-old Dr Salai Tun Than, retired rector of the Yezin University in Upper Burma, who is currently being held in the infamous Insein Prison.
Dr Than, who is not directly affiliated to any political movement, has had a long and distinguished career of public service, with the founding of the Myanmar Integrated Rural Development Association among his many accomplishments.
In any civilised country he would be held up as a pillar of the community.
Instead, on 29 November last year, he was arrested for handing out a petition calling for a return to civilian rule.
In February of this year he was sentenced to seven years in prison.
Dr Than has had no access to visitors since his arrest, save for the Red Cross, who have provided him with medicine for a chronic eye condition.
He is just one of more than 1,300 political prisoners languishing in Burmese jails, most of them guilty of nothing more than having the courage to stand up for their legitimate political freedoms.
I call upon the Burmese authorities to release Dr Salai Tun Than immediately.
It is now time for us to send a clear message to the military regime in Burma as a matter of urgency: it must heed calls for a return to democracy and political freedom.
Only then can it hope to qualify for much-needed international assistance that will enable this desperate country to halt its ruinous economic decline.
Mr President, May will be the twelfth anniversary of the elections which gave Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy 82% of parliamentary seats.
She is still under house arrest in Burma.
There are over 1 000 political prisoners in various jails in Burma.
They are being subjected daily to mistreatment and torture and are being denied adequate food and health care.
In November 2001 the UN General Assembly expressed concern at the very slow progress of talks between the State Peace and Development Council and the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi.
An ILO mission in February was denied access to Aung San Suu Kyi, and the UN Special Envoy strongly criticised the slow progress of dialogue.
The Burmese army still continues to perpetrate gross human rights abuses against ethnic civilian groups including beatings, rape, destruction of food supplies, forced relocation, torture, forced labour, extra-judicial summary executions and disappearances.
It is worth noting that European investment in Burma is significant, particularly in the oil and gas industries.
All foreign investment - we should remember - takes place through military-backed companies.
The International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions called on oil and gas companies to cease investment in Burma while the use of forced labour continues.
The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions called for economic sanctions against Burma.
This Parliament must again call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all who are wrongfully imprisoned.
The European Commission must ensure that humanitarian aid to areas most in need is delivered without political interference and that international NGOs are involved.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that, some dozen years ago, the National League for Democracy gained an overwhelming election victory in Burma.
Since then, though, the will of the people - of all ethnic groups, let it be emphasised - has been trodden underfoot.
For a dozen years, the elected president has been under house arrest, citizens who prove to be disagreeably uncooperative have been thrown into jail, forced labour convicts have been mistreated, women have been abused and ethnic minorities harassed.
Trafficking in drugs, small arms and human beings are the order of the day.
For a dozen years, the international community has been pressing for a return to democracy - so far, unfortunately, in vain.
Yet the EU troika's indication of its willingness to enter into discussions - without, though, tying these to concessions - is right and should be welcomed.
The UN Special Envoy's efforts at getting dialogue started with the elected president and the SPDC and seeking out a starting point for democratic change are particularly deserving of support.
That Razali Ismail's visit, originally scheduled for March, has been delayed, gives little cause for optimism.
Those who lose by this are the people in the bitterly poor country, for whom things are constantly getting worse and of whose fate the democratic part of the world must not lose sight.
That it will not is also guaranteed by the European-Burmese Office, funded by the European Union and run in cooperation with the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, which has experience of promoting development and democracy.
This gives us hope for new impetus to perhaps take us a bit further forward, even if we will need staying power.
Mr President, Burma, since the sixties, has isolated itself from the world at large, at great cost to its own people.
Burma is poor, under-developed and its population increasingly remote from the socialist military government, which refused, in 1990, to accept the result of the last free election in that country and placed the victor of those elections, Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest.
According to the findings of the Asian Development Bank, quoted by the UN's own rapporteur in his report, the country spends only 0.17 percent of its GDP on health care and a comparable amount on education.
Burma is now the world's largest producer of heroin and significant parts of the country are controlled by drug lords, and I am concerned at China's role in facilitating this process.
There are over 1 000 political prisoners in the country, including 15 elected MPs and a 74-year-old professor - as mentioned by my colleague, Mr Van Orden - Dr Salai Tun Than, whose only crime is to call for free multi-party elections- a man who bears no hatred towards his jailers but who symbolises, poignantly, the plight of his country.
Burma's rulers have driven themselves and their people into a cul-de-sac.
I support the principle of targeted sanctions, including travel bans on the military leadership, but I am sceptical about the consequences of their indiscriminate application, as this may only hurt the people themselves rather than the military leadership, although it makes sense to make new investment dependent on improvements in human rights on a case-by-case basis.
Certainly, we recognise that some political prisoners have been recently released and that 25 of the offices of the National League for Democracy in Rangoon have recently been allowed to re-open.
This is great progress and we should encourage it.
That said, we need to ensure that aid is channelled through trusted organisations and we need to offer the leadership a road map for reform.
Lastly, I say to the military leaders, that by imprisoning a 74-year-old man, they show not their strength but their weakness.
A country that tolerates freedom of expression is a stronger country with better hope for the future.
I urge them to free Dr Than and Aung San Suu Kyi, and all other political prisoners immediately and to give their people hope for the future.
Mr President, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council held in October 2001 call for all political prisoners still in detention in Burma (Myanmar) to be released, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The Commission supported this demand and continues to do so.
We are convinced that a lasting solution needs to be based on an agreement between the National Council for Peace and Development and the elected democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities.
We - the Union - have no ambitions to impose an agreement, we merely want to support a solution agreed between the parties.
Although certain slightly less discouraging developments than in the past have been observed in Burma over the past year, we are still, in our view, a very long way from a clear commitment by the National Council for Peace and Development to restore democracy and respect international standards of human rights.
The recent Union troika which visited Burma (Myanmar) between 13 and 15 March expressed its hope that the negotiations under way between the National League for Democracy and the NCPD would continue and reiterated our hope that this process would at last bring about tangible results.
It also reaffirmed the Union's support for the mission by the special envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Razali Ismail.
The conclusions of the troika's mission and the renewal of the Union's common position will be examined by the Commission and the Member States over the next few weeks.
Our common position - the Union's position - needs to be renewed by 29 April.
Generally speaking - and to reply to the concerns expressed by the members who tabled the resolution - we shall only change our common position if there are clear, specific signs of progress.
May I assure you once more that we are prepared to review our position one way or the other if there are any positive or negative developments in Burma which give us cause to do so.
To reply to the point raised by Mrs McKenna a moment ago on humanitarian aid, aid in the order of EUR 5 million a year is still being provided via NGOs and international organisations.
We are also in the process of preparing a specific AIDS programme which, if it is adopted, will be managed through the same channels and will be worth about the same as the humanitarian aid which we are currently distributing.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:

Indigenous minorities in Vietnam and closure of the refugee camps in Cambodia
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why are citizens from Vietnam's central highlands fleeing to the neighbouring country of Cambodia?
This question remains unanswered, despite the way out of their misery that the Americans are providing by offering to receive them.
Unless this question is answered, we are only treating the symptoms while the problem continues to spread insidiously.
This evil is, quite simply, the Vietnamese government's multiple disenfranchisement of ethnic minorities, whom the present resolution calls Montagnards, extending even to the persecution of the latter.
This disenfranchisement is social, religious and economic in nature.
The 'Kinh', the so-called real Vietnamese, consider themselves superior to the indigenous peoples of the central highlands.
With the help of the country's Communist leaders, they have, in their capacity as migrants, simply robbed the indigenous people of the central highlands of their land over the past fifteen years.
We have also indicated the way in which the Montagnards have been deprived of their rights on a social and economic front.
Among the Montagnards, there are a relatively large number of Christians, specifically Protestants.
Their churches refuse to join the government-controlled Protestant unity church and are therefore deemed illegal. This renders the Protestant Montagnards additionally suspicious in the eyes of the already strongly anti-religious authorities.
Add to this the element of the Montagnards' foreign religious contacts, and their efforts to achieve more self-determination, and it becomes clear why the Vietnamese government considers the central highlands a risk area and treats it accordingly.
Let us face it; this Communist government is as terrified as ever at the thought of any groups or opinions taking shape independently.
Is this, therefore, a hopeless situation for the Montagnards?
They can rely on an alert security service in their vicinity.
Representatives of foreign donors and Vietnamese NGOs cannot travel freely in the area where they live.
It is therefore extremely difficult to set up local development programmes.
Meetings of representatives of indigenous peoples are either not allowed or are monitored by the security service.
Despite this, insiders in the shape of Western development workers in the central highlands, detect a glimmer of hope.
Within the Vietnamese government services, there are also opinions circulating which show some understanding of the legitimate religious, political and social demands of the Montagnards.
In their contacts with the Vietnamese authorities, I wish the Council and the Commission much wisdom and patience in treading a path that will put an end to the intolerable disenfranchisement of the indigenous people of the central highlands.
The present resolution should provide a welcome boost for them.
Mr President, Europe, too, alas, has a long history of the repression of ethnic minorities and peoples and of the expulsion and persecution of religions and faith communities, but our European Union sees itself as overcoming that and as a beacon for human rights.
It is, then, of course, our task to ensure, as partners rather than as guardians, that universal human rights really are applied throughout the world.
It is precisely because South-East Asia is an important and valued partner for us in economic and strategic terms that it is also our right and our duty to intervene in order that these universal principles be adhered to there.
What we are at present witnessing is a vicious circle.
Ethnic minorities and the various peoples of the Vietnamese highlands are oppressed, with some of them fleeing to Cambodia and being accommodated in camps.
For this we thank the Cambodians, who had great problems of their own with expellees and refugees, and who are poor and are in this instance practising solidarity - that too is a sight to behold.
The Cambodians, though, of course send people, for all sorts of reasons, back to Vietnam, where they are again persecuted and oppressed, and there is another flow of refugees towards Cambodia.
A vicious circle indeed.
If we want to break this vicious circle, which is imperilling the stability of the entire region, we must press, firstly, for Cambodia to continue to discharge its international obligations and perhaps do so even more than hitherto.
Secondly, though, and this is of the essence, we must insist that Vietnam should at last treat its ethnic minorities and national communities with respect and protect them as it should, that it should not carry out settlement programmes to the detriment of the minorities, and that faith communities should receive proper protection.
We stand up for the rights of all faith communities without discrimination, but, just as Muslims stand up for the rights of Muslims throughout the world - something for which I have a high regard - we should show an increasing commitment to the Christian minorities throughout the world, and it is not least because of them that we are under a great obligation.
Mr President, the continued persecution of the indigenous minorities from Vietnam's Central Highlands has to be deplored.
There is a major problem with the Cambodian authorities who are reluctant to grant political asylum to them.
They wish to close the refugee camps and to force the occupants to seek asylum in third countries, particularly the United States.
The decision by the Cambodian and Vietnamese governments to attempt to implement the repatriation agreement bilaterally has to be of great concern, as is the refusal by the Vietnamese government to permit the UNHCR monitoring teams to visit the villages of potential returnees.
The withdrawal of the UNHCR from the tripartite agreement means that asylum-seekers are exposed to even greater risk of being influenced, intimidated and coerced into returning to Vietnam.
The Cambodian government must uphold its obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Geneva Convention, in particular by ensuring that any repatriation is conducted on a voluntary basis, and by guaranteeing that asylum-seekers arriving in Cambodia are not denied their basic right to asylum.
We must stop the Vietnamese persecuting people who, it seems, have been forced to go back against their will.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks first of all to Mr Nassauer, chairman of the delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN, and to Mr Posselt, Mr van den Berg, Mr Maaten, Mrs McKenna and Mr Corbett for having taken this initiative.
I thank them all the more, because in our somewhat beleaguered position, we non-attached members find it practically impossible to table motions, which is why we particularly welcome initiatives such as this.
Next Monday, in Geneva, at the Human Rights Commission, the leader of the Montagnard Foundation, Mr Kok Ksor, will speak for the first time in defence of the rights of his people.
The situation is, I think, extremely serious, not just for the hill tribes but for the entire Vietnamese population.
I have a number of reservations on points 4 and 5 of this resolution, because I think that Mr Poul Nielson's overall concept of cooperation needs to be challenged.
Helping the Vietnamese authorities fight poverty has not achieved anything, especially in terms of democratising Vietnam: there is the very serious problem of the hill tribes, but there is also the problem of freedom of worship for the Christian minorities and even for the Buddhist majority.
The patriarch of the Unified Buddhist church, Thich Huyen Quang, has been incarcerated for the last twenty years, as has his number 2, Thich Quang Do, who has been incarcerated in his pagoda for several years now.
Such is the situation in Vietnam.
The European Parliament has stressed time and again that Poul Nielson's policy has not brought about any improvements in Vietnam, despite massive funding from the Commission.
I do not think that the inefficiency of Poul Nielson's policy surprises any of us, but we do need to remind ourselves of it whenever we can.
There are also long-standing ties with the Communist International in the region.
Mr Hun Sen, whose history with the Khmer Rouge is often glossed over, clearly still has close allies in Hanoi, which explains this connivance in the hill tribes affair, which I think we have a duty to condemn.
The Commission fully shares the concern of the members who have spoken about the situation of the Vietnamese Montagnards.
We have always recognised that complex events were behind the instability which started to take hold in the central mountains of Vietnam at the beginning of 2001.
Like you, we have watched the exodus of the hill tribes from the region with concern and have supported efforts by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, working with the Vietnamese and Cambodian governments, to guarantee suitable conditions under which those wishing to can return.
We are therefore sorry to see that the tripartite agreement has been broken and, given the circumstances, we welcome the positive decision by the Cambodian government to allow Montagnards currently living in the refugee camps in Cambodia to return to the United States under the plan coordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
However, we feel that this measure does not offer a definitive solution to the problems at the root of this exodus.
We shall therefore continue to encourage Cambodia to face up to its international responsibilities.
It is subject to the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and should continue to offer aid, asylum and temporary protection to asylum seekers.
At the same time, we share the views expressed by the members in their resolution that Vietnam should continue in its efforts to improve protection for civil, political and religious rights.
In the case of the hill tribes in particular, the Vietnamese government can obviously only deal with these problems at a local level and that is where they must be dealt with.
These issues tie in generally with the need for pro-active reform in Vietnam; the Vietnamese administration needs to get used to the idea of pluralist opinion and the virtue of a political regime which brooks different points of view at all levels, which is not necessarily the case at present.
Vietnam also needs to extend its legal reforms and ensure that the constitutional rights of all its citizens are applied fully and fairly.
That is the Commission's position.
With all due respect to Mr Dupuis, may I close by reminding him that our policy in Vietnam is not the policy of Poul Nielson, it is the policy of the Commission, the policy of the Council of Ministers, the policy of the European Parliament, in short, the policy of the European Union.
Mr President, a number of countries around the world have reintroduced Sharia law in recent years, including parts of Nigeria.
In the Sudan Sharia has even been used against Christians, which is contrary to Islamic teaching.
We are not talking here of the death penalty as such, which remains legal in international law and is still practised in a number of democracies, not only the United States, but also Russia, India, Caribbean islands, Japan and Singapore to name but a few.
Indeed, in my own party in the UK the death penalty remains a matter of individual conscience with many, myself included, in favour of its restricted application for the most heinous of crimes, such as child murder and serial killings.
Tens of millions of European citizens also share this view.
Nevertheless, in Nigeria we have the terrible spectacle of women being executed for simple adultery by a barbarically slow and painful method.
It is always difficult to interfere in the customs of others, but it is important that, as a parliament, we transmit our abhorrence at this practice without delay to the Nigerian Government.
Furthermore, I recently heard that Afghanistan has no plans to abrogate the Sharia Criminal Code, including stoning to death for adultery.
I am of the view that, given the fact that the EU is the largest donor to the reconstruction of this country, to the tune of over EUR 1 billion, we should make aid conditional on the cessation of these unacceptable practices.
Both Nigeria and Afghanistan are members of the international community and signatories to various international conventions guaranteeing human rights.
I, like most Members in this House, believe that such Sharia punishments are totally unacceptable at the dawn of the 21st century.
Mr President, Commissioner, the only reason the voices of these two women, Safiya Hussaini and Hafsatu Abubakar, have reached this Chamber today from the distant regions of Sokoto and Katsina in Nigeria is because their situation is the very epitome of all that is unacceptable.
Guilty of having given birth as divorcÃ©es and condemned to the most horrible of deaths, by stoning, Mrs Hussaini and Mrs Abubakar are guilty of being women in a region which fundamentalist Koranic or Sharia law has stripped of all semblance of humanity.
The citizens of certain regions of Nigeria bound and gagged by obscurantist customs are the victims not just of moral regression but also of the regression of civilisation itself.
We have heard the voices of these victims.
Thanks to us and because the entire international community has been moved and motivated, the authorities and national courts in Nigeria have pardoned these two martyrs to religious fundamentalism.
But how can we possibly think that these efforts suffice, when these precepts of times gone by, which victimise and condemn millions of citizens from the day they are born, continue to apply?
The federal state of Nigeria condemns these practices and these courts through its constitution and its international undertakings.
Now it should prove that actions speak louder than words.
In doing so, it could take on the role and set the example which the calibre of its democracy and its transition to democracy have conferred on it within the African and international community.
If it effectively restores the rule of law and demonstrates intransigence in the face of ethnic, sexist or religious intolerance, Nigeria should be able to continue to benefit from Community aid.
If all Nigerians recognised the primacy of human rights, and of course women's rights, over any religious precepts or principles, the European Union would respond by providing full support in a spirit of solidarity for the democratic and economic reforms under way in Nigeria.
Mr President, thanks to action by the international community and previous resolutions adopted by Parliament on human rights in Nigeria, Mrs Safiya Hussaini, who was under sentence of death by stoning, has been pardoned.
