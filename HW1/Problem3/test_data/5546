Before I turn to the details of the directive on the table today, let me pay tribute to the successful and valuable work of the Council of Europe in the area of blood safety.
Our proposal for a directive builds on these achievements.
This new directive will cover blood and blood components not considered medicinal products in so far as it will ensure a comparable level of quality and safety throughout the blood transfusion chain in all Member States.
In addition, the directive lays down provisions at Community level for a quality system for blood establishments and for the training of blood establishment staff.
I am pleased to note that the amendments debated today in general are very supportive of the basic approach of the Commission to issues related to blood safety and the way these should be addressed at Community level.
I appreciate the very valuable contribution of the European Parliament.
A greater part of the amendments constitutes improvements, clarifications, and useful additions to the text and I thank Mr NisticÃ² and all his colleagues for their contribution.
We can accept in full 29 amendments.
There are in addition a further 23 amendments which include valuable ideas that we can endorse, but which, as drafted, are not fully acceptable.
This is either because they contain specific points of substance which conflict with the approach of the directive, or because they raise legal or technical difficulties.
With so many amendments. it is not feasible for me to make specific comments on each of them.
I will therefore concentrate on four key areas, where there are several amendments which we cannot accept, and where I believe that some clarification of the Commission' s position will be helpful.
First, ethical questions.
We all agree that the principle of voluntary, non-remunerated blood donation is of a very high ethical value.
As Mrs Stihler said, the EU charter of human rights demands that no financial gain shall be made from parts of the human body as such.
Therefore I welcome, and will actively support, any contribution the Community can make to achieve comprehensive application of this principle.
But we have to carefully analyse all aspects of the issue.
I am determined to ensure that this new directive will not unwillingly contribute to shortages of life-saving therapies.
The supply of blood and blood derivatives, such as plasma-derived drugs, is a matter of life and death for many patients, as many of you have said.
Much of the plasma used for these drugs in Europe does not come from donations which can be considered 'voluntary, non-remunerated' in the strict sense of the words, and it is difficult to see how these donations could be replaced in the short term.
There is a clear danger that a ban on them might result in severe shortages of these products.
Consequently I consider it premature to effectively ban any donation which is not fully in line with the definition of 'voluntary, non-remunerated donation' provided for in Amendment No 17 and to this extent I agree with Mr NisticÃ² and with the contributions from Mrs Ries, Mrs MÃŒller, Mr Bowis and Mrs Doyle.
I endorse their views and I accept what they said in relation to this issue.
In addition, I have doubts about the legal basis for a provision determining the way donations should be carried out, and this issue was also raised by Mrs Doyle.
Article 152 of the Treaty does not allow the Community to adopt measures which 'affect national provisions on donation' .
Whether an obligation to accept voluntary donation only can be justified in terms of increased safety seems questionable.
Particularly in the field of plasma-derived products, safety nowadays depends far more on sophisticated screening tests and inactivation steps.
Such a provision might therefore be challenged before the Court of Justice due to lack of an appropriate legal basis or on the grounds of subsidiarity.
For these reasons, I can only partly accept Amendments Nos 55 and 56.
As already indicated, I am prepared to discuss any solution that would make it clear that a comprehensive application of the principle of voluntary, non-remunerated donation is a central long-term aim of the Community.
Amendments Nos 1, 3, 7, 8, 12, 60 and 61 aim to introduce declarations or requirements of enhanced ethical standards in one way or another.
All of them are certainly worthwhile discussing and studying in detail, but from our point of view they are not really suitable for this directive, because they are either not directly linked with its objectives or do not have a legal basis in the Treaty.
Some of you said that remunerated donations have a greater risk from a safety point of view.
Many of you referred to studies.
All the advice I receive is that these are old studies.
All of the modern studies run to the contrary.
In view of the fact of what I said earlier in relation to other safety measures like screening tests and inactivation steps, these provide the degree of security that is necessary having regard to this particular debate.
It was also suggested that if we did have a shortage of supply, that this could be replaced by imports, but I have to point out that the imports will be from remunerated sources, so this undermines the very purpose that people wish to achieve.
Mrs Ries also mentioned that she had been contacted by haemophiliac associations and indeed some others made the same point.
I should say that my services and I have also been contacted by haemophiliac and other associations urging us not to go down the route of eliminating from the chain donations from remunerated supply.
I would urge Parliament to take this very much to heart when considering voting on this issue tomorrow and to follow the views that I am expressing on this.
I fully endorse and fully agree with the views of many of you who have already spoken on this issue.
The next issue I want to touch on is the scope of the directive.
The last part of Amendment No 13, together with Amendment No 72, aims to extend the scope of the directive to the collection and testing of blood and blood components as starting material for medicinal products.
The Commission can accept this in principle, but legal clarity has to be maintained as to the respective fields of application of this directive and Directive 89/381/EEC on blood and plasma derived products.
Therefore, it will be necessary to review the wording of both amendments in the light of the final compromise to be agreed with the Council.
Other amendments introduce the term 'blood derivatives' into the text of the directive; this cannot be accepted, because it might lead to confusion with 'medicinal products' .
Let me be clear: Everything made from blood and used in human therapy should fall under either this directive or the existing Directive 89/381/EEC.
If any doubts exist the Commission will reconsider the definitions used.
The third point relates to the technical standards.
The rapporteur has proposed to remove the technical annexes from the directive, and to adopt technical standards later by comitology.
I appreciate this approach and I am very grateful for the trust in the work of the Commission shown by this move.
Members of Parliament will know that this is an issue that I have spoken on before in Parliament and I am particularly pleased that this approach has been adopted on this occasion.
If the Council can accept this solution, my services will immediately start to draw up proposals for technical standards in order to ensure that they are adopted before the directive comes into force.
Let me also reassure you that my services will not try to reinvent the wheel when preparing the regular adaptation of the technical standards according to scientific and technical progress.
We will fully use the pioneering work of the Council of Europe.
To add to and further complicate these procedures would not be feasible in an area where quick decisions may have to be taken to protect public health.
For this reason, I can only partly accept Amendments Nos 68 and 71, and I cannot accept Amendment No 69.
Amendments Nos 39 and 41, which refer to another directive or ISO standards as reference for standards introduced under this directive, cannot be accepted.
When proposing updated standards, the Commission will take into account all relevant external and EU standards by default.
To mention some at the expense of others could cause legal problems in the application, or force the Community to apply standards established outside its legal framework.
We are also unable to accept Amendment No 22 introducing a definition of traceability, which in my view is not only too general but also not covered by the Treaty.
Amendment No 44, introducing a universal donor identification system, which is both costly and over ambitious and unnecessary, is not acceptable either.
Finally, the qualifications of blood establishment staff.
Amendment No 33 would restrict the qualifications of the 'responsible person' to that of a medical doctor.
This is too restrictive and cannot be accepted.
The 'responsible person' is, according to the proposal, charged with administrative and management tasks in relation to the application of the directive, and does not have medical responsibilities per se.
But again Member States are free to impose further demands as to the qualifications of the 'responsible person' .
In summary, for the reasons I have set out, 19 amendments are not acceptable.
These are Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 19, 20, 22, 30, 33, 39, 41, 44, 47, 60, 61, 69 and 73.
52 amendments are acceptable in full or in part.
The following 23 amendments are acceptable in part: Amendment Nos 2, 5, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 27, 28, 32, 35, 43, 46, 55, 56, 62, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71 and 72.
The remaining 28 amendments can be accepted in full, including Amendment No 75, the so-called 'compromise amendment' .
Let me, finally, repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work done by the rapporteur and the committee and indeed all of you present.
Many of the amendments will improve the proposal.
And for those elements where difficulties remain, the Commission is ready and willing to assist in finding solutions quickly.
Indeed, the fact that the Commission can accept in whole or in part 52 of the 71 amendments shows our willingness to take on board Parliament' s substantial policy contributions and our confidence that together we will be able to bring forward this important objective and have it adopted as quickly as possible.
Mr President, I shall make this very brief.
The intention seems to be that this House should have a debate on blood at about midnight when the werewolves are out, but be that as it may, at precisely midnight, I heard Commissioner Byrne say - but it may have been an error of interpretation, which is why I should like to have it repeated - that he did not believe that blood from stable and voluntary pools of donors, familiar to us from a number of Member States, was safer and of a higher quality than that obtained from people who supplement their income by donating blood.
I am shocked that this is how the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection views the situation, so I hope that he will deny having said these words.
It is absolutely certain that blood from a voluntary and stable body of donors who readily make their blood available to their fellow members of society is of a better quality than blood obtained from people wishing to supplement their income in this way.
I would ask you not to reopen the debate, because at the moment the most you can do is ask for clarification or ask the Commissioner a question.
You have the floor, Commissioner.
Mr President, I would be very sorry to shock Mr Lund and, if I can explain my thinking on this, perhaps it might relieve your concerns.
Rather than put it the way you put it, I would say that it does not necessarily follow that blood from a remunerated source is any less safe than blood from an unremunerated source and the studies that have been produced more recently on this issue tend to support that proposition.
Reference has been made to some studies that go in the other direction, but my advice is that those studies are old studies and the more modern view is in accordance with the view that I have just expressed.
Mr President, I would like to corroborate what Commissioner Byrne has just said, with great authority, gravity and professionalism.
Whether the donation is voluntary or not does not affect safety. Safety - and Mr Trakatellis, another man of science, has confirmed this - depends on the quality and sophistication of the tests.
Today we are concerned about prions because there are still no very advanced tests: there has only been one article published in Nature.
I hope that soon, through the flexible and rapid updating mechanism, those tests too can ensure safe blood, but certainly that does not depend on whether a donor is a volunteer or receives an incentive.
Thank you very much, Mr NisticÃ².
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.13 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, as a democrat, I have to take on board decisions even if I do not like them.
Yesterday, however, in connection with my report, a decision was taken which points in two directions.
After we had already discussed the legal basis for this decision, and also raised appropriate objections to it, to which we received no response from the Commission, this House decided yesterday to agree to the Commission's legislative proposal and then passed a resolution rejecting the Commission's proposal. This is recorded under item 11 of the Minutes.
I would now like to propose that the resolution passed by this Parliament yesterday be referred to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the purposes of clarification under Article 148(3).
There are two specific reasons for this: Firstly, we need clarification as to which of the two resolutions in this instance is actually valid.
Secondly, we need, for the future too, clarification in the Rules of Procedure as to what is to happen in cases such as this.
For if, as appears to me, votes are being, as it were, immediately corrected by the authorities, I find that not exactly in order.
I believe that a correction should in principle be made if the Committee on Constitutional Affairs so decides.
I therefore base my objection on Article 148(3). I request this House's Committee on Constitutional Affairs to clarify the situation and set down a ruling in the Rules of Procedure as to how we should proceed in future cases of this sort.
Mr Swoboda, I understand the reasons for your request.
I think the President will need to think it over very carefully and assess whether or not to give it positive follow-up.
I cannot give you an answer off the cuff.
I feel it would be discourteous to say no, but it would also be too hasty on my part to give an answer right away.
If your request is accepted the committee responsible should be the one for the Rules of Procedure, which is currently the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
(The Minutes were approved)
European Ombudsman/Code of administrative conduct
Mr President, in 1993 the Maastricht Treaty established the right to petition the European Parliament and the right to complain to the European Ombudsman as rights of European citizenship.
At the Nice summit in December 2000, these rights were enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The reports and resolutions which the European Parliament is debating today concern the present state of these vital constitutional rights of European citizens.
I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate, which goes to the heart of European citizenship.
Before commenting on some of the reports, I would like to express my thanks to Commissioner Loyola de Palacio for continuing to ensure that the Commission respects deadlines for answers to the Ombudsman's inquiries and provides answers which are complete and accurate.
This good cooperation is vital to ensure that the Ombudsman can deal with complaints promptly and effectively and thereby fulfils his mission of enhancing relations between the citizens and the Community institutions and bodies.
I would also like to pay tribute today to the work of Mr Jean-Claude Eeckhout. He will soon be retiring from his post in the Secretariat-General of the Commission where he deals, amongst other things, with relations between the Commission and the European Ombudsman.
To me, he represents the model public servant. He is devoted not only to the European ideal, but also to the hard practical work of improving administration for the benefit of citizens.
I now turn to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and congratulate Mr Roy Perry on his excellent report.
It is appropriate that Mr Perry should be the rapporteur, since he first launched the idea of such a code some years ago, in the report of the Committee on Petitions on its activities in 1996-1997.
Jean-Maurice Dehousse, rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has also played an important role.
He has stressed that the code should have a firm legal basis and suggested a practical way to achieve this.
I hope that this report will be followed by the rapid adoption of a regulation.
The Nice Charter includes good administration as one of the fundamental rights of citizenship.
I cannot understand why anyone should oppose the idea of Community law providing citizens with as high a standard of legal protection vis-Ã -vis the European administration as national laws already provide vis-Ã -vis the Member States' administrations.
The report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Statute of the European Ombudsman is unusual because the Treaty makes the European Parliament the legislator and also entrusts to it the power of initiative.
The role of the Council is limited to giving its approval to the Parliament's text by qualified majority, whilst the Commission gives an opinion.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Teresa Almeida Garrett, for the principled approach which she has taken to the legislative process.
As she has emphasised, the original Statute was drafted nearly a decade ago.
Its provisions concerning the inspection of documents and the hearing of witnesses need to be updated in the light of the greater emphasis on administrative openness and the need to gain the confidence of the public and promote a modern administrative culture at Community level.
The report of the Committee on Petitions on the Ombudsman's Annual Report for the year 2000 is also before you.
I congratulate the rapporteur Mr BÃ¶sch for his excellent and constructive report, which rightly focuses on the need to serve European citizens effectively.
I fully agree with the rapporteur that the Ombudsman should deal with complaints as quickly as possible.
To this end, we have continued our efforts to eliminate unnecessary delay by insisting that the institutions and bodies respect the deadlines for responding to complaints and by improving our own efficiency.
We have made progress towards achieving our internal management targets of acknowledging complaints within one week, deciding on their admissibility within one month and closing inquiries within one year.
At the end of August last year, there were 65 cases still open after one year.
By August 2001 the comparable figure was 25 cases.
Of these, one remains open because we have submitted a special report to the European Parliament.
In five other cases, the Statute lays down that the institution concerned has a further three months to produce a detailed opinion.
Mr BÃ¶sch's report also refers to the problems which the Committee on Petitions has faced in obtaining the information needed to deal effectively with citizens' petitions.
An example of such problems is the case of the petition concerning the regulation of the Lloyd's insurance market.
In my view, the most effective way to improve the situation could be through strengthening cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, especially in relation to petitions about infringements of Community law by Member States, where the Commission plays a vital role through the so-called Article 226 procedure.
We would be ready to handle the preparation of such cases in a professional way and thereby facilitate the work of the Committee on Petitions.
For my part, I am ready to enter discussions with the committee and the European Parliament's administration to achieve this.
In conclusion, Mr President, I shall make some brief comments about the Commission's recently published White Paper on governance.
The White Paper contains much talk, but few concrete proposals for action to benefit citizens.
It could have contained firm commitments to: propose a law on good administrative behaviour, to ensure the rule of law and respect for citizens by the EU administration; reform the way that the Commission acts as Guardian of the Treaty in order to make the procedure open, fair and understandable; advise officials to use their freedom of speech to promote debate and help focus citizens' attention on European issues; reinforce the legal advice service to citizens in the Commission representations, thereby promoting the correct application of Community law.
But it does not.
I am sorry to say that the Commission seems to have forgotten European citizenship. This neglect is illustrated in a brochure which the Commission has recently published called Who's who in the European Union.
The brochure mentions the Charter on Fundamental Rights and the fact that the European Parliament exercises democratic control over the Commission's activities. However, it contains no reference to citizenship or to the right to petition the European Parliament or to complain to the Ombudsman, which the Nice Charter includes as fundamental rights of European citizenship.
I would like to call the present Commission back to the road of making European citizenship a living reality.
It is the only way to obtain the confidence of the citizens, which today seems more lost than ever before.
Citizenship may be less fashionable than the more technocratic sounding 'governance' , but there are no technical solutions to the deep gulf between the rulers and ruled in Europe.
This gulf was revealed not just by the Irish referendum but by every other referendum on Europe in the last decade and also by the events in Gothenburg.
It can be bridged only slowly, by the development of European citizenship in an honest, fair and just way.
(Applause)
rapporteur. (DE) - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Ombudsman most warmly on the work which he and his colleagues carried out in 2000, and would like to lay before you some figures to emphasise these congratulations and this esteem, and which underline how this People's Advocate has become an institution whose absence from the European scene can no longer even be contemplated.
In 1995 there were only 298 complaints; in 2000, to which my report refers, there were by contrast 1732.
There were of course many cases which, in the final analysis, were not within the remit of the European Ombudsman.
However, the excellent networking of the European Ombudsman, which is to be further intensified in the future, resulted in the cases and complaints in question being passed on to the appropriate agencies.
An Ombudsman is there, after all, for the citizens, and there is sometimes confusion about who is responsible for what.
The Ombudsman has already addressed many of the points made in my report.
The ever shortening turnaround times are greatly to be welcomed; here, the Ombudsman is an example of good administrative practice on a European scale.
Eighty-three per cent of complaints were against the Commission.
I do not wish to make this an accusation levelled at the Commission; the division of competencies makes it quite obvious who is most going to be complained about.
What I, however, find interesting is what the complaints focus on.
In 28% of cases, it is a lack of transparency or the withholding of information, and in 24% avoidable delays.
Over half the complaints, therefore, focus on these two areas.
What this is about, Commissioner, is good governance.
It is precisely in these areas that we could improve European administration at no cost whatever.
However, I consider it quite remarkable - and this is something that must be said very clearly in a Parliament such as this - that those at the top of the Commission have neglected to consult the European expert on good governance - namely the Ombudsman - about the White Paper on the subject.
So I must ask you, Commissioner, how seriously you are taking the improvement of administration across Europe.
We do not need White Papers, we have an Ombudsman who gets complaints from our fellow citizens every year.
All that is needed is willingness; not repeated postponement and the commissioning of reforms and White Papers and studies and who knows what else; what we need is different administration.
That is perfectly clear from this report, in whose appendix I have taken the opportunity to discuss specific examples.
There is an instance, Commissioner, of a submarine.
You will be well aware of what significance submarines had for the previous Commission and what the consequences were.
If the European Ombudsman needs to intervene nearly a dozen times in order to get the Commission to certify that such a submarine had work done on it, then that tells you something about the new Commission.
If this Commission took until 2000 to concede that submarines existed, then whom are you trying to convince that this Commission is willing to take transparency and - let me say this as a Socialist - the protection of employees' rights in Europe seriously?
I really would like our Ombudsman to follow up instances like this rather more stringently in order to give them the critical attention they deserve, for the alternative would be undiluted flattery, credible to nobody.
Mr SÃ¶dermann, I would again ask you, as I did in the report, to consider presenting a special report on the issue of access to documents and data.
Otherwise, I can only repeat my thanks to you for your work.
In these thanks I wish to include your colleagues.
I believe your work has become a quite central building block for the further development of the European Union, and I hope that it will continue as it has begun.
Mr President, this week we have been debating very many important issues: the enlargement of the Union, the future governance of the Union and anti-terrorism measures amongst others.
I do not want anybody to think that the issues addressed in the joint debate this morning are not themselves of the utmost importance.
The European Union is a great ideal.
The institutions are undoubtedly worthy and officials of the institutions seek to discharge their functions responsibly.
As the Ombudsman himself said this morning, unfortunately the institutions of Europe do not enjoy the highest reputation amongst our citizens.
It is critical, therefore, that every step is taken to ensure the quality of the administration of European affairs by the EU institutions.
In Parliament we have the Petitions Committee and the Officer of the Ombudsman to oversee allegations of maladministration.
I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Herbert BÃ¶sch in his report on the Ombudsman, my colleague on the later report, Felipe CamisÃ³n on the work of the Petitions Committee and Mrs Almeida Garrett on her work on the Statute of the Ombudsman.
We need a new framework agreement so that the Member States also pay more serious attention to their obligations under the EU Treaties.
We should also place on record our appreciation to the Ombudsman and to his staff for the calm and efficient way in which they discharge their functions.
It cannot be easy to be the complaints department of Europe.
It requires special skills and Mr SÃ¶derman has shown us that he has those in abundance.
To turn to my own report proposing a code of good administrative behaviour, this has been a long time in the gestation and in the last Parliament there were reports from myself and from Mrs de Esteban proposing a code of good administrative behaviour.
I am grateful to rapporteurs from the Citizens' Rights Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee, in particular Mr Dehousse, who have pointed to a procedural route that could, and will I hope, enable us to get this code.
There are two central principles if the code is to be fully effective.
One, it must be based in law.
Good administration is a right, not a privilege and the code must be uniform for all the institutions.
Citizens need to know where they stand and precisely what their rights are in dealing with the institutions.
The right to good administration is enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
But without this code, the charter would just be a form of words.
This code is to put flesh on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is a concept that is contained within similar laws in most of the Member States.
Spain, is just one example.
Its 1992 administrative law requires that citizens be treated with respect and cooperation by the authorities.
Germany and its unfair practice law dating from 1909 enforces good practice upon its officials.
The European Union must now follow suit with its own code of good administrative behaviour.
I appreciate that the Commission in particular, but also the other institutions, have adopted and are applying their own voluntary codes.
They are good as far as they go, but they do not go far enough, and they have to be obligatory rather than voluntary.
There are, however, some differences between the proposed code as now drafted by the Ombudsman, which I hope that this House will support, and the codes currently in use.
I would refer just to one of them and that is the requirement that when an error has been made the official concerned has to apologise to the citizen who has suffered as a result.
A readiness to apologise never comes amiss, so I particularly support that particular clause in the draft.
In conclusion, British Members like me are often against written constitutions.
They are alien to our tradition.
They seem to us very often to concentrate on giving power to those in authority and ignoring the rights of the citizen.
But from the Magna Carta 1215 to our citizens' charter of the 1990s, we in Britain have welcomed codes that set out citizens' rights.
I hope that fellow Europeans will see this as a contribution to the good governance of Europe that even British Members can support.
Mr President, Commissioner, Ombudsman, recently, the Charter of Fundamental Rights acknowledged every European citizen' s right to good administration.
We feel that this is a fundamental objective of European integration and, as such, an area that unites us with everyone, in the sense that we are all on the same side, civil servants and politicians, taxpayers and administrators.
Since 1994, European citizens have had their own Ombudsman and know that they can rely on him and his actions, always competent and judicious, to protect their rights and to sensitively and ceaselessly endeavour to correct and improve the running of Community administration.
For this reason, the Ombudsman has always been able to count on the support of this Parliament.
In the course of recent years and through the presentation of annual reports, we have been able to see the increasingly visible affirmation of this still young institution and the increasingly consistent and productive results of its worthy activity.
The time has come today to present you with some amendments to its statute.
We are not of course, talking about a revolution.
Time has proved, and the practice employed by the Ombudsman is an example of this, that the powers and the competences granted him have always been used to fulfil the central objective of his activity, in his ceaseless quest to improve the sound administrative practices of the European Union.
What we are discussing today is simply the adaptation of the Statute' s provisions to the new legislative climate which has, fortunately, been making considerable progress towards the construction of a genuine Europe of the citizens, by improving the speed of a modern administration, which must be increasingly open and transparent.
By clarifying the Ombudsman' s powers of investigation, by giving him all the resources for accessing documents and for uncovering the truth, we can be sure of improving the administration' s operating conditions and of bringing the public closer to the various European institutions.
I wish to say one last word, Mr President, simply to mention the only area which has, on occasions, divided us, on which today an amendment to my report will be tabled which I cannot support.
It concerns the possibility for members of the institutions or more specifically, members of the Commission to also be heard by the Ombudsman.
I am convinced that the majority of this House will understand that given the hazy border that sometimes exists between political and administrative acts, Parliament claims for itself the monopoly on political control of the members of the Commission, as the prerogative of those who have been directly elected by the citizens of Europe and that it acknowledges that this power cannot be delegated.
It is in recognition of this common philosophy that this Parliament, and its rapporteur in particular, hope that the Commission, especially Commissioner Loyola de PalÃ¡cio, will deliver a favourable opinion and that the Council will approve the amendments that I have tabled today.
Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman on the extremely competent work he has done, and especially his work in defence of the rights of all the citizens of the Union.
A special thank you goes to Mrs Almeida Garrett, who has succeeded in putting her case with great ability, and has also been successful in conducting intelligent mediation.
Society advances and the law always follows its progress.
Sometimes that progress is rapid and the law seems slow compared with practice.
That is why I think the Ombudsman is right to propose amending Article 3 of the statute, which dates from the 1990s.
However, together with other members of the Committee on Petitions, I felt that the request to amend Article 3 went too far, in particular as regards the obligation to testify, even for members of the Community institutions.
This is because there is a difficulty and confusion, including legal confusion, between control of the institutions' administrative practices and control of political acts of members of those institutions.
There was therefore a need to maintain greater balance, although there is no intention to slow down any investigation, for clarity and above all in defence of proximity and transparency, fundamental pillars contained in the Union' s Treaties.
I think the solution adopted of partial revision, to which the Ombudsman has also contributed with his final letter accepting the positions of the rapporteur, Mrs Almeida Garrett, and the Commissioner, is the best way forward, and in the future appropriate steps can be taken to carry out a more systematic and juridical revision of this statute, respecting Community legislation and continuing to act in accordance with that principle of proximity and transparency which governs - and should continue to govern - the relationship between European citizens and Community institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The proclamation of the Charter represented an important step forward for the citizens of the European Union, even if there is controversy as to what legal reality this proclamation has achieved in the meantime.
In any case, the continuation of this important process demands further efforts at every level.
The Charter further laid down, in addition to other important things, a triad of significance to EU citizens which is echoed in the three reports before us: petitions, the Ombudsman and good administration.
For this, the three rapporteurs, Mr BÃ¶sch, Mrs Almeida Garrett and Mr Perry, to whose report I have the honour of speaking, deserve especial thanks and also congratulations.
In reinforcing the triad I have referred to, they have achieved an important step forward, for there is a need for the creation of a further substructure, a network, to secure these institutions for the citizen.
It will now be exciting to see how this network's ramifications will develop.
The law has many instruments through which to turn rights into realities - constitutions, laws, regulations, decrees, right down to service instructions.
In all these, the principle applies: the more generally a right is formulated, the higher up this hierarchy it should be set, and the more specifically, the further down it.
So it is good that we have a code for good administrative conduct before us, and it is right to encourage the Commission to make a regulation for this purpose.
When this regulation is put into tangible form, however, we must keep a careful eye on its precise final content.
In Germany, there was at one time a regulation which stated that a soldier had to start swimming, once he reached a depth of 80 cm of water.
Write this into a constitution and comedians will have a field day with it.
And so it was with good reason that this was not in the German constitution, but in a service regulation.
I believe it to be important that administration should be well organised.
This does not only mean ensuring that the right decisions are taken but also touches on the question of how administration comes across to the citizen - at the shop counter, as it were.
This is very important.
Modern administration means that the citizen is not the authorities' supplicant, but one of its customers.
Modern administration involves the authorities not thinking of themselves as superiors, but as providers of a service.
That is what they are there for, and the citizen is entitled to expect good services.
Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating my fellow committee members, Mr BÃ¶sch and Mr Perry, and also Mrs Almeida Garrett, for their reports.
Also Mr SÃ¶derman for his continued unstinting defence of European citizenship.
The approach of these reports is based on the need to create a system of transparency and understanding, so that citizens of the European Union can be confident that when they have a legitimate complaint they have recourse to the Ombudsman or the Committee on Petitions, depending on the nature of their problem.
It is important that we clarify for the public the distinct functions of the two institutions and press for more publicity and a more effective information policy for both the Ombudsman's office and Parliament's petition process.
I fully support the view that is necessary to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the treaties of the Union, so as to further enhance the rights of citizens of Europe.
To succeed as the most progressive combination of States, we must ensure that our institutions are fully democratic and accountable and that the individual and collective rights of all are guaranteed and defended.
I congratulate the Ombudsman in particular for succinctly identifying - perhaps one of the few to have done so at European level - the underlying reason for the failure of the Irish referendum and that is the gulf between rulers and ruled.
There is absolutely no doubt in my view that that is the case and it has given rise to all kinds of concerns.
The BÃ¶sch report quite rightly praises the cooperation between Parliament and the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman's office and the invaluable procedure of referring complaints to the Committee on Petitions where they fall outside his remit.
I welcome the Ombudsman's suggestion that there be a much closer working relationship between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman's office with regard to the legal implications of some of the cases that come before us.
The Perry report is another piece of important work and, as the Ombudsman has said, it is appropriate that Mr Perry, the author of the report, is given a role in initiating the whole idea of a code of conduct at European level.
It is essential that a common code of conduct applies in all our institutions, so that citizens are not baffled or bamboozled by the response of our institutions to their problems and complaints.
Mr President, these three reports generally give a strong endorsement of the function of the office of Ombudsman and also of its current incumbent and my group warmly congratulates Mr SÃ¶derman on his work.
It is clear that the Ombudsman, reinforced by the Charter, plays an increasingly meaningful and forceful role in protecting the citizen from abuses of executive authority.
We have tabled one amendment to Article 3 of the Statute, which would bring Members of the Commission and Members of Parliament as well as members of the agencies of the Union, such as Europol, beneath the purview of the Ombudsman.
The Commission opposes this reform on the grounds that it implies political interference, but we believe that the Ombudsman is perfectly capable of distinguishing between maladministration and defective politics.
The right to inquire into the conduct of those supremely responsible for administration is an essential part of good governance and a necessary complement to, not a substitute for, the work of this Parliament in exercising democratic accountability in relation to the College.
In most, if not all, Member States national ministers are subject to inquiries by the national ombudsman and it would be a pity if European standards of good administration fell below the norms now established in our Member States.
In fact, in our view, they should be superior.
Mr President, the Ombudsman, Jacob SÃ¶derman, said in this debate this morning that citizenship is perhaps less fashionable than the technocratic way of doing things, and in this he might be right.
However, I would like to say that the Committee on Petitions may even be the very committee in this Chamber that is able to find solutions to the gaping chasm that exists between the people and the decision-makers.
In my opinion these annual discussions are always among the highlights of the year and it is most agreeable to be able to participate in them.
Mr BÃ¶sch' s report on the annual report on the Ombudsman' s activities reiterates this call by Parliament for making the Charter of Fundamental Rights a binding component of the Treaties.
This deserves our enthusiastic support as this may just be one way - as Mr BÃ¶sch and the Committee state - to reinforce and broaden the scope of the right of petition instrument.
Some day it might evolve into a real citizens' initiative, found in the legislation of some Member States.
With regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, the subject of Mr Perry' s report, Parliament takes the view that what is needed is a law that is binding on all the institutions making it obligatory that administration should actually serve the people.
It is quite clear that the Commission should now be promoting this swiftly and determinedly.
Mr Duff has already referred to Teresa Almeida Garrett' s report on the Statute of the European Ombudsman, and I have to say his arguments convince me that it should be possible that members of the institutions can also if necessary be heard by the Ombudsman when it is a matter of administrative error.
In my opinion, Members of Parliament have nothing to fear from this as the Ombudsman' s competence is administrative and not political.
I hope Mr Duff' s amendment will be widely supported.
Applause
Mr President, what we are discussing here today is European citizenship and the rights of European citizens themselves.
As I see it, the rapporteur, Mr Perry, is strongly advocating a code of conduct which reflects the aims guiding those who drafted Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, namely the citizens' right to good administration.
Clearly, such a code calls for good administration by all those involved, institutions and officials alike. Furthermore, it should be implemented in the same way within all institutions.
The code must be as widely known, as transparent and as accessible as possible to the citizens and should help to make the European institutions more credible and bring them closer to the citizens.
Incidentally, I have to say that we still have a long way to go to achieve this. In addition, there must be no discrimination for reasons of sex, race, colour, ethnic origin, language or religion when implementing the code.
In this connection, Mr President, I think it is worth mentioning that, even in this institution, far more zeal than usual is displayed in asking one of our German colleagues for her card. It so happens that the lady is of Kurdish descent, with a dark complexion and black eyes and therefore does not look like the average Member.
If such behaviour goes on here, in this very House, imagine what can happen in the wider world.
It is therefore essential for the code of conduct to be implemented with no discrimination whatsoever.
The bodies already implementing the code of good conduct proposed by the Ombudsman deserve to be congratulated. I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Ombudsman himself on his work.
Through the citizens' complaints the Ombudsman and the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions on which I sit have become very aware of how much more still has to be done to make the European institutions more credible and bring them closer to the citizens. It is for us to work to promote such closeness and credibility.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to say something about the proposed modification of Article 3 of the Ombudsman' s Statute, in other words Mrs Garrett' s report.
We feel that giving access to all the classified documents from a Member State without the consent of that Member State, even if the documents could concern diplomatic or defence issues, is a very dangerous precedent, especially if this revision is in some way imposed on the Member States.
The perverse result of this measure, if it were adopted, would obviously be that the Member States would be encouraged to retain classified documents rather than passing them on to Community bodies, and this is why my group cannot support this proposal.
At present, with regard to the BÃ¶sch report, we do not entirely share Mr BÃ¶sch' s optimism on the analysis of the activity of the European Ombudsman.
It is true that the work done by Mr SÃ¶derman' s department seems quite remarkable given the modesty of their resources.
However, just over 1 700 complaints received in 2000, of which only 297 have been declared admissible, does not demonstrate good administration by the institutions of Europe, it shows above all a lack of information to citizens on their means of defence against some aspects of Brussels bureaucracy.
As for the tenor of the complaints lodged, which were mainly against the Commission, we feel they are symptomatic: refusal of information, lack of transparency, delayed payment, abuse of power, injustice and even discrimination are the main grievances.
It is on the basis of these grievances that I think we should continue our discussion.
Mr President, Mr SÃ¶derman, it is more than ten years since we proposed introducing a European Ombudsman.
We fought for a long time to obtain a proper statute so that the Ombudsman might have the opportunity to inspect everything.
That battle was lost but must now be joined again.
The statute should be revised so that the Ombudsman is entitled to see each and every document before he has to pronounce upon a matter.
The Ombudsman must, of course, respect privacy and reasonable demands for confidentiality, but he must have the opportunity to see everything.
If the Commission' s officials themselves can decide what they want to have inspected, then it is not of course the role of an Ombudsman we are talking about here, but a public relations function.
The European Parliament' s Committee on Budgetary Control has the same problem.
The Commission itself decides what it wishes to have inspected.
Even the Court of Auditors does not have the opportunity fully to inspect the Commission.
The President explained in the Committee that he too is not allowed to see every document.
This is where Mr Prodi ought to begin, instead of issuing further empty promises about more transparency and a closer relationship with the people.
The Ombudsman and the Court of Justice have done some good work in the interests of greater transparency.
Mr SÃ¶derman deserves a lot of praise, but the new regulation on transparency will not constitute great progress towards transparency. Instead, it is in danger of being an actual setback.
There is therefore a need now for active efforts on the parts of the Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control.
A number of active members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have brought legal proceedings against the Commission, and these are something which the whole Parliament should support.
The Court of Auditors ought not to accept a single refusal to let it see a document.
If the event of such a refusal, Parliament should make it known that it is not giving discharge. And why - I would ask the Ombudsman - not appeal to the people and go before the Court of Justice in the event of what you consider to be an unjustified refusal to grant access to documents?
Mr President, this may well look like a fight over a tiny paragraph somewhere in the EU's great system of treaties, but I believe that what we are dealing with is a quite fundamental question and not just a cultural contrast.
Again we see that the world has not yet managed to allow the principles of the Enlightenment, which have found their way into American case law via the Constitution and the Freedom of Information Act, to travel to Europe, because the Enlightenment unfortunately made no inroads into the French administrative tradition. That is again how one experiences these various speeches.
It is a bitter experience to find that the EU is still where it was on 17 December 1992, when dealing with the draft on the Ombudsman.
In any case, however, here we are, and I believe that this time we will win.
The many complaints from citizens having problems with EU institutions are essentially to do with so much still being withheld or suppressed.
What is now being proposed in the Garrett Report, which in my opinion can only be supported, is only the first step.
At first it should be the Ombudsman who is actually given access to all documents, but then it should also be the citizens themselves.
We urgently need here a reversal of the burden of proof; I would, indeed, demand of the Ombudsman that he should tell us in future what documents he has still not received where regulations on confidentiality have been invoked, and that we should, by means of this reversal of the burden of proof, reach the point where we really are living out a democracy and, as far as possible, have access to all documents and also to public sittings of the Council.
For I am firmly convinced that a democracy cannot exist without transparency.
Mr President, I welcome all these reports but will concentrate this morning on the BÃ¶sch report, highlighting the very important work carried out by the Ombudsman which goes some way to respecting the idea of transparency and open governance.
This will hopefully show citizens that Europe's institutions do endeavour to act in the interests of its people and that cases of maladministration will always be punished.
Of course the Ombudsman's powers are limited, but I am happy that the report demonstrates that the Ombudsman does his utmost in most cases in the name of fair play.
The bulk of the Ombudsman's report consists of a thorough account of the complaints made to him about maladministration by the European institutions, the investigations his office has carried out and the action taken, including, of course, the results.
However many complaints addressed to the Ombudsman still concern actions by national authorities, for which the European Ombudsman is not competent, and many complaints prove not to merit any action.
The number of cases where the Ombudsman's intervention has proved successful for the complainant shows that the Ombudsman has developed efficient ways of ensuring that the European institutions comply with his recommendations.
The Ombudsman's special reports, based on his right to own-initiative inquiry, make an important contribution to the interpretation and development of Community law.
I particularly welcome the fact that, in connection with the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Ombudsman has strongly urged that the Charter recognise the citizen's right to an open, accountable and service-minded administration.
Community bodies have a duty to shape Community policies and law in a way which is beneficial and comprehensible to citizens.
The People' s Movement against the EU has, from the very beginning, worked to promote effective supervision of the EU' s institutions by the Ombudsman.
We have never had any illusions that this Nordic guarantee of legal certainty, which is of course what the Ombudsman is, would revolutionise the EU bureaucracies, but if only the Ombudsman could clear just a few negotiable paths in the EU jungle, we should view this as progress.
The Ombudsman does not have an easy time of it.
It requires a great deal of patience to put up with the EU systems' inertia.
The Ombudsman' s very moderate proposals for a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour for the individual institutions has of course been met with that mixture of verbal good will and practical passivity which, in practice, can block any progress, and the current restrictions upon the Ombudsman' s ability to obtain any of the relevant information on the matters with which he is dealing - we are concerned here with Article 3 of the statute - is downright scandalous.
The Ombudsman is patient, however.
The institutions shelve recommendations and enquiries, but that does not cause the Ombudsman to give up.
The mill turns slowly, but I believe it turns all the same.
A regulation concerning good administrative behaviour - and which is not ineffectual nonsense from the Commission, but the Ombudsman' s own proposal - is something that we shall be able to support.
Such a regulation will not revolutionise the various forms of administration. For that, fundamental changes to the administrative culture are required, and these will not come overnight.
However, the rules can help develop legal certainty and transparency. Accordingly, we are able to support the proposal to amend Article 3 which, in its present state, really means that the institutions can refuse to provide the Ombudsman with the information needed for him to be able to exercise any supervision at all.
I do not consider the proposal to be far-reaching enough, but limited progress is better than nothing.
I wish Mr SÃ¶derman every success.
Mr President, the joint debate of these three reports is an important debate.
We need to convince people that the work of the Ombudsman is not just important, it is crucial to the proper integration of the European Union.
Unfortunately, a great many of our fellow Members still do not know this.
Luckily, these duties are being carried out by the experienced Mr SÃ¶derman, with his usual degree of enthusiasm for the job.
I drafted the report on the application of Community law and saw the huge problems caused by the poor application of Community law at first hand.
This is not just a legal problem, it is also a social problem, because the society of European citizens malfunctions as a result, and it is a political problem, because it reflects how mature we are about the type of European legal order we want.
At the same time, I saw the huge role played by the Ombudsman in ensuring that this legal order operates smoothly in the Community.
I need only remind you that most infringements of Community law are only discovered as the result of the complaints system.
The second point I want to make in connection with the regulatory role of the Ombudsman is that the right of complaint and petition is tending to develop into a conciliation procedure for resolving differences amicably, which is the only way of settling differences flexibly and cheaply and freeing up the Court of the European Communities.
However, first of all we must do everything humanly possible to find a way of cutting down the time taken to complete the procedure.
I should like to close by pointing out that we need a generally applicable code of conduct on general principles and that individual organisations should only have their own code of conduct on matters which relate specifically to them.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Ombudsman for the splendid job he has done with a view to securing citizens' rights in the EU system.
The institution of the Ombudsman is very important, and it is important that we should all constantly keep an eye on it and ensure that it can thrive, in the light of the new developments too.
The Ombudsman himself stated that there is a gulf between the EU and its citizens.
We do a lot of talking about it, but in reality we bring about very few radical steps to change the situation.
One of the reasons why people cannot fathom the EU system is also, of course, the utterly hopeless way in which we have organised ourselves, with a physical presence in Luxembourg, Brussels and Strasbourg, and I think one might well ask whether it is particularly appropriate for the Ombudsman to be located here in Strasbourg, though this is, of course, also partly due to the Ombudsman' s own decision.
I do not think it is appropriate.
I think it means that the Ombudsman is very easily sidelined in relation to the EU' s other institutions which he has, of course, to inspect but then also to reform, and I am inclined to think that it might go some way towards creating further conflicts.
I would go on to specify a couple of specific areas.
The first is the White Paper.
The Ombudsman himself touched upon this.
I think this is a very good example of a situation in which, as Mr Prodi pointed out the other day, the fact that the Ombudsman does not associate with the Commission on a daily basis means that he is not mentioned at all in the White Paper, as it would otherwise have been only natural for him to have been.
The other thing I should like to say is that I think, in fact, that there are too few complaints.
I am well aware that the Ombudsman is pressed for time, but I cannot understand why there are not more complaints, considering the huge institutional apparatus with which we are concerned here.
The third very important point is that the Ombudsman has made an effort to obtain ombudsmen for the candidate countries.
It is, of course, extremely important that, when the new candidate countries come on board, we also make sure they understand the nature of good administrative behaviour, seeing that they do not of course, in reality, have any special experience of our way of administering matters.
Fourthly, I am very pleased that the Ombudsman has addressed the subject of the e-mail system and that he is doing some energetic work on this so that we obtain real complaints and not only junk complaints.
Mr President, I too welcome these reports and, with particular reference to Mrs Almeida Garrett's report, I welcome the proposals to extend the Ombudsman's right of access to all documents.
I particularly welcome the proposed change relating to the status of documents emanating from Member States.
In the Committee on Petitions and elsewhere, we are running into difficulties on this question: to whom does information belong?
It is crucial that the Ombudsman should have the widest possible access and I agree with comments made by colleagues concerning the need for greater openness.
I only regret that we did not pursue this issue more fully in the Parliament's own debate on access to sensitive documents.
Mr Perry's report is also important, especially in its definition of an institution and the emphasis on the willingness to be helpful and to communicate.
Other civil services could well learn from this and I also welcome the extension of non-discrimination in his proposed Amendment No 11 to Article 5.
Mr President, this year too the Ombudsman' s annual report makes for inspiring reading.
I think it is on the right lines, and it is very gratifying to read that the Ombudsman has obtained the documents he asked for.
I hope this practice will rub off on the rest of the EU system, for that is the way it should be.
Only through openness do we ensure that it is possible to combat fraud and irregularities and that politicians have a better image in the eyes of the population.
We might well have had more use for the Ombudsman in relation to a case in Britain in which Lloyd's cheated thousands of people, an event which led to a long list of tragedies in the form of suicides and much else besides.
We see a lack of openness in the British government, the Council and the Commission, and it would be useful if the Ombudsman could give us further help on this issue.
I believe that the Committee on Petitions should have greater powers.
It is perhaps one of the most important committees, for it is here that the ordinary person within the EU system can come to raise matters.
It is therefore also incredibly important that there should be a powerful committee which can help him when he does just that.
I should like to say that when I heard my fellow MEP' s, Mr Krarup' s, speech, I was very surprised indeed.
Naturally, there were the snide remarks that are bound to come from an opponent but, knowing Mr Krarup as I do, what we have here is proof that he loves this system and really thinks it is fantastically good. It is just that he does not really want to say so.
I believe then that, somewhere along the line, even Mr Krarup will say that we need the EU.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs and Mr SÃ¶derman on their work.
It has made it possible for me to discuss with you issues of an institutional nature which are important to the efficient operation of the European Union. In particular, they are important to our relations with the citizens, and we do need to bring the Union' s institutions as close to the citizens as possible.
I should like to turn first to the BÃ¶sch report, the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2000. Allow me to say once again how much the Commission appreciates the excellent work undertaken by the European Ombudsman' s office, and how grateful it is for it.
The Ombudsman himself, Mr SÃ¶derman, deserves particular recognition.
He is the driving force and is largely responsible for the results and beneficial effects achieved by this new institution of the European Ombudsman. It has to be said that the citizens of Europe are daily becoming more familiar with it.
The European Ombudsman' s work focuses on poor administration and the Commission is bound to improve its administration and the quality of services provided for the benefit of the citizens.
In this context, the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the rapporteur. In particular, it agrees with the need to receive the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions as positively as possible, and provide them with every facility required.
One aspect of the BÃ¶sch report of particular concern to us is the follow-up to critical comments.
Last year, we, in the Commission, set up a new procedure for methodical review of the conclusions to be drawn from the cases dealt with by the Ombudsman.
As I see it, we have definitely improved as far as study, approval and consequently cooperation with the Ombudsman are concerned.
Allow me to refer to two examples to illustrate such follow-up. Firstly, further to the Ombudsman' s initiative, the Commission agreed to make the scripts of candidates in competitive examinations available to them as of 1 July 2000.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are not empty words but actual facts.
I venture to suggest that some of you should keep a closer eye on what is actually happening.
You have levelled some serious criticisms at the Commission. It is only fair to criticise the Commission when it acts inappropriately.
In my view however, constant criticism, targeting the Commission' s work just for the sake of it, is entirely unhelpful. It does not promote the Commission, the institutions as a whole or the idea of Europe amongst the citizens.
Criticism should be voiced when it is called for.
We shall work towards improvements across the board. Furthermore, we shall take all critical comments into account and study, analyse and assess them.
Another example I should like to refer to concerns the citizens' right to freedom of expression and lifting the age limit for staff recruitment.
The Commission is inclined, for example, to offer its political support here. However, these issues go beyond our competence and impact on other institutions too.
For instance, an interinstitutional agreement is required to amend the maximum age at which staff can be recruited. We do endorse and accept the view expressed and are prepared to discuss the matter with the other institutions.
Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether the latter will endorse Mr SÃ¶derman' s approach. As I said, we totally support it.
I shall now move on to Mr Perry' s report on the code of good administrative conduct.
Mr Perry has highlighted how these codes of good conduct are crucially important in guaranteeing a high quality service to European citizens.
They constitute an important tool for us, as we strive to turn the right to good administration enshrined in the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights into an operational guide for the staff of the European institutions.
The Commission therefore warmly welcomed the study undertaken by the European Ombudsman into the existence of such codes.
Furthermore, the Commission worked closely with Mr SÃ¶derman in drawing up the code of good administrative conduct. The latter is now complete and contains a great many of his suggestions and contributions.
It would not be fair to say that all his ideas have been included but most certainly have. Once again, I should like to thank Mr SÃ¶derman for his unfailingly positive approach and for always making helpful suggestions.
We have taken full account of the provisions contained in the Ombudsman' s draft code amongst the various other codes adopted by European institutions and bodies.
Indeed, the Commission' s code approximates most closely to the model put forward by the Ombudsman. This is not only because of its content and legal nature, but also because it is binding on our officials.
I also wanted to urge you not to confuse issues, ladies and gentlemen.
The White Paper on good governance stands for much more than administrative reform.
Administrative reform is already under way and is Commissioner Kinnock' s responsibility. To date, this House has agreed with the Commission that much has already been achieved in that respect.
We must carry the administrative reform through.
We are quite determined to do so.
Mr Kinnock is working very hard to that end, but it is a different issue, quite separate from good governance.
As I said, the White Paper on good governance stands for much more than administrative reform. It aims to establish how best to gather, bring together and integrate the various links in the chain of responsibility within our complex society.
This is a problem not only for the European institutions but for all our countries, all advanced democracies. Society is becoming ever more complex, the technological means allowing information to flow more freely are increasingly widespread, and new possibilities are opening up.
In addition, the way in which citizens organise themselves is daily becoming more complex.
Hence the significance of the White Paper. It puts all this in the context of the interplay between the European institutions.
That amounts to far more than administrative reform.
Consequently, administrative reform should not be confused with the White Paper on good governance being drawn up by the Commission under President Prodi' s guidance.
I should like to make it very clear to Mr Perry that the Commission agrees with him and with Mr SÃ¶derman on how unfortunate it is that such a wide range of codes of varying legal status are currently in place.
This does nothing for consistency or legal clarity.
It should however be borne in mind as Mr Perry suggests in his report, that it would be wise to consider the results of the codes of good conduct implemented or approved recently. In the Commission' s case, this was ten months ago.
As for the Council, it was just before the summer, in July. In our view therefore it is still too early to draw conclusions on the implementation of these codes of good conduct.
We shall start work on a report at the end of the current year. The report will refer in particular to the Commission' s own code of good conduct which will by then have been in place for a year.
As soon as sufficient information becomes available, the Commission will consider whether or not to prepare a legislative proposal for a horizontal regulation.
We need to have more information available so we do not at present have a position on the matter.
As for Mrs Almeida Garrett' s report, I have to say that from an institutional point of view it is undoubtedly the most sensitive.
I shall only refer to it briefly however, because pursuant to Article 195 of the Treaty the Commission is only competent to give an opinion, and the latter is not binding.
Nonetheless, I feel it is important to make our view known.
In the first place, Mrs Almeida Garrett deserves to be congratulated on her excellent work.
I have also had the opportunity to speak on the subject at the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to emphasise how well the present statute has worked.
As I stated earlier, the Commission has followed up investigations launched by the Ombudsman.
The code of good conduct is but one example of this.
In general, the Commission provides a constructive response and complies with the timetable for supplying information to the Ombudsman. I am grateful to Mr SÃ¶derman for highlighting this.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has tabled three amendments.
Regarding lifting the secrecy classification for access to files, I have already explained that the Commission has not resorted to this in any of the twenty requests for access submitted by the Ombudsman.
We could certainly succumb to the temptation of bringing the law into line with reality and go along with the position adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. On the other hand, given that everything has worked well, we might also query whether it is really necessary to amend this point.
We should always err on the side of caution when dealing with delicate matters, given the Commission' s role and the nature of the issues it is dealing with at present. Indeed, the latter will become increasingly delicate and varied as the building of Europe proceeds.
We might also encounter problems with the governments of Member States of the Union.
The structure of the European Union, based as it is on three pillars, means that the function of the Commission and also that of Parliament itself varies depending on the pillar in question.
The Commission will therefore deal with these matters in greater detail in the opinion to be given and put to Parliament in the near future, once a final position on the text approved has been adopted.
Concerning the deletion of the principle according to which when officials give evidence they speak as representatives of their administration, the Commission does not wish to be dogmatic, but we do feel that it is important for officials not to speak simply as individuals.
Rather, they should put forward the details and explanations pertaining to matters they are responsible for.
For the rest, they should comply with what is required of them under their statutes.
Further, I should like to emphasise that as a former Member of Parliament, let alone a Commissioner, I fully endorse the position of the rapporteur, Mrs Almeida Garrett, regarding the differences between political and administrative responsibilities and the European Parliament' s responsibility concerning political responsibilities, the responsibilities of Commissioners and indeed not only Commissioners but members of other institutions.
As regards access to documents emanating from the Member States it would be appropriate, as I said earlier, to be consistent with the new Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents.
The principle of obtaining prior consent from the Member State is provided for under Article 4 Paragraph 5 of the Regulation, and in the framework agreement with Parliament.
Declaration 35 annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty of Amsterdam serves a similar purpose.
In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs once again.
I must also say how very grateful I am to Mr SÃ¶derman for his work. It is most helpful to us because after all, criticism encourages us to improve and also offers solutions.
That has to be borne in mind. We have already made progress regarding the code of good conduct, infringement procedures, and officials' freedom, to name but a few examples.
I venture to suggest in this context that many things are open to criticism, because nothing is perfect. When, however, one fails to go deeper and criticism is unfounded, it runs the risk of losing its value or at the very least, proving less effective.
Mr President, there were a few questions, including two that were raised in Mrs Almeida Garrett's report, which I will try to clarify.
Firstly there was the question of hearing Commissioners as witnesses and the problem that arose in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs where people felt that there might be a difficulty in drawing a line between the political control of the European Parliament, the political responsibility of Commissioners and the administrative responsibility of the same Commissioners.
Many Members of the Constitutional Affairs Committee thought that this was very difficult to solve.
It is very important to understand that the Commission is the executive body and in theory it is the administration of the Union which has contact with the citizen.
Of course the Commissioners have administrative functions.
We have had a few complaints in this connection and the Commissioners have always replied very correctly.
Therefore to avoid further debate and confusion in this matter, this could be deleted from the proposal and, as the rapporteur said, one day an answer in writing might not be necessary.
I would like to stress that OLAF has the right to hear the Commissioners and that was the inspiration for my proposal.
Secondly on the question of all documents.
The idea that the Ombudsman has the right to see all documents is because the citizens do not have this access.
Trust in the Ombudsman's work is based on the fact that the citizens accept that they cannot have access to all documents but they need to know that the Ombudsman has the right if necessary.
This is the basis of their confidence in the Ombudsman's operations.
It is sometimes feared that the Ombudsman might get hold of state secrets.
Having been an ombudsman now for twelve years, I have never in a case of maladministration had to ask for documents on really secret matters.
I am not aware of any case in which an ombudsman has leaked documents.
The principle must, however, be in place that the Ombudsman has the right to see documents.
We have had some problems of interpretation here and we have lost time on both sides.
Mr Prodi asked for a debate on the White Paper and this is what I have tried to start.
It is very important that the White Paper is discussed because there is still one run to go.
I would hope for some more concrete proposals.
I will now turn to the criticism about the low number of complaints, publicising the work of the Ombudsman institutions, and the many complaints outside the mandate.
First of all our mandate lies entirely within the European Union.
Citizens may find this difficult to understand when they encounter problems with Community law.
They go to a Parliament Information Office or Commission Representation, get our form and complain to us.
We try to rectify the situation.
There is the possibility that this limits the number of complaints but the number has been increasing over the years.
On the question of publicising the Ombudsman's work, I would mention that we are more known than many ombudsmen on the national stage and Members of Parliament can surely do a lot to tell citizens about the right to petition and the right of complaint to the Ombudsman.
After all it is you who meet the Europeans out there.
It is you who have the contact with the public.
If you tell people about the possibilities then they will become much better known.
Many of you have done that and I am grateful.
I am really honoured that I had the possibility to discuss these matters.
I am very grateful for the comments made by Mrs de Palacio and all of you here and thank you very much for your work.
Thank you, Mr SÃ¶derman.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

The next item is the report (A5-0236/2001) by Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio on behalf of the Committee on Petitions on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year. [2001/2010(INI)].
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank and congratulate Mr CamisÃ³n on the both meticulous and prospective work that he has done in writing his report.
Thanks to him our colleagues can be aware of the expectations of the citizens of the Union and therefore of the task of the Committee on Petitions.
The situations in which petitioners find themselves are often Kafkaesque.
That is what comes out of reading some of the cases mentioned by Mr CamisÃ³n: whether they are problems of recognition of qualifications, discrimination, payment, or withdrawal of vehicle registration, the complexity is such and the obstacles so clear that citizens feel completely powerless.
The combined work of our Committee and the European Commission means that, by dealing with the problems, what is felt to be injustice can be corrected.
The Committee on Petitions can go further, however.
It can involve citizens in drawing up Community rules.
On 13 June, I had the honour of putting a report on silicone implants to the vote in Parliament.
This report is an example of the use, which is unfortunately all too rare, of paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 175 of the Rules of Procedure, which says in particular that the committee responsible may decide to draw up reports on the petitions that it has declared to be admissible and, if necessary, to put motions for resolutions to the vote in Parliament.
This was the case for the report for which I was responsible.
It was following two petitions collecting more than 1000 signatures that this report was undertaken.
But it was only the second time since the Committee on Petitions was created that a resolution adopted by Parliament resulted from direct complaints from citizens of the European Union.
As advocated by Paragraph 18 of Mr CamisÃ³n' s report, in this case our Committee called on STOA to make a scientific analysis of the problems encountered by petitioners.
Increased use of Article 175, an idea that is defended by the rapporteur, should enable our Committee to make a direct link between citizens' problems and all the Members of the European Parliament.
In my view, this is a political recognition of truly listening to citizens and it is one of the paths for the future for the Committee on Petitions.
Mr President, the fact that over 10 000 petitions have been received by the Committee on Petitions since its inception clearly demonstrates the practical significance of the European Union for its citizens.
The work of the Committee on Petitions has often led to a successful conclusion for the citizen concerned and has in some cases resulted in changes to national law and practice in Member States.
The areas that present the greatest difficulties to individuals and groups of citizens continue to be social protection, healthcare, taxation and recognition of academic qualifications, particularly for citizens who work in states other than their own Member States, such as in border regions.
Environmental complaints are also made on major developments where it is felt that their impact on the environment and the livelihoods of people in the areas affected is being ignored by the developers and in some cases by the authorities concerned.
There have been many successes.
For instance, an Irish petitioner with a UK higher institute teaching qualification was refused the right to apply for a post in a state school.
The Commission took up this case on behalf of the petitioner and the Committee on Petitions and eventually won the case, having met strong resistance from the German authorities.
That is the kind of success that can be achieved by the Committee on Petitions and we need more resources if the Committee on Petitions is to do its work effectively.
Mr President, I should begin by saying how much I appreciate the work undertaken by the Committee on Petitions.
I am aware that it is not one of the most influential committees in the House, and that not everyone appreciates it fully.
Nonetheless, the work of this Committee does represent one of the few channels allowing us to establish direct contact with the citizens and bring the institutions closer to them.
I entirely agree with Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio' s report.
I believe it reflects the concerns of those of us who are most closely involved with the Committee' s work. We shall therefore vote in favour of it.
I should however like to highlight some of the everyday practical problems we encounter...
(Interruption by Mr Marinos) I do apologise, Mr Marinos.
I was saying that we work well in the Committee on Petitions and that our work is very important.
I was hoping to highlight some of the everyday problems we encounter.
Firstly, we enjoy a good relationship with the European Commission. The European Commission and the Ombudsman work closely with the Committee on Petitions.
The opposite is true as far as the Council is concerned. We do not cooperate with it at all, yet the Council could have something to say on a good many petitions and we very much regret it is always absent.
That is our first problem.
The second problem I would like to mention concerns swift and decisive action on petitions.
I am very involved in the Committee on Petitions' work on environmental issues. That is quite logical, as I also sit on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
It is often the case with environmental problems that if it takes a long time for a response to be received, the decisions taken in a particular country prompting the petition have had an irreversible impact on the natural environment by then. The petitioners lose patience.
That therefore is another problem. Responses need to be swifter and more efficient.
I am well aware that Member States are conscious of the fact that delaying responses can facilitate their political decisions. That is sometimes the case.
It is not entirely the Commission' s fault.
The Member States take a long time to respond.
As I said earlier, the Committee on Petitions is very important to me. It is however lacking in human, legal - and here I am addressing our own institution of course - and technical resources, and it does need them.
One of Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio' s proposals seems to me to be entirely appropriate.
It would mean that in cases of lengthy delay in responding to the citizens, the President of Parliament would be requested to publicise the delay and its negative consequences for the petitioners. After all, the latter have enough to do familiarising themselves with Community legislation and assembling the documentation.
In conclusion, I do believe that work needs to be done to educate and inform citizens of their right to petition, because this is one of their rights.
I recall that in the previous legislature it was even proposed to do away with the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
For myself, I wish both Committees a great future in this House as they do at least bring the citizens closer to our work.
Mr President, there is much to support in and little to add to the excellent report by Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio.
I merely wish to highlight the inexcusable fact that the Committee on Petitions is still being rudely ignored by the Council of Ministers, none of whom - not so much as a representative - has ever wanted to work with us.
Why would they?
European citizens generally take recourse to the Committee on Petitions precisely in order to complain about infringements or omissions by ministers and their services, when they are wronged or when their protest or complaint is ignored.
That is precisely why the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman have become the refuge of those who believe that they have been wronged or who, as civic-minded citizens, are trying to do something about infringements, injustice or the destruction of the environment.
That is why the European Parliament needs to pay greater attention to the Committee on Petitions and to give it more scope for efficient intervention.
It is true that the Committee works closely with us but it often comes up against the indifference and filibustering of national services. As a result, cases drag on interminably, to the disappointment of the European citizens seeking our support.
That is why the CamisÃ³n Asensio report quite rightly says that short, mandatory deadlines need to be introduced for dealing with petitions more quickly.
At the same time, we need a procedure for publicising complaints and the inertia or filibustering of the authorities against which the complaint has been made in the petitioner's country.
This will give citizens the only weapon which the guilty authorities fear: publicity which exposes them to the voters.
A proposal which, if adopted, would I think be hugely important: we need, subject to certain requirements, to introduce an injunctions procedure so that an immediate stop can be put to any incipient infringements of Community law which threaten to wreak irreparable damage on the natural environment or our cultural heritage.
Because the time-consuming procedure up to final judgment by the European Court is bereft of any material value if the damage has already been done and cannot be reversed.
Mr President, as this debate comes to an end I would like to thank all the rapporteurs - Mr BÃ¶sch, Mr Perry, Mrs Almeida Garrett, Mrs Sbarbati, Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio - and all the Members who are committed to the institution of petitions. I also would like to thank the European Ombudsman who carries on the fight in defence of the citizens from his observation post.
We are working together, of course, and we too are working for the citizens of Europe, because they have a champion in this Parliament, the most authoritative institution in that respect.
Thanks to the European Commission' s particular sensitivity, as demonstrated by the preparation behind the officers' explanations of their reports in the Committee on Petitions, we have made great progress.
However, more and more European citizens are presenting petitions on personal, social and environmental problems. It is our duty give them increasingly relevant, detailed, and satisfying responses.
Their petitions illuminate the path the Union still has to travel to ensure peace of mind for our citizens.
Of course we do not want dull and amorphous standardisation in the European Union, rather we think above all that cultural differences should be harmonised by turning those differences into the true wealth of the institutions.
We have entered a season of reform, defence and strengthening of the institution of petitions and we believe that season of reform will give us the power to defend the citizens and, at the same time, make the European institutions better known to our ever-growing population.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of this debate is the same as for the previous one, namely relations between the European institutions and the citizens.
I should like to congratulate Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio on his report.
In it he emphasises how petitions allow the citizens to make their legitimate aspirations known and also draw attention to the inherent weaknesses of Community legislation. The Commission is interested in your work on both these counts, ladies and gentlemen.
As an outside observer, allow me to reiterate what I said earlier to Mrs GonzÃ¡lez.
I believe that the Committee on Petitions in this House does serve to bring the citizens closer to the institutions in general. The same is true of similar committees in other Parliaments I am acquainted with, for instance in my own country' s parliament, with which I am most familiar.
They play a key part precisely in bringing the citizens closer to the institutions in general. They are also invaluable to the work of Members themselves, making them aware of issues a significant number of citizens feel are sensitive and worthy of concern.
This last year, not only have the Commission' s services cooperated with this Committee, but we Commissioners have also made it our business to cooperate actively with you, ladies and gentlemen.
I would therefore like to thank Mr Gemelli for his remark.
It is certainly the case that Mr Kinnock, Mr Liikanen, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and Mr Bolkestein have contributed to your work.
They have come in person to discuss and explain issues. They have tried to adduce reasons, possibilities or solutions to concerns expressed by the Committee on Petitions further to requests or complaints by citizens.
This proves how much we in the Commission value your work, ladies and gentlemen.
In this connection I should like to reiterate what I said earlier. The Commission will respond in as open and constructive a manner as possible to your desire for strengthened cooperation.
I appreciate that the time it sometimes takes for us to respond to a query is a problem. Nonetheless, I am sure the House is aware that on most if not all occasions when problems were experienced they arose because the Commission was dependent on a Member State for information.
We have to deal with different administrations.
The only way we can obtain certain types of information from Member States is by exerting political pressure. There are no other means at our disposal.
The Commission brings pressure to bear in the same way as you do, ladies and gentlemen. We publicise the fact that the Member State in question has failed to respond to a query or is hindering a response by the Commission.
I can only promise that the Commission will continue to urge Member States to act on queries as quickly as possible, supplying the information requested. We will then be able to respond appropriately to the concerns raised by you.
In that sense we shall endeavour to continue cooperating fully with the House.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Sugar and preparations intended for human consumption
Mr President, we are being asked to discuss directives about breakfast at the end of the morning.
It is a little late, but I am still going to attempt it.
I would first of all like to point out that this is the second time that we have been consulted on this issue.
In the previous legislature, Parliament gave its opinion on the Commission' s proposals on the simplification of vertical directives on sugar, honey, fruit juices, milk and jams.
The Council took a great deal of time to finalise the case and finally made significant changes to the Commission' s initial proposals.
This is why we are being consulted again today.
I therefore remind you that the idea was to simplify the directives.
The point of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is certainly compatible with this objective, but it also consists of not abandoning quality requirements in the name of simplification, and above all not compromising on good consumer information.
All the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a large proportion of which came from the rapporteur, have this aim.
I would like to point out that the consensus in the Council obviously limits our room for manoeuvre, as we are simply being consulted, that is to say that following our vote today, the Council will, at the end of the day, be completely free to decide.
Nevertheless, I think that the amendments succeed in improving the texts from the point of view that I just specified: quality of products and correct consumer information.
I am going to review the various directives in order to give the main elements of them.
First of all, on sugars, there is a small problem of definition.
The Council, quite rightly, has defined a sugar that is being increasingly used, fructose, but it failed to give a definition of what it calls brown sugar.
Parliament' s amendment therefore asks for a definition in the texts.
A deadline needs to be imposed, but the Commission needs to propose a definition.
That seems elementary.
The second case, that of honey.
This is a sensitive case insofar as honey is a high quality product, usually produced on a small scale, with which there have been many marketing problems in previous years, inasmuch as we often see mixtures of honeys and also honeys coming onto the European Union market whose quality is not guaranteed.
We therefore need to be vigilant on definitions and labelling.
The Commission proposes adding a new category of honey, filtered honey.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes that we do not accept this proposal, as filtered honey is in fact a honey whose floral origin cannot be checked.
Most of the time it has lost the pollen that allows this to be checked, which prevents the product from being well defined and goes against a guarantee of quality for consumers.
We therefore propose that we do not accept this proposal.
With regard to harmful substances that may be found in honey for industry or baker' s honey, we think that it should be forbidden for them to be present in honey.
We are of course talking about lower quality honeys, which are used as raw materials in certain preparations in the agricultural and food industry, but there is no question of accepting the presence of harmful substances.
There is therefore an amendment from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in this respect.
The third case, that of fruit juices.
I think that the majority of the amendments are aimed not at making major changes to the proposal from the Commission and the Council, but rather at clarifying the texts and preventing them from going off course.
I will explain: we do not feel that a non-exhaustive list of treatments and substances authorised for production, as it is envisaged, is satisfactory.
A positive list should be given.
We therefore ask the Commission to put forward, within a certain period, a positive list of filtration adjuvants, precipitation agents and absorption adjuvants.
A positive list means that substances that are not on the list are forbidden.
We think that this is clearer, in the end, and more positive for consumers.
An amendment also asks for fungicides not to be used to preserve fruits to be used to make juices, but for only preservation by chilling to be permitted.
With regard to the fourth case, that of milk, there are no proposals for modification.
We think that the text proposed to us is quite satisfactory.
For jams, I personally reintroduced an amendment that was not accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but which I hold to.
It concerns not accepting the general use of a chemical flavouring in jams and marmalades, that is vanillin.
It does not strictly do anything apart from altering the taste.
Mr President, it is about five years ago that the Council consulted us on the proposal to simplify seven vertical directives on foodstuffs.
The aim of those proposals was to simplify the existing legislation, which contains far too much detail, or to replace it by directives containing only the essential requirements.
In that way, they would be easier to implement and better correspond to the horizontal directives.
This is a commendable effort which is in line with the expectations of both consumers and those who are involved in other ways.
We, the PPE-DE Group, are keen to lend our support in this connection.
We have established that the Directive on cocoa and chocolate products, which also originally formed part of this package and which had to undergo the lengthiest legislative procedure, namely that of co-decision, was the first one we managed to complete.
As for the five other directives of the package of seven, the five we are debating today, we will ultimately require more than five years to complete the simplification procedure.
We do wonder if we should not aspire to faster working methods and other decision-making methods, for we do not believe that that is what the public wants.
The PPE-DE Group would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
The delay is certainly not due to him, but due to the fact that the Council has fundamentally changed certain components, thus necessitating fresh advice from us.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I can say that we are in agreement with the report as it emerged from the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
That is the case for all components of the package, except for fruit juices.
On these, our view differs slightly from that in the report, but that was also apparent in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I do not believe, therefore, that I need to go into any more detail here regarding the reasoning, motives and strands of thought behind that difference of view.
However, I do not want to conceal the fact - and I should like to devote the rest of my speaking time to this - that we in our group, further to these issues arising, have held a serious debate on the issue of whether it is really up to a Parliament to discuss such detailed measures with 626 Members.
This is creating problems for us.
Parliament is being slated for this from outside.
That does not mean that we underestimate the importance of food legislation.
We realise that the detail is important in this connection, but we do wonder whether, with the material being at such a high technical level, we really are the people best placed to take the decisions and whether we should inconvenience 626 MEPs with these kinds of far-reaching, technical measures.
The question we asked ourselves is: should we not move towards two kinds of derived legislation, one on which Parliament deliberates and another which, surely, should be entrusted to the executive?
This discussion has certainly not reached its conclusion, but I should welcome a discussion which includes groups other than the PPE-DE Group.
Mr President, back in 1998 this Parliament approved the five directives under discussion today with amendments.
They have been referred back to us simply because there are some changes to the comitology procedure.
I note with satisfaction that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has no objections to the revised procedure.
It is, however, proposing new textual changes to the draft directive.
The purpose of the directives is to simplify rules governing composition and labelling.
We should therefore avoid complicating matters.
Political agreement has been reached on this issue after long and arduous negotiations and we should therefore avoid reopening the negotiations at all costs.
I agree with changes that add clarity to texts but do not change the substance.
One case in point is the inclusion of the definition of brown sugar.
This would be an added protection for consumers.
In relation to fruit juices, the proposed changes to the treatments and substances would be more appropriate within the horizontal legislation governing these treatments.
The suggestion to introduce three new product names for fruit juices is not in line with proposals currently under discussion on the Codex.
Furthermore, they will only serve to reopen the entire debate.
I do not believe that substantial changes, if adopted by this House, will achieve anything.
They will only serve to delay the procedure.
If that happens, it is the consumers who will be the losers in the end.
Mr President, talking about food is not very easy these days. If we then turn to purely technical aspects such as those addressed by Mr Lannoye, the complications increase.
We find ourselves in agreement with his report, except for the point raised by Mr Thyssen.
However the point I want to make is not about the actual merit of the report, but rather about an evaluation that this Parliament needs to carry out over the next few months on the future legislative method.
We also found certain points in this report where we have either aggravated the situation or intervened in legislation already dealt with in the course of the last two months, and here I am thinking, for example, of problems relating to water.
Coordinated production of legislation can, I think, only be helpful to this institution.
Another aspect I want to bring up is the excessive regulation to which we subject our legislative process, which is not reflected in our Member States.
In the Member States a whole series of areas are dealt with through the method of circulars.
As regards the report we drew up last year with the Commission, we will have to think very carefully about those issues, because I do not think a consumer who is buying honey is immediately aware of whether it is honey produced in beehives or filtered honey, even if the label is clear.
As our task is to be impartial and we need to produce legislation that is comprehensible to European citizens, perhaps further thought is necessary over the next few months.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen: I would like to make use of the short time available to me to comment on Article 3 of the Directive on fruit juices.
Today, we are increasingly advocating information and clarification for consumers.
Responsible, adult consumers, getting information from product labels, are meant to decide for themselves what they buy.
Strict, clear, unambiguous regulations, the thinking behind which is clear to all, must be enacted.
Descriptions such as 'juice' , 'fruit juice' , 'nectar' , 'fruit juice from concentrate' or even 'contains fruit' make it difficult for consumers to assess a product's true quality or know how it was produced.
It was in 1975 that the Fruit Juice Directive first introduced consumers to the designation 'fruit juice' or reinforced it, and consumers have got used to it.
'Fruit juice' and 'fruit juice from concentrate' are in the final analysis one and the same product.
The designation 'fruit juice from concentrate' refers only to the manufacturing process and not to the ingredients, which must of course be the same.
The additional designation 'with concentrates' tends in my view to confuse.
Product designations must be clearly defined, simple and comprehensible.
We must prevent additional descriptions which are not absolutely necessary, as confusion is no protection for consumers.
In my view, the proposed Amendments Nos 18, 19 and 25 make the current legal position stricter in an unjustifiable way, particularly for the juice industry, and I believe they should be rejected.
Fruit to be sold fresh in markets, in other words for consumption, may be treated with fungicides.
Why, then, not fruit for juice production?
In exactly the same way, the criteria of the EU Drinking Water Directive must suffice for the water which has to be used in the preparation of fruit juice.
I would ask you therefore, ladies and gentlemen, to vote objectively and purposefully to set a directive on course which will help the consumer and which manufacturers will be able to implement.
Mr President, I share some of Mrs Thyssens' reservations about what we are being asked to do here and the degree of expertise with which we do it.
Mr Lannoye knows he has my respect, but I have to say with some regret that I fear we are repeating some of the debating errors of the chocolate directive and the determination to rechristen some products.
Mr Lannoye's amendments have caused confusion in the name of purity when we come to the issue of honey.
I agree with him about fruit juice and I certainly salute his motives.
But there are a number of Member States which use filtered honey extensively to remove insect debris, grains of sand and pollen fragments.
I have heard no convincing argument that this damage of the product adds unwanted material and indeed there are other amendments before us today which call for the removal of organic and inorganic material from some honeys.
The Council had arrived at a sensible position on this and I have seen no evidence - and I have checked back with our own Food Standards Agency - that there are any legitimate concerns about content.
There are other ways of tracing the origins of honey, as well as the pollen content to which the rapporteur has referred.
Finally I would like to look at what a number of Member States call 'baker's honey' , which is to be redefined, if the rapporteur has his way, as 'industrial honey' .
There is no such thing.
I would like to think this was an unwitting translation error but this derogatory phraseology is probably not accidental.
By just putting a noun with an adjective you cannot always make sense.
If I were to describe Mr Lannoye, whom I hold in esteem as an 'industrial Belgian' , it would be a meaningless phrase.
We should use a real description understood throughout the Community, not an invented one.
This is not a product only fit to grease the wheels of industry.
It is a product that people know and have confidence in and it is safe for consumers.
Mr President, Commissioner, as time is short I shall only refer to the directive on fruit juice.
The Commission' s proposal is sound and does not require amendment.
In particular, I welcome the double definition of juice from concentrate and fruit juice. It helps to keep the consumer better informed.
Consequently I cannot support Amendment No 39, deleting the Commission' s text. I do support Amendment No 30 dealing with the subject in greater depth and referring back to Annex 1.
Further, I totally reject Amendments Nos 18, 19, 23 and 25.
The first of these concerns a ban on the use of fungicides in treatments after gathering.
It has to be borne in mind that fruit gathered in Europe is in principle destined for the fresh fruit trade. The decision on which fruit will be sold fresh and which will be processed is only taken following selection by quantity and size.
Directive 97/41/EC has already set a maximum limit for residue in the case of fresh fruit, based on detailed studies to ensure consumer safety.
I believe this Directive applies equally to juice, fresh fruit, juice produced in the home, or packaged juice.
Treatment after gathering is required to guarantee optimum storage, transport and distribution conditions. I should like to reiterate what I said earlier.
A substance may not be harmful in itself, it depends on the amount used. Regarding the quality of the water added to concentrates, Directive 98/93/EC refers to the quality of water for human consumption, including water used by the food industry.
Finally, Amendment No 23 calls for a list of authorised substances to be drawn up.
It does not make sense to specify additional substances over and above those referred to in Directives 89/109/EEC and 90/128/EEC on materials and objects liable to come into contact with foodstuffs. This would restrict the juice industry' s capacity to adjust quickly to technological developments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, food and consumer protection have become vexatious topics.
They also involve a great deal of uncertainty.
This report should achieve greater clarity, and Mr Lannoye has evidently put a great deal of effort into it.
I believe, however, that too much exactitude and too many details can also be dangerous, and with this in mind I can only support what was said by Mrs Thyssen: here, and also in our work generally, we should distinguish more and more between political statements and technical considerations.
We are also overstretched in many respects, not through our average IQ being so low, but simply because the specialised technical knowledge cannot be present, because simply too much is presupposed and we then also have difficulty at some point in deciding what is lobbying and what is meaningful activity.
I also believe that we should be careful when deciding on the details of labels, so that we do not, through the sheer compulsion to regulate - as for example with fruit juices, where, however, we have now reached a compromise - end up leading the consumer astray with duplicated explanations and elucidations.
If we carry on that way, even wines will soon have to carry their chemical composition on the label, and then the marketing of wine will no doubt be far less straightforward.
I am glad to be able to thank all those who have contributed to reaching compromises - in the field of fruit juices, on the subjects of fungicides, water adulteration and the juice and concentrate issue, as well as on aromas - and hope that, in the problematic area of honey, it is impossible to conceal the product's origin.
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, when voting, to pay careful attention to this as well.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the directive on fruit juices, I would like to indicate our agreement with the Council' s proposal, which we think is going in the right direction, that is to say towards effective protection for consumers, who need to be provided with clear, easy to understand and objective information that will enable them to make a completely informed choice, both in terms of quality and in terms of food safety.
The higher production costs associated with the effort and the quality guarantee must, however, be clearly acknowledged in labelling.
There are currently, depending on whether they are free of concentrate or made from concentrate, two major categories of fruit juices, each of which correspond to the nature of specific products and a particular production process.
In terms of labelling, current practice does not enable consumers to clearly distinguish between these two categories.
In order to remove this source of confusion in the mind of consumers as to the actual nature of the product that they are buying, the Finnish Presidency has proposed introducing two simple, clear and objective definitions.
The term 'fruit juice' would be reserved for juices without concentrate, while, according to them, juices made from concentrate should be named for sale purposes in accordance with their characteristics.
Thus, consumers looking for a more authentic and more natural product will easily be able to find it on the shelf under the clear name 'fruit juice' , knowing that they are prepared to pay the price corresponding to the specific qualities associated with this product, while consumers inclined towards a more standardised and cheaper product will be able to turn with full knowledge of the facts towards a juice made from concentrate without any ambiguity about its nature and particular characteristics.
We, think, Mr President, that defining these two categories of juice, corresponding to two different names, represents real progress in consumer information, and that is why we support it.
Mr President, I too shall refer only to the directive on fruit juice, as time is short.
Along with previous speakers, we believe that the Council' s proposal represents definite progress because it establishes a clear distinction between fresh fruit juice and concentrated juice.
This is a welcome development as it provides consumers with full information on two products with different characteristics produced in very different ways.
We cannot therefore support any amendment aimed at blurring or doing away with the distinction established so clearly in the Council' s text.
Further, we cannot accept the amendments aimed at ending the use of fruit from the fresh market. This is what would result if we agreed to ban treatment after gathering.
The use of this fruit makes it possible to provide the consumer with a healthy product, manufactured to high standards of quality and food safety. It is also a way of utilising surplus agricultural production so that large quantities are not allowed to rot and pollute the environment.
Consequently, we shall support the Council' s proposal and vote in its favour.
In our view, the majority of the amendments tabled in committee do not serve to clarify or improve the situation. Instead, they cause further confusion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to thank the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and you in particular, Mr Lannoye, as rapporteur, for examining the drafts of the five so-called vertical directives communicated to you by the Council.
These directives relate to sugars intended for human consumption, to honey, to fruit juices and similar products intended for human consumption, to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption and to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut purÃ©e intended for human consumption.
The Commission welcomes the way that Parliament has kept to the guidelines given by the Council on comitology and has thereby agreed to replace the advisory committee procedure by the regulatory committee procedure.
As regards the amendments to the Council's five drafts, the Commission notes that Parliament had been heard as early as 1996 on the corresponding proposals by the Commission and had adopted positions on them in the sittings of 14 January 1998 and 4 May 1999.
Even though some of these amendments appear to me thoroughly sensible from the editorial or technical point of view, I regret however that I must point out that, as has been said, we are dealing here with Council drafts and not with original proposals by the Commission and that these amendments therefore apply to the Council drafts and not to the Commission's proposals.
I must therefore, unfortunately, observe that the Commission cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.49 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.)
Mr President, I have no wish to hold up the vote but this morning I raised an objection to the session minutes under Rule 148(3).
Rule 148(3) requires a decision by Parliament. No such decision has been taken.
I just wanted to know what happens to my objection now.
Secondly, I should like to point out that we decided yesterday to adopt the Commission proposal on which I reported.
We then adopted a legislative resolution rejecting the Commission proposal.
The services changed this in the Minutes to 'approves the Commission proposal' .
However, item 4 still contains a sentence which contradicts the first decision because it still says that the upper ceiling is to be maintained, which was something we rejected at the outset.
Because of this contradiction in the current draft minutes, I have asked that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs should be instructed to look into the matter with a view to making a general amendment to the Rules of Procedure clarifying what happens when this sort of contradiction arises.
I just wanted to point out that no decision has yet been taken on my objection to the minutes, as required under Article 148 (3).
I assume that the Minutes have not been approved on this point and will not therefore be approved until a later date.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Swoboda is making a mistake and I would ask you to consider it carefully.
Parliament did indeed make a slightly contradictory decision yesterday, I repeat a slightly contradictory decision.
We adopted the Commission proposal on the transit system by a clear majority of 303 votes to 253.
The proposal says that the previous upper ceiling is to be abolished.
Parliament approved this by a clear majority.
In my view, item 4 has been included because of a faux pas by a number of colleagues.
However, there is still no material contradiction here because we also call on the Commission in item 4 to maintain an upper ceiling until the ecopoint system expires.
In other words, we clearly decided in the legislative act to adopt the Commission proposal.
If the Council agrees, and I hope that it does, then all will be well.
The second call in item 4 is a call for the Commission to reflect.
What the Commission does in this case, whether it proposes a new upper ceiling or no upper ceiling, is up to the Commission.
We did not, as you will see if you read the second clause, call for the old upper ceiling; we said the Commission might like to consider setting a new, reasonable upper ceiling.
However, this faux pas was carried by a majority.
All that means, however, is that the Commission has been asked to reflect and submit an opinion to Parliament once it has done so.
Parliament's clear position was, is, and remains - and in this respect there is nothing to correct, Mr Swoboda - that we approved the Commission's position yesterday by a large majority and I should like to confirm as much.
Mr Swoboda, Mr Jarzembowski, it is my understanding that the longer you talk, the more you seem to be seeing eye to eye.
We will have this carefully examined and you will be informed of the outcome in due course.
VOTE
Ladies and gentlemen, having consulted the relevant services, I do not wish to state the Commission's definitive position at this moment in time.
The Commission reserves the right to re-examine this matter.
I now give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Cappato.
You can now do one of two things.
You can in any event inform Parliament of whether you endorse the proposal, in which case we will proceed to vote on the legislative resolution. Alternatively, the proposal can also be referred back to committee.
Mr Cappato, please let us know what you decide to do.
Mr President, in view of the outcome of the vote and the high number of abstentions, I think it would be prudent, not for the rapporteur but for the House, to remit this report to committee.
(The matter was referred back to the committee responsible)
Report (A5-0271/2001) by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the 24th time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (pentabromodiphenyl ether) [COM(2001) 12 - C5-0018/2001 - 2001/0018(COD)]
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0272/2001) by Mr NisticÃ², on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage, and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Council Directive 89/381/EEC [COM(2000) 816 - C5-0034/2001 - 2000/0323(COD)]
Mr President, as rapporteur I would like to ask you and the House to accept my proposal to vote on Amendment No 75 before Amendments Nos 55 and 56.
This is to make the sequence of amendments logical, given that Amendment No 75 can replace Amendments Nos 55 and 56.
There will also be an oral amendment, which I support, to Amendment No 75, presented by Mr Lisi and Mr Santini, and an Amendment No 43, presented by Mr Tannock and Mrs Korhola, which I also support.
Mr President, the question Mr NisticÃ² is raising here about changing the voting order has been discussed, I believe, in the course of the last 10 days with Mr NisticÃ², and we reached the conclusion evident from the voting list a long time ago.
I do not therefore understand at all why Mr NisticÃ² is raising the issue now.
Amendments Nos 55 and 56 should clearly be voted on before Amendment No 75, and there has been agreement about this for quite a long time.
However, it seems that Mr NisticÃ² still wants to try to raise doubts about the matter.
I do not understand why.
I can be quite clear about this, Mr NisticÃ².
We must apply the Rules of Procedure in this instance, too, and the order of voting, which was re-examined by the services before you spoke, is the correct order, and that order is ultimately to be decided on by the President.
I believe that we are thus following the correct order.
Mr President, I was asking the House to decide - because the House is sovereign - whether I can change a sequence I regard as illogical.
I therefore insist on putting my proposal to the vote to see who is in favour and who is against.
Mr NisticÃ², you said two things.
We will deal with the compromise amendment later.
You can present it later, and then the House can decide whether or not it accepts it.
The order of voting on amendments is ultimately a matter for the President to decide, however.
I call on my authority to maintain the order of voting, advised by the services.
That is the reasonable order.
Once again, we can vote on a possible oral amendment, should this prove appropriate, in a moment.
Mr President, Mr NisticÃ² said there was an oral amendment to Amendment No 43, which is one of the ones you are trying to take en bloc.
If the oral amendment pertains to Amendment No 43 which forms part of the bloc vote, then you can read it out, in which case we will deal with this matter now before we vote en bloc.
Is that right, Mr NisticÃ²?
Absolutely right.
Mr Tannock is presenting that amendment.
The oral amendment to Amendment No 43 can now be clarified.
Mr President, the oral amendment I proposed to Amendment No 43 by Mr Lund is to replace his second paragraph.
This is one that I have reached a compromise on with Mrs Korhola.
It states the following: "In the case of shortage of certain plasma products, and solely with regards to the importation into the EU from countries outside of the EU, the Member States may permit exemptions to the directive provided the quality and safety requirements laid down are met."
This is absolutely essential to safeguard the interests of European haemophiliacs who rely, occasionally, on imported Factor VIII plasma products which may contain some donated and some sold blood from the United States.
So this is absolutely essential, if we are not to put in jeopardy the lives of British and other haemophiliacs.
It has the support of myself and Mrs Korhola.
I understand Mr Lund will support it as well.
Following the vote on Amendments Nos 55 and 56. President.
As we are familiar with the procedure when oral amendments are tabled, I have to ask the House whether there are any objections.
Twelve Members or more can object to voting on this oral amendment.
I would ask if the amendment can be accepted.
I see more than twelve Members.
This oral amendment is therefore not put to the vote.
I suggest we address this in a practical manner and vote on Amendment No 43 in a moment.
We will now vote en bloc on all 60 committee amendments, except for Amendment No 43.
Mr President, I am sorry you could not give me the floor when I asked for it before the vote on Amendments Nos 55 and 56, precisely because the oral amendment was intended to allow the House to decide whether it could unite behind the compromise incorporated into my proposal before voting on Amendments Nos 55 and 56.
At this point, as the first part has fallen because unfortunately I was not given a chance to speak, it is absolutely pointless to take the oral amendment, which related to the first part.
I am sorry, because if we had accepted the reversal of the order, as the rapporteur proposed, I would have been able to present it.
I tried to do so before the House voted, I did not get the floor and this is the result.
Mr President, before we vote on this motion, I should like to point out that, if we vote in favour of this motion, we shall be in serious violation of European primary law, by which I mean the fundamental Treaties of the European Union.
It is unacceptable, in a democratically constructed Europe, for the Ombudsman to be given control over Members.
It is unacceptable for Members to be accountable, irrespective of how much one approves of and supports the office of the ombudsman.
(Applause)
Mr von Boetticher, we will not be debating the content of the amendments during the voting.
That was not the agreement.
You know yourself that the House is very aware of the content of the amendments.
Mr Duff, you are not allowed to make any comments regarding the content.
We will not be holding a constitutional debate.
You can make a very brief comment, if you so wish, on a point of order, but not on the content.
Mr President, should I be unable to speak about the content, I would only say that the previous remark from the PPE side of the House is complete baloney.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is high time we voted.
Mr President, I did not want to interrupt the vote earlier but I should like to refer back to the NisticÃ² report.
Dr Tannock drew to our attention the question of concern about the supply of blood and plasma products for haemophiliacs if the source of supply is outside the Union.
I am not well-informed on the facts of the matter but my impression was that his intervention was based on verifiable facts rather than simply issues of political preference.
When we deal with legislation which intimately affects human health we must exercise great care and attention.
I ask you, Mr President, to ask the services to prepare a note on the facts of this matter so we can bring it to the attention of our colleagues in the groups.
I fear we may have voted in error.
Mr Cox, I shall naturally ask the services to examine everything very carefully.
That goes without saying, and certainly upon your express wishes.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Cappato Report (A5-0270)/2001)
Mr President, I close my eyes and what do I see?
I am in Venice, the most beautiful city in the world! There is the moon, there are the gondolas, we are on the Grand Canal, Italian cooking, spaghetti with sepia, Dom PÃ©rignon French champagne and a blonde beauty who takes me back to my youth.
However, because of lack of secrecy on personal data and lack of protection of privacy, when I get home I find my suitcases outside the door: my wife found out!
That is why I have voted in favour, Mr President.
But was it a dream I was talking about or was it reality?
- (NL) Many people in the Netherlands have self-adhesive labels on their letter boxes against commercial printed matter.
It has increasingly become the norm that ignoring this sign is rude and even unlawful.
Such a regulation has meanwhile become known as an opt-out, whereby the recipients themselves must make it known that they do not wish to receive such mail.
An opt-in, which requires an instruction that one does wish to receive commercial mail, would be preferable still.
In the case of electronic communication, there is even more reason for having such an opt-in, for it would prevent consumers from being harassed by unwanted communications they receive and need to delete, and for which they also have to pay.
Moreover, the e-mail system is also being weighed down by this deluge of advertising and is thus becoming unusable for reliable communications.
The Commission is right to propose such an opt-in in Article 13.
I am rather shocked by the view of the rapporteur, who appears to choose an opt-out which will only free consumers from the inconvenience after they have expressly lodged their protests.
Furthermore, people have already had bad experiences with pledges from organisations which make their money through direct marketing.
The protection of privacy, which the Directive is right to have as its objective, is seriously threatened by Mr Cappato' s view.
Mr President, I would like to make explanations of vote on two reports combined: on the Cappato and CederschiÃ¶ld reports.
I voted against both these reports.
There is a great danger, first of all, in relation to the blanket retention of information on users.
It raises serious questions about civil liberties.
With cybercrime we have the situation where new forms of crime are being created.
The lack of attention to civil liberties, the lack of attention to people's basic right to privacy is being overlooked.
There is a great danger here that in future we will have a society where people are afraid to communicate and use modern technology because they know that their communications will be intercepted, listened to, and be in the hands of people who have no right to them.
Before we start looking at bringing in legislation in these areas we should first of all ensure that people's basic rights and civil liberties are protected.
Both are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the EU Treaties.
The emphasis here is to use scare-tactic arguments such as the issue of paedophilia, terrorism, drugs or arms trafficking.
These are issues which are very emotive.
People are very willing to allow legislation to be put in place and oppressive measures to be brought in because they are concerned about these issues.
The fact that I voted against does not mean to say that I am not concerned about these issues.
But first and foremost we must protect people's basic civil liberties as enshrined in international law.
We should not overlook that.
What kind of a society will we have if people's basic rights are overlooked in the combating of other crimes?
There are a lot of similarities between the two.
We have to remember that.
NisticÃ² Report (A5-0272/2001)
. (PT) There are controversial aspects to this report as there are, in fact, to the Commission' s own proposal.
As the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market said, it would perhaps be preferable for the two directives, that is, the current proposal on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and the directive on universal service, to merge.
Furthermore, the Commission proposal to give employers the right to monitor their employees is a complicated and very sensitive issue.
Equally, the bulk sending of unsolicited e-mails (so-called spamming), is another cause for concern, for which a satisfactory solution should be found.
This is why we should devote our full attention to the position of DECO, which endorses the Commission proposal, which in turn seeks to make prior optÂ­in consent compulsory for unsolicited emails, since this appears to be the best guarantee for European consumers' choice as to whether they receive spam mail or not. This option thereby attempts to protect consumers from being bombarded with unsolicited electronic mails in the form of advertising, except when they have given their consent to receive such mail.
. I voted for 'Opt Out'.
The opposite, an 'Opt-In' regime for Europe, would be entirely ineffective.
If the EU legislates to try to restrict the sending of emails, whether for marketing, or fundraising, or political messages, the emails will still be sent to receivers within the EU - but from outside the EU.
Indeed, I am tempted by the thought of setting up a little business in somewhere sunny like a Carribean island from where I would spray unlimited emails into the EU from EU businesses in return for a nice fat fee.
This business could not exist in the EU.
The well-meaning EU, if it chooses 'Opt In', will do two harmful things : it will handicap EU-based businesses against their worldwide competitors, and it will transfer jobs outside the EU.
The road to hell, they say, is paved with good intentions.
'Spam' needs to be controlled - but it can only be controlled by global legislation and cooperation.
I choose to vote against the position adopted by my political group when it comes to the rules about sending out unsolicited advertisements to consumers via e-mail.
E-mail advertisements are, in general, an inconvenience for the consumer since it takes time, for example, to open and delete them.
They also contribute to the spread of viruses on the Internet.
What is more, it is the consumer who has to bear the costs of receiving and reading the advertisements.
In the light of this, I consider that only an opt-in solution can effectively protect consumers from unsolicited advertisements.
My position on this issue has influenced my vote in the final vote on this report.
Ries Report (A5-0271/2001)
SchÃ¶rling (Verts/ALE), in writing.
(SV) High brominated flame retardants are to be found high up in the food chain.
This is being seen for the first time now that a Swedish environmental study has shown that high brominated flame retardants, which were considered to be less dangerous than low brominated flame retardants, are also bioaccumulative, having been found in peregrine falcon eggs in Sweden.
The study shows that the content of brominated flame retardants in eggs from wild peregrine falcons is 400 times higher than that in eggs from falcons kept in cages.
We know that low brominated flame retardants are bioaccumulative now that they have been found in birds, fish and mammals, but it was previously believed that high brominated flame retardants were not especially dangerous.
High brominated flame retardants were thought to have larger molecules and thus to find it more difficult to penetrate the cell membranes of living organisms.
This has now proved not to be the case.
This is a major health and environmental problem because many users replaced the high brominated flame retardants in products with low brominated ones, and the use of low brominated flame retardants such as decaBDEs accounts for 80 per cent of all flame retardants.
The Group of the Greens therefore voted in favour of an immediate ban on the whole group of penta-, octa- and decaBDEs.
This is required by the precautionary principle, given the new discoveries that have been made.
A majority of Parliament chose to await the risk assessment that is at present under way in the case of decaBDEs.
This means that tons of dangerous high-risk chemicals continue to be released into the environment, something which in our view is contrary to the intentions of the precautionary principle.
Mr President, the Pensioners Party is totally in favour of regulating blood donation and the movement of blood.
Pensioners are very active in blood donor associations throughout Europe.
This excellent, spot-on, comprehensive report by my friend Mr NisticÃ² is therefore very welcome, and I have voted for it.
There is a saying in Italy, Mr President, that laughing makes for good blood, and we want the blood which is moving around the States to be good.
I therefore think it is a good thing that I sometimes go on with these explanations of vote to make people smile, because that makes for good blood and helps achieve the purpose of this directive.
The European Parliament has repeatedly turned its attention to the problem of testing blood for transfusions and blood donors and has passed a plethora of resolutions since 1993.
And there is still serious public concern as the result of criminal irresponsibility on the part of the relevant authorities in various countries of the European Union.
The aim of the Commission proposal to amend Directive 89/381/ÃEC is to improve both quality and safety in standards for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of blood and its various components.
More importantly, Member States can impose even stricter standards and blood moved between the 15 is not governed by the rules of the internal market.
I shall be voting for the NisticÃ² report because it is in favour of strict standards, it is against the commercialisation of human blood and because, for reasons of greater safety, it calls for security of supply via networks of volunteers in order to reverse the dependence of the European Union on non-Community suppliers.
.
(FR) We voted in favour of this text as it was following the modifications proposed by the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
And we voted against all the amendments that could endanger or restrict the giving of blood on a voluntary and non profit-making basis.
We only regret that the report does not envisage a formal obligation for companies to grant their employees the necessary time in order to give blood and to remove the bureaucratic authorisation procedures that discourage those with good intentions.
We are opposed to the whole economic system that is driven by profit.
Profit made directly or indirectly from trade in human organs, cells or tissues, is one of the most despicable manifestations of this system, an expression of the fact that society has not come out of barbarism.
.
(FR) The European directive on quality and safety standards for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of blood should be modified in order to increase protection of donors and recipients.
The safety of recipients should be further guaranteed, both through the traceability of the whole transfusion network and by guaranteeing highly qualified staff in all blood transfusion establishments in Europe.
Greater safety increases confidence in the supply system, which, as a result, encourages donors to give blood.
This directive, however, should also highlight principles.
Blood is not a commodity.
Moreover, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights states that it is forbidden to use the human body for profit.
This is why we need to clearly affirm the principle that the service should be free.
By donating blood, citizens are making an act of solidarity.
This means, as the European socialists have maintained, that blood components should only be taken from voluntary donors.
I cannot but vote in favour of the report by Giuseppe NisticÃ². This is because for a long time all sorts of people from all walks of life have been warning of the need for Community standards to establish definite rules in this sensitive sector of the collection, processing, storage and distribution of blood and its derivatives.
This is a sector where the extreme urgency of meeting great therapeutic needs must never be separated from considerations of control and prevention.
Mr NisticÃ² has set out the arguments extremely well, drawing on the strength of his professional expertise. Those are the reasons, in short, that lead me to support the report in full and consequently to vote for it.
.
I, like many of my colleagues, have heard from blood donation organisations concerned by the possible modifications to existing legislation in this field.
Everyone agrees in deploring, quite rightly, the shortage of blood and plasma within the European Union while stressing the fact that under no circumstances should we relax our vigilance regarding the quality of these products, so much so that the European Union' s requirements are half covered by imports!
This directive, amended by Parliament, modifies, integrates and completes the legislation that currently governs quality and safety standards in Europe for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components.
It is about adopting stricter requirements regarding the admissibility of donors and practical screening of them, as well as putting in place a quality system at Community level in blood transfusion establishments.
This would all be completed by an equivalent testing and approval system in the Member States.
Finally, common standards would be defined for staff training and for the traceability of blood from donor to patient.
Of course, these measures will not prevent the Member States from maintaining or establishing stricter protection measures.
It is also desirable to reduce the European Union' s dependence on imports of blood or blood components from third countries.
In order to do that, information campaigns need to be aimed at potential donors.
But under no circumstances should we envisage a system of payment for these products.
The European Parliament report rightly stresses the importance of the voluntary nature of blood donation while accepting that the social contribution made by donors and the commendable nature of the donations that they make should be highlighted.
As a blood donor myself and a supporter of the cause of blood donation, I therefore voted in favour of this report.
I have been involved in the issue of blood donation for many years in the Italian Parliament, including setting up a parliamentary group belonging to AVIS, the principle Italian donor organisation.
Over the years the task has involved the passing of and subsequent amendments to what is known as the 'Law on blood' .
I formed the opinion then that increased European harmonisation of the sector' s rules is vital, not just because of European citizenship which compels us to take the same attitude in dealing with problems of human health in Europe, but also because common rules are indispensable when faced with serious illnesses - AIDS, BSE - and a worldwide market in blood which must also take account of scientific progress (artificial blood, human blood produced from stem cells)
Our amendments to the directive satisfy those, like me, who have always fought to strengthen public policy in favour of non-remunerated voluntary donation.
It might perhaps have been possible to do a little more, providing funds to promote initiatives in support of voluntary blood donation, but we are still taking a good step forward.
. (PT) It is important to state once again, as this report does, that the human body or its parts cannot be traded as commodities, and this includes human blood, of course, irrespective of the state it is in.
Various donor organisations, including the Portuguese Association for the Protection of Blood Users and the International Federation of Blood Donors support this position, including the various positive aspects of the report which signify progress on providing incentives to volunteer blood in the various Member States of the European Union.
A high number of donors is crucial to enabling each Member State to be self-sufficient, although the principle of solidarity must also apply between Member States, whenever necessary and whenever possible.
As stated in the report, if we want donors to give blood for free, which should be the case, the blood supply system cannot be commercial.
The processing of blood at all stages must be a service carried out for the Member States' health services for the benefit of patients.
All proposals that improve on the current Directive 89/381 are also positive, specifically in the areas of the levels of quality and safety in the various phases of collection, processing, storage and distribution of blood.
