Humanitarian considerations should undoubtedly play a part, but the whole thing must still be manageable and controllable.
Above all, we must ensure that this European directive does not land the individual Member States in a situation which they are no longer able to control.
Naturally, where Member States already have more generous provisions, they should be able to retain them.
My main objective in drafting this statement was to warn against carrying matters to excess, and the unforeseeable consequences thereof, but without wishing to compromise the principle of family unity.
Nothing could be further from the truth!
The report mainly concerns two different groups : refugees and citizens of third countries, and their right to be reunited with their families in EU countries.
As Swedish Christian Democrats, we believe that these groups ought to be dealt with separately.
The right of refugees to be reunited with their families ought to be dealt with in the same way, but in a separate directive.
The family is our society' s most important building block, and we must therefore stand up for the right to a family life.
Above all, children' s right to be reunited with their parents must be protected, but the right to family reunification ought in certain cases (for example, when there are serious health reasons) to apply also to relatives in the ascending line, as well as to children who have come of age.
It is also only right that, following death or divorce for example, relatives should have an automatic right of residence in the host country, just as they should be given the right to work and receive an education in that country.
With these reservations and qualifications, we support the report.
- (DE) Despite the fact that it confines itself to refugees under the Geneva Convention, I intend to vote in favour of this report.
The Commission proposal will do nothing to advance the cause of the vast majority of homosexuals or refugees granted temporary or subsidiary protection.
However, particularly from a German perspective, it represents an improvement in the situation of those refugees who are in a position to facilitate the legal entry of others, under the 'family members' heading.
And that is not the only reason I will be voting in favour. Despite the fact that we Germans now hoist the flag against the extreme right almost on a daily basis, it is the German Minister of the Interior, Mr Schily, of all people, who has spoken out against this immigration-friendly legislation.
He is afraid that millions of immigrants will come to Germany if the directive comes into force.
In saying these things, he is playing into the hands of those who aim to drive these 'millions' of people out of Germany - dead or alive - using violent methods.
As a result, not only will our commitment to fighting the extreme right become a mask of hypocrisy; it will be turned on its head.
Madam President, could we not do as we used to, which was to name all those who wished to submit their explanations of vote in writing so that we could leave.
This is an unacceptable situation.
We are forced to hang around for half an hour after the votes to say that we are submitting our explanation of vote in writing.
We used to have a different system, which was better organised.
There is no need to get angry, Mrs Lulling.
As you know, it is extremely difficult to shout at the top of one' s voice to read out the names of Members who wish to submit an explanation of vote in writing.
Our staff check if the Members are indeed present and we note all written requests without having to read them out.
A check is made that the Member is in fact in the Chamber at the beginning of the explanations of vote and I therefore only call out the oral explanations.
You are therefore free to go.
I have been sitting here for almost half an hour waiting for my name to be called because I was informed by the services that I had to be present in order for my explanation of vote to be taken as written.
I do not understand the problem.
Why is it that our services cannot give us simple and straightforward information?
I indicated that I wanted to make my explanation of vote in writing and I was told that I would have to be here for the vote in the first instance and that I would have to wait until I was called to indicate that I wanted to make it in writing.
Why have I had to waste half an hour here?
Mr de Rossa, I have been told that this was a misunderstanding.
You were told that you had to be present for the vote.
I thought that this had always been the procedure, not that you had to wait for all the explanations of vote.
Madam President, I was told quite explicitly that I had to be present to indicate that I wanted to make a written explanation of vote.
When I was not here on a previous occasion I was rapped over the knuckles for not being here.
We cannot continue this discussion any further, but I promise you that we shall clear this up in the Bureau, first of all so that every President of the sitting applies the same rules for the explanations of votes.
I personally feel that the best approach is to check that Members are present for the vote so that they can leave if they are submitting their explanation in writing, and so that the explanations of vote in writing by Members who have not taken part in the vote are not counted.
I think that this is a good system, but first I would like to look into the matter with the other Vice-Presidents who, as I do, preside over the votes.
Thank you for your understanding.
Creating a monitoring centre for industrial change
.
(FR) I wish to express my support for establishing a new task, entrusted to a European Union agency, with a view to studying and more particularly to anticipating industrial change.
This would send out a powerful political message, demonstrating the will to react to these changes, which are caused by various upheavals, resulting particularly from economic and financial changes, the development of new technologies, international competition and the globalisation of trade.
It was at the Luxembourg Summit in November 1997 that we realised the importance of looking more closely into these phenomena so as to avoid suffering them again and to counter their negative consequences.
This idea led to a meeting of a group of experts, better known as the Gyllenhammar group, which was given the task of studying the economic and social implications of industrial change.
The conclusions reached by this group persuaded the Cardiff European Council in December 1998 to accept the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change. We are finally debating this proposal today, and I hope it will be put into practice in the very near future!
Over the last few years we have seen a huge increase in the number of relocations, restructurings and mergers, which has greatly changed the face of European industry and which has had serious repercussions for employment and for economic and social cohesion.
Member States that are ill-prepared for these changes have experienced them too many times and have tried to pick up the pieces, as best they can, under the sometimes disapproving eye of the European Commission, which has not hesitated to condemn more than one Member State for some misdemeanour involving state aid!
The first victims of these unforeseen changes are, of course, the employees, who, in spite of increased growth and an improvement in the overall economic situation, still live in a climate of insecurity.
Indeed we have recently seen companies making redundancies even when they are making profit, because they have to restructure and merge, with no thought, of course, of fulfilling their obligations to inform their employees and to communicate with them!
I take this opportunity to appeal to the Council, which is blocking the proposal for a directive on informing and consulting workers!
To sum up, this monitoring centre must be used as an instrument for anticipating industrial change.
We will then be able to adopt the measures necessary to prepare employees better, particularly by offering them training with the aim of adapting them to the business sectors of the future!
I support the proposal contained in the resolution which seeks to include the right to lifelong training in the Charter of Fundamental Rights!
The centre' s studies will, of course, be widely distributed.
I deplore the decision of the EPP, ELDR and the UEN to vote against the PES resolution to set up a European Monitoring Centre for Industrial Change.
Such a centre would serve to create a more proactive approach to medium and longer-term industrial change which would benefit all those concerned - Commission, European Parliament, social partners, government and local authorities.
Such a centre could be incorporated into an established body or foundation through the enlargement of existing competences, as proposed in the PSE resolution.
That some Irish members should vote against such a proposal is incomprehensible given that the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions in Dublin would be in line to carry out such work.
The huge industrial changes of recent years that have resulted from the increase in globalisation, new technologies and social transformations have given rise not only to economic growth and new production sectors but also to a growing number of company mergers, closures and relocations, which have resulted in the loss of local markets, unemployment, the degradation of social and labour protection systems, greater social exclusion and enormous human suffering.
It is, therefore, extremely important that a European Monitoring Centre for Industrial Change should be set up with the aim of stimulating a more active and responsible approach to industrial development, with the participation of both sides of industry, with a view to helping to avoid the most irksome consequences of industrial change.
It is equally urgent, however, that the Commission should hasten the review of Directive 94/45/EC on the setting up of a European Works Council and Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89, so as to ensure greater participation by workers' organisations prior to decisions on the concentration and transfer of undertakings and a greater guarantee of protection and defence of workers' rights.
EU external action priorities
We will be voting against the joint resolution on EU external action priorities because we believe that it promotes even further removing from Member States any possibility of implementing their own foreign and defence policies and incorporating these policies into the common foreign and security policy that has taken shape.
And this, by means of a European Parliament resolution! The common foreign and security policy has already left its mark in the shape of political and military interference in the domestic affairs of third countries in order to further the imperialist interests of the European Union, contrary to every interpretation of international law and to the interests of the citizens of the European Union and other countries.
This happened just recently, in the case of Kosovo, and Yugoslavia more generally.
The militarisation of the European Union, the arms race, the harmonisation of military weapons and the war industry, the imposition of the will of the mighty in the jungle of 'globalisation' and the free market, are diametrically opposed to the visions and struggles of the people for peace, a political and peaceful solution to conflicts and the rule of international law.
It is clear that this policy goes hand in hand with the recent decisions taken by the Council to prohibit all access to documents concerning defence and security policies.
The general orientation of these decisions is to keep citizens of the Member States of the European Union from the centres of decision-making and to prevent them from interfering with developments. Barriers and hurdles are being placed in the way of the popular movement, national parliaments and the European Parliament alike, so as to prevent them from exercising any form of democratic control.
What particularly worries me is the fact that, through fundamentally violating its own treaties, the European Union is attempting to by-pass its own internal rivalries by indirect means.
It is seeking to support the interests of European big business, to conquer new markets, and to support the euro, even by taking military action.
The New Order is placing new demands on people and on the less developed countries in order consolidate its supremacy.
In practice, a policy is being promoted which faithfully serves big business, sides with the USA, submitting to its orders, and promotes the New Order against the interests of the people.
This makes it easier to understand why the European Union is not troubled by the barbaric invasion and continued occupation of 38% of Cyprus and by Turkey' s bombing raids in Iraq.
The issue for me is not only whether and how the joint actions will be funded by the community budget, but to stop this policy, which is disastrous for people and peace alike.
The issue is not whether Mr Solana or other representatives of the CFSP will make annual announcements to the European Parliament, but for the people of Europe to take their fate into their own hands and to intervene effectively to impose peace, brotherhood and international cooperation based on the common good.
The joint resolution restricts itself to the two issues I have mentioned, which are of secondary importance, and comes to the arbitrary, and especially dangerous, conclusion that the 'intergovernmental system' which is at the root of the EU' s foreign policy, is the reason for the failure of the common foreign and security policy and that its success depends on its communitisation.
This disorients people and makes them prey to the unaccountable dictates of big business.
For all the above reasons, we believe that the 'joint' resolution in question demonstrates most dramatically how urgent it is for people to organise joint resistance and their opposition to this criminal policy, and to take the initiative and act.
Veltroni report (A5-209/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the Veltroni report also and above all because, as representative of the Pensioners' Party to the European Parliament, I am aware that pensioners and elderly people spend a lot of time watching television.
However, I would have liked this report to include a recommendation for the establishment, at last, of a European television programme.
The citizens of Europe have the right to see that Europe exists, and we have the means to show them - easily - through European television programmes.
Moreover, it would be appropriate to regulate the television companies of the States of the European Union in order to allow all the political bodies in the different States freedom of expression, for this is not always the case at the moment.
Madam President, I voted against the motion because this policy still contains worrying elements of statalism and welfarism.
There is no genuine opening for competition and, most importantly, provision is continuing to be made to subsidise the cinema industry without taking into account what it produces.
Thus, we will continue to give money to directors who produce appalling quality films which nobody wants to see but who nonetheless receive payment even from those who refuse even to watch the trailers.
The Veltroni report on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport is certainly an improvement on the Commission communication on the 'principles and guidelines for the Community' s audiovisual policy in the digital age' .
The important aspects of the intervention of the European Union are:
1) The global competitiveness of European industry, especially in relation to the USA, must be combined with a guarantee of pluralism and cultural diversity.
2) The increased effectiveness of the measures contained in Directive 89/552/ÃEC on 'Television without Frontiers' , concerning the promotion of European works.
3) The promotion of linguistic diversity.
4) The protection of minors using new programme control methods.
5) The creation of a European forum on cooperation in matters of transparency and the development of strategies to address market concentrations.
6) The support of the public audiovisual sector with the option of broadcasting on a global scale.
7) The promotion of an internal market for the cinema with the issue of a new directive.
I shall be voting for the Veltroni report, as it is a considerable improvement on the Communication from the Commission. But I do have two reservations.
The first has to do with the notion of rivalry, which may justify major concentrations and groupings of audiovisual media in the name of becoming stronger than the Americans, and may extend the Berlusconi phenomenon. The second concerns the lack of compliance and control mechanisms to ensure that the political aims of the European Parliament do not once again remain mere wishes, which is often the case with the successive amendments to the 'Television without Frontiers' Directive.
I am extremely pleased with this report on the Commission communication, which seeks to lay down the principles and guidelines of Community audiovisual policy, in order to adapt it to the digital age.
Such adaptation is actually crucial, given recent developments in digital technology.
We will only achieve this if we respect the principles governing this field, which are:
the protection of pluralism:
to achieve this task, I once again stress the fact that, as provided for in the protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, public service broadcasting plays a central part in safeguarding pluralism as well as cultural and linguistic diversity.
the possibility of targeting intervention to provide strategic support for services of general interest:
the public must be guaranteed access to audiovisual services on the basis of criteria such as universality, affordable costs and non-discrimination.
the maximum protection for those producing audiovisual works, and hence the possibility of providing better protection for intellectual ownership rights, copyright and related ownership rights:
the effectiveness of copyright protection is jeopardised in the digital age.
Respect for intellectual property is nevertheless a source of vitality in the audiovisual and cinematographic sector and the proposal for a directive on copyright and associated rights in the information society must therefore be speedily adopted, both to protect created works and to ensure that they are accessible and can circulate freely.
the increased protection for users, who will be covered by various safeguards depending on the different services that they use:
I approve of the idea of stepping up experiments with programme filtering systems and other methods of parental control for the protection of minors.
To conclude, I wish to stress that a revision of Directive (89/552/EEC) on 'Television without Frontier' is crucial.
We must strengthen the provisions on the circulation of European works and on independent production in order to make them more effective.
The obligation of public and private television broadcasters to allocate a proportion of their annual net income to investment in production and to the acquisition of European audiovisual programmes, including films, works aimed at minorities and ones made by independent producers, must be included in this piece of legislation.
Heaton-Harris report (A5-0199/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the Heaton-Harris report, which deals with the movement of university students within the European Union.
However, a survey has been carried out which highlights a factor which I consider to be extremely negative: precisely half the university students who had the right to benefit from the ERASMUS programme did not take up the offer.
This means that there is definitely something which is not working properly!
I would in any case like to stress that, in voting for the motion, I would also like to express the desire for a programme soon to be established in Europe, not just for the movement of young students between universities but also for the movement of elderly people who study at the university of the third age, who would welcome the opportunity to take part in exchanges with their sexagenarian, septuagenarian and octogenarian or even older peers from other States of the European Union.
We are delighted that this report, to which we contributed several amendments, has been adopted.
We now hope that the Commission and the Member States will take the necessary steps to make the Erasmus programme more accessible to students from economically less well-off groups, particularly by optimising coordination between national financial support for higher education and Erasmus grants, with a view to promoting social equality in access to the programme and the widest possible take-up.
We cannot continue to accept that the overall participation rate in the programme is barely above 50%, and that even so, some 57% of Erasmus students have been affected by worrying financial problems.
As the report points out, it is regrettable that the Erasmus programme has essentially benefited students from social groups whose parents have a high level of qualifications, are relatively well-off, and/or come from countries with higher levels of government support for students.
Hence the need for measures to help achieve its initial objective of enabling 10% of all Community students to spend part of their degree course in another Member State, and not just 1% as happened in 1997/1998, making it accessible to students from economically less well-off groups.
Boumediene-Thiery report (A5-0207/2000)
Madam President, 'in cauda venenum' as the Romans used to say: 'the sting is in the tail'. I voted against this report, and I was right to do so.
An amendment was rejected which I had tabled, which called for disabled people, the blind and partially sighted, the hearing-impaired, seriously ill people and the very elderly, who as such receive benefits and pensions from the Member States, not to be treated according to current European Union regulations which stipulate that if they go to a Union State which is not their country of residence then they cannot receive their pension.
In practice, a disabled person cannot travel within the European Union - from Italy to the United Kingdom, from France to Germany etc. because, if he moves and changes his country of residence, he will no longer be entitled to the benefits on which he depends to live.
When will we put an end to this injustice?
It is our view that all immigrant workers living and working in any European Union country must have the same rights and freedoms, particularly the freedom of movement, as European Union nationals.
Despite the report' s limitations in this respect and although we do not agree with the entire text, we did vote for the report because the measures it recommends represent progress in relation to the current deplorable situation of immigrant workers and migrant workers who are European Union nationals.
I would add that the extreme right' s fiercely racist opposition to this report confirms our views in this direction.
Since 1957, the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community has contained provisions designed to guarantee the free movement of workers within Community territory.
Various Community instruments have enabled this right to become a reality.
In 1990, two directives (90/364/EEC and 90/365/EEC) have extended the right of residence by defining general principles and rules for workers who have stopped work.
A third directive (93/96/EC), adopted in 1993, contains specific provisions for students.
Since 1993 and the Treaty of Maastricht, any Member State national has the right to move and reside freely in the European Union (Article 14 of the EC Treaty), and this right forms part of European citizenship (Article 18).
The report we are discussing today seeks to provide an overview of the implementation of the directives on the right of residence of students, pensioners and other non-economically-active members of society as well as to study the special measures concerning European Union citizens' moving and settling for reasons of public order, security and health (Directive 64/221/EEC).
With regard to the first section, we must admit that although the directives in question have been transposed, in some cases painstakingly, into national legislation, many obstacles remain, which must be overcome by adopting a raft of specifically-targeted measures.
To mention one problem with which I am very familiar, that of students, I think it is crucial that we provide them with better information on their rights if they wish to study in another Member State.
We also need to solve the problem of the recognition of diplomas, which is proving to be a significant issue in certain professions.
With regard to the second section, there are many problems in the way Directive 64/221/EEC has been implemented.
The Treaty allows Member States to impose limits on the free movement of persons for reasons of public order, public security or public health.
The Commission is aware, however, that Member States are interpreting these concepts in a totally different way, often too broadly, and it stresses that they must be applied in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
The Commission also stresses that these concepts must only be applied in the face of a genuine and sufficiently serious threat, which would affect a society' s fundamental wellbeing.
In any event, these concepts must comply with the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
It appears that, in order to resolve these difficulties, we will need to adopt a framework directive to organise and guarantee the unimpeded exercise of freedom of movement and residence.
An overall redrafting of the existing texts will make this possible and will have the advantage of putting an end to the current inequalities of treatment in the various Member States.
Only when these conditions are met will we enable nationals of Member States to gain awareness and to give substance to this concept of European citizenship, which for many is still nothing but a hollow shell.
The approval of the report that the rapporteur has presented to Parliament is heartening, but I cannot say the same for most of the proposals for amendments that have been raised in the House.
The principle of the free movement of persons, included in the Treaty of Rome fifty years ago, still encounters many difficulties in its practical implementation.
As mentioned in the report, the implementation of the directives on the right of residence of students and retired people (90/364, 90/365 and 93/96) is clearly unsatisfactory, and the same is true for the directive on migrant workers.
Workers in 'atypical' employment - part-time, short-term, etc. face residence problems in the host country.
In addition, as the rapporteur points out, there are at present millions of third-country nationals residing lawfully in the European Union who often find themselves deprived of the right to free movement and residence.
Hence it is essential that the Member States and the Commission take the necessary steps to ensure that the rights of migrant workers are upheld and to improve their situation.
With regard to students and retired people too, it is essential to speed up the bureaucratic process and to facilitate the free movement and residence of these citizens of the European Union in any Member State.
I have no objection to our attempting to resolve the outstanding problems associated with the right of residence of EU citizens, who are, after all, at liberty to move freely throughout European Union territory and reside wherever they choose, particularly when they are pensioners or students.
However, I am unable to support this report in principle, because it takes advantage of the situation, with a view to demanding freedom of movement and establishment for all third-country nationals who have the right of residence in a Member State.
There are millions of third-country nationals who fit this description, and it is completely unacceptable to saddle other Member States with the consequences of giving freedom of movement to millions of people, without taking the individual Member States' absorption capacity into account.
Many people have doubts about admitting Malta to the European Union.
If the demands made in the Boumediene-Thiery report in respect of freedom of movement for third-country nationals were to be met, this would have a far more serious impact than if we were to grant the citizens of the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe freedom of movement and establishment, without a transitional period, which is something no one in their right mind would consider.
If we really want to fan the flames of xenophobia within the Community, then I can think of no better way than to support the excessive and unreasonable proposals contained in the Boumediene-Thiery report, which thank God, was adopted in committee by only 23 votes in favour to 15 votes against.
It is asking too much of the other Member States as it is, for the German Government to allow several million third-country nationals resident on its territory to hold German citizenship in addition to their own.
In so doing, with a single stroke of the pen, it creates several million new EU citizens entitled to freedom of movement and freedom of establishment, and in fact they even have the right to vote at local and European elections. Yet at the same time, your colleague Mr Verheugen, is calling for a referendum on eastwards enlargement.
What about our right to a referendum against Germany' s being able to decide completely independently, and without reference to the other Member States, to present us with several million more EU citizens?
We cannot cope with the consequences of such generosity, as well intentioned as it may be, because it will be open to exploitation, particularly by gangs of human traffickers.
I say 'yes' to a rational immigration policy that we can sustain, but 'no' to the chaos that the Boumediene-Thiery report would inevitably cause.
The catalogue of problems and obstacles associated with the rights of European citizens who move about within the European Union or reside in a Member State other than the state in which they were born, as well as third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State of the European Union, is so enormous that, for many people, the much vaunted right of 'free movement' is either non-existent or is a continuous and never-ending hurdle race.
Students, retired people, certain categories of workers, especially those in 'atypical' forms of employment, and in part-time employment, are called upon to confront a whole host of difficulties and problems concerning residence in the host country. This is due to the sheer volume of formalities for the issue and renewal of residence permits and other difficulties associated with providing evidence of sufficient means.
In reality, not only does the notorious 'European area of freedom' not exist; it is so inextricably bound up with financial criteria that the right of residence, while recognised as an 'inalienable' right, is only granted to those who are financially independent.
In other words, we are dealing not only with the complete distortion of concepts but also with the utter derision of hundreds of thousands of European citizens and their families.
What is more, if we add to this the unacceptable phenomenon of the abusive interpretation of the concepts of public order and security, not only is the free movement and residence of people simply undermined and contravened in many cases, but it also becomes the springboard for the violation of fundamental and individual rights such as the right to the protection of personal information.
On the pretext of public order, the Schengen Information System stores, transmits and processes personal details in violation of the Treaties, Community law and international law.
We would also like to highlight the numerous cases of expulsion for economic reasons or for reasons of general prevention. In none of these cases is there anything to warrant regarding these people as belonging to sufficiently serious categories to justify their violent deportation.
For reasons of the fundamental protection of human rights and of the dignity of European citizens and third-country nationals legally residing in the European Union, it is essential that residence procedures are simplified in such a way that the unimpeded exercising of this right can be organised and secured and that inequalities and violations of basic democratic principles can be removed.
Member States must simplify and relax as far as possible the necessary procedures and formalities for students and retired people regarding the issues of adequate means and the granting and renewal of residence permits.
The granting and renewal of residence permits must be simplified for migrant workers, and social security and medical care systems must be simplified so as to put an end to the discrimination suffered by these workers.
Family reunification must also be made easier by simplifying the residence conditions for family members, and by simplifying the system for granting and issuing residence permits, if the applicant meets the necessary conditions, for at least 5 years.
Finally, an end must be put to the abusive appeal to public order, which turns European citizens into 'usual suspects' for reasons other than public security, in blatant violation of the rule of law, the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, in the approval of the Minutes it says that I said I had been deliberated misquoted.
I did not state that.
It was just a possibility, not a statement.
That is important.
I would not say that the transcription was deliberately badly done in any case - that was only a possibility.
In the Minutes it sounds as though I am making an accusation.
I would not dare to say so, because I have no proof at all.
It is merely a possibility.
Is that clear?
We take note of your observation and, of course, as you know, it is the verbatim report which testifies to what has been said.
It will therefore clarify whether you said one thing or another.
Mr President, in fact I was trying to amend the verbatim report of proceedings because in the Minutes it said only that I spoke, nothing else.
Concerning the verbatim report I put the accent on the fact that there was an expression that I had not used.
That was the problem.
You can write to the services to correct your words.
Apparently the services understood something else.
But you are entitled to correct your words.
Mr President, colleagues were shouting and so it was very difficult to hear what I was saying.
Right now there is no problem.
At the time Spanish colleagues were shouting so it was very difficult to hear.
That is why I cannot say...
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, the plenary does not adopt the verbatim report of proceedings.
We adopt the Minutes.
So if you have a problem ...
(The President was interrupted) Please, respect the presidency.
We take note of your remarks on the Minutes.
You can write to the services to correct the verbatim report.
That is all.
(The Minutes were approved)
Telecommunications mergers
The next item is the Commission statement on telecommunications mergers.
Mr President, on behalf of my group and all my colleagues I would like to welcome Mr Monti to the House today for what is a very timely discussion on the regulatory regime for telecom, bearing in mind that we are now moving into the very important consideration of the telecom package.
I want to briefly pick up on some of the crucial points that he made.
It is quite clear to all of us that the whole world of electronic communications is presenting us with a regulatory challenge, but it is clearly presenting you, Commissioner, and the competition authority with unprecedented challenges, given the speed with which technology is advancing.
Many of the ideas related to market share are also changing very rapidly.
In the telecom field, it is clear that market share can change hands much more quickly than in some of the major industries that have been regulated in the past.
I was delighted that your approach is to try and avoid putting a brake on innovation by excessively firm controls.
That is extremely important.
I would like your assurance that you will be developing the expert capability to what is undoubtedly going to be an increasing workload in looking at future mergers.
We understand from the Peers Group report that you are going to be awarded an extra 92 posts.
It will be interesting to hear how you envisage your service developing in this direction.
The second point which will come through in our consideration of the telecom package, is that in this very fast-moving world there is concern within the industry and amongst investors that excessively rigid targets in terms of market share thresholds for investigation - and that can be too much or too little in many cases - should not be allowed to inhibit your consideration of areas where there is a genuine competitive issue at stake.
Could you perhaps address these points when you respond to our debate later on?
Mr President, could I start my contribution by offering my congratulations to Commissioner Monti and his officials for the scrupulous and professional way in which they dealt with the proposed MCI Worldcom - Sprint merger.
I would particularly to thank him and his officials for trying to see trade unionists from all over the European Union and indeed from the United States of America, who had an opportunity to put their views.
Without doubt, one of the consequences of mergers and takeovers is the effect on employment and I know that the Commissioner, within the confines of the Treaty, is sensitive to this.
What also needs to be stressed is that there are special technological reasons why a concentration of ownership, the potential abuse of a dominant position, is so serious.
In most other industries such a concentration or potential abuse might be temporary, but in this field if any one company does secure such a strong position it will almost certainly have it, if not forever, then at least for a very long time.
In your presentation, Commissioner, you mentioned the danger of one company gaining control over these markets.
This really is a dilemma for Parliament and for the Commission.
We accept the near inevitability and in many cases the desirability of mergers and takeovers, but we also see the potential and actual dangers.
Parliament is consistent in its view that we do not want to put any obstacles in the way of competitiveness and innovation.
We welcome the position that you have taken on this particular issue.
One other small point: much of this competition is between the European Union and the United States of America.
I know you are well aware how crucial it is for Europe to lead in the two important spheres of third generation mobile telephones and digital television and I hope that you will continue your efforts to keep that lead, which is so crucial to jobs, employment and prosperity in the European Union.
I would like to take up the subject just touched upon by the previous speaker, namely the transatlantic aspects of telecoms liberalisation and particularly paragraph 6 and 7 of the draft resolution, which refers to the unfortunate initiative by Senator Hollings to restrict the transfer of licences to telecoms companies which are more than 25% state-owned.
This seems an ironic lurch towards a protectionist position at the very time when here in Europe and in this Parliament we are about to embark upon a debate on the latest raft of measures which, in my view, would make the European Union telecoms market the most liberalised and the most open market in the world going way beyond many if not all of the commitments into which we entered in GATT and the WTO.
This is politically if not technically an unbalanced situation which merits the attention of this House.
Whilst I have some philosophical sympathy with Senator Hollings and his colleagues who consider that state-owned companies have some hidden and sometimes explicit advantages over their privately-owned competitors, the way in which Congress in the United States is trying to address this issue is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of US multilateral commitments.
I would ask fellow Members, when considering the latest raft of telecoms measures in the weeks to come, not to allow this to go unnoticed or for that matter unchallenged.
Mr President, Commissioner, I remember how, around the middle of last year, when the merger of the American companies Time Warner and America Online was announced, there were people who described that event as an early beginning of the third millennium as far as its cultural and technological aspects were concerned.
At that time, comparisons were made.
In the United States, 40% of homes had access to that network of all networks known as the Internet, whilst in the European Union, that figure hardly reached 20%, and that percentage was only surpassed in a few of the Union' s Member States, which were more advanced in terms of technological development.
I believe we need to make progress and take more action specifically on that issue. We must not have two types of society, second- and first-class citizens, those who are technologically advanced and those who are technologically backward.
We must provide all citizens with access to this new information society.
However, as we make more effort in terms of the concentration of companies and of developing the European market, we must take account of the dangers caused by a lack of security in telecommunications.
I am thinking of the Echelon affair, which is very much related to this kind of issue.
In Europe, we must ensure that there is security, because that is a human right.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the fact that the Commission and the US Department of Justice have blocked the proposed MCI Worldcom - Sprint merger, and were also delighted to hear that the US Government is not inclined to approve the AOL - Time Warner deal.
The Internet must continue to be a means of communication for all.
We must therefore prevent the telecommunications and media giants from being able to occupy a dominant position.
Competition law is an effective tool to this end.
However, mergers also have an impact on employment and social cohesion.
Telecommunications and media are not crisis-ridden industries; they are an expanding sector.
Objectively, this makes it easier to take account of sociopolitical and employment policy aspects in merger decisions.
Since the mid-nineties, the Federal Communication Commission in the USA has, in the case of several merger decisions, secured commitments from the companies concerned to increase the number of employees, improve quality of service, and do more to look after the public interest.
Therefore we fail to comprehend why, in the welfare state of Europe, competition law should rule the day.
We are calling for the EU to introduce binding social clauses into the mergers approvals process.
Apart from the competition law test, we need additional criteria for the purposes of merger decisions, for example: firstly, the companies should give a binding commitment to preserving or raising the level of employment.
Secondly, they should improve the quality of service for large sections of their customer base.
Thirdly, they must implement to the letter, the mechanics of the European social dialogue and the provisions of the directive on informing and consulting workers, as they make the transition to the new merged company.
Fourthly, the merger must bring added benefits when it comes to furthering the public interest.
This relates to such matters as the need to safeguard a comprehensive and modern universal service, and requirements in terms of data and consumer protection.
That is the only way to guarantee that competition policy will also strengthen the European social model in the new economy.
Mr President, at the outset I would like to say that I welcome the Commission's publication of the new telecom directives and regulations on 12 July.
This is part of the ongoing framework programme to improve the quality of telecommunications services in Europe.
Parliament and the Commission are right to be adamant that the Union must improve its telecommunications network.
It is fair to say that the United States is possibly three years ahead of the Union as regards the use of the Internet.
On the back of the new directives which are being enacted in the telecom sector, the European Union will catch up with the US sooner rather than later.
This is also in line with the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Portugal.
EU leaders pointed to the need to improve our overall telecommunications services.
I support the recommendation that all schools in Europe must be equipped with the Internet.
From an Irish perspective, I am particularly satisfied that this programme is advancing at a very swift pace.
There has been much talk in national and international media about the auctioning of third-generation mobile phone licences in Europe.
Certainly, the auctioning of these licences in Germany and Britain has secured large amounts of money for the respective national exchequers, but who ultimately is going to pay for these phones?
I strongly believe that consumers, once again, are going to be forced to bear the high cost of these licences.
Commissioner, I do not envy you your task in general, let alone in a new sector such as the telecoms sector whose dynamics are so unpredictable that it is particularly difficult to make decisions regarding competitiveness and mergers which, from a traditional perspective, do not always work to the advantage of the companies of a sector such as the telecommunications sector which has to develop in Europe to make its companies more competitive, and frequently do not work to the advantage of consumers either.
For example, in the case of Microsoft, when it was considered that Microsoft had reached the most dominant position possible, another operating system such as Linux would threaten its monopoly without any interference from the U.S. Department of Justice at all.
I would have liked to talk about the Vodaphone/Mannesmann case and its rather problematic implications for the France Telecom Orange case, and express my fear that the Community authorities, certainly including Parliament, might be tempted or give way to the instinct to intervene officially and issue excessive regulations to govern the sector.
Today Parliament - and I call upon the Commissioner to take note of this - adopted, with very little opposition, including our own, a document calling upon the Commission to promote the establishment of a body to prevent market mergers liable to prejudice pluralism.
The resolution was on multimedia, but the telecommunications and multimedia markets are one and the same and I feel that we should exercise extreme caution when intervening in the concentration and restructuring processes taking place in this sector.
For the good of ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for firmly quashing the WorldCom-Sprint merger, which was the right thing to do.
These cases have increased dramatically in number recently.
In ten years the number of mergers has risen fivefold and there are about three hundred of them a year now.
Mr Harbour presented the telecom package.
It just shows what a furious pace this industry is moving along at.
It demands a lot from all of us in terms of skills.
The telecommunications and IT sectors are special.
It is not just a matter of pushing a cart; it is a quite exceptional field, because information is at present the most important tool of production.
In addition, it involves, as we know very well from the Echelon case and others, the possibility of monitoring, and thus the possibility of the monitoring of people, which has also become a very important business.
The other aspect to consider here is globalisation, which crosses state and cultural borders.
These are in a way beyond the control and vigilance of everyone.
Quite the opposite, as through them these companies can create a dependency, as that part of this business happens in people' s brains.
It is an important new territorial conquest, and, for that reason, I would ask the Commission to be particularly careful with regard to these mergers.
While we are aiming at deregulation here, Commissioner, companies are tending to re-regulate: to make new agreements about the market that bypass the democratic monitoring and control systems.
As Mr Clegg said, there are obviously problems too between the European Union and the United States, such as the restriction on mergers in the case of Deutsche Telecom, which obviously has to be looked into.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Clegg has already expressed his broad support, on behalf of the Liberal Group, for the Commission' s proposals, and his concern about certain specific aspects relating to the United States, as has just been mentioned.
I would like to highlight the concern about an aspect which appears in the Liberal Group' s original motion for a resolution, whose first section refers to the need to reject any political interference in the Commission' s competition policy.
If we apply this to the issue in question, the telecommunications sector, it is a well-founded concern given the cases which arose in Spain, a few months ago, involving the merger of TelefÃ³nica with a Dutch company, in Portugal and in other sectors in France.
It worries us that there is still government interference in the actions of companies who are seeking appropriate dimensions and competitiveness at a European level.
We therefore support the Commission' s proposals and we would like to draw attention to this aspect.
Mr President, the records for company mergers have now been broken in the telecommunications sector, with mega-mergers in Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic.
These operations involve billions of dollars, and benefit consumers, who are also employees facing company closures, relocations and redundancies.
The telecommunications sector has become a symbol of capitalist globalisation, which forces it to bear the cost of this race towards ever more enormous deals.
The Lisbon Summit made several references to the information society. This is something which can indeed enable considerable progress to be made.
There is no doubting that this is a challenge!
Nowadays these changes are generally matched by a dismantling of social rights, an increase in part-time work and flexibility at work.
Nor can we ignore the consequences for the freedom of information, cultural diversity and public services.
The Commission banned the merger between MC Worldcom and Sprint solely because it might threaten free competition.
At a time, however, when the European Union is making employment a priority, mergers should also be seen in light of their consequences for employment and land-use planning.
We should also increase the employees' and union organisations' rights and powers on the boards of European companies and perhaps even give them a right of veto in the event of restructurings or mergers.
Lastly, common regulations should be promoted so that the information society benefits all citizens and is based on equality of access, freedom of information and cultural diversity.
May I welcome the Commissioner to Parliament today on behalf of all of us.
We all appreciate the importance of your task in the competition department of the Commission.
It is perhaps the most important task of the Commission to maintain free competition and make the market work across the European Union.
In the telecoms context it is vital to ensure that consumers get all the benefits the free market can offer them, particularly the low-cost Internet access.
The way to deliver that low-cost Internet access, vitally important for the creation of a European E-economy to the people of Europe, is through liberalisation and free competition.
We used to regulate the telecom sector through national regulators, but these will wither away in future because we are moving towards a single, global regulator, namely the market.
The market is the most effective regulator, providing the best protection for consumers and giving consumers more power than any number of Commission consultation groups.
In future we shall want to give the competition mergers department, more work, because the market should play an even bigger role in telecoms than it does at the moment.
We want to see an end to the advantages inherited by some of the old state monopolies.
I hope you will apply competition law and merger law toughly, but always ensure that you look at each merger on its own merits.
Just because it may produce a big player or a big corporation it is not necessarily wrong for the market or anti-competitive.
We have to remember that Europe probably will need some large corporations if it is to reap the benefits of the Internet revolution.
Mr President, I would like to take up what Mary Read had to say in her intervention, when she discussed the impact on jobs and employment.
It is simply not the case that the workers in our regions and constituencies are forever waiting with bated breath for us to liberalise previously protected sectors.
The reverse is often true.
We are going to have to answer a whole host of employees' questions about local public transport operatives over the next few weeks and months.
We, the representatives of the people, must provide these answers, and not the Commission, which will talk to the union leaders if need be.
One thing is for sure, unrestricted liberalisation and the opening up of markets, are no panacea.
However, market opening in the telecommunications sector itself, demonstrates that market opening can bring benefits for consumers in the form of falling prices and access to new services.
It has brought about rapid advances in technology, which, at the end of the day, will lead to an increase in jobs, even high-quality jobs in the major sectors.
The globalisation of our national economies has had a major stimulating effect on the liberalisation of telecommunications markets in Europe, and, conversely, has furthered development at international level.
It goes without saying that we need a certain number of commercial giants to be able to hold our own as a global player.
But this must not of course lead to new monopolies in markets and market sectors.
We need to adopt a rigorous competition policy with regard to commercial organisations, in order to ensure that no single company gains a dominant hold in the new market block formed by the telecommunications and multimedia sectors.
That is why we should support the Commission' s decision in matters such as WorldCom and Sprint.
We also hope that it will adopt a similarly rigorous approach where Time Warner and AOL are concerned.
Above all, though, the Commission must use its efforts to modernise competition law, particularly in respect of the regulation on merger control, as an opportunity to adopt an extremely rigorous approach to its reform undertakings too.
We hope this will not prove to be to the detriment of competition policy.
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, ladies and gentlemen, it is natural of the market that companies in the telecommunications industry, which right now requires its players to invest billions and embark on enormous basic infrastructure projects, should try to seek partners in the free market, all the while honouring the rules and regulations.
It is of overall benefit to society that an operational environment should be created in Europe, in which companies, that is to say, the private sector, are themselves able to attend to these infrastructure projects that vitally need the information society.
As these same companies at the same time employ more and more people, as we heard today in your presentation, Mr Monti, and are therefore boosting economic growth in Europe, I do not really understand the fears that have been expressed over there at the other side of the Chamber that these mergers, which are fully beneficial to society as a whole, should have a detrimental effect on employment in Europe.
Politicians and trust busters, such as Mr Monti, must not interfere in this current development in the market other than when the Commission has proper grounds to believe that a particular merger may cause distortions to the competition situation, so harming the interests of consumers.
Mr Rapkay, you may be sure that nobody in this Chamber wants monopolies or oligopolies in the market.
This must really be restricted to certain cases; in other words, we need logic and consistency in this.
On the other hand, the Commission must actively monitor whether free access to markets is being realised in all sectors, as stated in point 3 of Parliament' s joint motion for a resolution.
Global competition must be examined, and there have been problems recently, at least with regard to the Deutsche Telekom - Voice Stream deal.
I hope, Mr Monti, you will comment on this plan by the US Congress, which totally contravenes WTO regulations, to ban licence transfers to firms owned by foreign companies.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament who spoke for their interest in these issues, for the appreciation they have generously shown for the Commission's activities and for their support.
Please excuse me, for I shall have to be extremely brief in my answers.
Mr Harbour, you identified one crucial point, namely preventing market trends from disrupting innovation.
This is indeed one of our key concerns.
You referred to the outcome of the Commission's peer group preview.
I am delighted that the peer group has understood the needs of competition policy so clearly.
We are beginning to form ideas about how to deploy additional resources within the competition DG but we must first secure the support of the budgetary authority.
Mrs Read, among others, supported the decision we took in late June about MCI WorldCom-Sprint.
That decision was based on a great many considerations, including some input from the trade unions, although this in no way led us to depart from regulations.
Mrs Read and other Members of Parliament mentioned some sectors in which Europe has a lead, for instance third-generation mobile telephony and digital TV.
One particularly effective way to maintain a lead is to make the market run efficiently.
That is why we insist so much on rigorous enforcement of competition policy in the light of the market situation in Europe, irrespective of the nationality of companies.
When companies establish or consolidate a dominant position without proposing the necessary remedies, we have no option but to block a merger and recently did so in a case involving two European companies, Volvo and Scania, which, indeed, are based in the same Member State.
We would have done the same in another case in which one company was European (Pechiney) and the other North American-Canadian (Alcan), but the merger was withdrawn.
In addition, we took similar action in the recent MCI WorldCom-Sprint case, where both companies were American.
We have established excellent cooperation with our American counterparts at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
Talking of the US, several Members have drawn attention to the risks of the Hollings Bill.
This is simply a proposal, and I hope that it will not become law, although this depends on your American opposite numbers.
However, if it were to be adopted I would consider it a disturbing sign of protectionism It would be unfortunate if liberalisation, which has taken such giant leaps forward in the US, Europe and elsewhere over the past few years, were to start going backwards in the US.
Moreover, the bill is, in our view, clearly incompatible with the USA's WTO obligations and other basic telecommunications agreements and the Commission through my colleague Pascal Lamy has certainly made this very clear to our American counterparts.
The Commission also resolutely opposes any such legislation in our Member States.
To dispel Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm's anxieties, the Commission alone has the power to consider Community-scale mergers.
When a Member State wrongfully intervenes, the Commission is ready to challenge such an intervention, as it proved in one case last year in a decision addressed to the Portuguese Government.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea, Mr Markov and Mr Rapkay referred to the very important AOL-Time Warner case.
You will appreciate that I cannot say very much now.
The deadline for the Commission's decision is 24 October.
The hearing on this merger is taking place today and tomorrow in Brussels.
We expressed our concerns on 22 August when we issued our statement of objections to the parties.
There is nothing else I can add at this stage.
Mr Gallagher and another honourable Member referred to the allocation system for third-generation mobile telephone licences.
The auctions will increase the number of mobile telephone operators in the Union.
More players mean more competition, so we can only welcome the outcome of the auctions from a competitive standpoint.
We will obviously make sure that the consortia put in place will not lead to concerted practices because membership will vary from country to country.
It has been pointed out that the sums paid to EU governments to obtain licences are too high and that making it necessary for the operators to recoup their initial investment would lead to higher prices for consumers and perhaps limit the development of new advanced mobile telephone services.
But this is not a competition law issue as such, whereas trying to introduce restrictions on competition in order to make it easier to recoup the cost would be sanctioned by competition law.
However, irrespective of the system used - auctions, beauty contests or whatever - the precise rules of a beauty contest or an auction can require scrutiny to ensure, for example, that incumbents are not favoured and that non-discrimination, transparency and proportionality are guaranteed.
So even though Member States are free to choose either a beauty contest, an auction system or a mixture of both, they must still comply with competition law and the sector-specific telecommunications legislation on licensing and with the state aid rules.
In this context I could mention that the competition DG is currently looking into a complaint against the Netherlands, jointly with the information society DG.
They are also looking into a complaint against France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany and finally, we are also investigating a UMTS auction under the state aid rules.
So we are trying to be vigilant as all of you urge us to be.
Mr Della Vedova is afraid that the Community authorities will attempt to overburden the development of this sector, which is going to become so important for the European economy, with regulatory constraints.
I can assure him that, as far as regulations are concerned, the Commission is trying to keep constraints to a minimum and, that it is for precisely this reason that it considers that it is important for competition policy to play a major role.
As far as pluralism - also mentioned by Mr Della Vedova - is concerned, I can only point out that, under the current European system, Member States can adopt measures to protect pluralism.
This is recognised in the merger regulation as one of the legitimate grounds for Member States to intervene, provided, of course, that the purpose of the intervention is to protect pluralism.
I note that Mrs Villiers urges us to apply competition law toughly.
I hope we will live up to your expectations in the future, without being prejudiced against size as such.
We have to examine situations case by case.
Size can sometimes create problems.
Even smaller operators can create competition problems and then we have to intervene.
Finally, several Members - Mrs Read, Mr Markov, Mrs Ainardi, Mr Rapkay - have recognised and stressed the beneficial impact of the development of this sector on employment, but also expressed some concern about the social impact of mergers.
I must be very brief at this stage.
This raises two issues.
As to the general effect on employment, I firmly believe that if competition is maintained employment tends to benefit.
This has clearly been the case in the telecommunication industry.
Even though incumbents may have laid off some workers, liberalisation has created a large number of new entrants which are creating new employment.
The Commission is extremely keen that workers' rights should be safeguarded.
The whole deployment of Commission policy instruments and the assessment of concentrations is limited purely to the aspects covered by competition law.
However the Commission welcomes the involvement of workers' representatives in the merger control process.
Representatives have a right to be heard at all stages of the procedure.
I know from experience that their views are a valuable input for my services.
I am increasingly convinced that rigorous competition is a key component of a social market economy, be it in the traditional sectors or in the new sectors and - I stress both adjectives - social and market economies.
Thank you very much, Mr Monti, for your detailed reply.
I have received 4 motions for resolutions, in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to end the present statement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
Human cloning
The next item is the Commission statement on human cloning.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recent progress in the field of life sciences provide considerable prospects for their application, but also raise ethical questions which are of great concern to the general public.
It is becoming increasingly important to anticipate these ethical questions so that they can then be integrated into a broader dialogue between science and society.
In its statement of January 2000, the Commission highlighted the fact that a genuine European research area can only become a reality if we also promote a European area of ethical values, which are shared throughout Europe.
With this in mind, the Commission plans to adopt initiatives such as strengthening the links between ethics committees across Europe and the exchange of good practice in the ethical assessment of research projects.
Therapeutic cloning, or to be more precise, the use for therapeutic purposes of embryo stem cells obtained by cloning techniques is one example of the ethical questions raised by the rapid scientific advances that have been made in the life sciences.
This technique for therapeutic cloning is a particularly sensitive issue, for obvious cultural, religious and ethical reasons.
The report by a group of British experts, published on 16 August, recognises the considerable importance of research into human embryo stem cells and their therapeutic application.
This report recommends authorising research in this area, and particularly the use of embryos produced by cloning, using the technique of nucleus replacement, whilst recommending a clear legal and ethical framework.
The publication of this report has led to many people across Europe expressing their views and has enabled a genuine debate to be held at European level, beyond the scientific circles concerned.
As President Prodi announced recently in a press statement, the Commission, far from remaining silent, hopes that an enlightened debate will ensue, in close cooperation with the European Parliament.
Respect for the national identity of Member States led the Treaty on European Union to give Member States the prerogative to legislate on ethical issues.
Legislation and gaps in legislation vary greatly, which reflects the range of very different sensibilities in the countries of the European Union.
Community action in the field of biotechnological research is nevertheless increasingly based on the most rigorous fundamental ethical principles, out of respect for national sensibilities.
This applies to Community legislation on the patentability of biotechnological inventions, which is expressly based on respect for the fundamental principles that guarantee human dignity and integrity. This legislation also affirms the principle that the human body, at all stages of its formation or its development, including germ cells, as well as the simple discovery of one of its elements or of one of its products, including the partial sequencing of a human gene, cannot be patented.
This legislation does not allow for the patenting of reproductive human cloning and the sale of embryos or parts of the human body.
Whilst the directive regulates the conditions in which an invention based on biological matter may benefit from the protection of a patent, its aim is not, however, to set the conditions in which the research itself may be carried out.
With regard to research, the European Commission has, for many years, given its support to the field of biomedicine.
The fifth framework-programme, which was adopted using the codecision procedure, respects fundamental ethical principles and is based on the opinion issued by the European Ethics Group prior to the adoption of the framework-programme.
Research involving cloning techniques for reproductive or therapeutic ends is therefore quite explicitly excluded.
Animal cloning is also limited to ethically justifiable purposes, to ensure that operations are carried out without causing unnecessary suffering
The framework-programme, which also has a proactive role, is currently supporting the studies in bioethics looking at the potential risks and benefits of cloning technology.
Furthermore, complementary approaches to therapeutic cloning attempting to develop new techniques for cell therapy are underway, particularly through major projects using adult stem cells.
This research is being carried out with respect for fundamental ethical principles and for the relevant national regulations.
I should like to emphasise that the ethical aspects are, as a matter of course, taken into account when proposals are assessed and that a thorough ethical review is undertaken for proposals involving more sensitive ethical issues.
The Commission looks forward to hearing the opinion of the European Group on Ethics this November on the use of adult stem cells.
This group has shown its independence and its considerable competence in issues that are both highly sensitive and also extremely technical.
Like previous ones, this opinion will, of course, be extremely important for the framing of Community research policy.
In more general terms, the high level group of experts on life sciences, recently established at my behest, must help us to construct a genuine dialogue on the life sciences between the world of research and society at large.
The symposium, which is being held by this group on 6 and 7 November in Brussels and to which, of course, I invite all Members of this Parliament who may be interested, represents an important stage in establishing this dialogue.
Therefore, although the Commission has no plans to legislate or harmonise in the field of ethics, it does wish to contribute to the debate, fully respecting the diversity of Europe' s cultures and sensibilities.
This is also one of the objectives of the European research area, which is gradually being developed.
I wish to ask a question regarding the agenda.
Mr Busquin has just made a statement about cloning.
When will the debate on this subject be held?
At 5 p.m. in other words, immediately after the debate on enlargement.
Comments by Mr Verheugen concerning enlargement
The next item is the communication on Mr Verheugen' s statement on enlargement.
I welcome President Prodi to the Chamber and I thank him for being present.
I must warn you that President Prodi will have to leave us at 4.35 p.m. to travel to New York for the Millennium meeting.
We are nevertheless grateful to him for having made the effort to take part in this debate and, without further ado, I shall give him the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to make a personal statement before this house, together with Commissioner Verheugen, in order to clarify the political significance of the interview with him in the SÃŒddeutsche Zeitung of 2 September and the political significance of a number of ensuing press statements.
Mr Verheugen will shortly explain to you exactly what he said and why he said it.
For my part, I want to reaffirm solemnly before you, Members of Parliament, the full commitment of my Commission to the great task of enlargement.
I have repeatedly stressed that enlargement is the Commission' s single most important task and that the Commission is committed to starting the process off along the right track.
There is a pressing need for this new page in the history of the Union to be completed, in accordance with the objectives set by the European Council and the Commission itself and frequently presented before this House.
As you are well aware, this is a highly complex issue from a political point of view, and with your strong, unwavering support, the Commission is conducting the negotiation process transparently and objectively, with rigorous adherence to the conditions laid down in its mandate.
The democracies of the countries which are going to join the Union are making a huge effort, which we are in constant danger of underestimating.
However, this effort must be matched on our side by considerable political generosity, expressed in many different ways.
The Union' s first act of generosity, and I must stress that once again, must be to be ready to open its doors to new Members by January 2003.
In order to put our house in order, therefore, the Union' s main concern must be to agree in Nice, at the end of the year, upon a high-quality institutional reform which will prevent our system from being watered down.
There is another side to the political generosity which it is our duty to display: we must all make every effort to win as many citizens as possible over to supporting the enlargement process.
For my part, I fear that the public is not yet sufficiently convinced.
In seeking democratic support for this historic enterprise, we are certainly not attempting to delay the process but to reinforce it.
It is clearly up to each individual Member State or candidate country to decide which ways and means to use to ensure support from its citizens.
In particular, the national procedures for ratifying enlargement are purely national issues.
It is certainly not the intention of the Commission or Commissioner Verheugen to interfere in this matter.
Nevertheless - and this is a different matter - we must all play our part in making clear to our citizens what is at stake.
I have always found Parliament, before which I sit today, to be fully committed to doing just this: explaining to our fellow citizens, over and over again, that enlargement is not a threat but a historic opportunity in all respects, and, above all, a historic step towards establishing peace in our continent.
The loyal commitment of all the Commissioners to the Commission' s policies is a hallmark of my presidency, and, as this House is aware, I do not lack the means to enforce that if necessary.
In this particular case, I am entirely confident that GÃŒnter Verheugen fully supports the Commission' s policy, which this House has approved on many occasions.
I therefore have every confidence in his ability to bring the enlargement negotiations to a swift, successful conclusion.
. (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful that we are having this debate, because it gives me the opportunity to offer a word of explanation - and therefore have the final word, as I see it - on the interview that unleashed this furore.
I made the point, in this interview - in a personal capacity and in a purely German context - that referenda can help to involve the public more closely in major European projects that change the constitutional nature of the State.
I cited the Treaty of Maastricht as an example of this, and not enlargement.
Finally, I also said that the German constitution makes no provision for this.
No one regrets more than I do the fact that this statement was taken to mean that I was calling for a referendum on enlargement.
I hereby declare that I did not raise such a demand, either for Germany or for any other country for that matter.
If you read the text with complete impartiality and do not rely on second-hand reports, you will come to no other conclusion.
But what was the real message?
The message was this: 'we want enlargement and we want it to be implemented as quickly as possible and as comprehensively as is necessary.'
A huge number of Members of this House know that for a year now, I have been trying, with a passion, to get a direct message across to the citizens of the candidate countries and the Member States, to the effect that we really do want these new Members.
What I am trying to do, is to breathe life into a process that could easily slip into pure practicalities.
We want to secure peace and stability throughout Europe.
We want to give young democracies the chance to participate, on equal terms, in Europe' s political and economic development.
We want to boost Europe' s role in international competition.
We have no alternative.
Since the Prodi Commission took office, the outcome of the enlargement negotiations has been positive.
The progress reports that the Commission is due to submit in the autumn will reveal that the candidate countries have made an enormous amount of progress and are approaching the stage when they will be ready for accession.
The Commission is intending to propose new elements for the negotiating strategy in the autumn, which should make it possible to proceed even more rapidly with negotiations and to tackle the key issues that arise at the negotiating table.
I might point out that it will only be possible to make this kind of headway in close cooperation with the Member States and the European Parliament.
I would expressly like to thank the European Parliament for its outstanding cooperation and for the unconditional support it has given me, so far at any rate.
I also warmly commend the European Parliament and its Members for their positive role in the efforts being made to raise awareness of this historic project amongst the people of Europe.
I have always advocated that we should obtain the broadest possible support amongst the public, and highlight, in a wide-ranging public debate, the major benefits that the accession of new Member States would bring.
We must convince people that enlargement will be politically and economically advantageous to both sides from the very outset.
We need to have a wide-ranging , democratic debate on this historic project.
These were the basic ideas I wanted to bring out in the interview.
(Applause) The Commission has absolutely no intention - and it was most certainly the very last thing I intended - of introducing any new political conditions into the negotiating process or the decision-making process.
The strategy has been laid down by the European Council.
The Commission pursues this strategy with vigour.
And as President Prodi has already said, it makes perfect sense for the accession treaties to be ratified in the individual Member States in accordance with their respective legal systems.
Three conclusions can be drawn from this, to my mind.
Firstly, we must wage a broadly-based communication campaign in the Member States and the candidate countries.
The Commission has already made the necessary preparations to this end.
Secondly, we ought not to dismiss any fears or concerns people may have, rather we should talk openly to them and help them....
(Applause)... to seize the new opportunities and rise to the new challenges.
I am thinking, in particular, of the border regions.
The Commission is working on a programme here too.
And thirdly, when it comes to issues beset with fears and emotions - and they are there in the enlargement process; take, for example, the issue of immigration - we must proceed with the greatest caution and keep a sense of perspective as far as we possibly can.
But there are ways and means of solving these problems.
And these must, and will be, decided on when the time is right, and in the appropriate manner.
(Applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish we did not have to have this debate today.
It centres on a grave occurrence, a serious political error.
I hope that in the light of what President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have just had to say, the record will have been put straight by the end of this debate.
It was not the President, but the Commission whom we asked for a statement.
But I am extremely grateful to President Prodi for the fact that he deemed the occurrence so important as to address us in person today.
Commissioner Verheugen, I have read your interview several times.
Before I get to the real crux of the matter, I would like to draw your attention to the following sentence, which has left me totally bewildered and dismayed.
I am being completely matter-of-fact when I say this, because I believe deeply in every word that I calmly utter here, and because it reflects my convictions.
Mr Verheugen said in the interview: "One of the almost tragic developments of the past few years has been that Parliament has found itself unanimous in only one respect, namely in opposing the Commission."
Mr Verheugen, what is your understanding of Parliament' s role?
You would not be in office if we had not given you our blessing.
On behalf of my group, I would assert - and President Prodi is aware - that, in principle, we regard ourselves as the European Commission' s ally when it comes to safeguarding the Treaties, involving Mr Patten in external policy, and when we are having trouble getting secretariats.
We are on the Commission' s side and would ask you to take note of this and not accuse us of opposing the Commission in principle, and only finding ourselves unanimous in one respect.
I simply refuse to accept this.
(Applause)
I refuse to accept this because I want people to understand that the work we do is in support of the Commission.
We have a joint task to get to grips with for Europe.
Turning now to the facts of the matter.
You said that anyone reading your text with impartiality could reach no other conclusion.
I believe - and in fact this is a pan-European debate - that even if you take an impartial view of this text, you simply cannot help reaching the conclusions we have introduced into the public debate.
Mr Verheugen, I am grateful to you for, and highly appreciative of your statement to the effect that no new conditions should be created.
In so doing you have made it clear, once and for all - as the President of the Commission said - that you are no longer advocating that a referendum of the kind you have in your country, should form the basis for enlargement of the European Union.
After all, quite a few people have been left wondering if there is a strategy underlying Commissioner Verheugen' s comment.
In fact only today, certain other individuals - and I would not wish to make a party political issue of this - amongst whom an important character from Germany, who is close to you politically, have called for a referendum on this issue.
But I am pleased that the matter has been cleared up today.
(Heckling)
Please do not get excited.
I am delighted that we have been able to reach a consensus on this issue and discuss it, because the issue of enlargement concerns the future of the European continent in the twenty-first century.
The Commission and Parliament must tread the same path if we are to approach the future with confidence.
(Applause)
We must now join forces and urge the national governments to make a success of Nice.
We must do this together, in a spirit of good will and cooperation.
What matters most - to that extent, I sympathise with some of your comments, which we fully agree with - is to win public support for the enlargement of the European Union, so that we take the people in our countries with us.
As Members of the European Parliament, we are committed to this on an ongoing basis.
After all, it was the people of Europe that brought about the change in, and downfall, of Communism.
The reunification of Germany would not have been possible without Solidarnosc in Poland.
(Applause)
Let us now - and I call upon the Commission and the assembled delegates to rise to this challenge - tread the path of Europe together.
Parliament is agreed that we must tread this path together.
Mr Verheugen, I would urge you to take this to heart.
In principle, we are on the Commission' s side when it comes to the future development of Europe, the unity of our continent, and enlargement, because the people of Central Europe want to be part of the community of values that is the European Union.
It is our political and moral duty to do everything we can to make enlargement a reality as soon as we possibly can.
It is in the interests of the security, peace, and freedom of our European continent.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, President of the Commission, Mr Verheugen, you said just now that your comments in the interview were made in a German context, but it is far from being an internal German issue.
And even though Mr Poettering has just spoken, and now I am taking the floor, do not think that this is an all-German debate.
The comments you made, Mr Verheugen, provoked amazement, irritation and also anger amongst the Socialist Group.
This is not about the worth or lack of worth of referenda in terms of democracy, or involving the people in the decisions of the European Union.
Nor do I intend, as speaker for my group, to go into the internal German debate on such referenda and similar issues.
Naturally, each Member State will decide on the accession of new States according to its own constitutional law, and the same applies to Germany.
But precisely because the German constitution makes no provision for a referendum of this kind, your comments were interpreted as a call for a referendum to be introduced, and as such, as an attempt to postpone the eastward enlargement of the European Union.
I know this was far from being your intention, Commissioner, but that is the impression people got and it must be dispelled!
(Applause) The Socialist Group wants the European Union to honour the commitment it has entered into with regard to Eastern Europe.
We want the negotiations to be resolved speedily and diligently.
We reject any attempt to put new obstacles in the way of accession.
But the same applies to comments made by certain members of your group, Mr Poettering; for example with regard to the PPE' s attitude towards accession to the Economic and Monetary Union.
(Applause)
My group, the socialist group, welcomes the fact that President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have made the necessary clarifications here today, and we are grateful to you for this.
You have clarified matters to our satisfaction.
Now, of course, we could say: "Romano" locuto, causa finita.
(Laughter)But of course things are not that simple, because the fundamental problem, Commissioner Verheugen, is one we all face: i.e. the Commission, MEPs, national governments, and the parties in our Member States.
The fundamental problem is how we go about informing EU citizens about the accession of East European States, how we convince them and win their support for these accessions.
That is the key objective.
However, we are all to be found wanting in this respect.
The only way to achieve this aim is to impress on the people that the size of the task is commensurate with the size of the opportunity presented to us all in Europe.
That is the message we must drive home.
To this end, you, President Prodi, and you Commissioner, and all of us, must stop getting bogged down in bureaucratic detail and doubts.
Let us give our work the epoch-making status it deserves!
The political generation of the fifties - Adenauer, Monnet, Schuman and so on -, had the courage and vision to resolve the centuries' old conflict between Germany and France in a European Community, and to make a start on unifying the people of Europe.
Our generation of politicians, ladies and gentlemen, yours and mine, now has the opportunity, for the first time in a thousand years, to bring all the people of Europe together in one Community, based on free will, peace and democracy.
We must not allow anyone to wreck this opportunity, nor must we waste it.
(Applause)
Madam President, today offers an important corrective opportunity and an important step forward in this debate.
I am extremely pleased to see the President of the Commission here and I hope that Mr Prodi, as President of the Commission, will assert his presidential leadership on a regular basis in that way on strategic issues such as enlargement.
I therefore especially welcome his statement today.
I accept Commissioner Verheugen's explanation that he was speaking in a German context and in a personal capacity.
However, as the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, he does not now have the luxury of speaking in a personal capacity.
The fundamental problem when we give mixed messages or perhaps poorly expressed or ill-judged messages is that we risk conveying the wrong message.
From the way in which this interview was received and commented upon that has clearly happened here.
On the matter of a referendum I accept his explanation.
However the underlying thesis is correct.
We do need to take the public with us and if that was his point it is a valid one.
As to Member States leaving the Commission to do the dirty work, I hope that does not refer to the work of enlargement.
I am sure that implication was not intended.
If, Commissioner, you meant that some statesmen in our governments like to go on central European tours and announce that enlargement is on its way but then leave the details to the Commission, you should say so plainly and we will back you up when you confront the Council with this.
(Applause)I would ask the Commissioner in fairness to withdraw his remarks on the European Parliament finding itself unanimous in only one respect, namely in opposing the Commission.
That cannot be substantiated.
The Commissioner's relationship with our Parliament and its committees has always been constructive and positive and it should remain so.
Such a slur on our interinstitutional relationship must not be allowed to stand.
(Applause)
Madam President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for having consented to this discussion with us.
This is an excellent opportunity for us to embark on a serious and honest debate on the issue of enlargement, and we can also consider together how we can include our citizens in the discussion.
Nothing is more important than this.
I can understand how the Commission might be rather irritated by the way the Council sometimes approaches the issue of enlargement.
The Council has been incapable of proposing a concrete enlargement plan and in this it really has to rally its forces.
Neither is it of any benefit if state leaders travel to applicant countries and make hollow promises that membership is just around the corner.
This is not serious enlargement work.
Obviously, public confidence can be restored, but it will mean that first the entire negotiations process must be made more open.
Furthermore, national parliaments must be involved in these discussions, and we now have a good opportunity to say that we too in the European Parliament debate this matter regularly.
And then we have the idea that we might organise referenda on the results of enlargement.
It is certainly not quite the right time to contemplate this, as we will really have to have the courage to tell people that eight years have passed already since the present applicant countries were invited to join the European Union.
Eight years have passed, but hopefully we will be bold enough to tell the people that this process is now far advanced and is irreversible.
A referendum in itself is an absolutely splendid way of involving the people in making decisions.
I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for having had the courage to utter the word.
Even in Germany they should, in my opinion, consider dismissing historical fears that referenda might be generally dangerous.
Now let us just consider this Charter of Fundamental Rights.
At present, a Charter of Fundamental Rights is being drafted, but does it contain one single genuine right of involvement on the part of the ordinary citizen?
Why have we not started to discuss pan-European referenda or, for example, the right of citizens' initiative, which, for example, they have automatically in Switzerland?
I can understand why the Swiss do not wish to join the Union before such fundamental rights are also guaranteed to them as citizens joining the European Union.
This is a task we can embark on together, so that we can really establish a People' s Europe.
It is also the best way to dispel idle fears, because people have to enlighten themselves, they have to talk, and they have to acquire knowledge and information.
In other words, people' s direct rights are vitally necessary in general, but in this case I do not think we can start to vote on enlargement now.
Madam President, opinion differs in my group as to the proposed enlargement of the European Union.
Personally, I see it as an historic necessity and opportunity, which must not be put at risk either by rashness, undemocratic procedures, and bureaucratic or national small-mindedness, or politicians ' lack of consideration for the social dimension.
Commissioner, I do not doubt your personal commitment to enlargement.
Yet if you tell us, as you have done today, that we simply misinterpreted the interview, and I then read, in tomorrow 's edition of die Zeit, your own comments to the effect that the interview was your annual flop, then I am bound to wonder what is going on here!
I would urge you once again to clarify the situation for us.
In July, you dropped some very vague hints about the difficulties.
Despite being asked to do so, you were not prepared to be more specific at the time.
You are absolutely right to say that the people must be involved in the decision-making processes.
But that means of course, that the democratically elected representatives should be given these opportunities too.
I believe we must see an end to the excessively secretive brand of diplomacy employed by the Council and the Commission towards Parliament.
There is a second problem. I emphatically support your view that national governments must not overwhelm the people with existential decisions, as happened - I would agree with you on this point - in the case of the euro.
But a German referendum must never be allowed to determine the weal and woe of enlargement.
That would be insensitive and unacceptable to my mind.
Aside from that, you will receive our unswerving support if you are serious about democratic participation.
However, I also recall that you yourself dismissed out of hand the idea of having a referendum on the Treaty of Maastricht, in Germany at the time.
Thirdly - and this is the most important point - if we are to win the people' s support for enlargement and accession then their hopes and fears must be taken very seriously.
As I see it, there is more to this than launching a PR campaign costing EUR 150 million; it means highlighting the democratic, social and employment dimensions of enlargement.
There has been precious little sign of this so far, either in the debate on a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in EU reform undertakings, or in the accession negotiations.
Commissioner, please use your considerable and acknowledged ability to help make eastward enlargement a project for joint security and social solidarity, and one that can be jointly decided on and shaped by the people of Europe.
Then you will have us all on your side.
Madam President, President Prodi said 'Public opinion is not sufficiently convinced' and other Members have said the same thing.
The truth of the matter, which is serious, appears to be that the public is not sufficiently convinced because Europe is too concerned with specific issues concerning the individual States and is not doing enough to combat the major problems such as unemployment, migration, human rights, the renegotiation of the world's financial system, the financial bubble, relations with the United States and Europe' s capacity to build a healthy economy and exert its own influence in the world.
We have to realise that the European citizens are afraid.
Therefore, if we want enlargement to work to the ultimate benefit of present and future Member citizens, we will have to start involving the citizens in political and institutional processes, not unconditionally as you said in your speech, President Prodi, for there is one condition and that is that enlargement becomes a genuine benefit both for those citizens who are currently Members of our European Union and for those who, we hope, will join us as soon as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Italian Radicals are certainly not going to criticise anyone for proposing to organise a referendum on an extremely important issue.
It was, of course, a mistake, which has caused problems for the Commission and for all of us as the European Union, in the face of the legitimate hopes of the peoples of Eastern Europe who, after 50 years of Communist dictatorship, which we did nothing to combat, now, I believe, have the right to be part of the European Union.
I would now like the Members to carry out an examination of conscience, and I would ask both the Commission and Parliament what is going to happen at the Biarritz and Nice Summits, whose agendas contain such major issues about which absolutely nothing is being done.
No progress is being made on the matters of the institutional reforms; most importantly, nothing is being done to make good the commitment we have made in past years to extend enlargement to the countries of southern Europe - I refer to the Delors I and II packages.
Then we want to achieve enlargement without spending a penny more than our current budget, which is already less than sufficient for the 15.
These are major issues and your interview, Commissioner, caused some consternation.
I hope that these statements will set us off along the right road again, but the real problems remain unsolved: what reforms and what financial means are we going to use to bring enlargement to Eastern Europe with genuine success?
Madam President, I had understood that Mr Verheugen was going to give a full explanation of the interview that he gave to the SÃŒddeutsche Zeitung.
One important point he made was that he felt that, in his opinion, there should have been a referendum in Germany on the introduction of the euro.
Well, it is not too late.
Does he still think that German public opinion should be tested on the euro and what does he think the result would be?
Madam President, first of all, I would like to answer a number of specific questions that have been put to me.
I will firstly answer the questions put to me by Mr Poettering and Mr Cox, whom I would like to thank for their fair-minded contributions to the debate.
I am very pleased to note that you have formed a different impression of the relationship between Parliament and the Commission, to the one I very briefly described.
I must confess that I have also found this to be absolutely true in my own experience.
I have been asked to withdraw this evaluation. I am only too pleased to do so.....
.... because this debate has shown that I was obviously mistaken, and I have no difficulty whatsoever in admitting this!
I would like to address Mr Cox again. You picked up on a particular German word that I used, and for which the English translation is 'dirty work' .
I would just like to explain that in the part of Germany I come from, this word implies nothing more than painful and hard work.
I did not mean anything else by it......
(Heckling from the Chamber)
.... and the interpretation you gave it certainly comes very close indeed to what I really think.
There is no need for us to have yet more discussions on the decision-making process regarding the introduction of the euro to Germany.
At the time, I was chairman of the special committee of the German Bundestag, which prepared for the ratification of the euro in Germany.
This process was concluded as early as the end of 1993.
There are no further decisions to be made on the subject, the matter is closed.
People said at the time that the public had not been sufficiently involved.
Any one of my German colleagues would testify to that, and that is what I brought out again in the interview.
Incidentally, to sum up, I would like to point out that as I see it, this debate has revealed, firstly, that there is a very large and broad consensus of opinion between the Commission and Parliament on the key question as to how necessary, important and irreversible enlargement is, and, secondly, that we are also very much in tune as to the need to work together to secure the people' s support for this momentous project.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
If there are no further interventions, this debate is closed and we shall continue the debate on human cloning.
I wish to thank Commissioner Verheugen once more and to welcome back Commissioner Busquin.
Human cloning (continuation)
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that every person who is motivated by faith in man, right from the very first moment of his existence, must be guaranteed the unconditional respect which is morally due to the human person in its entirety.
Therefore, we must state, loud and clear, our opposition to experiments which involve the destruction of human embryos.
An embryo is already a human person with a very specific identity, and every action which is not intended to benefit the embryo is an act of violence against the right to life.
Parliament must reiterate what it has declared many times in recent years, including last May.
It is immoral to use human embryos for research, for those very operations to which the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, has allocated public funding, those operations which have been approved by Tony Blair' s British Government.
Sadly, it would appear that commercial interests are driving scientists to explore types of research which involve shortcuts and disregard all consideration for the protection of human life, which we consider to start at the moment of conception.
The human body is not a possession, it is nothing to do with 'having' , it is to do with 'being' , with being a living person, and it cannot therefore be reduced to a machine made up of components and gears, materials and functions.
What people are trying to achieve is almost an attack on life; it is the opposite of the ethic of love of man and his body, even in that initial stage of being alive, of being in the world, the human world, with that body which is himself. To the extent that those who take human embryos and disembowel them, removing the mass of cells inside and extinguishing their life, contrive to say that there is no-one inside, for if there were somebody inside they would be worthy of love or, in a loveless world, they would at least have the right for their human dignity to be respected.
Otherwise, the world would consist of violence, brutality and cynicism.
Ladies and gentlemen, to oppose destructive research on embryos is not just to adhere to religious principle, but to uphold a principle of civilisation as well: the absolute ban on one man being master of another which should still be at the very heart of our civilisation.
We cannot allow man to have such great power over his fellow man.
But this does not mean that we are against research, quite the contrary.
Alternative research is possible: research on the stem cells present in adults and on cells removed from the umbilical cord immediately after birth, for example.
In addition to all this, research is indeed being carried out on adult cells and looks likely to yield results.
Many research scientists are involved in alternatives to cloning and they are about to form major national research groups to work in this specific area.
Lastly, we propose that a temporary committee be set up to study these issues.
We would like there to be in-depth studies of new issues thrown up by the life sciences, on the condition that it is clear that the positions adopted by Parliament cannot be renegotiated.
It is those positions which the Commission must take as its starting point to assist us in producing well-founded recommendations.
Mr President, Article 1 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights states that the dignity of the person must be respected and protected.
Article 3 states that in the cases of medicine and biology, the following principles must be respected: the prohibition of eugenic practices, specifically those that are aimed at human selection; the prohibition of making the human body or any of its parts a source of profit and the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings.
Such formal statements are not necessarily sufficient.
Scientific advances are mind-boggling.
The speed at which scientific research progresses is sometimes difficult for average humans, and even for politicians, to comprehend.
This rhythm of progress in the techno-sciences, that is, in the marriage of science and technology, raises ethical questions that have major consequences.
This applies above all to the new mastery of living mechanisms.
In this respect, the British government' s proposal to refer legislation which seeks to authorise some scientific research into therapeutic cloning, including the human embryo, to the parliament at Westminster has led to all sorts of reactions and comments, both positive and negative.
Certain political groups in this Parliament are proposing a vote on a supposedly 'urgent' motion for a resolution.
The Socialists are of the view that such issues are too important for the future of medicine, biology and human society, and because they are so important, this Parliament should carry out a more thorough job than a resolution adopted at top speed.
This is not the gunfight at the OK Corral: This is not about being the first to draw.
This morning' s discussions on the monitoring centre for industrial change showed that this Parliament is capable of voting on everything and its opposite in the space of a few minutes.
The Socialists are unhappy with this type of vote, which looks more like Russian roulette than serious parliamentary work.
We would like to see a calm discussion of a vital problem, covering the opportunities opened up by genetic engineering and also the lines that cannot be crossed in this field.
This raft of issues concerns various standing committees in this Parliament.
This is clearly a cross-sector issue, which deserves to be dealt with by a special temporary committee, which has the task of calling in experts and of holding hearings of opposing views so that we can have an objective debate, which is not skewed in advance by deeply-embedded prejudices.
I shall end, Mr President, by asking you, by asking all of us, to take this task seriously.
We are prepared to withdraw our motion for a resolution if the other groups do the same and to try to work constructively together.
I welcome the Commissioner's statement and particularly its measured and considered nature.
The ELDR resolution that has been tabled takes the same view.
We do not want a quick, ill-conceived reaction to events that have taken place in my country and the announcement made by the British Government.
These are serious matters and reflect our citizens' deep concerns but we should appreciate the full context of the UK announcement, acknowledging the subsidiarity principle to which the Commissioner referred.
It is only a proposal, not a decision, and it follows a very careful and considered report by the chief medical officer's expert group on cloning.
The matter has been under consideration for two years - too long, say some commentators, when measured against the lives of people with cancer, Parkinson's disease or organ failure who might be aided by this research.
The experts' group merely proposes an extension to existing UK rules on the purposes for which embryos can be used in research.
I emphasise this is an extension to existing rules and controls in this very, very delicate area.
We must respect the there are deep and genuine public concerns on both sides of this argument and this is what our resolution tries to do.
The British Government has recognised that in its proposal because it will be the subject of a free vote, possibly later this year.
I believe, although it is not my party's government, that the British Government has been measured and considered in its response.
I ask this Parliament to be measured and considered in the way it deals with this important issue.
Mr President, once again we face a fundamental ethical debate on developments in biotechnology as applied to humans.
There are two opposing views in play: the first refuses to turn the human being and more specifically the embryo into a tool and is concerned at the potential risks for human society of the widespread use of certain techniques such as cloning.
The second view considers that the right of those suffering from serious and hitherto incurable illnesses to be able to benefit from the potential of medical research takes precedence over any other consideration.
The British Government, without any prior consultation with other countries - and I emphasise this point - has apparently opted for the second approach, by declaring itself to be in favour of therapeutic cloning.
The idea behind this decision is that therapeutic cloning, that is, the cloning of embryonic cells that are undifferentiated from human embryos available for research and production is a promising way forward.
Even if this idea is well-founded, it is nonetheless true that this option gives human embryos the status of stock cells for medical use and involves the production of embryos, first for research purposes, and then, probably, for production.
I feel that it is extremely important to make two observations at this point.
First of all, I would remind you of the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Bio-Medicine, adopted in Oviedo, in April 1997.
It is probably fair to criticise this convention for its vagueness on a number of points, but in Article 18, it states quite clearly that the production of human embryos for research purposes is prohibited.
There has been consensus on this point throughout Europe until quite recently, but this consensus has just been broken by the position adopted by the government of the United Kingdom.
My second observation is that, according to several experts, and as Mr Busquin, Commissioner for Research mentioned earlier, there are other routes open to respond to the legitimate expectations of those who are suffering from serious genetic illnesses.
In particular, there are routes that do not require the production of embryos by cloning, but which use adult cells.
Why then, given this scenario, should we immediately rush into something that is ethically and socially questionable?
To conclude, I believe that the knowledge that has been acquired in gene therapy could be promising for humanity, but that they are also full of potential risks and are open to serious abuse.
We therefore need a rigorous legal framework and clear legal guidelines.
Upholding the ban on human cloning, rather than establishing it in the first place - I am talking about upholding the ban - is crucial in this respect.
Our Parliament has the responsibility of restating this, not by rushing into anything, but simply by remaining consistent with our earlier positions.
Mr President, two hundred years ago, Doctor Cabanis, a philosopher of the Enlightenment, proposed to dare to reconsider and improve on the work of nature. His idea was that, having demonstrated such great curiosity about how to make the animal races more beautiful and better, how shameful it was to completely neglect the human race, as if it were more crucial to have big, strong oxen than vigorous and healthy people and to have sweet-smelling peaches rather than wise and good citizens.
Mr Cabanis' dream is today close to becoming reality.
His dream has a name: eugenics.
This dream is in fact a nightmare.
This nightmare takes on many guises, each one more monstrous than the last, whether it involves prenatal diagnoses, for example, which serve to destroy embryos affected by Down' s syndrome to avoid the trouble of eradicating the disease itself; whether it involves the production of excessive numbers of embryos that pile up in freezers; or whether, finally, it involves the cloning of human beings.
These embryos are human beings, whose lives are sacred.
They are people.
It is our duty to respect their dignity.
What good are our grandiose declarations on human rights if we then treat human dignity with such scorn, and in the secrecy of our laboratories, at that?
There is no doubt at all that the cloning of human beings would mark the birth of a new form of slavery, in which test tubes take the place of chains and laboratories the place of galley-ships.
Our bleeding hearts will, of course, reproach us for refusing to give scientific research the resources it needs in order to progress and even worse, to cure our illnesses.
I do not accept this form of intellectual terrorism.
Furthermore, I am almost inclined to think that in the minds of all these people, research is nothing but an excuse to conduct experiments befitting a sorcerer' s apprentice.
As the wife of a doctor, I am extremely concerned that such research should be allowed to develop.
In this respect, it would probably be more appropriate to ask scientists to conduct further research into the possibility of obtaining differentiated stem cells for therapeutic purposes, particularly from adult organs.
In order to combat those whose dream is to conquer the mystery of life, we have the right to protect the dignity of all human beings by strictly prohibiting the cloning of human beings.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his speech just now, Mr Fiori made things very clear: he stated clearly that this is a matter of likening religious principles - his own - to the principles of civilisation.
For my part, I believe that what the institutions must affirm is the principle of secularity, and they must confirm that what may seem morally unacceptable to some must not by virtue of this be legally discounted.
We must make the difference between the law and religious principles clear.
If we do not observe this principle, then I fear that there will be no hope for us.
Mr President, to return to the matter in hand, we are aware that, in the face of new ideas - even new ideas which seem promising in terms of treatments for illnesses affecting millions and millions of people - the normal, conventional reaction always kicks in: to ban, to crusade, to shout 'Barbarians!' without even stopping to ask whether the ban can work, whether it would work or whether we are in a position to ensure that it is observed or to monitor it.
It is the same reaction as that which has been aroused by normal social phenomena for a long time now, in matters of abortion, migration or even drugs.
We declare a ban and then we wash our hands of the matter.
It is my opinion, however, that the responsibility of policy-makers - which may be more difficult, more complex - is to regulate certain issues, set limits and avoid situations out of a western.
This is the mandate of the institutions, independently of the religious consciences of any of their Members, where applicable.
It is for precisely this reason that we, the Radicals of the Bonino List, feel that we can just about support the compromise of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
We want to try and reduce the gap between science and politics, to endeavour to govern new phenomena secularly together with the pragmatism of experimentation and successive approximations, without immediately launching into prohibitionist campaigns which we already know to be ineffective.
What we are doing now, exactly as we did in the case of illegal abortion, is merely sparking off, once again, the medical tourism of millions of people who will seek treatment on the black market elsewhere.
What I am saying is extremely serious and fills me with concern. Watch out: when applied to science and social phenomena, prohibition has never worked.
I believe that it is our responsibility to set the limits, or take on board the risk of setting the limits, of successive approximations without trying to impose any ethical principles - in the case of those who have any - or principles of civilisation.
The real civilisation of the institutions is the civilisation of secularity, experimentation and discussion.
Mr President, I must apologise for my absence earlier. I had notified the services that I would be temporarily unavailable.
Mr President, my group disapproves of the decision taken by the British Government on the cloning of human cells.
In our view, it does not take account either of European legislation on this matter or of the opinion that the European Union' s ethics committee is in the process of drafting on the consequences of research in cloning.
We wish to state our support for prohibiting any research into human cloning and we oppose any commercial exploitation of biotechnological inventions that involve cloning.
Having stated these general positions of principle, the debate is only beginning on the attitude we should adopt towards biotechnological research, both in order to fully weigh up its ethical implications, but without running the risk of slowing down work which is likely to bring about improvements in human health.
Given the extremely sensitive nature of these issues, which concern civilisation itself, my group does not wish to see resolutions adopted in haste.
Instead, we have from the outset stated our support for the establishment of a temporary committee on cloning and on biotechnological research so that we can hold the hearings necessary for adopting a position with a full understanding of the issue when the time comes.
This is why my group has not signed any of the compromise motions for resolutions that have been submitted to us today.
At this stage, each of us will speak according to his or her conscience about the principles that I have just stated.
Mr President, in January 1998 we held a debate on the Council of Europe' s Protocol which contained a ban on human cloning.
I then expressed the fear that countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which refused to sign the protocol at the time, were probably not in favour of imposing an outright ban.
This is less than two years ago.
Meanwhile, the British Government would like to permit therapeutic cloning of embryos for research.
I cannot help thinking that the boundaries are forever being extended.
Initially, there was a complete ban; now cloning is allowed on a therapeutic basis but not for reproductive purposes.
As if this would explain and justify everything.
What then is the big difference between therapeutic and reproductive cloning of human embryos?
And what do we do if we are put under pressure soon to apply the research findings in the pharmaceutical field, or to clone for reproductive purposes?
As far as I am concerned, every new human being is a gift of God.
Any form of human life should be treated with respect.
This is also the only way to safeguard human dignity.
The treatment of the human embryo as a consumer article, supposedly justified by the argument that this is in the name of research, fills me with disgust, especially because there are other ways of cloning stem cells.
I do wonder why this option is taken, despite all the ethical concerns which exist worldwide.
I would urgently call on the British Government to reconsider its far-reaching decision and would ask the British Parliament not to back this proposal.
Mr President, a proud man wants to play God.
He refuses to acknowledge that he is only a creature.
He wants to be the creator.
The issue before us today is a battle between creation and man's discoveries.
There are scientists so arrogant today that they are already patenting their discoveries, as if they had stumbled upon their own creation.
Dr William Hesseltine, the chief executive of Human Gene Sciences Inc., has already patented 100 human genes and his company has submitted applications for 8000.
They argue that human cloning is about the promotion of health.
I am arguing today that human cloning is about the wealth of certain scientists and their companies.
Some scientists have taken the lunacy of Hitler's fascism from the battlefield and are prepared to validate it in the laboratory.
Parliament needs to reject this and as a member of the British Parliament I will be voting against it in my own Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group was dismayed to hear of the British Government' s plans with regard to the cloning of human embryos.
Hitherto, all those in positions of responsibility within the European Union were agreed that the cloning of human beings should be rejected out of hand.
During the fifth research framework programme, the Council - inclusive of the British Government - voted unanimously in favour of a form of words that rules out cloning, as well as so-called therapeutic cloning.
Parliament and the Council voted in favour of a text for the Directive on the patenting of biotechnological discoveries that completely rules out cloning of human beings, because this type of technology offends common decency and is an affront to law and order.
Commissioner, over the past few days, a number of articles in the press, as well as your speech, have given rise to some confusion regarding the fifth research framework programme, and especially concerning the Patenting Directive.
The impression has been given that only reproductive cloning is banned.
This is completely wrong.
I was involved in the careful drafting of both texts, and both directives rule out therapeutic as well as reproductive cloning.
Take a close look at the documents, Commissioner, and clarify matters, or else you will have the European Parliament to deal with.
And I do not think that is something you would want.
Now this consensus between the States of the European Union and the institutions has been disrupted by the government of one Member State.
We as a Parliament must withstand this attempt to shatter taboos.
But it is not just a case of making our feelings known, we must also ensure that action be taken as a result.
Hence the PPE-DE Group has called for a strict ban on the cloning of human beings at all stages of their development to be incorporated into the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Finally, I urge the Commission to ensure that there is strict compliance with the fifth research framework programme' s call for no support to be provided for any form of human cloning.
This also means boycotting the cross-subsidisation provided by research institutes in Great Britain.
The best way to achieve this would be to ensure that those institutions involved in the cloning of human beings no longer receive any financial support whatsoever from the European Union.
Mr President, you should listen to the Commissioner!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt whatsoever that biotechnology and genetic engineering are highly significant fields these days.
They will continue to gain in importance in research, and in terms of their many applications.
No one doubts that either.
But is this difficult field, with all the hopes and fears it brings, being handled in a manner that is beyond reproach?
I suspect not.
Today' s debate is positive proof of this suspicion.
As a Parliament, we are reacting too hastily to a legislative proposal in a Member State of the European Union, which caused consternation amongst the public a few days ago.
And what form has this reaction taken?
A quick glance at draft resolutions on the table reveals that all Parliament has been able to do, in its haste, has been to reiterate its already frequently expressed stance on critical fields of research and the application of biotechnology and genetic engineering.
That is all very well, but it is not enough!
We must make biotechnology and genetic engineering, but above all bioethics, one of the European Parliament' s key concerns.
I am not alone in calling for this; I have the backing of my group.
The people of Europe want to see more foresighted commitment from us in this area.
We cannot afford to be overtaken by events any longer.
We must no longer be in the position where - huffing and puffing to catch up - we find ourselves commenting on developments that are already at an advanced stage.
The European Parliament must point the way, so that biotechnology and genetic engineering develop for the benefit of mankind, rather than being to its detriment owing to the transgression of ethical boundaries.
Therefore we should vote overwhelmingly to adopt the proposed committee, which will form the basis for far-sighted legislation.
We must be aware that biotechnology is bound up with what is presumed to be the greatest revolution in medicine and technology.
This revolution must not be attended by irresponsibly conceived legislation.
We must appoint the best experts to advise the Council and ensure that there is consistency in the legislation across the Member States.
The ethical issues and the need to protect human dignity, in particular, are so important that we cannot afford to leave them at the mercy of fragmented, possibly even contradictory pieces of legislation introduced by individual Member States.
We must get to grips with all the ethical issues raised by medicine, technology and science, as a matter of urgency.
The appropriate parliamentary committee must therefore get down to work as quickly as possible.
Our vote will set this in train.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, biotechnology is currently one of the most promising technologies which can bring about a breakthrough in the medical world.
Putting an end to cloning techniques in Europe will only shift research elsewhere, for example to the United States or, in the worst case, to countries whose ethical standards are worse than those in the European Union.
As a result, expertise, research activities and employment will drain away to overseas countries. Furthermore, the products will end up back on the market in the European Union anyway.
What is this really about?
Who are we to deny people the right to recovery?
Would it not be too easy to ban promising technology with great potential on ethical grounds?
Is not every person entitled to health and welfare?
Who has the right to put the label of ethics on it?
I can tell you that I, along with the Liberal Group, will be giving this resolution my wholehearted support.
Mr President, we have the awful situation where one EU Member State permits therapeutic cloning, which we have always been critical of.
The people of the European Union are expecting the European Parliament to take a stance on this.
I think it would be irresponsible if we were draw a veil over the issue by saying: 'just to pacify you, we will set up an interminable debating society, or a temporary committee.'
We must take a stance on this decision, which is to be taken in the course of the next few weeks - yes as soon as that- without further ado, and then of course we must state our position on the issues we can expect to deal with in the future.
But on no account must we gloss over this by failing to make our feelings known and by trying to conceal things in committees, which will disconcert the public.
I believe that what is happening now is of crucial importance.
If we accept therapeutic cloning, then we will be opening Pandora' s box. It would bring the nightmare scenario of cloned and made-to-measure human beings that much closer.
The arbitrary distinction between reproductive and non-reproductive cloning is semantic sleight of hand.
The term 'therapeutic cloning' is equally problematic, because there is no question of it being a therapy.
Cloning, including therapeutic cloning, is the first step along the way to human beings being regarded merely as biological material.
It is indefensible to deliberately - I repeat, deliberately - create life in order to use it as research material.
This conflicts with human rights.
We are also dividing up the concept of human dignity when we deliberately produce embryos in order to have a ready supply of spare parts.
That is why Parliament must use its power to act.
Commissioner for Research, I am also expecting you to make an unequivocal statement today, on how you propose to proceed when a Member State disregards the resolutions of Parliament and the Council.
We need a clear signal, and I feel it would be a sad day for politics if we were to cast aside all our ethical misgivings out of loyalty to Blair.
Mr President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that human cloning which seeks to reproduce a human being similar to another with the sole purpose of improving it must be clearly prohibited.
This has always been this Parliament' s position and I think it is useful to restate this.
Today, however, we are discussing the use of cloning techniques for therapeutic purposes and this has many implications.
These implications are, in themselves, medical.
We must make the distinction between therapeutic cloning, which must be clearly differentiated from reproductive cloning.
Cell therapy today represents great hope for many patients suffering from genetic or degenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s and cancer.
There are also ethical and philosophical implications.
What status does the embryo have?
In order to answer this question, we might refer to the many debates that we have had on abortion or on in-vitro fertilisation.
What is the status of unwanted embryos, produced by in-vitro fertilisation and condemned to be destroyed?
Could they not provide new life?
There are economic and social implications.
This debate concerns the whole of society.
What is the American or Japanese point of view on these issues?
Europe must take a global view and take account of the potential for research offered by therapeutic cloning.
There must be an in-depth debate.
You have called for one and we agree.
Perhaps it would be useful to define in advance what is prohibited and to produce a strict framework for acceptable practice.
Safeguards are crucial.
These issues are viewed differently from one country to another, according to their culture.
This is why the European Union' s action in this field must be guided by major fundamental principles alone.
These principles exist and are: respect for the person, respect for life and for freedom but also for progress that will benefit everyone.
Mr President, cloning and patentability are and must remain illegal wherever human beings are concerned.
There is no difference between cloning for therapeutic purposes and cloning for reproductive purposes.
The end cannot justify the means when human dignity is at stake, for human dignity must be respected above all things.
The use of human embryos to produce organs can therefore in no way be justified.
In fact, when an embryo is used in this way a potential human being is eliminated, which clearly contradicts the value attached to the declared goal of saving other human lives.
It would certainly be a different matter if mere stem cells were to be used rather than embryos.
In our opinion, it is ethically wrong to attempt to alter the nature of the fundamental rules of the origins of life.
We must stop and reflect on the possible implications of upsetting the laws of nature.
The precautionary principle must be invoked and applied to the possibility of cloning for therapeutic purposes.
Indeed, it is no coincidence that the 1998-2002 fifth research and technological development framework programme excludes the financing of projects which involve the cloning of embryos for reproductive purposes and does not provide for funding research into cloning for therapeutic purposes.
In respect for the differences of opinion on the matter, we feel that it is vital to lay down ethical standards based on respect for human dignity in the biotechnology sector.
We call upon the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies to take the risks of going beyond certain limits into due consideration, for once these limits have been passed anything appears legitimate if human dignity is not respected.
I hope that, as President Prodi maintains, Europeans will be able to unite on the basis of common values.
To this end, the Commission must facilitate an open debate aimed at finding the right balance between ethical inflexibility based on the refusal to exploit the human body for commercial ends and the obligation to meet the need for medical treatment.
We call upon the Council to take up the initiative of organising an international convention on the use of live tissue to prevent human embryos being marketed and used for unnatural purposes.
It is important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that we do not create another species of human being in the same way that we appear to be provoking natural and environmental disasters.
Mr President, it is a pity that none of the British delegates who support the government' s stance have taken the floor.
It would have been interesting to hear their arguments too, because I am quite sure that they must have had a few thoughts on the matter .
In Great Britain, it has been permissible, since 1990, to experiment on embryos up to fourteen days old.
I believe this is the next logical step.
Why does Great Britain behave differently to the continent?
That is certainly an interesting question.
The difference obviously does not depend on which government is in power.
It was a Conservative Government before, and now they have a Labour Government, and yet nothing has changed.
Why is public opinion in Great Britain unlike that on the other side of the Channel?
It would be entirely appropriate to discuss this kind of issue during this debate, because we have the privilege of being in the company of delegates from the four corners of the European Union.
That was the first comment I wanted to make.
Secondly, I wanted to say how impressed I was with Mrs Bonino' s comments.
It really struck a chord with me.
I too would advocate that we should allow ourselves to be guided by the laity in matters of principle.
The State is not religious, but it has a duty to respect religion.
I too have respect for whether someone is Catholic, Evangelical, Jewish or whatever.
But I also want my opinion to be respected.
However this is only possible within a lay context.
Claims of infallibility have already done Europe untold damage.
We should endeavour to leave this behind.
No one has a monopoly on ethics.
People who see things differently are ethical too.
Incidentally, we have seen time and again how bans are watered down in practice.
Everyone could cite examples of this.
That is why I am firmly convinced - whatever we decide here - that in a cosmopolitan society performing research from a variety of perspectives, knowledge will out.
At the end of the day, we will have no choice but to deal with this knowledge in a responsible manner by trying to circumscribe it.
Mr Wurtz, a ban on any type of research may be called for, but it would be extraordinarily naÃ¯ve to believe that this ban would be observed.
In the final reckoning, we will have no choice but to lay down boundaries.
I feel as many other people do about this issue.
The thought of embryos being meddled with and experimented on makes my hair stand on end. There are certainly boundaries.
But practical experience has shown me that at the end of the day, it will probably not be possible to do a great deal more than simply circumscribe everything.
There is no need for us to take action at present.
We still have time.
We need to think very carefully about how we are going to proceed in this matter.
We have committees for this purpose, and sometimes reading a good book has its uses.
An important European value that we all, whether lay or religious, purport to share is that any experimentation on a human being should only be for their exclusive and direct benefit.
We depart from that principle at our peril and here we clearly have departed from it.
We cannot experiment on human beings at any stage of their development and we certainly cannot mass-produce embryos for experimentation.
The next stage will be commercial exploitation, which our own bio-patenting directive allows for.
The UK authorities argue that in spite of ethical doubts the cloning of human embryos is necessary because it is the only way to help patients suffering from various diseases.
Many scientists dispute this and recommend more research with adult stem cells to achieve the same results in curing diseases.
Can we not get together and find a way of dealing with stem research without experimenting directly on human beings?
I hope this House agrees that this is a value that Europe was built on.
This is an emotive subject, not least because of the title 'Human cloning'.
Stem cell research would be a less tendentious title. But my purpose is to ask for calm reflection and consideration of the facts and the implications for us the human race, for our health and well-being, for the future of science and the health industry in Europe and, by no means least, for our spiritual well-being.
So let us get some facts straight.
Fact: human reproductive cloning is banned in the UK.
There is no intention to change this and the UK industry has no intention of carrying out human reproductive cloning now or in the future.
The research use of embryonic stem cells is a short-term response to a scientific need to discover ways of reprogramming adult cells.
Fact: stem cell research is tightly regulated under a stringent act of Parliament by the highly respected and rigorous Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.
It would perhaps be a good idea if other Member States were to have something similar.
Fact: there have recently been interesting advances in adult stem cell research, but there still remain significant disadvantages compared with the unique characteristics of embryonic stem cells.
The aim of research in embryonic stem cells is to find ways of using adult stem cells which overcome these disadvantages.
So we come down to the basic dilemma. Is an embryo up to 14 days old a living being with the full rights of a living person or of a foetus?
Rightly or wrongly, the UK and the US legislation have permitted this type of research for ten years and many benefits have resulted.
And after consulting world-wide for many months the Donaldson report recommends extending such research for therapeutic purposes.
The choice is yours, colleagues.
You have to be true to your conscience and your faith but also consider the future well-being of your neighbour.
Caring for your neighbour is also a Christian enjoinder.
He may have Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or diabetes.
Mr President, this is a serious and complex subject, which has been brought to the fore by the British decision.
It should also be pointed out that national legislation on this issue varies enormously, which can lead to uncontrolled practices, but these practices, as Mrs GrossetÃªte said just now, may make us question the value some countries place on the reality of the principle of respect for human life from the embryonic stage, stated in Article 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which forbids the production of embryos for human purposes.
The difference between provisions shows how complex the debate is and raises several questions that merge into one another.
What does respect for life mean?
What does the pre-embryo mean in relation to the embryo?
Do we have the right to authorise research into the embryo for therapeutic purposes?
Where do the stem cells come from?
Should embryos be cloned?
Do stem cells come from foetal tissue as well as from adult tissue?
Do we have the right to create embryos for any purposes other than for life itself?
