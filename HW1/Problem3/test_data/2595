Conquests of this sort have not been allowed to continue.
I could remind the House of the case of East Timor or of the cases of Kuwait and Iraq with which we are so very familiar.
Things turned out differently where China and Tibet are concerned.
It is a case of more than mere conquest, as China has taken over every aspect of Tibetan life by force.
Large numbers of Chinese settlements have been set up in Tibet, and they are of course controlled by the central government.
Tibetans cannot find work in their own country, as all new jobs are reserved for the Chinese.
The national identity of Tibet is being destroyed, and its great historical legacy eroded.
Obviously, such a course of action meant that Tibetâs great religion was first in the line of fire.
This is evident from the treatment meted out to the Dalai Lama, and also from the disappearance of the second most important religious representative, the Panchen Lama, whose fate remains unknown.
In addition, wholesale indoctrination of Buddhist monks and nuns has taken place.
The brainwashing process always concludes in the same way.
Individuals are forced to choose between signing a statement breaking with the Dalai Lama or not returning to their religious communities.
The outcome has been that some 12Â 000 Buddhist monks and nuns have been expelled from their communities.
As the House will be well aware, even possession of an image of the Dalai Lama is a punishable offence.
The intention is to erase him from the collective memory of the Tibetan people.
This is all alarmingly reminiscent of the steps taken in Russia, when Bukharin, Trotsky and others were airbrushed out of photographs.
As to the position that this is an internal Chinese matter and we should not become involved, it brings to mind the arguments adduced by a person being tried for murdering his parents, who pleads with the court for a lenient sentence on the grounds that he is an orphan.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for the opportunity today to make the House once again aware of the issue of Tibet, of which, if there is eventually to be a solution, it must again and again be reminded, particularly at a time when the human rights situation there and in China is increasingly glossed over and ignored out of the desire for improved economic relations.
You mentioned, Commissioner, that the Commission will get involved as and when both parties approach you.
For that, I fear, we will have a very, very long time to wait, for it is not exactly in Chinaâs interest that Tibet and the suppression of its culture be publicly debated and exposed.
It is for us in this European Parliament â and also for all European delegations that travel to China â to spell out the fact that it is Tibet that will â and must â determine whether there is to be more cooperation between Europe and China, both in terms of improved trading relations and of whether or not embargos are to be lifted.
Let the Chinese Government be aware that the latest attacks on Tibetan religion are counter-productive in this respect.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his answer to the question.
As has been quite rightly pointed out, the Tibetans are being denied their most basic political and democratic rights.
What, moreover, we see, and have seen for a long time, is an all but systematic destruction of their cultural heritage and of their ability to practise their religion.
The example given by the Commissioner, namely of monks being imprisoned for having portraits of the Dalai Lama, is just one example of how absurd this oppression is.
As is well known, the EU has expressed this view on quite a number of occasions.
The question is: is this enough?
It would be interesting to hear more about plans for the future.
How is the pressure on China to be increased where the issue of Tibet is concerned?
China is now an economic and political giant which is increasingly also becoming a global player.
There must, however, be no beating about the bush where China is concerned.
The positive economic development is in no way matched by correspondingly positive democratic development.
We see nothing of that at present.
On the contrary, the fact is that Chinaâs economic progress is partly based upon its systematically denying its own workers their most basic rights.
Policy on China is therefore a test of the EUâs credibility on human rights issues.
Economic interests vie with support for Tibetansâ and other Chinese peopleâs political and democratic rights.
That test is one that the EU must pass.
It would therefore be quite absurd to do what is now proposed, namely to lift the arms embargo on China.
That would be to give two different signals at the same time.
There would be oral criticism, but a simultaneous demonstration in practical terms that another type of relationship with China was desired, with little real importance attached to the oppression practised by that country.
The EU must adopt a more consistent attitude.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the House has now raised the issue of Tibet on three occasions within a short space of time, because it is an issue of the utmost importance.
I am also pleased that the European Commission is dealing with it, and I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement.
I would like to make it clear that I cannot accept some of the content of the Commissionerâs statement.
As I understood MrÂ Onyszkiewiczâs speech, he cannot accept it either.
The Commissioner seemed to indicate that this was an internal Chinese matter.
I beg to differ.
This is not an internal Chinese matter, and we are all aware that China violates human rights on its own territory.
As MrÂ Onyszkiewicz said, this is a matter of a nation conquered by China, and I fully agree with him.
Commissioner, you ventured to suggest that a solution compatible with Chinese sovereignty and respect for the rights of the Tibetan people should be sought.
That is a tall order, as there are no limits to the aspirations of the Chinese leadership.
We can only go as far as agreeing to what the Dalai Lama is prepared to consent to, namely that China could represent Tibet in the international arena.
Tibet must run its own internal affairs.
There can be no question of autonomy.
It therefore seems to me that calling for a climate of mutual trust is not the right approach.
What is needed is a change in the Chinese attitude.
The people of Tibet have shown quite clearly that they are acting appropriately and building a climate of trust.
The fact that they have agreed for China to represent them abroad is ample proof of the trust they deserve.
It has to be said that trust is an unfortunate term to use in connection with a conquered and humiliated nation.
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to understand that in conquering Tibet, China identified religion with cultural and national issues.
The Tibetan people are being persecuted on all three counts, and this persecution must be stopped.
Thank you, MrÂ President.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
I want to thank you particularly for allowing me to take the floor.
I had intended to do so on behalf of the Non-attached Members, but I differ from my colleagues in that I wish to thank CommissionerÂ Kallas very much for his statement.
In my view, the European Commission needs to find its own way of dealing with Tibet.
The Commissionâs way is likely to be effective but less dramatic than ours.
I believe the Commission has presented such a policy today and demonstrated the political will to see it through, and I wished to thank the Commissioner for that.
As I see it, the Dalai Lamaâs latest statement, in which he refers to respecting the territorial integrity of China, is very significant.
Another important development is political in nature.
I refer to the Chinese leadershipâs undertaking to engage in the dialogue the Commissioner mentioned.
I believe that even the so-called âstep-by-stepâ policy is effective.
I am convinced that with the support of the House and acting also on its behalf, the Commission will be able to ensure that all the problems previous speakers rightly pointed out are resolved.
Essentially, the Members who spoke before me were presenting a snapshot of reality.
I very much hope that any future snapshot will be entirely different.
It is my earnest desire that the problems referred to today will have faded into oblivion in a couple of yearsâ time.
I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for this statement.
I am often critical of the European Commission, but on this occasion I believe it has taken a step in the right direction.
Finally, I should like to thank the President again for enabling me to speak pursuant to an earlier agreement.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, today is the 46th anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising of 1959 and this year the Chinese Government is marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
The PPE-DE Group supports the middle-way approach for increased Tibetan autonomy or self-government within a united China that is respectful of cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.
This is exactly what the Dalai Lama has reiterated today to be his approach and that of the Tibetan people.
I quote his words of today: 'I want once again to reassure the Chinese authorities that as long as I am responsible for the affairs of Tibet, we remain fully committed to the middle-way approach of not seeking independence for Tibet and are willing to remain within the People's Republic of China.'
I acknowledge that His Excellency Mr Guan Chengyua, the Chinese Ambassador to the EU, stated this morning at the China delegation meeting, in response to a question, that the door is open for the Dalai Lama, especially if he abandons any secessionist activities and recognises that China is whole and indivisible.
It appears to me that the Dalai Lama, and indeed His Excellency the Chinese Ambassador, are singing from the same hymn sheet on this and I would urge them to make progress.
The Dalai Lama accepts the middle way as the only way forward.
He has made that very clear and reiterated it today.
It is also the view of my own group, which passionately supports that way forward.
China has made great economic progress in recent decades and it is now a major player on the world stage, which delights us all.
We see the potential and the enormous contribution that China and the Chinese people can make worldwide.
There still is, as Commissioner Kallas said earlier, a problem in certain areas of human rights.
We should be able to sit down and make progress in these areas.
In China, with a population of 1Âœ billion, the scale of the problem is different, but China has made enormous progress on the economic side.
I believe, with the good will and support of all concerned, China can make the same progress on human rights issues and we want to encourage it to do that.
Tibet, however, is an international treasure and international treasures are not the preserve of any one people.
We want to help the Chinese to preserve Tibet, which has a unique cultural, religious and linguistic heritage.
I say to the Chinese authorities: please preserve it, through the middle way approach, through supporting the autonomous region of Tibet, so that we can all continue to enjoy the heritage of this absolute jewel on the world stage.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like once again to congratulate this Parliament and the Commission on tackling the issue of Tibet.
I believe that this offers us a good opportunity to point out that it is not the Tibetan Government and the Dalai Lama who now have to make a move in favour of Sino-Tibetan dialogue and a lasting and fair solution for the people of Tibet â they have already done so â but rather the Chinese Government in particular.
Within this framework of growing relations with the European Union, I believe that it is important to send a clear message to China that it must respond favourably to the progress in this dialogue and it is therefore very worrying that the possibility of lifting the arms embargo on China is also mentioned.
I believe that this is a serious mistake and that it would not just send an inappropriate message about the European Union's double standards when assessing human rights in the world, but also about our institutional inconsistency, since we should remember that the European Parliament recently adopted a resolution that expressed quite the opposite point of view.
I would therefore insist that to lift the arms embargo on China today, before the situation in Tibet is resolved, would clearly send the wrong message.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am very glad that we are having this debate, for this year marks 23 years since this House, here in Strasbourg, adopted the Habsburg Report on the decolonisation of the Baltic states and asked the UNâs decolonisation sub-committee to take up their cause.
Having at the time been on the rapporteurâs staff, I still remember the counter-arguments to the effect that independence for the Baltic states would never be possible, that this was utopian fantasy, that the Balts possessed no right to self-determination, and so on.
The fact that there are, today, Members and Commissioners from the Baltic states sitting in this House should encourage us not to be deterred from our course where Tibet is concerned.
Tibet is â as has been said here today many times â not only in essence a human rights problem, but much more than that.
There are those who talk of it being a minorities issue, but to do so is to misread the facts.
Tibet is not a minority problem; the problem is that it is a country that has been overrun by colonisers.
China is a colonial power â no more and no less.
If the Chinese want to go on living together with the Tibetans â a possibility to which the Dalai Lama has referred â then it is they who must take the first and crucial step and gain the trust of the Tibetan people â something they can do only by acknowledging and defending their right of self-determination, their own culture and religion and their rights as human beings.
It is only through partnership that integration is possible.
Suppression integrates nobody; it results in disintegration.
That is why it makes such an impact that so many former human rights activists â Milan HorÃ¡Äek, who is sitting here, his former fellow-campaigner VÃ¡clav Havel, many of our Polish Members â are so strong in their support for Tibet, for it is a clear sign that Europeâs freedom and Tibetâs are, in the long run, inseparable one from another, and that freedom is indivisible.
So my thanks go to Mr Thomas Mann and to all the others in our group with primary responsibility for Tibet, for having joined with Members from other groups in securing for us this debate on a current issue before we move on to matters of urgent importance.
The only thing I have to say to the Chinese leadership is that we, in the European Parliament, will not give up until this symbol of a free Tibet that we have set up here can indeed shine forth in freedom, and until the Tibetans can follow their own democratically chosen path.
Â Â  Mr President, I would especially like to thank MrÂ Posselt, who has touched on something that, for obvious reasons, is a serious point.
What he said about the history of my own nation is true.
Along with the rest of Estonia, I am very familiar with the history of Tibet, and with the events of 1959 in particular.
We in Europe have to be concerned at the situation in Tibet, and I am pleased to say that the Commission is keeping this issue high on its agenda.
What can be done?
The Commission is in favour of genuine autonomy and the preservation of cultural, religious and national identity.
We have received some positive signs that the process is going in the right direction.
We have had consultations with representatives of the Dalai Lama and know that there have been consultations between his representatives and the Chinese authorities.
We hope that possible solutions will follow.
In history, large-scale, comprehensive and unanimous peaceful pressure from the free world has brought impressive results.
I am convinced that the European Parliament and the European Commission will again prove powerful driving forces for such pressure.
Â Â  Mr President, I beg permission to raise a matter concerning human rights.
I have sent in letters on the subject.
The human rights problems in Tibet, Belarus and so on are hard to comprehend.
However, that does not mean that we do not have problems in our own countries.
Last week a family with five special needs children had their children taken from them.
That familyâs case had been reported in the national media, exposing the lack of services for their own children and children in general.
In Ireland the services are very patchy and in places very poor, and some families have been told that if they need help the State might take their children from them.
I have had at least six families come to me about this.
The five children involved were supposed to be returned to their parents on Monday, but have not been as yet.
They are autistic and there is no way to explain to them what is happening or that they cannot go home.
They are being damaged for life.
I appeal to the House to talk to the Irish Government about its treatment of people with disabilities and their families.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Belarus(1).
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have a very tough resolution against Belarus before us, but it unfortunately also reflects the grim reality.
The lights are going out in Belarus, and the prospects for development are ever more receding.
I believe that one point could have been emphasised still more in this resolution, namely the oppression of the free trade union movement in Belarus.
This is an important part of the countryâs democratic opposition.
Parts of this movement are now on the way to being crushed by the Lukashenko regime.
Belarus is now a country that is becoming ever more isolated in Europe.
That obviously applies also to its contacts with the EU - a course that has obviously been chosen by the President of Belarus and that thus also affects the Belarussian people.
That is why it is all the more important to show that this policy of isolating Belarus is aimed at those in power in the country and not at the Belarussian people.
What we need now is more contact with the civil organisations in Belarus, the democratic opposition, independent media and the free trade unions that are still fighting against the authoritarian government headed by President Lukashenko.
At the same time, we should perhaps conduct a still tougher policy of sanctions against those who now govern Belarussian society.
There is no alternative.
In countries all around the region, for example in Ukraine and other countries, a process of democratisation is taking place.
Clearly, the day will come when Belarus too is democratised and can be included in further European cooperation.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, last year the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov human rights prize to the Belarusian Association of Journalists.
Today we have a responsibility to European society and the people of Belarus to demonstrate whether we can sustain the high standards set by DrÂ Sakharov and the European Parliament, since the human rights prize awarded in the name of Academician Andrei Sakharov, is a symbol for the victory of the dignity of mankind, intellectual freedom and reason.
Today we must continue what we have begun.
We are responding to the struggle by the Belarussian democrat Mihail Marynich for human rights, by adopting a resolution demanding his immediate and unconditional release as well as that of other political prisoners â that is our responsibility.
Responding to the struggle of the journalists of Belarus for the truth, in our statement we strongly condemn attacks by the Lukashenko regime on the media, journalists and any person who freely expresses their opinion â that is our responsibility.
We are responding to the Belarusian peopleâs fight for the right to belong to the new democratic world by condemning the dictatorial Lukashenko regime â that is our responsibility.
Europe must promote the process of shaping civil society in Belarus, where society is not as inert as is at times thought in Europe.
People want to express their opinions and are ready to do so, and I am convinced that the struggle of the Belarussian people and the leaders of democracy there has earned the most comprehensive EU support â both moral and financial, since the criminal Lukashenko regime is combating them ruthlessly.
Our duty is to call things by their real names.
Today in Belarus there is a form of implementing political, economic and ideological power, a regime known as a dictatorship.
In Minsk the true supreme power, legislative power, executive power and even judicial power belongs to one person â a dictator, who has usurped unlimited, absolute and uncontrollable power and dominion over society and individuals.
I call on the European Parliament and the Council to acknowledge that the current Belarusian regime is a dictatorship and that President Lukashenko is a dictator, and to condemn them.
In the name of Belarussian democracy, I call for a unification of vision and economic power, Europeâs parliamentary experience and the administrative capacity of the Commission.
In order to protect Belarussian democracy, we need a decent shield, not an umbrella.
I call for our common endeavour to begin today!
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
Belarus is a blot on the map of Europe, and unfortunately this blot is becoming blacker and blacker.
Elsewhere, democracy is making headway, even in Arab countries, though the rate of progress is slow and we are not satisfied with it.
In Belarus, however, the situation is worsening.
MrÂ Lukaschenko, Belarusâ , is doing all he can to isolate the country still further.
He recently stated that Belarus ought not to send young people to be educated and study in the West, because anything they learnt there would be of no use back in their home country, especially in view of the political situation in Belarus.
It is hardly surprising that Western knowledge is deemed useless in Belarus, given that the country must be the only country in Europe and perhaps even further afield, where an official state ideology exists.
There are officials everywhere, monitoring compliance with this state ideology and its development.
They can be found in every workplace.
It is therefore crucially important for us to send out a strong signal on this matter.
Allow me to state quite clearly that what is happening in Belarus is not just a matter for Belarus, it is an important matter for the whole of Europe.
Thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the world finds itself in an era in which democratic values are being imposed across the globe.
Of course, none of us can remain indifferent in the face of events in the Middle East, including the major changes in Lebanon, where people are also demanding the right to freedom and democracy.
We very recently had an opportunity here in Parliament to hear the new President of Ukraine drawing attention to the new reality and the major transformation that has taken place in his country.
Against that background it is totally unacceptable for our continent to continue to be blemished by what has already been described, and very appositely, as a dark stain that is becoming darker still with each passing day.
The news from Belarus is really very disturbing.
There is not the least sign of the regime being willing to open up to civil society: quite the opposite, it is stepping up increasingly repressive measures.
I therefore believe that, politically speaking, Belarus has become one of the greatest problems we face within Europe, and in view of the gravity of this situation I believe that we should strengthen our support for civil society in that country in every possible way, and that we should also step up existing sanctions as far as possible.
The dialogue between the European Union and Russia has assumed particular importance in this context.
As we know, one of the most important problems to be discussed as part of this dialogue is conditions in the neighbouring countries which lie between the European Union and Russia, and, as our resolution states very clearly, it is a matter of regret that this point â covered in paragraph 21 of our resolution â has not been taken up by the Commission.
Commissioner, I hope that you will be able to enlighten us on that subject; I regard that as essential.
We will accordingly be supporting this motion for a resolution in the hope that there will be good news from Belarus before the year is out.
I sincerely hope so.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, fortunate and independent countries have a tendency to forget the fate of those not equally blessed.
Tibet was the subject of debate in the House today.
Luckily, Tibet and the Dalai Lama do not allow themselves to be forgotten.
They send out constant reminders of their existence.
I have to say that my countryâs history was equally bitter.
In the nineteenth century Europe often tried to forget that the Polish people existed and had a right to independence.
Only the many Polish uprisings kept the so-called Polish issue alive and ensured Poland was not forgotten.
In more recent history, the world largely forgot about the whole area of Europe that found itself under a Communist yoke after the 1945 Yalta Conference.
Then came 1989, the fall of the Communist regime in Poland, followed by the fall of the Berlin Wall.
I should remind the House that the fall of Communism in Poland preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall.
There followed happy times for Poland.
We now need to realise that what lies beyond the eastern border of the present European Union is not another planet but our own back yard.
When the people of Ukraine claimed their independence, the European Union managed to demonstrate its support.
The same should happen now.
The responsibility for defending the Belarussian nation and its right to genuine independence, rather than a semblance of independence controlled by MrÂ Lukaschenko and his cronies, rests on our shoulders.
It is important to realise that whilst combating his people, MrÂ Lukaschenko is also combating their culture and religion, notably the Catholic religion.
There are many Catholics in Belarus, and Catholicism tends to be identified with independentist and pro-Western tendencies.
The expulsion of Catholic priests has become standard practice in Belarus.
That is why we must offer every support to the people of Belarus as they seek their freedom.
Â Â  Mr President, there is no democracy when people are hunted down and thrown into jail for thinking differently, for then arbitrariness, fear and double-dealing hold the reins.
There are many in this chamber who know what it was like when these conditions applied in our own states.
This is a situation in which we should not shrink back from using the word âdictatorshipâ, for that is precisely what is currently gaining ground in Belarus.
That is precisely the situation in which it is possible for political detainees such as Mikhail Marinitch, Valeri Levonevski and Alexander Vassiliev, as well as Yauhien Afnagel and Professor Yuri Bandashevsky, to cite two topical examples, to have their personal freedoms curtailed.
This is something we have to bring to peopleâs attention, and, here and now, I call on the Council â in its absence â and the Commission to summon the Belarussian ambassadors and give them a political message demanding the immediate release of these political detainees and making it plain that we will not tolerate further detentions on the grounds of the free expression of opinion.
In the same breath, let me reiterate my call to the Commission and the Council to also do something about the disappeared persons and press on with the work that the Council of Europe has begun.
They must set in motion an international inquiry that will at last give the people of Belarus hope when the international community no longer keeps silent in the face of the massive violations of human rights in Belarus.
Â Â  Mr President, when I say 'Belarus' you might react with the all too familiar 'last dictatorship in Europe'.
Indeed, human rights abuses are an everyday occurrence in the EU's new neighbour.
Allow me, however, not to talk directly about human rights abuses in Belarus, but to raise the issue of the European Union's assistance to civil society in that country.
Through the TACIS programme, the EU has allocated EUR 10 million to projects in Belarus in support of civil society and the independent media for the period 2005-2006.
Since that assistance flows through the Belarus Government, it is not efficient and flexible enough to support civil society organisations, the majority of which have already been de-registered for political reasons.
In spite of the Council of Ministers' resolution of November 2004 and the detailed EU action plan for promoting democracy in Belarus, the European Commission insists on using the existing mechanism for support to civil society in Belarus.
Some Member States and the expelled Belarussian community, on the other hand, want to see the creation of a special fund, with more flexible structures, to support non-registered NGOs, which are the most active and important in Belarus but receive no support under the current EU mechanisms.
We must acknowledge the progress made by the European Commission regarding Belarus.
However, the Commission must finally recognise the need for increased support for genuine civil society organisations such as the Belarussian Association of Journalists, laureate of the Sakharov Prize.
I therefore call on the European Parliament to raise its voice in this matter, exert its influence and put adequate pressure not only on the Commission but also on Belarus.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is rare for a motion to be carried unanimously in the European Parliament, but I am convinced this will be the case today, when we vote on Belarus.
I truly believe it could happen.
Rarely do black-and-white situations arise in the international arena or indeed in internal politics.
The situation in Belarus is like a black-and-white film.
Truth and freedom are on one side, and the regime on the other.
I thank the rapporteurs for their motion for a resolution.
I am not sure that it is too severe.
It is appropriate to the current situation in Belarus, which is after all a European country.
This motion for a resolution is a rallying call to the defence of a free, democratic and European Belarus.
The country deserves a better future.
The European Parliament has remembered the political prisoners and the disappeared in Belarus, the closed-down newspapers and educational establishments, whilst emphasising that freedom is indivisible and that freedom does not require a visa from Mr Lukaschenko.
I believe thanks are due to the rapporteurs for this.
In conclusion, I should like to say that as the House defends the cause of Belarus today, it is also defending European solidarity and honour.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, in the Middle Ages, the Lithuanians, the Poles and the White Russians constituted a triple federation, a central European kingdom.
Today, the Poles and Lithuanians are with us, and people talk as if Belarus were on the moon.
I recently received an e-mail from a member of the public who strongly protested at what he saw as our neglect of that country.
Such is not the case; here in the European Parliament, we are giving human rights in Belarus massive backing, awarding the Sakharov Prize to its citizens, holding debates on a regular basis, and really getting stuck in.
That, though, is the impression that the public get as a result of the Councilâs absolute passivity, and, in particular, of the policies adopted by our nation states, whose interest in this issue is â with a few laudable exceptions â quite inadequate.
For these reasons, it is important that we should make it clear that items 3 and 4 in this resolution must be addressed with all speed; I refer to the investigation of the cases where people have disappeared, and the release of political detainees.
I would ask the other groups to lend their support to our amendment, whereby we may be able to do something for young people from Belarus, where, we agree, democracy and the rule of law must be advanced, and the nation states must at last awake from their torpor.
Â Â  Mr President, let me start by saying that I very much share the sentiments expressed in your motion for a resolution on Belarus, about which we share many of the same concerns.
The EUâs goal is to have close relations with all of our neighbours, including Belarus.
We want to see Belarus as a democratic, stable and prosperous country, fully benefiting from our Neighbourhood Policy.
Unfortunately, its government's policies prevent it from taking its rightful place in the family of European nations.
The seriously flawed conduct of the parliamentary elections and the referendum in October 2004, show how far Belarus is lagging behind in terms of democratic development.
It is deeply worrying for us all that democratisation, respect for fundamental freedoms and respect for the rule of law are deteriorating rather than improving, as the regime continues to tighten its grip on democratic forces, the independent media and opposition forces.
In November 2004, following the elections in Belarus, EU foreign ministers adopted conclusions setting out a clear EU policy.
We confirmed the restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with Belarussian authorities, but at the same time sent a clear message to the population that they are not forgotten and that we are trying to support civil society and democratic forces in Belarus.
We are closely monitoring the human rights situation in the country and, as a result, the EU imposed a visa ban last year on certain high-ranking Belarussian officials, on the basis of the findings of the Council of Europeâs Pourgourides report on politically motivated disappearances.
We then extended this visa ban to the officials considered responsible for the rigged election and the referendum, as well as those responsible for the repression of the peaceful demonstrations that followed.
The cases of Mr Marinich and other imprisoned political opponents are of great concern to us.
We believe that his trial was politically motivated and have issued a statement calling for his disproportionate sentence to be reconsidered.
We have serious concerns in general about the independence of the judiciary in Belarus and continue to follow these cases closely.
The EU issued the statement on Mr Marinich's case in January.
As regards your call on the Commission to step up our assistance efforts to Belarus, I am pleased to report that we have already done so in response to the EU Foreign Ministers' conclusions last November.
The Commission is playing the lead role in coordinating and delivering EU assistance in support of civil society and democratisation in Belarus.
A conference will be held in Vilnius next week on that very important subject.
In difficult situations such as that of Belarus, where a country is isolating itself from the world, this is particularly difficult and we are working on the appropriate division of labour between the Community Member States and other donors.
We very much welcome the role that the European Parliament can play in encouraging democratic changes and supporting democratic forces in Belarus.
We are currently carefully examining the action plan which your Delegation for Relations with Belarus has prepared, to see how this can mesh with our own efforts in that regard.
There is much to be done and we look forward to working with Parliament and with the democratic forces inside Belarus.
You raised some questions in your contributions that I should like to answer.
The first was whether Belarus was discussed at high-level meetings between the EU and Russia.
The answer is yes; the issue is always raised during those meetings.
The question of how to channel the funds and how to assist civil society in Belarus financially was also raised.
The main question is the ability of the relevant organisations to absorb the funds.
The Commission is ready to examine all possible ways of supporting Belarussian civil society financially so that the funds can be used efficiently.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Cambodia(1).
Â Â  Mr President, there has, for over thirty-five years, been a great deal of poison in Cambodian politics.
After the French ceased their occupation of the much larger colony formerly known as Indochina, mainly as a result of the war of independence in what is now Vietnam, the Americans, the Russians and the Chinese were ready to bring the smaller new states of Cambodia and Laos into their respective spheres of influence.
Each of those superpowers tried to arm their own satellite movements in those states and bring them to power with military support in order thereafter to permanently eliminate all other forces.
In a sharp reaction to an irresponsible American intervention, power fell into the hands of the Khmer Rouge, a movement that laboured under the illusion that the destruction of the cities and the intellectuals would mean major progress for the poor farming population.
I would remind you that it was this murderous terror regime that the United Nations recognised, rather than the insurgents backed by Vietnam, who wanted to bring it to an end.
The then liberators still have a large following among the people, although they still feel distrusted by the outside world.
On account of its toxic past, Cambodia still finds it virtually impossible to sustain normal coalition governments and a normally functioning parliamentary democracy.
The political parties deny each otherâs right of existence and would ideally like to annihilate one another for good.
This explains how members of the parliamentary opposition can be treated as public enemies and locked up.
Since the rich Western nations have in the past made a considerable contribution to this venomous climate, we have the moral duty to help the Cambodians to break free of it.
Criticism and condemnation are desperately needed, but also the lesson that things could have been done better than the outside world have demonstrated to the Cambodians in the past.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, we as parliamentarians can easily understand the horror and the violence described in relation to the motion for a resolution before us today.
Three of our fellow parliamentarians, Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy and Chea Poch were subjected to loss of immunity in a particularly brutal way, by means of a show of hands, in a parliamentary session â if it can be called that â held behind closed doors, hidden from the public gaze and without any formal record of the proceedings.
Furthermore, one of these parliamentarians was arrested shortly afterwards.
These events struck at the heart of democracy itself, at the very nature of parliament.
One of the targets of this action, MrÂ Sam Rainsy, the leader of his party in fact, had two days earlier written an article in the Cambodia Daily clearly describing the gravity of the situation in his country.
I would like to draw your attention to that situation, ladies and gentlemen.
We need to act resolutely in this case.
It is not the first time that we have had to highlight the serious nature of the situation in Cambodia, and we should call on the Commission, the Council and on the Member States to be particularly clear about this at the forthcoming meeting on 10 and 11Â March.
This issue will, however, also be dealt with at the next meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Committee which will be taking place in Geneva at the end of this month and continuing into April.
A delegation from Parliament will be present at that meeting.
It will be incumbent on us to follow all the debates very carefully, because the report of the UN special envoy, MrÂ Peter Leuprecht, also denounces the very grave situation in that country in the clearest terms.
If I may quote the English expression he used, he called the situation in Cambodia âa chunky faÃ§ade of democracyâ.
That is the extent of the deterioration we are witnessing.
Cambodia, instead of offering us signs of hope and confidence in the future, is doing just the opposite.
The attitude of the regime is hardening and human rights violations are on the increase.
I accordingly suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that we should revisit this subject before the summer recess, once the conclusions of the Geneva meetings are available, and if there has been no significant progress in Cambodia.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to apologise to the Commissioners and fellow Members, because unfortunately, due to my flight schedule, I will be unable to stay until the end of this debate.
I would kindly ask you to forgive me.
Mr Sam Rainsy â Sam being, as you know, his surname and Rainsy his first name â and his wife are very good friends of mine, and so I have first-hand experience of the difficulty of the battle that is being fought.
To give you an example, Mr Sam Rainsyâs party is entitled âSam Rainsyâ because that is the only name that Hun Senâs party did not reject.
All other names he had tried first had been rejected.
This is to give you an idea of that countryâs power mechanism.
What is particularly unfortunate, even more unfortunate than the fate of our three colleagues from the Cambodian Parliament, is the fact that, to date, Cambodia has been one of the poorest countries of South-East Asia, with a society characterised by an unusually high level of crime on a daily basis â violence that is politically inspired, criminally inspired, and in respect of which very little is being done.
What we should not forget either is that despite all fine promises, the Cambodian Government â Mr Hun Sen having, as you know, again become Prime Minister â has not actually made a serious start on bringing to justice those who are most responsible for the mass destruction, the genocide that was committed by the Khmer Rouge, and nor does it seem likely that they will do so in the short term.
It therefore goes without saying that we are concerned about the fate of our colleagues, which other members of the opposition could also suffer.
I would, however, urge you not to lose sight of the fact that the European Union is Cambodiaâs largest donor and that fact alone means that we definitely have levers at our disposal to persuade this awful regime to make changes for the better.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Cambodia is indeed a source of concern.
In supporting this joint resolution on Cambodia by six groups within this Parliament, I should like to emphasise two points, albeit at the risk of going over ground covered by some of the earlier speakers.
The first point which I would like to stress today concerns the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity from three members of the Sam Rainsy party.
The first of these is Cheam Channy, who has also been imprisoned and is set to be tried by a military tribunal, despite the fact that a Cambodian civilian may not be subjected to military justice.
Next there are Chea Po and Sam Rainsy himself, who have both fled Cambodia in order to be able to speak out more effectively on the situation in that country.
It is vital that they should be given back their immunity and thus be able to resume their role as elected representatives, a role conferred on them by the electors of Cambodia.
We would point out that we received Sam Rainsy here a fortnight ago during the February plenary session, on the occasion of the visit of the ASEAN delegation.
At that time, he expressed a desire for some gesture from us.
It was therefore incumbent upon us to make that gesture today.
Secondly, I should like there to be more effective monitoring of the various types of aid provided to Cambodia, as has just been mentioned.
It is inconceivable that, according to the United Nations development programmes, over the last ten years the country should have seen deterioration in three of the key development benchmarks, namely the number of persons living below the poverty line, the adult illiteracy rate and the rate of infant mortality.
There are fears that aid is not necessarily reaching those for whom it was originally intended and that it does not meet the populationâs real needs.
Effective monitoring and control of aid is necessary in that country in order to put a stop to this unfortunate tendency.
The Cambodian Government should indicate its good intentions in terms of the effectiveness of measures taken and implemented in the countryâs interests and should explain, in particular, the purpose to which European aid has been directed.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by withdrawing parliamentary immunity from three opposition members of parliament â including our friend Sam Rainsy, whom a number of us have met â who had drawn attention to what was currently happening in Cambodia and had denounced the gangrene of corruption in their country, Cambodia has once again shown itself to be a very inadequate democracy indeed, in which autocracy imposes an arbitrary governance on political, social and economic life.
We must bear in mind, as our colleague has just pointed out â and it is important that people are aware of this â that, despite the five billion dollars in international aid received during the last ten years, Cambodia is nonetheless the only country in the world where illiteracy, infant mortality and the number of people living below the poverty line are still on the increase.
As the UN and World Bank have emphasised, those exercising political power are misappropriating international aid, the countryâs resources, leaving the Cambodian people in a state of abject poverty.
The donor countries â including ourselves â share the blame for this situation because there is no control of the true recipients of the aid, and a regime, known for its corruption and authoritarian excesses, is not being called to account.
Finally, what can we say about the peasants expropriated for the benefit of a Chinese company which, like other companies, is unscrupulously laying waste to entire hectares of forest?
Since 1993, 50% of the Cambodian forest has been destroyed with the complicity of a corrupt government.
It is time that the European Union began supporting those really engaged in the fight against corruption and striving to establish the rule of law and compliance with democratic principles, by, for example, making aid conditional upon respect for democracy, human rights and the environment.
Finally, let us force the Cambodian Government to do what is the duty of every democratically elected government, namely to respect and support democrats.
Â Â  . Mr President, during the difficult period in which Cambodia made a new beginning after dictatorship and the rampages of the Khmer Rouge, it was Son San, the president of its parliament, who became a driving force for freedom and democracy.
He was a frequent visitor here in Strasbourg and an impressive partner to this House.
It is therefore all the more terrible that the attempt is now being made to silence the Cambodian Parliament and its great democratic tradition, using intimidation and terror initiated by the Prime Minister.
Let me say that Sam Rainsyâs visit a fortnight ago was entirely in the tradition of the visits made by the campaigner for freedom Son San, and that Sam Rainsy deserves our wholehearted support, for without a functioning parliament, all the efforts undertaken in Cambodia by the UN and the international community will have been in vain.
Despite the great deal of money and the efforts by the international community that have been invested in Cambodia, we face the prospect of yet more general wreckage if we do not succeed in putting a stop to its governmentâs authoritarian tendencies and strengthening the democratic forces and parliamentary life.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Union has been in support of Cambodiaâs democratisation process since 1992.
We have always assumed that Cambodia would make gradual progress on the road to democracy, but patience is now, of course, wearing thin.
In the past year, the situation in Cambodia has taken a dramatic turn for the worse, the latest low point being the witch hunt against three members of the opposition, including the brave Sam Rainsy who was here two weeks ago.
Good though it was to see him here, it would have been better if he had not been here and had simply been able to fulfil his opposition role in Phnom Penh.
You need not take my word for it, because in the next few days, the UN envoy to Cambodia, Mr Peter Leuprecht, will be presenting his findings to the United Nations.
His conclusion is simply depressing.
In his four years as envoy, hardly any progress has been made.
The European Union, the Commission and the Member States have now spent a total of EUR 1 billion on the office in Phnom Penh, observation missions during elections, financial support for mine-clearing operations, and suchlike.
Should we not conclude that the EU policy has simply failed?
We should be able to say so.
In my view, the time for compromise is over.
If the Cambodian Government does not soon respect the basic principles of democratic rule of law, such as transparency and accountability, we must suspend our support.
What is, in any event, called for is a drastic reorientation of our support.
Â Â  Thank you.
Several years have elapsed since the end of the conflict in Cambodia, but the situation within that country continues to give rise to concern.
The House was recently moved to debate violations of human rights in Cambodia along with the unacceptable treatment of women and children that constituted an affront to their human dignity.
The group in power was elected in so-called free elections.
It has no concept of a state, and is either unable to engage in dialogue with the opposition or does not wish to do so.
Twenty people died during the first local elections alone, and those in power did not allow the opposition access to the media.
Many activists are now under arrest.
Those who were arrested in the past remain in prison, and no sentence has been passed on them.
Obtaining statements by force or through bribery is an everyday event.
Corruption is widespread.
These are all features of political life in Cambodia and of how the system of justice operates there.
The attitude of the Cambodian Ministry for cults and religion is significant.
It recently issued an edict banning the missionary activities of Christian churches, which led to anti-Christian protests.
Religious discrimination, restrictions on the right of assembly and freedom of speech, threats and intimidation by political leaders all amount to serious infringements of the nationâs and the individualâs right to freedom.
We therefore appeal for respect for human rights, an end to persecution and to the intimidation of human rights defenders.
We also support the European Parliamentâs resolution.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the people of Cambodia have suffered extensively for many decades from the catastrophic effects of a totalitarian government and high-level official corruption.
At present, those in the country who have fought endlessly for justice and reform are once again under severe government-led persecution.
They include the three opposition leaders, Sam Rainsy, Chea Poch and Cheam Channy, whose parliamentary immunity was recently lifted for obvious political reasons and using dubious and groundless proceedings.
In passing this resolution we, the representatives of the European people, want to convey a strong and clear message to the autocratic rulers in Phnom Penh and to those who support them that the friends of Cambodia will not turn a blind eye to the ongoing attempts to eliminate the democratic opposition in that country.
They will continue to support wholeheartedly those pluralistic political forces that are fighting for reform, democracy, freedom of expression and social justice.
Â Â  The Commission has been following with concern the events relating to the lifting on 3 February of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Sam Rainsy, the leader of the Cambodian opposition Sam Rainsy Party, and two other members of the National Assembly.
The Commission believes these events could further weaken the opposition and risk jeopardising the continuation of the democratic process in the country.
Commission representatives in Brussels have also recently met MrÂ Rainsy, who briefed them on the recent developments.
The Commission strongly supported the issuing of an EU declaration on the subject and I can inform you that the EU declaration was brought to the personal attention of the Prime Minister by the local representative of the EU presidency.
The Commission is raising its concern over these issues in its political dialogue with Cambodian authorities, for instance at the EC-Cambodia Joint Committee meeting to be held later this year.
I can also assure you that, in all its co-operation activities in Cambodia, the Commission attaches the greatest importance to democracy, good governance and respect for human rights.
I take this opportunity to call upon the political leaders in Cambodia to work constructively together to find an appropriate solution to this problem, so as to enable Cambodia to continue its progress on the road to a fully functioning democracy.
At the same time, I would like to assure this House that the Commission will continue to follow these events closely, through its delegation in Phnom Penh and with the missions of EU Member States in Cambodia.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Saudi Arabia(1).
Â Â  Mr President, it is good that we should have today a joint resolution focussing attention on the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia.
On the Arabian peninsula, just as in certain Swiss cantons, it is women who have fundamental rights denied them.
It was as recently as the 1970s that Saudi Arabia held its first local elections, in which women were denied the vote â and, as I was able to see for myself when our Gulf States delegation went to the local elections in Riyadh at the beginning of February, they still are.
What double standards, though, do we find among the Member Statesâ Heads of State or Government?
On the one hand, they do â occasionally and quietly â make critical comments about the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia.
On the other, business is booming, particularly in armaments.
Yet again, alas, Germany leads the field in this respect.
The statements made by the German Federal Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, on his visit to Saudi Arabia, speak volumes.
He described Saudi Arabia as a country with enormous potential and vast financial resources.
It is therefore hardly surprising that his visit saw every kind of arms deal being done â deals that certainly do nothing to make the region more peaceful and will do nothing to improve the human rights situation there.
I favour a general ban on Member States of the European Union exporting weaponry, not only to China, but also to Saudi Arabia.
Let us do away with double standards and stop exporting armaments.
Something else I want to address is the position of workers who are not Saudi nationals.
People in EU diplomatic circles said that the term âslaveryâ struck them as a description of the situation of such workers in Saudi Arabia.
The situation of non-Saudi workers in Saudi Arabia is a fundamental issue, and one that this House really will have to debate.
Â Â  Mr President, the first ever nation-wide electoral process in the history of Saudi Arabia is under way, with the local elections in Riyadh completed last month and continuing in the rest of the country until April.
Riyadh had an 82% turnout of men only, even though the Saudi Arabian electoral law states that citizens are eligible to vote.
The authorities have declared that women will be entitled to vote in the future.
I acknowledge that last October they ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination on all Forms of Discrimination against Women.
Those elections were witnessed by a delegation of the European Parliament and I wish to thank the authorities for the kindness and hospitality extended to all its members.
I favour a substantial strengthening of EU-Saudi relations and urge the EU institutions to increase our presence in the region.
I welcome the enactment of new codes of judicial procedure and criminal procedure and the establishment of a standing committee to investigate complaints of torture and a national programme to eliminate poverty.
I hope these very positive moves will translate into practice on the ground very soon.
I know that centuries of cultural and religious practice separate the EU and Saudi Arabia.
However, I must urge the Saudi Arabian authorities to lift the restrictions on women's freedom, including the prohibition to drive, to work, to hold public office â restrictions on their very legal personality.
While countering terrorism and fundamentalism is essential, we must at the same time safeguard basic human and civil freedoms.
I would also urge more tolerance in relation to religious freedom.
I look forward to very fruitful relations continuing between the EU and Saudi Arabia.
I am particularly concerned here as a woman and a public representative of a small country that up to 30 years ago had prohibitions on women's rights in many areas; women were not even allowed to work once they got married.
We have come a long way.
We do not always get it right in our part of the world, but let us look at the women's issue in Saudi Arabia and move ahead on that together.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, a country that in the 21st century does not allow women to exercise their voting rights, surely cannot be included on the list of the world's democracies.
A country that in the 21st century treats women socially and politically the way that Saudi Arabia does, unquestionably cannot be regarded as a civilised nation.
Such a country should have been subjected to the most fierce international pressure and total isolation until drastic reforms were urgently brought about.
Yet we Europeans, who pride ourselves on being the guardians of human rights and the defenders of gender equality, do nothing more than pass semi-polite, mildly reprimanding resolutions which we know for sure will have not the slightest impact.
At the same time, we continue through lucrative trade and defence contracts â some Member States more than others â to fully support the dictatorial regime in power in Saudi Arabia.
It is shameful.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the visit to Riyadh and Jeddah by the Delegation for relations with the Gulf States was extremely useful, both in terms of increased collaboration between the European Parliament and countries such as Saudi Arabia, which are vital for Middle East stability, and in terms of improved understanding between different cultures and religions.
We met many representatives of the political and economic world, of the media and of what is termed âcivil societyâ, although that does not currently exist as such in Saudi Arabia, due to the ban on associations and the establishment of political parties.
We were in the Saudi capital during the week of the first elections, which were only held on a municipal level but which represented a first small step towards the necessary political and social reforms.
However, the exclusion of women from the vote cast a dark shadow over the credibility of the entire process.
We reminded all our contacts that it was unacceptable to deny women the right to vote.
We repeated the same message to the Prince Regent, Abdullah, himself, who appeared to concur but replied that it would take time.
In the meantime, a few days ago, the statement by the Saudi Foreign Minister was released, announcing that women would take part in the next elections.
We therefore remain confident that words will be followed up by action.
Women today represent a vital driving force in the development of the much-hoped-for democratic institutions.
Many of them are cultured and well-educated and have responsible roles in various sectors of society.
Persons we met who are active in promoting womenâs interests are trying energetically and tenaciously to make women more aware of their rights.
It is obvious that much still has to be done in terms of respect for the rights of women and for civil and, above all, human rights in general, including those of the numerous foreign workers operating in the country.
Today, the country is faced with conflicting demands from those seeking greater openness for Saudi society and those who prefer to maintain the .
However, the impression is that it will be difficult to turn the clock back.
Everyone we met emphasised the Saudi commitment to the fight against terrorism and religious fundamentalism, which, as we know, has found a disturbingly fertile breeding-ground in the country.
We should stress that a constant theme, and one which, I believe, deserves our support, was the request for closer relations between Europe and Saudi Arabia, with the aim of achieving the shared goals of peace, stability, political reform and economic cooperation.
In particular, we need to give joint support for efforts to eliminate the causes of terrorism and put an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Additionally, Saudi Arabia is insistently asking the European institutions to increase their presence in the country and to strengthen economic and commercial ties.
I believe it is vital to intensify contacts on all fronts, particularly in this sensitive transitional phase.
One final point to bear in mind is that even the most reformist of the Saudis are asking us in the West not to impose our model of society and democracy and to give them the necessary time to take action, even if this does not always match our expectations.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the municipal elections in Saudi Arabia do indeed represent a significant step forward in terms of the political reforms that country is undertaking; we should acknowledge this just as it is acknowledged in the resolution we are presenting today.
Nevertheless, the fact that women quite literally suffer segregation and have not been able to vote or stand for office is a blatant anachronism.
Women suffer incomprehensible and unacceptable restrictions in terms of freedom of movement â they are not even allowed to drive â work opportunities, legal personality and legal representation in judicial processes.
Furthermore, the precarious conditions suffered by the immigrant population as a whole is to be regretted, and in this case too, women are particularly affected.
If Saudi Arabia wants to be recognised internationally as a modern state that respects human rights, it must, as a minimum, respect the rights laid down in the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, to which â I would remind you â Saudi Arabia is a contracting party.
In particular, Article 7 of that Convention states that the contracting parties must take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of the country, and in particular they must guarantee womenâs right to vote in all elections and to be elected, and also to participate in the creation of State policy and its implementation.
In the recent municipal elections, this article has clearly not been complied with.
Furthermore, we should remember that, according to Amnesty International, at least 31 people were put to death during 2004.
We must therefore once again call for the abolition of the death penalty, as the European Union has been doing for a long time.
It is important to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia, and this offers an opportunity for both parties to contribute to greater understanding between peoples and cultures.
Nevertheless, precisely in the interests of these good relations, Saudi Arabia should not be another example of the double standards sometimes shown by the European Union when considering democratisation and respect for human rights in the world.
The credibility of the European Union is once again at stake.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it is impossible to avoid feeling a mixture of both encouragement and regret following the first local elections in Saudi Arabia.
Encouragement, because these elections are a first significant step towards the political democratisation of that country.
We must give our clear support to this process, because the act of choosing between different voting slips and then placing them in the ballot box constitutes an undoubtedly positive social development for the Saudi people.
However, not everyone was entitled to make this gesture, which is something I regret profoundly.
Although this election was based on universal suffrage, women were deprived of this right in Saudi Arabia, just as they are deprived of other rights, such as the right to drive.
Our Parliament sent a delegation to these elections, and our fellow MEPs on the spot did not fail to point out how surreal this situation appeared to them and emphasised that it cannot last.
Fortunately, we are not alone because, I am pleased to say, senior Saudi figures have publicly expressed their determination to see this situation change.
While globalisation can involve threats and risks, it is also a way of obtaining an exceptional degree of openness towards others.
In the age of the Internet and satellites, no society can remain cut off and unaware of the need to respect the universal dignity of both men and women.
I hope this message will also be heard in Riyadh.
Without, naturally, wishing to give lessons in democracy, there is still much that has to be said about the situation in Saudi Arabia in terms of respect for religious freedom or the huge challenges represented by the fight against terrorism in the region.
However, I would like to end on a positive note: our political dialogue with the Saudi authorities must remain calm and cordial, but it must also be frank.
Let us have the courage to face up to the real problems and find solutions to them!
Â Â  Mr President, the European Commission thanks Parliament for bringing forward this resolution on Saudi Arabia.
It is a well-drafted and balanced resolution, which has the merit of pointing out the positive and less positive aspects of the Saudi elections and the on-going reform process.
The Commission also welcomes the visit to Saudi Arabia by the European Parliament's Delegation for Relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and encourages it to pursue its efforts.
The Commission shares Parliamentâs view on the need to promote a substantial strengthening of EU-Saudi relations.
In June 2004, the European Council adopted an EU Strategic Partnership for the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
That document reflected EU political will to intensify efforts to resolve conflicts, ease tension, build trust, strengthen governance and improve the lives of the people living on the shores of the Mediterranean and in the Middle East, and not least to address the situation faced by women in some of these countries.
Our current EU-Gulf Cooperation Council Agreement and our future Free Trade Area Agreement - which will include human rights as an essential element - will remain the framework for our cooperation.
However, we will be further developing our relations with each Gulf country according to its particular needs, capacities and will to move towards.
The European Unionâs determination to promote both stability and change throughout the region is at the core of this process.
Indeed, we must pursue stability through change and reform: political and economic reforms are needed for the regionâs development and the well-being of its peoples.
The Commission, as you know, is keen that an initiative for reform should come from within the region itself.
This requires that the region speak out clearly in favour of political, economic and social reform.
Whilst reforms cannot be imposed from the outside, they can be encouraged.
For example, the EU should encourage the Saudi Government to accelerate the pace of reforms that contribute towards womenâs empowerment.
The EU will continue to raise such issues in its official contacts with the Saudis, not least at the next EU-Gulf Cooperation Council ministerial meeting to be held in Bahrain on 5 April.
In addition, Saudi Arabia has now been included as one of the countries on which the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights can focus.
That means we will assess initiatives from NGOs willing to support the efforts made in the region.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
Â Â  We will now move to the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, can I just point out that the versions in some languages do not list the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as having signed the resolution? That of course we did, and we support it wholeheartedly.
Â Â  Yes, it is clearly from six political groups, Mr Posselt, and that includes the PPE-DE Group.
Â Â  Mr President, with the agreement of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I should like to amend the wording of the new paragraph 2a to read: '... calls on the Saudi Arabian Government to lift restrictions on women's free movement (including the to drive) - there is a change of word there -, on employment opportunities, on their legal personality and on their representation in judicial process'.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 10 March 2005.
Â Â  I would like to begin by welcoming Monsignor Rallo, the Vaticanâs special envoy to the Council of Europe, to the diplomatic gallery on behalf of the European Parliament.
Â Â  The final version of the agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 7 April pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
No amendments have been proposed.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed that the Commission make a Statement on illegal imports of BT 10 maize into the European Union.
The author of the proposal, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, has the floor.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the fact is, then, that Syngenta has been bringing genetically-modified maize into Europe for several years â whether mistakenly or deliberately cannot be determined.
The American authorities knew of this some time before reporting it to us; they allowed the matter to drag out, and it is only now that the Commission has been informed.
I would very much like the Commission to tell us to what extent we can expect these procedures to be properly monitored in future.
That is something that should be explained to us.
Â Â  Does anybody wish to speak in favour of the proposal?
Nobody.
Does anybody wish to speak against?
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is a worthwhile initiative, but we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats think it would be preferable to have a discussion with the Commission, within Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, so as to follow the usual procedures and give that committee the responsibility for dealing with this issue.
If I may say so, doing so would be entirely with the agreement of the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, MrÂ Florenz.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote on the proposal of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to include a Commission statement on illegal imports of BT 10 maize into the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the closeness of the result and Mrs GrossetÃªteâs statement lead me to assume that, once the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has dealt with this issue, it will come before the House as a whole.
Â Â  Of course.
A point of order.
I am not going to ask you which Rule you are invoking, because I have not asked Mr Swoboda either, but please tell me what it consists of.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to make it known that I voted against the proposal, but unfortunately did not use an electronic card to do so.
I should like this to be recorded.
Â Â  You will be aware that, in order to vote electronically, the card must be inserted.
By definition, it is not possible to vote electronically without a card, and there is no way I can know who has a card and who does not.
I cannot see whether or not you have a card. It is the computer that counts the votes.
Your vote has obviously not been counted if you did not have a card.
I am very sorry.
No amendments have been proposed.
We have received two proposals relating to the items included in the debate on cases of violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
On the one hand, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the item on Bangladesh be replaced by the issue of Burma.
And on the other hand, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that the item on Lampedusa be replaced by the issue of Burma.
We shall vote first on the request of the Socialist Group.
If it is accepted, the request of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will lapse.
Does anyone wish to explain the request of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, our request is quite clear: we are asking to replace the item on Bangladesh with the item on Burma because we believe the situation in the latter country is more urgent.
I do not think that the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia itself hopes for a resolution on Bangladesh at the moment, whereas Parliament ought to adopt a stance on Burma.
Â Â  Does anybody wish to speak in favour?
Mr Salafranca.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I simply wished to say that the request of the chairperson of the competent delegation, Mrs Gill, is very reasonable, since it would allow this urgent debate to be delayed until a later sitting, giving the competent delegation time to meet, and that my group would be prepared to support it provided that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports another reasonable proposal that we have made: that contained in the urgent resolution calling for Lampedusa to be dealt with on a later occasion, giving the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs the time to carry out a mission on the ground, as it has decided to do in principle.
Mr President, I would like to hear the Socialist Groupâs views on this.
Â Â  You are in favour with conditions, but I am not now going to ask the Socialist Group in the European Parliament whether it accepts your conditions, because that would be tantamount to a negotiation in plenary and I do not believe that to be appropriate.
Does anybody wish to speak against?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to stress that for some weeks now we have been trying to bring the issue of Bangladesh â a country where internal tensions are running very high â to the attention of this House and of European public opinion in general.
I would also argue that, even though the Chair of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia is against it, that does not mean that the situation in that country does not need debating urgently.
The rationale seems rather specious to me, and so we are in favour of keeping this item on the agenda.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote on the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to replace the item on Bangladesh with the issue of Burma.
We shall proceed to the vote on the request of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to replace the item on Lampedusa with the issue of Burma.
The item on Lampedusa shall remain on the agenda.
No amendments have been proposed for the sittings of 27 and 28 April.
Â Â  The first item we are going to deal with is the requests for one-minute speeches from Members.
I shall deal firstly with those Members who have taken the trouble to inform the Presidency in advance of their desire to speak and of the issue on which they wish to speak.
I shall alternate speeches according to the groups of the speakers.
Mr de Grandes Pascual has the floor first.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in this very same plenary sitting the European Parliament will demand that Bulgaria and Romania will without fail offer guarantees of the clear separation of powers in their legal systems, with unequivocal independence for the judiciary, so that they may be fully integrated into the European Union.
At the same time, the European Union is in the process of ratifying a Constitutional Treaty for Europe, which enshrines the separation of powers as an essential element of its constitutional architecture.
Within this context, it saddens me to have to condemn the regressive attitude of Spainâs Socialist Government and its direct attack on the independence of the judiciary.
Â Â  One moment please, Mr De Grandes.
You may leave the Chamber if you wish.
Those who wish to leave the Chamber may do so, but please do not use the corridors as a place for chatting, thereby preventing the sitting from taking place normally.
Leave the Chamber if you like, but please do not chat in the corridors.
Go ahead, Mr De Grandes.
Â Â  Thank you for allowing me to speak, Mr President.
The facts are blatantly clear: Mr RodrÃ­guez Zapateroâs government has carried out a reform of the organic law on the judiciary, breaking the pre-existing pact on the judiciary, changing the rules half way through the mandate of the General Council of the Judiciary and preventing any judicial appointment from going ahead without the political green light from a blocking minority taking their orders from the government.
Merits or qualifications making people suitable for a judicial post will no longer be relevant, but rather solely their affinity with a political minority.
The situation is one of deadlock, and the Councilâs task of filling vacancies for judges and magistrates has been paralysed.
It is so scandalous that some distinguished candidates have given up their legitimate aspirations, ashamed of the horse-trading that the negotiations on appointments have become.
On taking power in the 1980s, the Socialists emphatically proclaimed âMontesquieu is deadâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to inform the House that a project has been approved and is being implemented in Thessaloniki, with European Union funding, for the construction and equipping of a sports and cultural centre with enhanced accessibility for disabled persons, by the non-trading, non-profit-making company Adapted Physical Activity Cultural Development Centre 2000, with the participation of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and the municipality of Thermaiko.
The Greek state and the competent construction agency, the Thessaloniki county council, however, suddenly suspended completion of the centre for no apparent reason and refused to pay the rest of the money budgeted for it.
Although all the legal procedures provided for were complied with on the part of the agencies involved, the Greek state, as one of the implementing agencies, is jeopardising overall progress in the project and is depriving disabled athletes and the rest of the town from accessing, participating in and contributing to the cultural and sporting product being manufactured.
I wish to emphasise that no bureaucracy is authorised to ...
Â Â  When Parliament voted on the Budget, it voted against the proposal to set aside EUR 1.5Â million for the Youth World Event.
By all accounts, the Commission now intends to grant that amount after all.
Having already written to you on this very subject, I should like you to ascertain from the Commission whether that is the case, what criteria the Commission is applying and why the Commission is unwilling to accept Parliamentâs decision.
Â Â  â I wish to express my concern regarding the guidelines for applying the safeguard clause to the textiles and clothing sector announced by the Commission on 6Â April.
Quite apart from the delay in drawing them up, these guidelines contain constraints and procedures that may complicate and hold back the activation of the clause, thereby preventing us from providing the much-needed immediate response to a situation so serious that thousands of companies and jobs are at risk.
The Commission appears to have confirmed that it wants these guidelines to block, rather than facilitate, the application of those safeguard measures, as Commissioner Ferrero Waldner made clear in the debate in this House.
We wonder what the consequences of this will be.
In light of the reported sharp rise in requests for export to the EU, measures to defend the present and future of this important sector should have been taken long ago, such as implementing, at the earliest opportunity, the safeguard clauses provided for in the trade agreements.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to pay tribute before this House to the Holy Father John PaulÂ II.
He was accompanied on his final journey by the millions of believers and non-believers who paid their respects in Rome, as well as by countless others throughout the world who followed events in the media.
Through his intimate union with God, and in keeping with his motto, , Pope John PaulÂ IIâs actions showed us Godâs will in shaping civilisation, life and love.
In his roles as priest, bishop, cardinal and pope he defended life from conception to natural death, as well as the dignity and rights of every individual and of entire nations, whilst reminding us that democracy without values can quickly turn into open or disguised totalitarianism.
The Holy Father John PaulÂ II reminded us that only a Europe that rediscovers its Christian roots, instead of doing away with them, will be able to rise to the great challenges of the third millennium.
These challenges include peace, dialogue between cultures and religions and the safeguarding of creation.
Let us pray to God for the Holy Father, and also for a united Europe of fatherlands rooted in Christian values.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to the Global Security Fund, set up in the early 1990s under the auspices of Jacob Rothschild.
This is a Brussels-based fund and it is no ordinary fund: it does not trade, it is not listed and it has a totally different purpose.
It is being used for geopolitical engineering purposes, apparently under the guidance of the intelligence services.
I have previously asked about the alleged involvement of the European Unionâs own intelligence resources in the management of slush funds in offshore accounts, and I still await a reply.
To that question I now add another: what are the European Unionâs connections to the Global Security Fund and what relationship does it have with European Union institutions?
Â Â  MrÂ President, in the course of International Womenâs Day on 8 March in Istanbul, there was a violent demonstration in which the police used force to disperse the women.
At the same time, a European delegation was present in Turkey.
I think it ought to have packed its bags immediately.
Sometimes, actions speak louder than words.
I voted in favour of Turkeyâs admission.
I want the Commission to be appropriately firm in ensuring that Turkey complies with the rules we would impose.
Â Â  â Mr President, in June 1995, the Turkish National Assembly adopted a motion authorising the Turkish Government to take all the necessary measures, including military measures, against Greece should Greece, exercising its sovereign right, extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles, as provided for in the International Convention on the Law of the Sea.
A few days previously, the President of the Turkish National Assembly proposed the lifting of the .
Nonetheless, a few hours later, both the Turkish Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs restored it.
I believe that, as President of the European Parliament and with the sensitivity for which you are renowned, you should take an immediate initiative and send a mission on this question to the President of the Turkish National Assembly and to the political parties, in order to get this historic anachronism lifted in a country which wishes to accede to the European Union and on which the European Parliament passed a positive resolution in December 2004.
We have every interest in strengthening the credibility, the visibility and the efficacy of the European Parliament.
Â Â  I shall take note of your comments, Mr Beglitis.
Parliamentâs services will study it and we shall take any necessary action.
Mr De Rossa.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to raise my concern that the Irish Government is not fully respecting the minimum legal and humanitarian standards for the reception and processing of immigrants and asylum seekers that have been established by the European Union.
On 14 March this year, the police took into custody 35 Nigerians, including men, women and children.
Police raided schools to arrest children for them to be deported; they deported parents without children who could not be found; and deported one young man who was within a few weeks of completing his Leaving Certificate â a very important examination in Ireland because it grants admission to Irish universities.
The extraordinary thing is that the Irish Government has now had to reverse its decision to deport that young man and, having declared that it regrets making a mistake, has now issued him with a six-month visa.
I firmly believe that the Irish Government is in breach of European Union standards in relation to transparency in complying with humanitarian law, and the minimum standards that we have set down.
So I would ask you, MrÂ President, to request that the Commission carry out an investigation into this matter and report back to this House.
Â Â  Mr President, a twenty-year-old Turkish woman suffering from leukaemia will soon die unless she is given a bone marrow transplant from a compatible donor.
Cyprus has one of the largest bone marrow transplant banks in Europe.
Two Greek Cypriot donors have been found and are available to donate their bone marrow to the Turkish patient.
Unfortunately, the Turkish authorities are putting various politically-based obstacles in the way of the transfer of the bone marrow graft from Cyprus to Turkey.
Mr President, would you, as a matter of urgency, use your good offices to contact the Turkish Government in order to urge them to assist in this humanitarian issue and prove that the fight against cancer has no boundaries in Europe.
Â Â  I shall take account of your request.
Parliamentâs services will advise me and we shall take any necessary action.
Mr Tannock has the floor.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to protest at the decision of Mr Berretta, the chief executive officer of Eutelsat, to discontinue the contract for New Tang Dynasty Television, a US-based global channel that is the only free uncensored Chinese-language broadcaster to reach mainland China, much to the anger of the Communist government there.
This termination allegedly followed commercial threats by the Peopleâs Republic of China to withdraw the Beijing 2008 Olympic TV broadcasting contracts.
The EU, although understandably eager to trade with China, must not compromise on its commitment to fundamental human rights, which include freedom of expression and conscience and access to a free media.
The matter is currently before the French courts, but I am sure that this House will join me in asking the President of this Parliament to write to Eutelsat demanding a full explanation of why it is breaking its own charter committed to upholding media freedom.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the whole world has heard that President Mugabeâs ZANU-PF Party won the parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe with an overwhelming majority, but no one is labouring under any illusions, because it is common knowledge that those elections were far from free and fair.
They involved intimidation and terror by Mugabeâs followers, as well as electoral fraud on a massive scale.
Nevertheless, the observers of the Southern African Development Community claimed that the elections had been free and that the outcome fully reflected the will of Zimbabweâs people.
Meanwhile, that country is inching closer to the abyss.
It is high time we had a new policy, one that will remind the African countries of their responsibilities.
The South African Presidentâs âsilent diplomacyâ amounts to complicity with Mugabeâs regime.
The British newspaper is right in saying that, as long as the African leaders and Mbeki refuse to take action against Zimbabwe, their own pledges of democracy and good governance in exchange for European funds are completely meaningless.
If those countries continue to protect Mugabe, the EU should stop giving them money.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing older than yesterdayâs news, as the saying goes.
In practice, however, this House could make do with one newspaper for a whole year.
This is the length of time that has passed since the election of the new Parliament, and yet we continue to tell our visitors â some 200Â 000 of whom have visited Parliamentâs buildings here in Strasbourg and in Brussels in the space of a year â that MrÂ Cox is the President of Parliament.
The leaflets that contain this information, along with the former composition of Parliamentâs governing bodies and the number of seats previously held by the various groups, have been out of date for a long time.
I should therefore like to ask how much longer we will continue to drag our heels in this fashion, given that we want the European public not only to respect our decisions, but also to comply with them.
I believe that we should all be ashamed of distributing such outdated materials to tens of thousands of people.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that, on 19 January, a court in Athens sentenced the Austrian caricaturist and artist Gerhard Haderer to six months in jail, a charge of blasphemy having been brought against him by the Greek Orthodox Church in respect of his book âThe Life of Jesusâ.
The sentence has not yet been enforced, as MrÂ Haderer has appealed against it.
His appeal is to be heard on 13 April, or in other words the day after tomorrow.
I regard this as an assault on the free expression of opinion and as an attack on art, and I ask the Greek authorities to look into this matter and to examine whether their laws are in conflict with European fundamental rights as regards free expression of opinion and the freedom of art.
As the Austrian authorities have already halted proceedings against MrÂ Haderer, and as the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that nobody may be prosecuted in one Member State for an action in respect of which proceedings have already been concluded in another, the European arrest warrant must not be applied in this instance, and the Austrian authorities should inform the Greek courts immediately of what their investigations have brought to light.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, earlier the President asked us to observe a minuteâs silence in memory of Pope John PaulÂ II.
Taking my cue from this significant occasion, I should like to call upon the European Parliament to work together with the Apostolic See to organise a conference on employment, to be held before the end of the year.
The issue of employment, which is a major problem faced by Europe, the European Union and the whole world, was very dear to the heart of the Polish Pope, who believed that help should always be given to unemployed people.
I believe that this issue is one that could unite both believers and non-believers, and by believers I mean both Catholics and those of other faiths.
It is for this reason that I am calling upon the European Parliament to hold a conference of this kind this year in conjunction with the Apostolic See.
I believe that this would also be a fitting tribute to such a great man.
Â Â  Mr President, two years ago a young man from London named Jeremiah Duggan died when he was hit by vehicles on a motorway near Wiesbaden in Germany.
The German authorities very quickly decided that it was a case of suicide and failed even to take witness statements or statements from those who last saw him.
There seems to have been a deliberate avoidance of considering all the facts in the case.
In spite of considerable evidence gathered by Mrs Erica Duggan, his mother, that Jeremiah died in very worrying and suspicious circumstances, last week the Hessen State Prosecutor decided not to investigate.
The evidence she presented concerns the organisation that Jeremiah was involved in immediately before he met his death and which appears to be a sinister anti-Semitic sect.
It may be that he was being hounded by it and mentally tortured.
It is called the Lyndon LaRouche network or the Schiller Institute.
It recruits young people in Europe to a dangerous cult.
Some of its ideas are plain rubbish but there are also plenty of destructive, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.
In these circumstances, the position of the prosecutor that her job is not to safeguard the public from known dangers is inexplicable.
I shall be raising this with MEP colleagues and may wish to ask you to intervene at an appropriate time.
The European Convention on Human Rights imposes an obligation to protect life, which must mean investigating suspicious deaths.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common foreign and security policy that the European Union is engaged in developing necessarily involves joint regulation of weapons exports, and so I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Venezuela is currently engaged in a process of rearmament and that this, in view of the conflicts on its borders, is particularly likely to prompt a crisis situation.
If I may give an example, Venezuela has bought 100Â 000 Kalashnikov rifles from Russia, and, as its army consists of only 35Â 000 troops, one cannot but wonder for whom they are intended.
Venezuela has also signed a contract with a Member State of the European Union for the purchase of four corvettes, four patrol vessels, ten transport aircraft and two sea reconnaissance aircraft.
I would ask you, Mr President, to ascertain whether these actions are in breach of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the current state of affairs regarding the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
This Treaty, which was signed in October 2004, is currently awaiting ratification before it enters into force.
The question that therefore arises is as follows: what obligations are incumbent upon a state that has signed the Treaty but not yet ratified it?
The answer to this question can be found in international law, in particular the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. ArticleÂ 18 of this Convention states that a state in this position is obliged to refrain from acts which would hinder or preclude the entry into force of the agreement in question, or which would defeat the agreementâs object and purpose.
What this means is that governments are obliged under international law to take all steps necessary to ensure that the European Constitution is ratified.
It therefore follows that neither states nor governments should in any way support or tolerate anti-Constitution campaigns.
As the Latin saying goes, ââ, that is, âagreements must be honouredâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, the very strong euro is creating huge problems in the economically less developed countries of Europe.
We have problems with competitiveness.
Non-proprietary goods are not selling.
Mercedes are selling, of course, because they are a brand name; French perfumes are selling, because they are brand names, but simple goods from factories in Greece and other countries are not selling, because they are very expensive.
There is a huge problem with the very strong euro.
It is impossible for my country to suddenly cover this deficit when factories are closing, when factories are relocating outside Greece because they cannot meet the costs of the very strong euro.
We cannot sell our products.
We have no tourists.
No one goes on holiday to a Mediterranean country with such a strong currency.
They go to the coast on the other side.
Europe therefore needs to decide to peg the euro to the dollar, because otherwise we shall shortly be facing a serious problem.
We need to think and look ahead, so that the peoples of Europe have a tolerable standard of living rather than the miserable standard of living into which the very strong euro will force them.
Â Â  Mr President, today I would like to start a process of naming and shaming those Member States that fail to implement European directives.
There are currently 83 Lisbon directives which we have passed in the European Parliament.
Out of sixty-three that should have been implemented by now, only ten have been fully implemented.
Today I would like to mention the Electricity Directive which should have been implemented by 1 June 2004.
Those countries that have not implemented the Electricity Directive are Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland and Portugal.
Sweden has yet to notify the Commission of its legislation implementing the Electricity Directive.
I believe that the Lisbon Agenda is in jeopardy.
It is time we put pressure on the Member States.
I would like you, Mr President, to write to those governments asking them when they intend to implement the directive.
Â Â  I have taken note of your request.
Parliamentâs services will help me to analyse it and we will take any necessary action.
Mr Pek has the floor.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest man of our time, John PaulÂ II, has passed away.
The whole world was stunned by the news and plunged into mourning, and billions of people have paid tribute to him.
At a time when the European Union is engulfed in a crisis of values, this House needs to hear the real truth about the source of John PaulÂ IIâs moral and spiritual strength and the source of the spiritual power that this magnificent man radiated.
They came from something you reject, ladies and gentlemen, namely the very heart of the teachings of Jesus Christ, which are full of love and truth.
There is only one truth, and if the embryonic European State that is currently under construction rejects this truth, in so doing going against the beliefs of millions of people all over the world, it will commit a grave error, and the whole edifice will collapse.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I want the European Parliament to speak up for the thousands, indeed millions, of textile workers who see their work threatened by the abolition of quotas within the framework of the WTO.
The United States did not tie itself in the same knots as the European Commission when it came to instituting the procedure to safeguard itself against Chinese textile products.
The European Commission tells us to wait.
According to the Euratex organisation, we shall lose 1Â 350 jobs per day in the textile sector unless the decision is made to safeguard it.
How many unemployed will the Commission have to have on its conscience before it finally deigns to respond?
Â Â  Only two requests for the floor have been registered.
Mr Medina Ortega has the floor.
Â Â  Mr President, I regret what Mr de Grandes has said, and it seems he has the wrong Parliament.
He has raised an issue that relates to the operational structure of the Spanish institutions.
The Socialist government is currently trying to re-establish the balance, which was seriously upset as a result of the pressure on the judiciary from the previous Peopleâs Party government.
We hope that the Peopleâs Party, within the framework of the Spanish constitutional system, is prepared to take a more flexible position, in order to make it possible to bring the Spanish judicial system back into line with the rule of law.
Â Â  Mr President, we never talk about children's rights, almost as if such children do not exist, but they do.
Children who experience sexual abuse, children who experience other kinds of abuse, be they child soldiers or starving children, and children who do not go to school.
Commissioner Frattini knows all these problems well and it seems to me that you could arrange with the Commission for this question, that is the question of children's rights, to be debated in a plenary session.
Â Â  Mr de Grandes, are you requesting the floor on a point of order?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am speaking pursuant to Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure, as a result of personal comments.
Â Â  Rule 145 has been invoked previously by other Members and I have pointed out that this Rule relates to issues of a personal nature.
Frankly, I do not believe there has been any personal accusation against you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have been mentioned by name, accused of fraudulent use of Parliament.
Â Â  You have been mentioned, but I do not believe that ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have been mentioned, and a value judgment has been made against me.
Â Â  Mr de Grandes, I do not wish my personal circumstances to lead to my interpreting the Rules of Procedure in a biased fashion, because that would be regrettable, and I do not believe that to be the case, Mr de Grandes.
I am going to give you the floor.
This is the second time this has happened; I will have to send a circular to all Members clearly indicating the scope of Rule 145.
You have the floor in order to respond, and I shall read the Rule, to âremarks that have been made about his personâ; and Rule 145 says that the speaker, in this case you, âmay not speak on substantive matters but shall confine his observations to rebutting any remarks that have been made about his personâ.
That is what Rule 145 says.
You have invoked it and I would ask that you comply with it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have been mentioned by name, accused of having the wrong Parliament.
Mr President, I do not have the wrong Parliament.
This is the forum for defending the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the separation of powers, to which my question related, is unfortunately being jeopardised in my country.
I wished to condemn this within the context of the Union.
When we demand that other countries respect the separation of powers, we must first of all do so ourselves.
That is why what is happening now is so unfortunate and that is why I have vigorously condemned it in this Parliament.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
It is questionable whether your comments relate to substantive matters; we shall have to clarify the scope of this Rule.
Mr Medina, I would ask you not to insist on the issue because that would lead to an endless argument.
I would ask you to be reasonable and not to insist, because we cannot ascertain whether personal comments have been made.
Thank you, Mr Medina.
Â Â  The next item is the annual debate on the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.
There are several oral questions.
Mr Cavada has the floor.
Â Â  MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Vice-President of the Commission, the oral questions presented to you by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs focus on three prior conditions to which Parliament has returned regularly since the Treaty of Amsterdam set us the objective of transforming the EU into an area of freedom, security and justice.
We have indeed been convinced since l999 that such an objective can only be achieved if three conditions are fulfilled: more legitimacy, greater effectiveness and more credibility for our political action.
Firstly, more legitimacy. What this signifies for Parliament is more respect for the democratic principle according to which the European Parliament must definitely be more seriously involved in preparing European legislation and negotiating international agreements.
In The Hague, the European Council decided to make the transition to codecision where illegal immigration was concerned, but â rather bizarrely â it rejected codecision when it came to legal immigration, which is the form of immigration of interest to most Europeans.
Parliament also continues simply to be consulted on criminal matters, which is the most sensitive area of relations between European citizens and institutions.
The Council has still not grasped that, if this relationship is not based on very high standards and on a courageous policy for promoting fundamental rights, any initiative launched by the EU is in danger of being contested by those same Member States that put the brakes on the EUâs development.
This discrepancy between public declarations and practical decisions already sees us face to face before the Court of Justice, disputing regulations in the areas of family reunification, data protection and, perhaps tomorrow, asylum procedure.
Greater effectiveness comes next, since most of the responses given by the institutions to requests in connection with the free movement of persons or with tackling organised crime or terrorism remain very vague when they are not merely theoretical declarations.
That this is the case is still proved to us by the fact that we continue to proceed by trial and error when it comes not only to border control and to the development of Schengen cooperation but also to conflict prevention or the promotion of integration.
The absence of clear objectives and priorities leads us to dissipate our energies as much as the lack of any obvious link with other Community policies which do, however, complement the policies associated with the area of freedom, security and justice.
Another crucial factor to be defined is that of the relationship between the European and the national institutions.
It will be difficult for us to obtain more mutual trust if we are not in a position to define the tasks of each decision-making level, the expected responses and the measures to be taken in case of a failure to act.
We must not forget that, in speaking of peopleâs freedoms or security, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
Finally, we need more credibility.
Last year, the European Council confronted an impressively high number of instances in which the action plan to combat terrorism was not put into effect. All it was able to do was appoint a representative of the Secretary-General, thereby adding, if need be, a new piece to a sort of institutional Meccano which is already failing to impress in terms of its transparency and, certainly, its efficiency.
To date, agencies such as Europol or CEPOL still have to prove their worth and have difficulty integrating themselves into the national security systems.
On many occasions, the European Parliament has invited the Council to create credible bodies, better integrated into the institutional framework of the EU, but it has never received genuinely credible responses.
In certain cases, like that of the development of information bodies, the replies have even been so vague as to make one wonder if they really have been devised in a way that is equal to the questions raised.
I shall in any case listen very carefully, or rather â since obligations in connection with the French election campaign will require me to leave the Chamber in a few minutesâ time â I shall, no later than tomorrow morning, read the replies given to us in the course of this debate.
I am able right now to commit myself to presenting the competent parliamentary committee with proposals designed to reopen a dialogue between our institutions that is commensurate with our expectations â those of our people, as well as those generated by the tasks that have been entrusted to us under the Treaties and that call for a clear political perspective rather than technocratic responses that cause delay.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cavada was quite right to raise just now the issue of Parliamentâs involvement, and I think we should give more thought to our approach in such a sensitive area as this one.
Particularly as we are discussing the area of freedom, security and justice, I would like to focus on the planned proposal on data retention.
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs â and I, as its rapporteur â had doubts about the legal basis for this proposal, and in this the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Commission and the Councilâs Legal Service agreed with us.
I would now just like to know whether we can assume that the Council will do likewise and involve Parliament in the decision on this matter, or whether we can take it as read that the Member States will stick with their proposal in the full knowledge that they are setting themselves against three institutions.
I would be very interested to learn that as a matter of extreme urgency.
Â Â  . Mr President, my group has grave concerns about the plan to track, in future, when and with whom citizens communicate by telephone, fax and e-mail and indeed, which websites they visit, so as to establish a record of their interests.
That is surely totally unacceptable and is a typical example of legislation that serves above all else to help politicians feel better about themselves and to demonstrate that they can, at times, take decisive action, although it remains to be seen whether or not it is effective.
Would it not be preferable to channel the many millions involved into specific investigations?
Before I even consider giving my approval, I would like the Council to give me good reasons why this huge increase is necessary, proportionate and effective.
I defy the Council to give me the bare facts and leave out the empty rhetoric.
My group is also â as Mr Alvaro said a moment ago â deeply worried about the procedure.
The Council knows that Parliament feels very strongly about civil rights and effective measures to combat crime, more so than do the governments.
That is why the governments are resolutely determined to legislate without any parliament being involved.
The Commission and the legal services tell us that this subject falls within the scope of the first pillar where Parliament has a say.
The Commission has already said it will table a proposal of its own, but the Council, as if on automatic pilot, continues to hold meetings on the proposal of those four Member States.
I would also like to know how this can be reconciled with the governmentsâ position on the Constitution, which stipulates, after all, that Parliament will become colegislator in the third pillar too.
The governments claim they very much want this democratic control, but they stand to lose every shred of credibility if they now try to avoid it by quickly forcing something through which will have huge implications for the public and for hundreds of Internet and telecoms businesses.
Will the Council simply decide to wait for the Commissionâs proposal, or should this House again go to the Court of Justice to enforce democracy on the Member States by means of a legal ruling?
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just been given a tangible example of what this debate is about.
The example â that of the framework directive on data retention â is an important one in terms of determining two quite different issues, the first being that of how the institutions relate to each other.
There is no point in coming out with fine principles concerning issues of the law, freedom and the safeguarding of rights, but not doing anything about them in a real-life situation involving relations between the institutions.
The question that Mr Alvaro highlighted has not yet been answered, and the Council was meant to do so today.
If this House and the Commission have justifiable misgivings about whether Parliament should be involved and, if it is to be involved, to what extent, then â if we are to get anywhere â the Council must give us its final decision on the matter today.
For months, we have had the feeling that this is an issue on which Parliament is being strung along.
We can debate as much as we like, but no kind of concrete and final decision is possible.
Parliament is not being involved, and no final decision is being taken.
The second issue is that no answer has as yet been given to the question Mrs Buitenweg raised just now about whether doing this sort of thing with data is actually necessary â about whether it is productive, whether it is helpful, whether it really will succeed in helping keep people in the European Union safe, or whether it adds up to nothing more than shooting from the hip at a time when the European Union was also in a situation of grave crisis.
Firstly, what role will Parliament play, and, secondly, at which stage of the process can we expect to play it?
To both these questions we expect precise answers.
The third question that needs to be answered has to do with what the actual point of this measure is.
Â Â  MrÂ President, 2004 saw significant advances in terms of the area of freedom, security and justice, firstly with the adoption of the Hague programme, which sets the new priorities for the next few years and, secondly, with a Council decision of 22 December, which permits the switch to codecision when it comes to border control, asylum, immigration, judicial cooperation on criminal matters and police cooperation.
We cannot but be very pleased that the Council has heard our requests, and we wish to continue in this spirit of dialogue between equal partners in order to ensure the continuity of the progress to be made.
Unfortunately, developments in European immigration policy have mainly been in terms of repressive measures and the fight against illegal immigration.
I am therefore delighted that the Commission has presented a Green Paper on economic immigration.
I want this Green Paper, however, to permit a wider debate on opening up means of legal immigration and not to be confined to the needs of the European labour market.
Indeed, if a discussion on economic immigration is absolutely necessary to European immigration policy, we are not prepared to shop around in third countries.
We must make efforts to come up with lasting solutions for migrants, and ones that respect their fundamental rights.
I thus call upon the Member States to permit the switch to codecision where legal immigration is concerned.
2004 also saw the proposal presented for a directive on the procedures concerning the granting and withdrawal of refugee status.
I really wish to draw the Councilâs and the Commissionâs attention to our great concern about this proposal.
By allowing too large a number of dispensations, this proposal amounts, indeed, to no more than a levelling down of asylum policy.
In the worst case, it is in danger of jeopardising the more protective asylum policies of certain Member States.
I am sorry that the Council has not permitted the switch to codecision where this matter is concerned, and I would call upon it to take the anxieties of the European Parliament into consideration.
We wish to ask the Council how matters now stand regarding its proposal concerning data retention, since Commissioner Frattini announced to us that the Commission wished to present its own proposal.
Are you going to allow a tool for protecting personal data in the third pillar?
The question has been put, and we hope for a reply.
Finally, I would ask the Council to decide, during this weekâs JHA Council, again to consult the European Parliament on the framework directive concerning racism and xenophobia, and I look forward to your replies.
Â Â  MrÂ President, allow me firstly to thank you for the opportunity given to the Council to take stock of the progress made in 2004 in developing the area of freedom, security and justice.
I should like, in particular, to thank MrÂ Cavada, MrÂ Alvaro, MrsÂ Buitenweg, MrÂ Reul and MrsÂ Roure for the questions that have been put and which have bearing on the future and operation of this area of freedom, security and justice on which - as you emphasised â considerable progress was made in 2004.
2004 was the year of the Constitutional Treaty, with significant progress made in building a more secure and therefore freer Europe. It was the year in which the Hague programme â a practical list of measures to be implemented - was adopted in relation to the area of freedom, security and justice.
It was also the year in which more than one hundred documents were adopted in connection with the area of freedom. What progress for one of the greatest projects for deepening Europe following its enlargement, which also took place in 2004!
Yes, 2004 was the year of the Constitutional Treaty, which opens up new horizons for people and for the European Parliament, as shown by the questions put by MrÂ Cavada.
By reinforcing judicial and police cooperation, by extending codecision and qualified majority voting â an absolute necessity in a democratic Europe of 25 Member States â and by laying the foundations of a genuinely common asylum and immigration policy, Europe will contribute genuine added value to our citizens where security, justice and freedom are concerned.
Faced with the challenges of immigration, organised crime and international terrorism, no Member State is in a position to face up to things alone.
We need more in the way of Europe.
A vote in favour of the European Constitution will be a vote in favour of a more secure and therefore freer Europe.
A vote against the European Constitution will mean our maintaining the national barriers faced by our police and magistrates while criminals take advantage of the absence of borders.
That is a state of affairs that we must not accept.
MrÂ Cavada is right to emphasise the way in which the Constitutional Treaty opens up many new prospects of cooperation and codecision involving our institutions.
If I understand correctly, a lot of the questions put are designed to anticipate applying the provisions of the Constitutional Treaty.
In a community governed by law, such as the European Union, the Council will carry out its work while respecting the rules laid down by the sole Treaties currently in force.
The Council will not anticipate the Constitutional Treaty out of respect for the important decisions to be taken over the next few months by our national parliaments and our people.
Obviously, this does not prevent close cooperation, and an excellent understanding, between Parliament and the Council. Nor, where the Treaties permit, does it prevent our two institutions listening to each other or doing more to exchange information.
As early as 2004, the Councilâs activities in the field of justice and home affairs were characterised by great progress, thanks, in particular, to the excellent work of the Dutch and Irish Presidencies.
As proof of this, I cite the fact that the Council adopted an important bill in the institutional field â and one to which you referred â insofar as it made the codecision procedure applicable in fields concerned with external border controls and the fight against illegal immigration.
It is a first step and an important one.
I also cite as proof the continued efforts to bring about an area of freedom, security and justice extended to include 25 Member States.
The Council has, in particular, adopted nine regulations, seven directives and more than thirty decisions or framework decisions.
That is a lot!
Finally, the European Council has adopted the excellent and particularly pragmatic Hague programme with a view to strengthening the three pillars constituted by freedom, security and justice. The Council has invited the Commission to present an action plan in 2005 that will give practical expression to the objectives and priorities of the Hague programme, objectives that you are rightly demanding be pursued.
We shall discuss the matter again this week at the Justice and Home Affairs Council, as well as at the June Council.
In the field of asylum, the Council has adopted a directive concerning the minimum standards relating to the conditions that third-country nationals or stateless persons have to fulfil in order to claim the status of refugees or of persons needing international protection.
In order to ensure greater solidarity between the Member States, we have established a European Fund for Refugees, which will make it possible to support the efforts made by the Member States in this field.
Other measures need still to be adopted in this area, notably the proposal for a directive concerning the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
The Council has also given special attention to the immigration aspects by defining measures in the areas relating to admission. These have included, in particular, the successful integration of immigrants, which is an important aspect of the management of legal immigration, and the tackling of illegal immigration.
Regarding admission, I should like in particular to emphasise that the Council has adopted the directive relating to residence permits issued to third-country nationals who are victims of human trafficking.
Moreover, the Council has created the European Border Management Agency.
This agency will be operational as from 1Â May 2005.
The Luxembourg Presidency is making efforts to find a definitive headquarters for it, but I have to tell you that, with five candidates in contention, it cannot be assumed that there will be unanimous support for a solution, especially if none of the five countries gives up its candidacy, as none has done so far.
Where expulsion is concerned, several measures, of which you are aware, have been adopted, such as the joint organisation of shared flights for expelling third-country nationals.
Two readmission agreements with Hong Kong and Macao have now entered into force.
Those with Albania and Sri Lanka have been finalised.
As the Presidency of the Council sees matters, these negotiations will have to be speeded up with a view to arriving at a broad network of European readmission agreements.
Where visa policy is concerned, the Council has decided to add to the European Unionâs budget the appropriations necessary for developing the VIS, the system whereby the Member States will be able to exchange data concerning visas and which will enable the national authorities to capture and update data relating to visas, as well as to consult such data electronically.
We have also adopted a regulation concerning the standards governing security elements and biometric elements that are part and parcel of passports and travel documents issued by the Member States.
By doing this, we have created a basis for harmonisation whereby passports and travel documents must contain digitalised photographs of their holdersâ faces, as well as recorded fingerprints.
In accordance with this decision, the Member States will have until August 2006 to introduce biometric elements into passports.
As we know, this deadline falls later than that established by our American partners for enabling people to enter their country without visas.
I call upon all the EU institutions to convey a message of understanding to the US Government and, above all, Congress so that a situation that we should regret on both sides of the Atlantic does not occur in October 2005.
The Presidency of the Council is working on this every day, as is the Commission.
In the area of police cooperation, you know that, since the appalling attacks on New York and Madrid, the fight against international terrorism has become a priority.
The European Union has resolved to act jointly in order to combat terrorism and assure its people of the best possible protection.
The European Unionâs strategy is global in character and provides for a whole series of measures.
MrÂ Gijs de Vries was appointed as coordinator of the fight against terrorism in March of last year.
His main tasks consist firstly of coordinating the Councilâs work on combating terrorism, secondly of ensuring that an overall view is obtained of all the tools available to the EU and, thirdly, of carefully following the implementation of the action plan to combat terrorism.
This coordinating function within the Council â I emphasise this in response to the question put â is important if the various structures within the Council are to have a coherent approach in an area affecting development, the police, justice, defence, external policy and other areas.
Moreover, I should like to remind you that the Council takes steps to evaluate the implementation of the action plan every six months.
This review took place in December 2004, and another will be carried out in June of this year.
As President-in-Office of the Council, I attach particular importance to continuing to make these joint efforts to combat terrorism and to ensure â and this is important â that the decisions taken are duly implemented by the Member States.
The European Parliament also asked whether the Council would envisage converting the shared values and professional standards of the police into legislative measures.
For the moment, there is no Council decision along these lines, and it has to be asked what now would basically change if this were the direction taken.
Regarding the integration of Europol into European Union law, I should like to remind you that the Hague programme specifies that the Council must adopt European legislation on Europol as soon as possible after the Constitutional Treaty has come into force and no later than in January 2008, taking account of all the tasks entrusted to Europol.
In the meantime, Europol will continue with its efforts to improve its operations by making full use of the cooperation agreement concluded with Eurojust.
Europol and Eurojust should, moreover, submit a report to the Council each year on their shared experiences and the precise results obtained.
What is more, Europol and Eurojust should encourage recourse to the Member Statesâ joint investigation teams and facilitate their own participation in these.
The Council has also adopted complementary measures aimed at enabling the European Police College to develop progressively.
In particular, we have conferred legal personality upon it and established its headquarters.
Moreover, the Council has adopted several measures aimed at reinforcing police cooperation in certain specific areas.
The Council has adopted the decision on combating vehicle crime.
The number of vehicles stolen each year in the Member States of the European Union is currently estimated at 1.2 million.
That is a huge cost, amounting to at least EURÂ 15 billion per year.
This decision introduces better cooperation, designed to prevent this type of cross-border crime.
The Council has taken several decisions aimed at combating violence connected in particular with football, the public disorder it entails and its consequences for those who respect the laws.
In this context, we have taken several cooperation measures enabling us to put security measures in place, for example for the European Football Championship which took place in Portugal last year.
Where tackling drugs is concerned, the Council signalled its agreement in December 2004 to an anti-drugs strategy for the period 2005 to 2012.
When it comes to judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and taking account, on this issue too, of the question put just now by MrÂ Cavada concerning the quality of justice, I would inform you that the Council has noted with interest the recommendation of the European Parliament concerning the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal legislation in the Member States.
I would take the liberty of reminding you in this connection that the Tampere European Council has already defined the initial parameters for action in this field, and the 2004 Hague programme defines the actions it would be appropriate to implement in the future.
A deciding factor in this context is mutual confidence in the Member Statesâ legal and judicial systems.
Mutual confidence cannot be brought about by decree.
It demands a set of measures, including a minimum number of common rules, the exchange of information and a more European-style training of police officers and magistrates.
In 2004, the Council continued to implement the mutual recognition of judgments programme, which has to be anchored in the mutual confidence of which I have just spoken.
In the area of mutual recognition, we have arrived at an agreement in principle on the draft framework decision relating to the mutual recognition of fines, as well as on the draft framework decision relating to the mutual recognition of confiscation orders.
The Council has also examined the proposal aimed at devising a system for exchanging information extracted from police records with a view to promoting a better knowledge of convictions.
I do hope that, in the course of this weekâs Council and of the Councils to follow, we shall be able to make progress on this matter, which is important to the lives of people in our Member States.
We have also made progress in relation to substantive criminal law, particularly by adopting the framework decisions in the field of drug trafficking and several reports on the implementation of framework decisions on the subjects, especially, of combating money laundering and terrorism.
In the Council, we have begun examining the proposal for a framework decision in relation to a number of procedural rights accorded within the framework of criminal procedures in the European Union, essential factors for creating the confidence of which I spoke just now.
I shall shortly listen with interest to the report on this subject which is to be presented in this Chamber.
Regarding the retention of telecommunications data, which is the subject of the questions also put this evening, I would emphasise that the Council attaches great importance to this document in the fight against crime.
It is not a question of telephone tapping but of storing data, for example telephone numbers, for a certain period.
Yes, we are convinced that this document is useful, given the experience we have acquired as ministers for justice or home affairs.
As a lawyer, I am well aware that the legal basis is important.
Please, though!
Let us not, either in the Council or in discussions between our institutions, waste too much time on the legal basis if, as I hope we do, we share the objective of fighting crime effectively while ensuring respect for the protection of private life â a concern of the Council too - and while bearing in mind the financial costs of these new measures.
We shall take a positive attitude to examining the proposals forwarded by the Commission to the Council just a few days ago, especially the opinion of the Legal Service in this regard.
If I understand correctly, the Commission will submit a new proposal in the course of the next few weeks.
It will be examined in the light of the Legal Serviceâs opinion.
I would emphasise again, however, that, for the Council, the main thing is the content.
Obviously, it will be possible to discuss all the other aspects mentioned this evening in the Chamber.
The Council has also made effective progress in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters which, moreover, constitutes an important dimension of Europeansâ lives.
We perhaps speak too often, in the area of security and justice, of the criminal dimension.
The Council has laid down rules when it comes to the mutual recognition of decisions relating to family law, commercial law or other areas of civil law.
We have, for example, adopted the regulation concerning the order for uncontested claims.
We have adopted a directive relating to the compensation of victims in cross-border situations.
We have carried on with the work concerning the proposal for a regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, namely RomeÂ II.
It is, moreover, a proposal of particular importance since it is aimed at defining the law applicable, for example, in situations of liability due to defective products.
We have begun examining the proposal for a regulation to introduce a European payment order procedure.
I hope that we shall soon be able to make progress, both in the European Parliament and in the Council, on the issues relating to the legal basis.
What is more, we shall, while awaiting Parliamentâs opinion, hold an orientation debate in this connection within the JHA Council in order to make progress with you on this important document.
We have also begun examining the proposal for a directive on certain aspects of mediation so that it will be possible for the decisions taken in accordance with the directive to be recognised and implemented in all the Member States.
The list is long, and I could go on; but you are aware of a lot of these documents.
You can see that, in 2004, huge progress was made in constructing a more secure, more just and therefore freer Europe.
My only regret is that there is still such a lot to be done and that progress is sometimes slow, given the need for unanimity in the Council and different legal traditions.
In this European judicial area, the Council and the European Parliament share the same ambitions, I think.
The Constitutional Treaty opens up new prospects for us.
I am able to tell you, on behalf of the Council, that I am committed to constructive cooperation with Parliament and to working tirelessly to ensure that our people can live in security and freedom.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, honourable Members, the Commission is obviously deeply committed to furthering a real, effective European area of justice, security and freedom.
We intend to pursue this commitment in close and loyal collaboration with this Parliament and with the Council.
There are a few strategic guidelines for our actions, which I shall very quickly explain to this House.
The first principle is seeking a balance â not a legal balance, but primarily a political and institutional one â between the two main demands made by Europeâs citizens: more security on the one hand, and more freedom on the other.
I cannot imagine a European area in which citizens are guaranteed more security but at the expense of their freedom, with a reduction in their area of freedom and safeguards.
As Minister Frieden quite rightly pointed out, the added value that Europe can provide is to be found in this balance.
The second major guideline is solidarity, which we see as a principle that will enable us again to develop a European area in the vast field of immigration policy.
We shall seek an appropriate balance between a firm stance against trafficking in human beings and illegal immigration on the one hand, and on the other a genuine European area for addressing legal immigration, which I think is an opportunity and not a danger, provided it is accompanied by suitable integration measures, for instance.
These are all lines of action on which the Commission will be working from this year, 2005, onwards, again with the idea that Europe can make a difference, in comparison with action by individual Member States.
Consider, for instance, cooperation with non-EU countries â countries of origin and countries of transit â which need to be supported in their policies so that together we can manage the question of immigration and not just look on it as if the issue ought not to affect us directly, in the future or perhaps even now.
There is also a third strategic guideline: strengthening the European area of justice â I mean civil as well as criminal justice.
I see Europeâs commitment in this field to lie in promoting and not just protecting fundamental rights, starting with the establishment of an Agency for Fundamental Rights, the purpose of which will be precisely to promote full respect for these rights and not just to enforce them.
In all of this we shall need to work in conjunction with Parliament and the Council, creating those synergies that will be essential for performing all the activities that fall within our remit.
First of all, the action plan â mentioned by Minister Frieden and MrÂ Cavada and others â will be submitted in time to be approved under the Luxembourg Presidency in June; it will of course be submitted before that, but it will take account of the debate which even today is bringing out some important points.
As I have pledged and as the Council has requested, the action plan will contain detailed measures, a timetable for adopting the provisions and an indication of the specific measures that the Member States must adopt, in order of priority.
The Commission is certainly also considering a number of items that have not yet been directly addressed because the Constitutional Treaty has not entered into force; but there are certain aspects which, in the Commissionâs view, deserve some preparatory work right now even though they will not be operational straight away.
We are thinking of doing the preparatory work by the beginning of 2006, even before the Constitutional Treaty enters into force, an event that we fervently â very fervently â hope will happen.
I shall give just one example: democratic control of Europol and Eurojust is one of the really important aspects marking a step forward for the European area.
Obviously, it depends on the European Constitution entering into force, but there is nothing to prevent the Commission from making an early start with a study and a report, so that we can be ready as soon as the Constitutional Treaty enters into force.
The action plan will then include a mechanism that not only MrÂ Cavada in his question but also, I think, many Member States would like to see: a mechanism for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the action plan measures.
As the President-in-Office of the Council has already pointed out, I believe such monitoring should be constant: it will take place every six months according to a system that has been a success in a completely different area, though it is the principle that counts: the internal market scoreboard ranking system.
We are thinking of a model that works out the scores every six months, not with the intention of making threats or of naming and shaming, of course, but with the intention of helping the Member States to keep to the timetable for adopting the necessary initiatives.
Otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, if we set a timetable and this timetable then remains just on paper, the Commissionâs work becomes rather pointless.
Instead, therefore, we believe we should help, encourage and spur on the Member States through a joint effort between the Commission and the Council, which in this respect is essential.
I shall not dwell on what the main priorities are, as they have already been mentioned: terrorism requires a broad, non-emergency, prevention and reaction strategy, which must certainly respect peopleâs fundamental rights; personal data protection initiatives will be formally submitted very soon, and in the second half of the year there will also be a comprehensive data protection initiative under the third pillar, as I promised this Parliament.
Organised crime is certainly a priority, with special attention for the victims of crime and of trafficking, particularly trafficking in human beings and particularly children, a group that I consider extraordinarily important: they are the most vulnerable victims of all and in my view deserve the strongest protection.
Next, fundamental rights.
I have already mentioned the impact assessment that we are going to carry out: before being adopted, every Commission initiative will be evaluated against the system of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution; no initiative that is out of line can be adopted by a Commission decision and offered to the outside world â a kind of prior conformity and impact assessment for EU-initiated legislation.
Lastly, a couple of final thoughts on Europeâs external actions in the field of security, freedom and justice.
At the beginning of July we shall be putting forward a comprehensive communication on the international dimension of security and justice â of the European area of freedom, security and justice â reaffirming the role that Europe can and must play in the world as the defender and promoter of fundamental rights and of great principles and great values.
Much has been said on the subject of justice: confidence and mutual trust, and harmonisation are the two key concepts.
Regarding immigration, I have already mentioned that trafficking in human beings must be hit hard, but we must have a healthy, balanced integration policy for those who enter legitimately.
The Commission is of course looking forward with great interest to the results on the unresolved issues that the Green Paper on immigration has brought to the notice of everybody here, without prescribing solutions, as you know, but stating the issues.
This, then, is the spirit in which we want to work with Parliament.
We shall work with the national parliaments to reinforce the principle, which we have written into the Constitution, of monitoring subsidiarity, and we shall also of course work with this Parliament, which will be, as it already is, an essential point of reference for us to carry out the initiatives.
Â Â  . â On the occasion of the annual assessment of the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice, we are in a delicate political situation.
We cannot give the new Commission credit for the progress that has been made, nor hold it responsible for the delays that have occurred.
Indeed, 2004 was the year in which the Prodi Commission left office and the Barroso Commission took up its duties; in other words, Frattini took over from Vitorino.
It was, however, an historic year for three main reasons.
Firstly, the EU was enlarged and now has a population of over 450Â million inhabitants, giving it greater political, geographical and economic weight.
Secondly, in addition to the economy and the internal market, we took on shared responsibility to address threats to stability and security, which are not restricted by borders, as in the case of terrorism; we must not forget the tragic events of 11Â March in Madrid.
Thirdly, as mentioned by Mr Cavada and MrsÂ Roure, major changes have taken place in the area of justice and home affairs, with a new institutional framework entering into force as regards visas, asylum and immigration, whereby codecision with Parliament and qualified majority voting in the Council now apply.
Against this backdrop, the questions that we ask here, both to the Commission and the Council, are indicative of the concerns that we would like to see addressed.
We want to know what initiatives are being taken and Parliament wants to monitor those initiatives.
We do not wish merely to play a supporting role; we want our opinions to be taken on board, so that all EU citizens can live freely in a secure world, in which all kinds of disaster are combated and our freedoms are guaranteed.
From this perspective, Commissioner Frattini, congratulations on the guarantees you have given us that greater security must not undermine freedom, and on your initiative in the Council as regards the European Day against the Death Penalty.
Lastly, three aspects that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats considers fundamental: firstly, the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty, with the consequent abolition of the pillar structure; secondly, that the codecision process should extend to areas such as legal immigration and integration, so that full democratic accountability can be guaranteed in the decisions taken in these areas; and thirdly and lastly, that judicial control should be improved by extending the Court of Justiceâs powers.
Â Â  â Madam President, establishing a European area of freedom, security and justice is a historic task, and the period currently under review is a historic period, since in 2004 the EU became a union of 25 Member States, and in this new political environment, security and justice must be able to embark on a path of further development.
In this EU of 25 Member States, the terms âoutsideâ and âinsideâ have a different meaning, and this new world not only needs new regulations; it also needs new institutions, ones that do not just function in formal terms, but that really know those 25 Member States, including the domestic problems and fault lines of the ten new ones.
This is why we are keen to ensure that the new institutions, the European Border Control Agency and the European Human Rights Agency, are really able to work substantively and effectively.
The EU is in fact caught in the middle of conflicting interests and expectations on the part of citizens: as Commissioner Frattini rightly points out, the citizens of Europe want more security and more freedom.
However, we all know that we need more solidarity too, even though the EU is sometimes more tight-fisted about making gestures of solidarity than about keeping a firm grip on security.
We understand that since September 11 and Madrid, we can expect to find ourselves compelled to take action against terrorism.
We also understand that there may sometimes be a temptation to override the values of freedom or solidarity, but we must not allow ourselves to do so.
For the sake of those who are looking to the EU as their new homeland, we must not let this happen.
We welcome the increased differentiation in immigration policy, and we are pleased about the questions raised in the Green Paper.
But please, when answering these questions, let us review the situation of the EU labour market with a critical eye, including the existing labour market supply in the new Member States.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am grateful for the very full speech of Minister Frieden, outlining the Councilâs output in 2004.
However, it hardly engaged the well-known dissatisfaction of this Parliament with both the quality and the manner of EU Justice and Home Affairs developments at all.
A complete culture change is required in the Council, such that this Parliament is treated as a true partner.
The fact that the Minister said that we should not spend too much time worrying about the legal basis of the data-retention proposal is absolutely symptomatic of the fact that the Council just does not get it!
It potentially makes a big difference, both to the degree of privacy infringement and to the degree of openness and democracy in decision-making, whether that proposal is based in EU law or is simply intergovernmental.
The cavalier way that privacy concerns are treated in the Council is deeply worrying.
More and more proposals infringe data protection norms.
It is a slippery slope.
The ultimate goal will become â or is already â the linking-up of the whole series of EU and national databases on personal habits, biometric information and probably, eventually, DNA.
This needs a serious public debate, mediated through this Parliament, on the basis of thorough privacy impact assessments accompanying each proposal.
However, what we are getting is a process of salami slicing, where each new proposal removes a little more protection against invasions of privacy.
This sly and shadowy method is not a clever strategy because if the European public one day finds it does not like the system of surveillance constructed, it will react strongly.
I urge the Minister to persuade interior ministries and home offices to change the habits of a lifetime and be open, candid and accountable in their dealings.
Â Â  . Madam President, I was rather irritated by two remarks that the President-in-Office of the Council made.
The first was that the Council would make no attempt to anticipate the provisions of the future Constitution.
The second was that, if we are doing something for security, we should not argue about its basis in law.
The former reflects a trend that has been apparent in debates over recent months, whether on counter-terrorism or data collection; one cannot help thinking that the Council has for some time been wandering around the outermost limits of the existing Treaties, and has â ever more glaringly and with ever-increasing frequency â been going against the guarantees of fundamental rights.
I am thinking here of air passengersâ data and the debate on the collection of telecommunications data.
It is very evidently high time something was made clear, namely that the Constitutionâs improvements in terms of what can be done for internal security, and the improved instruments it contains, are inseparable from the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and from Parliamentâs involvement across the board.
The two cannot be put asunder.
For that reason, as regards adherence to fundamental rights and to the foundations underpinning our laws, we will fight it out with you.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the misleading title of area of freedom, security and justice, as it is also called in the Constitutional Treaty, is an expression of the promotion and burgeoning of suppression, on the pretext of combating terrorism and organised crime, the institutionalisation and expansion of anti-democratic and other measures, the expansion of the mechanisms of suppression and the construction of fortress Europe, with strictly controlled immigration, which even goes as far as creating sorting concentration camps in third countries which remind us of the concentration of slaves in previous centuries.
The reference to freedom and justice is an insult to the peoples, when you are trying, on the pretext of terrorism, to terrorise people so that you can cover up the barbaric policy against the workers and the suppressive measures which are being taken and which you will try to use against those who react, when the Tampere programme has already resulted in the growth of an industry, a real factory turning out reactionary laws and mechanisms which strike at democratic rights and freedoms, and when you are setting up an unbelievable system to record social action and personal data in every country, with networks of cameras and other monitoring equipment.
Everyone is monitoring everything: telephones, airlines, cameras on the roads, cameras in public places, zeppelins in the sky.
Social struggles are being criminalised, while radical action is seen as the number one danger and is being indirectly but clearly included in terrorist threats.
2004 can therefore be evaluated as the year in which the push to the right in the European Union was speeded up, with the main target and enemy being the people.
The response of the labour and grass-roots movement must be to step up the fight against non-compliance with and disobedience to reactionary laws and the European Union itself.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner and Council, this legal area is still extremely undeveloped, even if, in all honesty, it also has to be said that a very great deal has nonetheless happened in the last ten years.
Thinking back, for example, to the prevailing mood and spirit when we voted through the action plan to combat organised crime, it is noticeable that there is, in any case, a different rhetoric present today than there was in the nation states at that time.
There is a serious imbalance, however.
