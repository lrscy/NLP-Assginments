This is bad enough as it is.
What I find worse, though, is that there was no reaction whatsoever to this incident from the Muslim quarters in Belgium.
Quite the reverse; the resulting silence gave the impression that, at the least, people in those quarters were not at all shocked that the Chairman of the Muslim Executive, who claims to speak on behalf of all Muslims in Belgium, should give indirect support to terrorism.
This is disquieting and we should challenge it.
Madam President, terrorism is irredeemably evil.
Its wicked persona is not to be excused or ameliorated.
Sadly, the GUE/NGL minority report tries to do exactly that, with its focus on the economic and social causes of terrorism, its attack on the war on terror and its diversionary reference to what it calls 'state terrorism'.
I am not surprised, because embedded in GUE/NGL is Sinn FÃ©in, the long-term friend and political affiliate of terrorists.
We have heard much talk of human rights, as if fighting terrorism and a belief in human rights were incompatible.
Remember that terrorists are those who set out to destroy all tenets of liberal democracy, who refuse to live by our civilised laws, but who are adept at exploiting them when it suits their nefarious purposes.
Coming from Northern Ireland, I have seen that at first hand.
Sometimes, if society is to survive, it must fight back.
Some, I fear, would so cloak themselves in an exaggerated human rights mantra that they would see society perish sooner than terror.
This is a world of harsh choices.
Rabid Islamic terrorism is a particular threat to every liberty that the Western world holds dear.
It plays not by the rules, but embraces a perverted death culture that rejoices in mass murder.
With such people we cannot be soft.
If we are, they will win.
Yes, there must be a winner between good and evil, between terror and order, and it is the duty of all of us to see that good triumphs and terror is vanquished.
Madam President, This is a very important report with different emphases.
One of the big problems seems to be that numerous states have not been willing to counter the terrorist threat efficiently.
As you mentioned, Madam Commissioner, even several UN member states have not been able to agree on an international definition of terrorism.
Against this background I think the main challenge for us is to strengthen and enhance the efficiency of transatlantic cooperation and coordination.
That also means fully implementing the EU-US cooperation declarations.
I wonder whether concentrating on suspicions and accusations might give the misleading impression that US intelligence is not our ally but the main adversary.
At the same time, I would like to pay tribute to our own anti-terrorist efforts.
They have succeeded in preventing many new terrorist attacks in the UK, Germany and the United States.
But the urgent need is obviously for closer cooperation between the EU Member States and special agencies.
I can only support the idea that the EU anti-terrorist coordinator be given a stronger mandate and more resources.
I think paragraph 9 is especially relevant.
It states that one of the EU's external actions should be aimed at preventing extremist groups and states from resorting to terrorism.
I think this is a key to practical solutions.
Without the support of such states as Iran, terrorist initiatives will be dramatically reduced.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to begin my speech by congratulating Mr YaÃ±ez-Barnuevo GarcÃ­a on his outstanding report.
The positive aspect of this report is, to my mind, the balance it achieves between the need, on the one hand, for a firm, uncompromising approach coupled with more effective international coordination in the fight against terrorism, and on the other hand, the need to maintain human and civil rights and the principle of the rule of law.
The report also takes account of factors contributing to the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists, be they outside or actually within Europe.
Among these factors are extreme poverty, lack of access to education, social, economic, ethnic and religious discrimination and collective disenchantment.
I firmly believe that the gradual elimination of these factors and causes is a vitally important prerequisite for successfully combating terrorism.
I should also like, in conclusion, to urge, through the Council, those EU Member States that have not yet done so, to sign or ratify at the earliest opportunity the 16 United Nations universal instruments on combating terrorism.
Thank you.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating the violated rights of our esteemed terrorists this morning, Parliament was packed full, with the Commission Presidency and all the European institutions' authorities.
Now, however, when it is time to debate and take stock of the strategy for combating terrorism and, above all, for protecting Europe's citizens against the looming threat of terrorism, few of the people involved are present.
One day, somebody will write the story of Europe's fight against terrorism and they will pick on this, together with the serious mistake we made this morning in adopting the Fava report, which is a huge gift to al-Qa'ida.
The report rightly states that we need to examine the factors contributing to radicalisation.
We know what these factors are: they are the mosques and Islamic centres.
It is the absolute freedom granted to thousands of Islamic centres and mosques to carry out propaganda and recruitment and to collaborate actively with Islamic terrorist organisations.
It is time we started to say that quite plainly here in Parliament.
Madam President, this report starts from the false premise that international terrorism constitutes the greatest threat to the democratic international community. Likewise, President Bush's concept of a war on terror is mistaken.
Violence and terrorism are only means to an end.
The greatest threat to the free democratic world comes from an ideology.
The ideology in question is that of the fundamentalist and extremist Islam, which by means of terror seeks first to impose its psychological, and then ultimately its physical dominion on the world.
They believe that time and demography are on their side and they have declared war on us.
Sun Tzu remarked that the first place to win a war is in the mind of the enemy.
Islamic fundamentalists might conclude that they are well on the road to winning that war when its victims do not confront the fundamental cause of the problem.
The solution is not for the European Union to concentrate more power in its hands, as is predictably recommended in this report.
The solution is to recognise that fundamentalist, extremist and literal Islam is incompatible with Western liberal democracy and indeed any kind of civilisation.
From that starting point we can begin to adopt concrete measures to combat its manifestations through the actions of nation states and international cooperation.
Had I longer than 90 seconds to speak, I could have told you what some of those measures might be.
Madam President, I wish to begin by extending my own solidarity to the victims of the Madrid bombings with us today.
In debating international action to combat terrorism, let us recognise that such solidarity extends internationally and that the countries of the Middle East, Africa and Asia have suffered far more from terrorism over the past decade than we have in Europe or the West.
It is right to seek international cooperation, as terrorists themselves exploit globalisation through the internet, mobile communications, the media and the covert movement of people and of funds.
Europe should consistently use its foreign policies to encourage all third countries to sign, ratify and implement the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.
However, we must be consistent too in insisting that we cannot protect the rights and liberties of our own citizens by denying those of others beyond our borders.
Our commitment must be to address the underlying conditions that draw people into terrorism, by working to improve respect for human rights, to promote democracy and good governance, to resolve conflict and to tackle world poverty and to roundly reject those, like the last speaker, who falsely seek to equate terrorism with religion by upholding our commitment to promote mutual understanding and cultural awareness in Europe and throughout the world.
Madam President, the reason why I omitted to congratulate you is that I was not in fact thinking of the great region of Westphalia-Lippe, which Mr Brok, too, calls home.
Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, for this exchange of views.
In any debate of this kind, there will of course - how could it be otherwise? - be differences and divergent views, but there is also agreement, and many of you made reference to this morning's debate, in which, too, there were of course considerable differences of opinion, yet unanimity prevailed when it came to the question of how to combat international terrorism while also maintaining our common values.
A society such as our own is pluralistic and open.
The public's right to security is, of course, one of the fundamental freedoms, but how can that security be guaranteed?
Although this is an area that can, perhaps, be regulated only by the Member States, it is becoming more and more apparent - as a number of your Members have indicated - that there is a need for coordination, that is to say, for cooperation across borders, which also includes cross-border cooperation between Europe and the United States.
If we are to talk today about the causes of terrorism, it might be said that there is a holistic and long-term approach to it.
One of your Members warned that perhaps the wrong measures might be taken under the heading of 'prevention', which I see as a very important consideration.
I would like to go back to the example of last November's Tripoli conference between the African Union and the European Union on the subject of migration.
How we handle 'good governance' in these countries and give their peoples the prospect of education and work, are major issues.
Do they actually have any prospects at all?
Or are they the potential victims of those whose promises to them ultimately result in their deaths?
This I see as something from which the European Union cannot avert its gaze.
As in many other areas, there was vigorous debate among us a number of years ago concerning the European security strategy, when we came to agree that the fight against international terrorism is essential, but also that it called for a highly graduated range of instruments, one of which is prevention.
None of these measures, however, can be activated at the press of a button, and they cannot be put into effect overnight.
Doing so will demand staying power and proper coordination.
I would now like to follow up a number of things that both the Commission and I - in my introductory remarks - mentioned, one of which has to do with the importance of establishing what role the United Nations is to play in this.
What else can we do?
I think it is important that Members of your House - not alone, but with others - should continue a dialogue on this subject with your counterparts in other regions that may perhaps also be suffering from terrorism.
In saying this, I am thinking back to the establishment of the Europe-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, where one important approach might be to discuss these issues and arrive at an agreement on how to institute coordination and cooperation.
Let me, once more, sound a note of warning against simplistic answers and quick fixes.
What is needed within the European Union is preparation for the long haul and a coordinated approach.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - International terrorism is like a deadly disease. We often see it as someone else's misfortune until it strikes home.
Ultimately, however, in a direct or indirect way all countries, and even institutions, are drawn into the cauldron.
Terrorism knows no borders and is indiscriminate.
One has only to review the names of those who died in 9/11 to realise that the victims derived from so many different countries and adhered to all the major religions.
Can we talk, however, of a war on terror?
In war your enemies are known.
In terrorist scenarios these are unknown.
A main topic of public international law is the Laws of War.
This is completely alien when dealing with terrorists.
However we have managed to produce some form of legal approach in combating terrorism.
One of the more meaningful documents was adopted in Barcelona having regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism.
The participating countries made no less than 21 obligations to fight terrorism.
Perhaps this should act as a blueprint and if these obligations are adhered to at least one region will be earnestly addressing this calamity.
EC-Russia short-stay visa agreement - EC-Russia readmission agreement (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report by Mrs da AssunÃ§Ã£o Esteves, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas - C6-0169/2006 -, and
the report by Mrs da AssunÃ§Ã£o Esteves, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on readmission - C6-0168/2006 -.
Mr President, on this occasion, I am speaking on behalf of both the Commission and the Council, both of which are entirely supportive of your House's concerns as regards respect for human rights in the Russian Federation, and confirm that respect for human rights is fundamental to the implementation of the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation relating to visa facilitation and readmission.
You will be able carefully to monitor compliance with this aspect of the readmission agreement and of the agreement on visa facilitation through the joint committees set up pursuant to them, and, under the second of the two, you will also be keeping an eye on the principle of mutuality in the implementation of the agreement, on equal treatment in the registration of citizens of the European Union and of the Russian Federation and on the free movement of persons within the territory of the latter.
Respect for human rights and basic freedoms is fundamental to relations between the European Union and Russia as a whole, which are underpinned by the partnership and cooperation agreements and by the timetables for the shared areas.
The European Union and the Russian Federation have also, in accordance with the timetable for the common area of freedom, security and justice, agreed to step up their cooperation through respect for the rights of individuals in the EU Member States and Russia, including those of immigrants and members of minorities, as well as respect for fundamental rights and freedoms as described in the Convention on Human Rights and Basic Freedoms and in the International Convention against all forms of racial discrimination.
The same timetable also makes reference to the promotion of cooperation in protecting the rights of children, in connection with which soundings have been taken to consider the possibility of accession to international agreements on the subject.
Another opportunity for putting general questions to Russia is afforded to the European Union by the human rights consultations between the two, which are held every six months.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mrs Esteves, and the rapporteurs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Pinior and Mr Vatanen, for their reports on visa facilitation and readmission agreements.
They reflect the European Parliament's concerns and the advice to which the Commission will pay great attention in monitoring the implementation of the two agreements.
I wish to confirm the joint Council-Commission statement that was just heard by you, that Vice-President Frattini and I have addressed to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the request of its chairman, Mr Cavada.
I would not underestimate the concerns the European Union has over the human rights situation in Russia.
We remain worried about the shortcomings regarding in particular the rule of law and media freedom in Russia.
I understand and share the concerns raised by the European Parliament in this regard.
The Commission has always looked to the European Parliament as an ally in its promotion of the principles of democracy and the universality of human rights in our relations with partner countries such as Russia.
For their own sake, but also because they are cornerstones of peace and human development, they are indeed agreed common values and the foundations of the long-term strategic partnership which the European Union wants to have with Russia.
Since the beginning, the Commission has been and will continue to emphasise to the Russian authorities that our strategic partnership is based on common values which underpin EU-Russia relations as enshrined in the partnership and cooperation agreement and in the four Common Spaces roadmaps.
They explicitly foresee the strengthening of our cooperation through respect of individual rights in the EU Member States and Russia.
The readmission agreement fully respects human rights and fundamental freedoms and is consistent with the EU's human rights policies.
Article 18 of the agreement explicitly clarifies that it is without prejudice to the rights, obligations and responsibilities of the Community, the Member States and the Russian Federation arising from international law, in particular from the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1984 UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
The practical implementation of the readmission agreement will fall under the exclusive competence of the Member States and Russia's national authorities.
All of those authorities are directly bound by the above-mentioned international instruments and their individual return decisions are subject to judicial review before national courts.
As far as asylum seekers are concerned, I would like to clarify that they are not included in the scope of the readmission agreement.
They have for the duration of their asylum procedure a temporary right to stay in the territory of Member States.
The agreement covers only illegal immigrants, that means people who do not or no longer fulfil the conditions in force for entry to, presence in, or residence in the territory.
In the case of asylum applications at the border, the principle of non refoulement has in particular to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article 18 of the Agreement.
Honourable Members, the extension of our common borders after the EU enlargement has of course broadened the scope of our cooperation with Russia.
Russia is, and should be, a strategic partner and an important neighbour to the European Union.
Now migration policy and movement of people have become strategic priorities for the EU's external relations in general and with Russia in particular.
I firmly believe that only by engaging with Russia can we achieve real results in those areas of common concern.
Through visa facilitation, we are decisively contributing to the common objective of building a new Europe without dividing lines and facilitating travel among our citizens.
We are fostering trust and dialogue.
People-to-people contacts are intensifying and our economic and societal interaction is increasing to the benefit of all our citizens.
Through readmission we are effectively fighting illegal migration, contributing to joint migration management.
Finally, the first agreement on visa facilitation ever negotiated by the Community and the first readmission agreement concluded with a major partner country are tangible signs of our practical cooperation within the aforementioned common space on freedom, security and justice.
They are evidence of our resolve to successfully address common challenges with Russia.
They will remain, I think, as landmark, sectoral agreements within the overall new architecture provided by the strategic agreement on which we hope to launch negotiations with Russia soon.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Parliament debated the agreements on facilitating visas and the readmission of illegal immigrants concluded between the EU and the Russian Federation.
With the active intervention of most of the committee members and with the special help of Mr Lax, Mr Vatanen and Mrs Roure, whom I wish to thank, the debate was far from routine.
It was a troubled debate because the Russian Federation's political landscape, and its difficult relationship with democracy and human rights, was never far from people's thoughts.
Firstly, Parliament was only consulted when it was no longer possible to influence the content of the agreements.
The Commission and the Council need to bring these agreements to us at an earlier stage, as part of the institutional cooperation laid down in the Treaties.
We know that the still intergovernmental nature of the Union's external policy does not accord us all of the powers of a true Parliament.
The day will come when it does, once the European Constitution crisis is over.
The wording of the agreements, and the political landscape surrounding them, raises a number of questions for Parliament to address.
The agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas does not guarantee genuine reciprocity between the EU and the Russian Federation, either with its wording or in terms of the way in which events are predicted to happen.
Obtaining visas in the Russian Federation is a dreadfully complex process: mandatory registration on every journey within Russia, surcharges, additional permits, in particular for travel to Chechnya and certain parts of Eastern Russia, invitations for admission, which are conducive to corruption, bureaucratic obstacles; in short, one hurdle after another.
As we all know, simplifying visas in Russia involves a veil of uncertainty.
What Parliament would like and expects to see is strong commitment on the part of the Commission and the Council to lobby the Russian authorities.
In spite of all the difficulties, Parliament welcomes the spirit of openness that the visa facilitation arrangements will bring to relations between our peoples.
It is the kind of openness needed for a new Europe, for a broader Europe, for that justice on a broad scale that we all want to build.
The agreements on the readmission of immigrants also aroused passionate debate in the Committee on Civil Liberties.
We rejected the simplistic and dangerous classification of this agreement as being a merely technical agreement; an agreement dealing with people is, by definition, never technical, and this is particularly true of those on illegal immigrants, which brings to life the human misery of poverty and social exclusion.
The misfortune of some affects us all.
If there is one area in which guarantees of human rights can be vulnerable it is precisely in this area of immigration.
Parliament is concerned precisely about the guarantees of human rights in the accelerated readmission procedure and about respect for the status in international law of asylum seekers and stateless persons.
The speed of the procedure is not a value; people's dignity throughout the process is a value, which must be characterised by rights during the ordeal of illegal immigration, namely the right to defence, humane treatment in detention, family unity, and physical and psychological inviolability.
This is why the Joint Readmission Committee, which the agreement mentions, must include a human rights monitoring component, by which I mean active monitoring, because this is Europe's identity - it is what defines Europe.
Human rights are the only criterion by which compliance with the agreements and the good faith of the parties can be measured.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a political act is always conditioned by circumstances, and in this case the circumstance is the EU looking for its own energy and a Russian Federation stubbornly refusing to sign essential declarations on human rights.
Yet the Union's silence on this matter would be tantamount to a negation of its culture of rights.
The Union must not silence this culture.
In any part of the world, realpolitik must not endlessly challenge our ideals.
A joint compromise declaration by the Council and the Commission, such as the one that is promised and that accompanies Parliament's decision, is the most important step that we have taken today.
Is it a small step or giant leap?
The answer lies with the ethical conscience of the main players - only time will tell.
Mr President, I was expecting to have less time to speak, so now I shall give more time to the other speakers.
As you had two reports, you were entitled to two times five minutes, making ten minutes, but you were concise and fulfilled your task very well.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we examine objectively the Agreement we have reached, there is no denying that it is a step in the right direction, albeit a very modest one.
We have to remember that the original proposal was very modest in scope.
One of the three main things that still cause difficulties for travellers in Russia is the registration requirement.
How can travellers today still be required to register with the police at different places?
In practice, this completely prevents normal motoring in Russia.
The Russian Federation recently introduced a law which prevents undesirable persons from entering Russia.
What criteria are being used, though?
Is entry into Russia denied to those who have found fault with Russia, the Kremlin, Putin or his speech at Munich?
Are these the criteria used to make someone an undesirable person in Russia?
There are regions in Russia, such as Chechnya and other areas, where travellers cannot even go.
What is hard to take in this whole situation is the fact that this reflects the relationship between the EU and Russia.
It shows how we are unable to resolve problems on an equal footing.
The Commission spoke fine words about common values, but where are they exactly?
If we had common values, we would also be able to conclude balanced agreements that served the interests of both sides and our common future.
If we accept such one-sided agreements as this one, we will actually slow down Russia's transition to the rule of law.
In this Agreement there are echoes of a time gone by, and if we take an honest look at our partnership and its development, we will need to start drawing up a new agreement immediately.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (PL) Mr President, I was the author of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Council's decision concerning the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation on readmission.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs welcomed the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation on readmission, in parallel to the visa facilitation agreement.
This represents a further step toward completing the creation of an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, within the framework of the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs also believes that it is necessary to enhance the capacity of the Russian Federation in the field of migration management, in order for its authorities to be able to fulfil the obligations stipulated in the readmission agreement, as soon as this agreement enters into force.
The committee was also concerned about the absence of regulatory framework provisions for implementing the Agreement.
The European Commission should seek to provide the Russian authorities with the necessary expertise in order for the country to be in a position to meet its obligations according to accepted international standards.
That is the most important matter to be dealt with at present.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (LT) I would like to talk about the readmission agreement between the European Union and Russia; although in fact, both agreements - on readmission and on simplification of the issuing procedures of short term visas - are being considered together.
Relations between the European Union and Russia cover an increasing number of areas.
If we want these relations to be truly successful, it is necessary for them to be dominated by values, not just technical aspects.
Only in this way will we be able to achieve the goal of creating a more open Europe, which respects basic values and is able to change the world in a positive way.
In my opinion, the basic problem relating to the readmission agreement between the European Union and Russia is that it is unclear whether the primary focus is human rights or whether priority is being given to a generalised approach to refoulement of individuals, that is, priority is given to security considerations rather than to humanitarian aspects.
I fully understand that when readmission agreements are being drafted, the temptation to equate illegal migration with criminal activity must be resisted.
Similarly, when such agreements are being drafted, there should not be an inclination to focus on the issue of refoulement as a cornerstone of migration policy.
In our endeavours to obtain satisfactory statistical results, we must still pay particular attention to human rights, that is, practical considerations should not upstage moral considerations.
It only takes a single case of non-respect for human rights to raise a concern.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think it is necessary to mention one major failing: the fact that there is no system of regulation by which the agreement could be implemented.
I believe that in principle this agreement could be supported, but I would like to emphasise once more that it is imperative for the Russian Federation to strengthen its migration controls, so that its government bodies are able to respect the commitments that they will have to enter into from the day the readmission agreement becomes operational.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Gloser, I must say that the two international agreements with Russia that you are presenting to us today, one on the measures aimed at facilitating the issuance of visas and the other on readmission, have made us extremely worried.
The European Union's cooperating with Russia must result in the protection of fundamental rights, including the rights of migrants and asylum seekers, being promoted more effectively.
Admittedly, these agreements enable progress to be made, in particular on the price of visas and the simplification of the procedure, but several problems remain.
Indeed, the events that took place recently in Russia show that freedom of the press and freedom of expression are not systematically guaranteed there.
Europe must therefore keep issuing strong demands to ensure that human rights are protected.
You responded to some of our concerns in your statement.
The Commission has committed itself to guaranteeing reciprocity in the implementation of the agreement on visas, equal treatment regarding registration procedures and free movement within Russia.
Obviously, I would have liked firmer commitments to have been made, particularly on the protection of migrants and the rights of children.
I am particularly concerned by the accelerated procedure provided for by the readmission agreement.
Will the Commission ensure, moreover, that this procedure complies with the principle of non-refoulement?
We also requested clearer commitments for visas, which, in the long run, would have meant putting a stop to the invitation and registration system and simplifying the procedure for bona fide travellers.
Finally, I must once again reiterate our Parliament's dissatisfaction with the fact that we were simply consulted on these international agreements, and this, long after they had been concluded.
Prior consultation of the European Parliament during the negotiations would also - it must be said - lead to greater democratic control.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the right to travel within Europe is an issue of absolutely fundamental importance to our lives.
The fact that the EU is now discussing visa facilitation agreements with its eastern neighbour is, of course, a good thing.
It cannot be emphasised enough how important visa rules, in particular, are for the way in which the European Union is perceived by the surrounding world and for the way in which the third country, in this case Russia, is perceived by EU citizens.
For anyone who travels in the EU's border regions, this is often the first issue they encounter.
We parliamentarians have a big responsibility. It is our responsibility to assess the agreement and its actual content.
It is no secret that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has not been happy.
In practice, European travellers to Russia encounter two problems if they are not on a group visit.
They have to have an invitation from a Russian organisation or individual.
What ordinary EU citizen has such contacts?
The second obstacle is that they have to register with a Russian local authority within three days of their arrival, and this can take several days.
What are they to do if they are not in Moscow or St Petersburg?
None of these issues is addressed by the agreement.
We must be clear that the agreement is a declaration and not a document with significant content.
If I guess correctly, many people in this House too believe that the agreement involves visa facilitation for all young people and all students.
That is not the case.
Only those who already have study places would experience some limited relaxation of visa requirements, and, in such cases, visits could not, in any case, exceed 90 days.
There are not many study programmes like that.
In spite of all the shortcomings, Parliament has shown a constructive attitude.
We understand the importance of sending out a political signal.
However, it is important for all our citizens that the Commission and the Council should undertake single-mindedly to bring about an appreciable relaxation of visa requirements, beginning now and extending into the future.
Without such a pledge, the ALDE Group will vote against the proposals.
The Commission and the Council have put forward a declaration that is partially in keeping with Parliament's wishes.
I do, however, have a question for Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: what is the next step that you now intend to take in order to abolish in practice the duty of registration and the system involving invitations?
Both issues are, of course, relevant to the general, overarching objective of the whole agreement, namely that of abolishing the visa system.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the agreements currently being debated are a very important step towards a closer relationship between the European Union and Russia, especially as their adoption will make it significantly easier for people to cross the border.
That is the theory.
However, in practice, the situation is not ideal in several respects.
Travel to certain regions of the Russian Federation, notably to Chechnya, will still require additional permits, and the reasons for such decisions by the Russian authorities are surely obvious.
The agreement on facilitation does not contain a reciprocal clause on human rights and democracy, which ought to appear in agreements between the Union and third countries as a matter of course.
It is also difficult to understand why the Joint Readmission Committee is not authorised to monitor compliance with human rights and why individuals seeking political asylum are covered by the Agreement.
It would appear that practical and technical matters were prioritised during work on the aforementioned documents, whilst issues relating to respect for the dignity of human beings were sidelined, although they ought to be at the heart of all agreements, especially those entered into with Russia.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur for her consistent work in preparing Parliament's opinion under consideration.
As a shadow rapporteur, I am especially satisfied that, following a two-hour discussion with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, my proposal to mention the requirement to undergo a mandatory registration procedure as being a serious obstacle to travel within Russia and the EU has been taken into account.
The requirement to undergo registration in Russia has become an enormous problem for those EU citizens applying for private short-stay visas to Russia.
Latvian citizens and non-citizens know this problem from their own negative experience since many of us, especially Russian speakers, mainly go to Russia in order to visit our relatives and friends living there.
The new law on migration registration of foreign nationals and stateless persons in the Russian Federation entered into force recently, on 15 January of this year.
The law provides some facilitation of the registration procedure and abolishes registration fees but, nevertheless, the system as such is preserved.
Unfortunately, such a system is reciprocal, since some EU Member States also demand the registration of certain categories of third-country nationals.
Both the Russian and EU sides have to make immediate efforts to find a solution for essential facilitation of movement of people between our countries.
Nevertheless, since some facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas is better than none at all, our political group is supporting the agreement on this.
On the other hand, we maintain our principal reservations with respect to the agreement on readmission.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, nationals of both the EU countries and Russia are required to have visas to travel.
Russia has actively called for visa-free travel.
To facilitate the granting of visas, we first have to have reciprocal agreements, examples of which are the proposals now before us.
The reports by the parliamentary committees condemn the situation regarding the rule of law - its absence, in fact - in Russia.
They voice the concern that visas may not be granted for free civil action.
They also criticise the compulsory registration procedure and complain about the lack of any rules to implement the Agreement on readmission, human rights problems and so on.
It would seem that the time is not yet ripe for visa-free travel.
As long as visas are required, they need to be made easy and cheap for law-abiding citizens to acquire.
We should be wary of making visas a political issue.
(PL) Mr President, reciprocity and solidarity are two values that should be crucial to relations between the European Union and Russia.
They are also essential conditions for such a relationship.
Reciprocity underpins all international relations.
I cannot conceive of agreements between states in which their mutual rights and responsibilities were not presented as being of equal value.
Any imbalance would immediately cause an outcry.
I am therefore quite certain that the principle of reciprocity must be observed in agreements between the Union and the Russian Federation.
I believe there are two aspects that should be considered in relation to the second value, namely solidarity.
Firstly, there is the solidarity between the Member States of the Union, who gave their consent for both agreements to be drafted.
I am glad that my own country, Poland, took part in this process.
We have been Russia's neighbour for centuries, and there have been ups and downs in our relationship, as is often the case with neighbours.
These agreements prove that we wish to have a good and normal neighbourly relationship with Russia.
The second aspect to consider is the solidarity between the citizens of the Union and the citizens of the Russian Federation.
We will demonstrate this solidarity if we treat Russian citizens as people who are travelling around the Union in good faith, and facilitate their entry and stay amongst us.
I should like to emphasise that the citizens of the new Member States are particularly aware of what a blessing freedom of travel is.
We know what reducing border crossing formalities means and we value it a great deal.
We wish to share those benefits with the Russian citizens, on the basis of the principle of reciprocity and respect for human rights.
I think Parliament should support these agreements, because they create a good neighbour policy for the Union.
(FI) Mr President, relations between the EU and Russia have not made any progress for a long time now.
For this reason, the Agreements before us now are important, even though they are rather undemanding in terms of their content.
It is very regrettable that the EU and Russia have not as yet got round to negotiating arrangements for the new agreement between them.
There need to be continued efforts to commence talks.
The delay in negotiations on this new agreement should not, however, be a reason for preventing both sides from developing their vital partnership.
The new strategic partnership can and must also be structured within the framework of the current Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, resolving the issue of visa facilitation and readmission is an important task that would promote the consolidation of common values.
Both the debate and the answers given by the Commission and the Council show, however, that in truth nothing has been achieved in discussions with Russia - neither a registration procedure nor a simplification of the invitation system.
That has been left to rely on Russia's goodwill.
It is not clear why Russia has been given a transition period for the readmission of persons from third countries.
Our report of May 2005 on relations between the European Union and Russia stressed that the European Parliament was repeating its call on Russia to ratify the border agreement with Estonia and to sign and ratify the border agreement with Latvia without delay.
I believe that the demarcation of borders and the conclusion of a readmission agreement are preconditions for the signing of a visa facilitation agreement.
In this respect Russia has not displayed any initiative, but has just dictated its conditions to both countries.
Since Parliament has been placed in a totally humiliating position, we believe that it is not possible to support these agreements - a lot of serious work still remains to be done on them.
(CS) Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, from my point of view, the agreement on the facilitation of the visa process with Russia is, despite all the comments and reservations that have been expressed, a step forward.
It demonstrates that it is possible for the European Union and Russia to reach a compromise even on complex issues.
Furthermore, let us answer the following question: do we want to make it easier, quicker and cheaper for students, scientists, businesspeople and family members to have access to visas?
I believe the answer is yes.
Otherwise, access will be selective, something that we in the Czech Republic know all about in our relations with the EU.
For example, the process of joining Schengen was slow and fraught with difficulties.
Naturally, as someone who has spent many years in Russia and as a member of the Delegation for relations with Russia, I am well aware of the complications regarding visas and I therefore believe that simplifying at least part of the visa process is better than nothing.
Thank you.
(LT) The European Union is bringing down the barriers that hinder people of good will from associating with each other.
After five years of negotiations with Russia, the 'visa wall' between the EU and Russia has become a little lower.
Once the visa simplification and readmission agreements come into force, a sizeable group of people will be able to travel and interact easier.
Those who are still disadvantaged are Kaliningrad residents who wish to visit Lithuania and Poland, and Lithuanians and Poles who wish to visit Kaliningrad.
At the moment there is no charge for visas, but the agreement, which is supposed to make things easier for them, will actually impose the hardship of a EUR 35 charge for a visa.
This goes against the principles of cross-border cooperation and against the Kaliningrad region's anti-isolationist policy, which interests both Russia and the EU.
Vilnius, Warsaw, Brussels and Berlin, as well as Moscow, are trying to negotiate bilateral solutions within the margin of flexibility of the Schengen Agreement provisions.
Lithuania has led the way as the first and only EU nation so far to have a readmission agreement with Russia.
Three years of experience have been positive.
Since the agreement has been in force, the Lithuanian-Russian border has been crossed by almost 2 million people; however, not once have the provisions of the agreement needed to be invoked.
I agree with a number of colleagues who have sharply criticised the agreement, especially for the lack of sufficient nexus to human rights and liberties.
Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction.
On the long road toward the 'demolition of the visa wall' there are still a lot of obstacles.
EU citizens coming to Russia have to register, and if they want to visit certain regions, extra permits are needed.
These 'hidden' internal visas need to be done away with, because they restrict EU citizens' freedom of movement.
This issue must be talked about honestly.
Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for the many important things you have said, but also for being realistic enough to see that it is not, of course, possible to agree on everything.
The fact is that all of us would have liked to see something in line with our own thinking, and, as indeed one speaker said earlier on, all this is an important step forward, but we need many more of them.
It is clear from the joint statement by the Commission and the Council that we had, in various areas, due regard to the principle of mutuality, which is an important one.
What is equally important is respect for human rights, and of that you rightly reminded us.
While I do not wish to confuse these two considerations, they are, of course, connected in some way.
The importance of dialogue with Russia has already been highlighted in various debates.
Although demands are always being made that we should get our way on various fronts, if, for example, there is still no go-ahead given for the negotiation of the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, there is no possibility of our making demands, expressing aspirations, or putting forward what you have requested, and it is for that reason that it is high time that the green light was given.
I hope that we will be able to find a suitable solution to the problem that still hangs over this issue.
Even though there may be things that we cannot accept as regards respect for human rights, there is nonetheless the twice-yearly human rights consultation between the European Union and Russia, which present an opportunity for raising such issues.
Some of you made reference to the issue of bureaucratisation.
While we would, of course, have wished to do many things differently in this area, the regime has nonetheless been relaxed as regards necessary invitations, and I am sure that the Commissioner will have something more to say about this.
This has not, of course, been done to the extent that some of you demanded, but it is nonetheless evident from this that we are making progress, albeit often with only small steps, for it is small steps forward that are called for in dialogue, particularly with Russia.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, I have taken good note of the many concerns you have expressed, but let me first say that Article 300(1) of the EC Treaty clearly states that negotiations on international agreements on matters falling under Community competence are conducted by the Commission on the basis of negotiating directives approved by the Council.
The European Parliament needs to be consulted before the conclusion of the agreement, as laid down in paragraph 3 of that article.
This provision also applies in areas of codecision, so in my view the procedures set up by the EC Treaty have been fully respected, both on readmission and on visa facilitation.
I wanted to say that, because it came up in the discussion.
At the same time, however, I can also reiterate that of course we are at your disposal to provide any relevant information, even during the ongoing negotiations.
I also fully share the view that the promotion and the safeguard of human rights in our relationships with Russia, and in connection with those agreements in particular, are of course a fundamental aspect.
The Commission, assisted by the EU Member States, will therefore monitor this issue very closely in the context of the joint committees set up by the agreements and, of course, human dignity - the dignity of the human being - is certainly very important here and has priority.
Furthermore, the regular semi-annual consultations between the European Union and Russia on human rights are always an occasion where we can address broader concerns with Russia and human rights issues are always raised at the Summit and at ministerial levels, as appropriate.
The visa facilitation agreement constitutes a real improvement of the status quo.
It is indeed, as our colleague said, a step forward.
It contains important facilitations for issuing short-stay visas which will then apply on a reciprocal basis to citizens of the Schengen Member States and of the Russian Federation.
Some of these facilitations apply to all visa applicants and others to specific categories who have a particular interest in travelling, while the agreement provides for legally binding rights and obligations, which will ensure somewhat greater flexibility in the visa procedures.
I wish to draw your attention in particular to the fact that we, the Commission, have managed to negotiate important visa facilitation for journalists, for instance, who will no longer require an invitation or a validation by the Russian authorities, and special attention will also be paid to effective reciprocity in the implementation of the agreement, equal treatment regarding registration procedures for EU and Russian nationals and the free movement of persons within Russian territory.
You raised two topics, namely registration requirements and the removal of invitations.
I would like to just say that the agreement includes a commitment to simplify the registration procedures, with a view to ensuring equal treatment for EU and Russian citizens, and I would like to remind you that the Schengen acquis also imposes a general obligation for aliens to register.
We have raised this issue with the Russian authorities on several occasions and new legislation, which entered into force in Russia last month, is already in place to simplify these procedures.
According to this law, an appearance in person will no longer be required for registration.
Of course, we will now monitor and seek further clarification of these rules.
I would also like to say that the visa facilitation agreement introduces another important change, namely the fact that validation of invitations by the Russian authorities is no longer required.
In comparison with the current situation, where the invitation from the Russian host needs to be validated, this is, I think, a great improvement for a large category of citizens.
Of course, the agreement does not abolish the invitations and their validation for all EU citizens applying for Russian visas.
However, it should be borne in mind that the Schengen acquis also requires any person applying for a visa to justify the purpose of the travel and present supporting documents.
I also would like to say that the readmission agreement contains important elements for humane and more effective return management in the future and I would just like to reiterate what I said at the beginning.
In the case of asylum applications at the border, the principle of non refoulement has to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article 18 of the agreement.
So it is clear that this will be an important aspect.
I could go on giving you all the details, because I have listened very carefully.
However, I think this matter has already been discussed in the LIBE Committee, so just let me say that I hope the House will follow the committee's recommendation and give a positive opinion on both agreements.
It will make a change for our citizens and ultimately this may be what matters most.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (ET) The groundwork for the agreement signed between the European Union and Russia concerning the facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas was laid in May 2003 at the St Petersburg summit.
The agreement was intended as part of a process that was designed to strengthen relations between the parties through the creation of a common area founded on freedom, security and justice.
I see an agreement, but not the common area that was meant to arise.
Parliament will not retreat from its repeated demand that international agreements signed on behalf of the European Union contain a mutual human rights and democracy clause.
The agreement on the facilitation of the issuing of short-stay visas with Russia does not contain that clause.
At the same time, Russia has paid lip service to a significant requirement of the European Union's visa facilitation policy, according to which the agreement on readmission should already have been concluded, or be at the active negotiating stage.
The readmission agreement was proposed by Parliament together with the visa facilitation agreement.
In addition, Russia has been granted a very generous transition period before the actual commencement of readmission.
I repeatedly drew attention to the absurd situation according to which the European Union makes it easier for Russian citizens to cross a border that Russia itself does not recognise.
Moscow has not yet ratified the Estonian-Russian Border Treaty.
Logically, the recognition of that border should be the precondition for the establishment and amendment of the border regime.
In order to support democracy, 16 years ago the European Union and the United States adopted an approach that treated Russia as a promising young country.
This overly generous treatment continues, though it is no longer appropriate.
It is in Europe's interests to treat Russia as a full partner that must fulfil its international obligations just like any other.
Economic policy guidelines for 2007 - Member States' employment policies (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report by Mr Bullmann, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the situation of the European economy: preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines for 2007, and
the report by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States - C6-0036/2007 - 2006/0271(CNS].
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to make a few comments on your Members' reports on the economic policy guidelines for 2007.
You will recall that it was last December that the Commission presented its annual report on the Lisbon process, in which it discusses the progress that has been made with the Lisbon Strategy across the Community and in the Member States, and also makes recommendations specific to individual countries on economic and employment policy, which will be elaborated by the ECOFIN Council and by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection Council jointly, although each Council configuration will concentrate on matters within its own remit.
We are therefore glad to see that your House has given thought to these economic policy guidelines, and, in addition to this debate today, we will also have another opportunity for exchanging views at the Troika meeting on 26 February.
The Commission's progress report met with broad approval from the ECOFIN Council when it met in January.
In particular, we can endorse the report's fundamentally positive outlook.
The first concrete results of the reform process are becoming visible across the EU and in the Member States, in that we can see the beginnings of an overall improvement in the economy and employment in the European Union as the renewed Lisbon Strategy bears fruit.
It nevertheless has to be said - as it was yesterday in various ways - that there is no reason for complacency.
We should be set on using the present favourable economic position as a means for accomplishing further reforms, and this is made all the more important by the prospect of demographic change presenting financial policy with considerable challenges.
What is needed in order to consolidate the long-term sustainability of public finance is a three-pillar strategy, in other words a combination of reform of the pension and health care system, reduction of state debt and enhanced employment and productivity, while the quality of public finance needs to be improved by restructuring public budgets with a greater bias towards expenditure that promotes productivity and innovation and builds up human resources, and so the country-specific recommendations are a good instrument for moving the modernisation of our economy forward and enhancing the European Union's ability to hold its own in global competition.
Starting with Mr Bullmann's report, there are two aspects of it on which I should like to comment briefly.
Firstly, one point made in it is that financial and economic policy needs to be better coordinated, especially within the euro zone.
Demands that this be done come as no surprise to me, for they have been made repeatedly over the years, but, if one considers closely the present situation, it quickly becomes evident that there is no lack of coordination procedures in the economic and monetary union; indeed, there are too many of them rather than too few, with, for example, the economic policy guidelines - which we are discussing today - and the budget policy monitoring procedure, to name but two.
What matters most of all in practice is that these procedures be applied consistently and effectively, and, by presenting its country-specific recommendations, the Commission has taken the first step to this end.
My second point has more to do with the institutions; it relates to the concrete proposal in Mr Bullmann's report for the setting-up, following the Spring Summit, of an interinstitutional working party to consider the review of the Integrated Guidelines scheduled for 2008.
Far be it from me to give a final evaluation of this proposal today; I am sure you will understand that it is an in-depth examination, rather than a personal estimate, that is called for, but I have to say that it does not, at first sight, appear to me to be wholly compatible with the way work is shared out between the institutions under the Treaties.
Quite apart from that, though, the fact of the matter is that communication between the Council and your House has constantly improved over recent years, something attributable not least to the troika meetings and sittings such as this one.
I am also aware, however, that there is always progress to be made.
Let me now turn to Mr Andersson's report.
As required by Article 128(2) of the European Communities Treaty, the Council, acting on the Commission's proposal, lays down every year guidelines that the Member States follow in their employment policy.
In order, however, to ensure the continuity needed for proper implementation, it was agreed in 2002 that the employment policy guidelines would, in principle, be altered only every three years.
It was also agreed that they should be brought into line with the economic policy guidelines.
It was on this basis that, in 2005, the first integrated guidelines were laid down for the period from then to 2008.
In 2006, then, the Commission proposed that the employment policy guidelines laid down in 2005 should be left unchanged.
Your House has repeatedly urged that it be allowed sufficient time to carefully elaborate its position, since the tight deadlines involved in the annual employment cycle usually made it necessary to invoke the urgency procedure.
There has been an exchange of letters on this subject between your House and the Council.
For 2008, your House has asked for more time for a hearing, on the grounds that it will involve a comprehensive triennial examination of the employment policy guidelines, and we will consult with the Commission when considering this.
A position on the timetable for the procedure in 2008 is unfortunately not available at the present time.
This year, it is to be expected that the Council, as soon as the opinions of your House, ECOSOC, the Committee of the Regions and of the Employment Committee are forthcoming, will, at the 30/31 May Council meeting, be able to achieve policy agreement on the employment policy guidelines for 2007, which would then be formally adopted before summer this year.
As Mr Andersson indeed stated in his report, the fact is that - quite apart from previous successes in terms of more people in work and fewer people out of it - there is a need for further purposeful effort if the goals set are to be achieved within the European Union.
By way of conclusion, I would like once more to emphasise that these include, in particular, an increase in the participation of young people and older persons in the labour market, together with an improvement in the compatibility of work and family life.
While I am aware that this is right at the top of the agenda in many Member States, I am also aware that there are those in which action is needed in this area.
Mr President, with your permission, I shall speak in my mother tongue.
(ES) Ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating jointly the report by Mr Bullmann, on the broad economic policy guidelines, and the report by Mr Andersson, on the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States.
Both reports are based on last December's Commission Communication on the implementation by the Member States of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, and the integrated guidelines for 2005-2008, which was approved by the Council following consultation of this Parliament and on the proposal of the Commission.
Today's debate is taking place during the weeks leading up to the Spring European Council of 8 March and involves cooperating in the preparations for that Council.
Just this morning, this Parliament adopted a resolution expressing this Parliament's assessment of the implementation to date of the renewed Lisbon Strategy and stressing the areas and policies in which decisive action by the Member States and the European Union is needed.
It is important to stress that the reports that we are debating today and the opinion of this Parliament and of the European Commission are in agreement on a series of fundamental points.
Firstly, both Parliament and the Commission acknowledge the results that we are beginning to see, both in terms of economic growth and in terms of employment, thanks to the application of the policies agreed within the renewed framework of the Lisbon Strategy and thanks in particular to the budgetary consolidation and structural reform efforts made by the majority of Member States.
Just yesterday, Eurostat published the European Union's GDP growth figures for the fourth quarter of 2006.
That information indicates that the joint growth for 2006 was practically 3%.
That would represent the highest rhythm of increase in our GDP since the Lisbon Strategy was launched in 2000.
Although Parliament and the Commission are in agreement, we must nevertheless be sure to emphasise this point, to emphasise the fact that we are beginning to see the positive results of the strategies implemented a few years ago.
It is important that the citizens receive the message that the efforts made since the Stability and Growth Pact was implemented, since the Lisbon Strategy was implemented - efforts that have not always been easy to accept or understand - are yielding fruit and helping to strengthen the European social model within the context of globalisation.
Many of the difficulties faced by the European project in terms of public opinion over recent times result from the fear amongst the citizens, in certain sectors of our society, that globalisation is lowering standards in a way that undermines the foundations of our social model, and that the European Union and the policies and strategies decided upon here are unable to prevent it.
Some people even accuse the European Union of provoking and speeding up that deterioration of the European social model.
The results we are seeing demonstrate clearly that that is not the case.
Those people who believe that Europe has become stagnant and that the rigidity of the labour markets is preventing job creation are also wrong.
The figures show that, since the euro was created on 1 January 1999, eight years ago now, the European Union has created four times as many jobs as it had created over the previous eight years.
Furthermore, during this decade, since the Lisbon Strategy was launched, the European Union has clearly been creating more jobs than the United States.
Some people describe the budgetary policies as restrictive and accuse the Stability and Growth Pact of slowing down economic growth, but the reality is that it is the countries with the best budgetary accounts, with budget surpluses, both in the euro zone and in the European Union as a whole, that for some time have been experiencing the highest levels of economic growth.
The truth is that fiscal consolidation makes progress and improves in parallel with the increase and improvement in our growth and job creation figures.
There has recently been a lot of talk about the strength of the euro against the dollar and the yen being an obstacle to our exports, but the fact is that the euro zone's trade balance, in relation to the United States, has improved again in 2006 and that the rise in oil prices has partly been compensated for by the rise in the value of the euro against the dollar.
In short, ladies and gentlemen, the improvement in our economies and the acceleration of job creation are clear evidence that the European social and economic model, with its high level of social protection and its environmental demands, is perfectly compatible with the globalisation of the economy and with economic growth.
Europe, its countries, our economies, have always worked better when they have opened up to the world and, now that the global economy is undergoing an unprecedented expansion, Europe and its citizens have much to gain from this opening up of our borders and the increased integration of our economies at global level.
Sending this message to the citizens is not just a way to vindicate the economic and social policies that we have been advocating over recent years: it is crucial in terms of increasing confidence in Europe's capacity to provide the European citizens with well-being and offers us a solid basis for strengthening the political will necessary in order to move ahead with the structural reforms laid down in the Lisbon Strategy.
The second point on which there is fundamental agreement between the reports we are debating today and the opinion of the European Commission is the need to enhance the reforms initiated through the implementation of national reform plans by the Member States.
In this regard, the dynamism of the emerging economies, the ageing of the population, the growth potential, which is still low, in many European economies, the continuing budgetary imbalances in certain Member States, the low growth in productivity and the segmentation of the labour market are some of the very powerful reasons for continuing to implement policies leading to greater innovation capacity, greater life-long training opportunities, better functioning of the markets and healthier public finances.
The third significant area of agreement between Parliament and the Commission relates to the need to act not just in each of the Member States, but also at European level, in order to make progress on achieving an internal market in sectors that are crucial to our economy, such as the energy sector and the financial services sector, in order to increase support for innovation, in order to create a more favourable environment for business activity and greater adaptability of the markets in products and services and of the labour market.
Of these priority areas for action at European level, the reports rightly place the emphasis on the issue of energy, which will be one of the key issues at the Spring European Council, which is going to debate the energy package proposed by the Commission on 10 January.
The degree of commitment and ambition demonstrated by the Heads of State or Government in terms of creating a genuine common energy policy will be decisive when it comes to assessing whether the response to the challenge of guaranteeing our energy supply, while at the same time tackling climate change, is credible.
When it comes to tackling these challenges, action by each of the Member States separately will clearly be insufficient and joint action at European level will therefore be required in order to defend the interests of the citizens properly.
Finally, both the report by Mr Bullmann and the report by Mr Andersson express the need for Parliament to be able to exercise its prerogatives properly when it comes to revising the integrated guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy, which is scheduled for next year.
I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission is fully committed, particularly those of us in the College who are directly involved with the Lisbon Strategy, Vice-President Verheugen, Commissioner Å pidla and myself, and we have a common desire to explore all possible ways to involve Parliament effectively in this revision.
I shall end, Mr President, by expressing my desire for this plenary to endorse the practically unanimous support of the respective committees for the reports by Mr Bullmann and Mr Andersson.
Through this support and through the high degree of consensus between Parliament and the Commission, we will be sending a clear signal to the European Council and to the citizens in general of the European Union's will and capacity to create a specific instrument to tackle the risks and take advantage of the opportunities presented by globalisation, while defending and enhancing Europe's economic progress and social cohesion.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Who would have guessed thirty-three years ago that we would be together in a debate like this in our respective posts?
rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, the report I have prepared on the employment guidelines is extremely short and has been accepted unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
It is really about how we are to deal with next year's employment guidelines and integrated guidelines, for our current guidelines are to remain unchanged this year, but next year we shall see a more radical review.
Just as Commissioner Almunia said, we therefore anticipate being able to devote a little more time to the issue, and we need more time in Parliament too.
That is something I really wish to emphasise, for there is a difference between the employment and the economic guidelines.
The employment guidelines cannot be adopted by the Council until Parliament has made its position known.
Constructive cooperation between the institutions is therefore required before next year.
We made things easier in the run-up to this year.
We did so last year too, when no great review took place.
Next year's review is to be a major one, so we are expecting cooperation extending over several months.
We have, in actual fact, already had a discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs between the coordinators and myself about not delaying in appointing a rapporteur to prepare the work before next year's changes.
I wish, for all that, nonetheless to say something about the situation, even if it is only addressed in the justification.
Things are genuinely going better for Europe.
Employment trends are more encouraging than they were a few years ago.
Unemployment is declining.
We have sound growth.
We must not forget, however, that there are still deficiencies which we must concentrate on remedying.
I am thinking of young people who leave school early and young people who become unemployed immediately their education is finished.
We know that, if they remain outside the labour market for a long time, it becomes incredibly difficult to get them back into it again.
I am thinking of the still considerable differences between the situations of men and women in the labour market.
I am thinking of people who have come to us from other parts of the world and who, even today, have problems entering the labour market due to the shortcomings of our integration policy.
I am thinking of people with disabilities, who are also excluded from the labour market.
I attended the informal Council of Ministers meeting involving the employment ministers, a meeting that addressed another aspect of employment, namely that we want jobs that are actually better.
It is true that we have more jobs, but we want higher-quality jobs too.
What, then, is meant by 'better jobs'?
The fact is, we mean jobs that offer living wages and jobs that entail professional development and offer the further training that is so necessary if people are to be able to cope successfully in the labour market.
We are also concerned here with good working environments and with giving employees the opportunity to exercise influence, both individually and through their trade unions.
The current trend towards more jobs does not always mean better jobs.
That is a state of affairs of which we are aware, and there are debates about it in quite a few countries, for example in Germany, which I visited recently.
I also know from my own country that a proportion of the new jobs are what are known as atypical and do not always provide a living wage or opportunities for further training.
The influence that people in these jobs are able to exercise is also fairly minimal.
We must, then, also concentrate on creating not only more jobs but also high-quality jobs.
Europe will never be able to compete in the world market by creating low-wage jobs and jobs that do not enable people to provide for themselves.
Instead, it will only be able to compete by creating high-quality jobs that offer, for example, further training and the opportunity to exercise influence.
This is a subject to which we intend to return next year when we carry out the more thorough review of employment trends, looking at more and better jobs and at groups that at present still have difficulty entering the labour market.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as Commissioner Almunia pointed out, we have, in practical terms, got our growth back up to 3%, and are therefore back on the course set by Lisbon.
It is this continuous 3% growth that we aimed to achieve by means of the Lisbon Strategy, enabling us to implement the social and economic reforms that are needed in order that everyone in Europe may benefit.
It is precisely because there were many years in which we did not achieve this that we need to remind ourselves that this will not happen on its own.
Much in this upturn has to do, in the first instance, with the economic cycle, and it is because we cannot be certain that it will continue that our report takes the line that action on our part is needed, that we need to manage and direct, that we must not take time out and allow the clock to keep ticking while we neglect to take the necessary political steps.
The single market is our great trump card, performing better than the internal market in the USA.
90% of what we manufacture in the European Union, we - as consumers - buy back from our own companies, and that gives us strength to cope with the vicissitudes of globalisation.
It is right, then, that this internal market should be completed, whether as regards financial services, energy, or the free movement of workers in Europe, for whom this is a fundamental right, albeit one that we have yet to put into effect, but this single market can function only if we endow it with a political framework - only if we are bold enough to give it form and ensure that the social checks and balances are in place.
That is why it is so important to call to mind the fact that we have succeeded in creating that social balance; we did so with the Services Directive.
It is only when people are able to support themselves properly by their own labour in this internal market that they will be able, as consumers, to support an economic upturn; it is only then that they will be able, as consumers, to invest, and only then that they will be able, as workers, to acquire further skills and qualifications and to play their decisive part in fostering innovation in our societies.
That is why it is so important that this report should ask the Member States just where they are, how far they have come, and just what they have done about achieving the great targets that we set ourselves at Lisbon.
It is crystal clear that they are beginning to come up with some answers, but those answers are still slow in coming and are not framed everywhere with the same quality that we would like to see; active employment policy and social integration policy, in particular, leave something to be desired.
Looking at the positive outcomes, we can see that the countries that are ahead are the ones that are bold enough, instead of making savings to the point where nothing works, to invest in the active parts of society, in small and medium-sized enterprises, in those who are at school, in those who are doing their apprenticeships, in those who are studying for university degrees and are thereby bringing new creativity into society.
It is not fortuitous that many Scandinavian countries, working according to the Nordic model, are producing the best results on this front.
While it is up to each and every country to find its own best solution, we would strongly encourage the Member States to play their part in putting the pro-active Lisbon approach into practice and carrying on with it.
I am grateful to the President-in-Office, Mr Gloser, for not, in his speech, disregarding the report, but instead saying 'yes' to dialogue, and I would urge him to be courageous, for I can find nothing in the Treaty that forbids us from developing closer forms of cooperation where the reform of the Integrated Guidelines and preparing Lisbon and the economic policy guidelines for a new stage are concerned.
This House expects to be involved - as is only right and proper - for that is the only way in which we can help to communicate the Lisbon goals to the public, to businesses, to trade unions and to workers.
I think the Commission is right to think in terms of coming up with more proposals on this front; why should such proposals not be adopted by the European Council as guidelines and thus give the Member States firmer guidance?
I do not want to close without extending very warm thanks to the services - both the committee's and those of the groups - for their contribution to the production of the report, and also to the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Montoro Romero, Mrs in 't Veld, Mrs RÃŒhle and Mrs Wagenknecht, whose excellent cooperation has made it possible to present a unanimous report.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) We are dealing with a good report.
I believe that Mr Bullmann has done an excellent job, an open job, in order to produce an analysis of the European economy at this time. It is a hopeful time, but it is also a time for realistic analysis.
This report also stresses that we must make a precise diagnosis of whether we are dealing with a strictly cyclical recovery or something more.
I hope that it is something more, but we must also tell the European citizens that we must carry on working because the rationalisation of public finances we saw last year may also be due to cyclical factors and not to deliberate or structural decisions.
As the report does, we must accept that what has failed in the European economy over recent years has been the weakness of internal demand, that is to say, confidence, consumer and investor confidence, and that is extremely negative in terms of the European project.
We must also stress the need for reforms: reforms of the labour market that have been discussed and agreed; reforms of economic policies to promote small and medium-sized businesses, which are key to the growth and creation of employment; reforms intended to complete the single market, particularly in services and in the energy sector; reforms to improve the efficiency of the markets in goods, services, work and capital; and also fiscal reforms aimed at providing a coordinated fiscal framework that stimulates the creation of jobs and promotes the creation and development of the fabric of small and medium-sized enterprise that we believe to be fundamental.
Furthermore, this report stresses the need to combat protectionism, which unfortunately is present in many of our current European governments, and we also warn that the risk associated with the euro-dollar exchange rate may threaten the quality of our economic growth.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Almunia, Mr Gloser, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work; I believe that this report presents both an analysis and recommendations that my group can fully support.
I should like simply to highlight three aspects.
The outlook for the euro zone in terms of growth and competitiveness is improving.
However, as the report says - and this is my first remark - there are some very important differences between the Member States.
I believe that we should try to learn some lessons from this, or, in any case, try to understand why this is so.
Things are not always easy; many elements come into play.
In particular, the report mentions the difference between the situation of a number of large Member States and that of smaller ones, but, ultimately, it is more complicated than that, since we can also observe spectacular differences in results among the large Member States.
Germany has performed averagely, with 2.7% growth last year, which is a very good result compared with previous years.
However, with 2% growth, other large Member States, such as Italy, and also my country, France, are below average in terms of EU growth, something that only happened two years ago.
This is combined with other elements that are fairly worrying, since the differences in external trade are just as spectacular.
Germany is a record-breaker again, showing an ability to conquer international markets, while France, which for a very long time was a country with a very strong international trade surplus, is producing one record trade deficit after another, quarter after quarter.
It is true that the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and a number of small Member States have obtained good results in terms of growth, employment and international trade.
There is a first lesson to be learnt from this, one that has perhaps come to my mind as a result of my country's situation.
It is that, in a country in which for five years, there has been one, let us say, liberal, structural reform after another, in which it was explained to us that that which was going to enable us to resolve the crisis, and the employment crisis in particular, was to reduce taxes - corporation tax, income tax - to jeopardise some forms of employment protection - we had a 'new employment' contract, which undermined protection against redundancies, etc. - to weaken public services and to privatise, we have not obtained a single result.
On the contrary, some countries that have kept compulsory levies and higher labour costs than France are, for their part, showing important results.
I have learnt a second lesson from this, which is that not only has this formula been ineffective, but it is wrong to think that Europe will cope if it practices downwards competition.
It is not by practising a form of competition based on low costs that Europe will manage to extricate itself, but by investing in human resources, in innovation, in research, in training and in universities.
My third remark, and a point rightly noted in the report, is that, despite this overall increase in growth and economic results, poverty continues to be a problem.
Even when compared with the 1990s, the level of poverty within the European Union has gone up again.
At the end of the day, there are 80 million Europeans living below the 60% average income threshold.
On this issue, I believe that we should also learn a lesson from what took place under President Clinton in the United States, which back then experienced a boom with the new economy, a boom that at the same time did not prevent serious poverty from continuing to somewhat poison society, because the Welfare programmes could not be implemented.
We too must combine investments with the knowledge-based economy, the competitive economy and social cohesion.
The two go hand in hand and support each other.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, who has considerably lightened the shadow rapporteurs' load by submitting an excellent text that needed hardly any editing, and. with which, as it is now before us, I too am pleased, for it contains many excellent recommendations, although many of them we have, of course, made before, and what is lacking is action.
Many of these things have not been implemented.
It is true that the economy is picking up, but this is no time to rest on our laurels.
Where, for example, the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, now is the time when the preventive leg should enter into force.
Rather than blowing the kitty, we should keep the budget in good shape, reduce debts, invest, and in that sense, I am completely at one with Mr Bullmann.
This should not, however, take on the form that it often does, namely subsidies that distort the market and replace the desperately-needed reforms.
This is often simply used as a fig leaf, which is not the idea.
I am all in favour of completing the internal market, and I hope that the Services Directive, which was far too weak for my liking, will have some impact on that front after all.

A great deal needs to be done in the area of labour market measures too, and I would like to say, briefly, that I see the social model as one in which all Europeans are given opportunities, but the one we have at present is still systematically excluding 8% of the people from the labour market, and not only eastern European workers and immigrants.
We would rather have them drown in the Mediterranean than give them access to our labour market.
It is meanwhile the case that we have been turning a blind eye to the fact that people working illegally on our markets under the most abominable conditions are almost kept as slaves.
This is not so much a social model as a disgrace for Europe, so as far as I am concerned, the free movement of eastern European workers could not come any sooner, complete with an immigration system and green card.
Finally, some question the merits of more coordination of national economic policy.
We should have another discussion on this some time.
I think it is, at any rate, far preferable than the current trend towards protectionism and Member States competing against one another, for the fact is that, if we in Europe want to be of any significance in the world economy, we have to ensure that we have a strong, open market, which means that we have to focus on areas of future significance, that is to say on energy, innovation and sustainable development - areas in which we should become world leaders.

on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteurs on their work.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will support these reports.
As I only have a short time available, I shall just raise a couple of issues.
At present, the economies of the Member States of the European Union are in need of genuine internal solidarity and cohesion, in order to meet the challenges of competition in the long term.
We can congratulate ourselves on a real economic revival, as demonstrated by the growth of GDP.
However, we would do well to remember that we are not alone.
Our population of 500 million does not even account for 8% of the world's population.
Our competitors include not only the United States, but also, and maybe most importantly. India, China, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia.
Nowadays, it is the economy, access to strategic raw materials and demographic potential that represent real strength.
These three pillars are closely related.
Accordingly, if we do not adopt a family-friendly policy that is truly harmonised with the economy, and also with regard to employment issues, then we are likely not only to lag behind in the near future but to actually collapse altogether.
The Lisbon Strategy is not an end in itself.
All its actions must aim to promote the individual and his or her development, that is to say, the development of a European citizen.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing I have to say is that the 'Lisbon Strategy' label now gets stuck on everything, irrespective of how little it has to do with the Strategy's original objective.
Although it was employment policy that first prompted the Lisbon Strategy and constituted its primary goal, that is now becoming no more than an appendix to it.
This redefinition has been accomplished as a matter of policy, as a means of obfuscation and avoiding the admission that, while the EU's economic data may be taking a turn for the better, no comparable upward trend is to be found in the employment figures.
Secondly, I would like to remind the House that the EU's Heads of State or Government, at every spring summit, undertake to apply the growth and employment guidelines to their own national policies.
Thirdly, when they do so, the core concern is to combat the social exclusion of people, for that is the only way to effectively reduce long-term unemployment and poverty, and, in so doing, particular attention needs to be given to groups who, by reason of their personal characteristics, are especially subject to discrimination in trying to get into the labour market, such as, for example, people with disabilities and migrant women.
This year, though, the Council and the Commission have simply allowed this core concern to be forgotten about, even though there is no cause for them to do so, for exclusion is as much a problem as it ever was.
We cannot accept that employment policy should be biased towards those who are already in work.
The guideline currently in force must be taken as seriously as it ever has been, and the great coalition must not be allowed to get away with giving it a different priority and simply looking away when social need is most pressing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the economic policy guidelines contains a large number of statements that I can go along with.
It states that, rather than economic growth being an end in itself, the focus must be on people's quality of life.
It advocates not only that economic growth should be export-oriented, but also that it should be responsive to demand, and it manifests concern about the continuing high incidence of poverty within the European Union.
Although all that is laudable and - alas - not always obvious to the Members of this House, the report does also include passages that make a vote in its favour impossible.
What is certainly not acceptable from our group's standpoint is the favourable mention given to the neo-liberal Services Directive, which will further encourage wage dumping and the despoliation of social services in the European Union, thereby helping to make poverty and social exclusion even more widespread.
We also see it as unacceptable that the report should call for further liberalisation of the energy sector.
What Europe in fact needs is not even more deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation, but the very opposite; what we need is a radically different economic policy in which, for once, the interests of workers and consumers are treated as more important than big business's interest in private profit.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bullmann report shows that economies of countries which have not yet adopted the euro are performing better than those who have.
Indeed, I must congratulate Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
They have not only shaken off the shackles of Communism but also embraced the free market, low taxation and minimal regulation.
Is it any wonder they have the highest growth rates in Europe?
However, I must warn them that this has ended.
It will all be downhill from here.
Latvia will adopt the euro in 2008, Lithuania and Slovakia in 2009 and Estonia in 2010 and they will be hamstrung by EU regulation, EU targets and by the EU continually meddling in their economic affairs.
I think we should all worry when the report informs us that the European Union must play a more active role in determining economic policy.
One size does not fit all and individual countries know best how to find their markets, manage their economies and trade with the world.
Please give them economic independence.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest data on the economic situation are on the whole positive but, as the Commission has stressed, growth in productivity and job quality are still below the levels that Europe needs.
I hope that these encouraging data will not be an excuse for making less effort, but a clear signal that we have identified the key, strategic points and that we must continue to concentrate on these.
I appeal to both the European institutions and to the individual Member States in this respect.
I refer in particular to three areas of action: 1) learning and retraining programmes, and programmes linking universities and other training establishments with the world of work; 2) responses to the demographic challenge, such as support for women and families, and the reform and harmonisation of social security systems; and 3) support, as yet insufficient, for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular to enable them to adapt to the latest challenges of international trade and to using new technologies and innovations.
These are the areas that still need a lot of work.
(ES) Europe is currently facing two great challenges: on the one hand, economic globalisation and, on the other, the ageing of the population, and all of this combined with the phenomenon of immigration.
Both require clear modernisation of the European social model.
As you know, competitiveness is the key element in terms of facing the challenge of globalisation.
We all know that we cannot compete with the emerging countries in terms of labour costs, but we have a clear advantage, our human capital, given its capacity, its flexibility and its creativity, and we also have the crucial values of solidarity, equal opportunities and inclusiveness.
With regard to the ageing of the population, in order to confront this challenge and to be able to guarantee pensions and healthcare in the future, it is essential that we increase productivity, and amongst other things that requires more jobs and also better quality jobs.
There is a general consensus amongst the Member States that it is necessary to modernise legislation in the field of employment protection.
In this regard, the combination of flexibility and security, which we often call 'flexisecurity', is a key element that must be developed in the future.
We also need, firstly, to apply a strategy of active ageing, with more training for people over 45 and with financial and tax incentives to extend working lives beyond 65.
Secondly, to guarantee an appropriate immigration policy, in accordance with a proposal that is based on a broad European agreement enabling it to be controlled in an ordered fashion and immigrants to be integrated by means of training and recycling plans suited to their profiles.
Finally, to promote a reform of public pensions systems with a view to ensuring that they are sustainable through consolidation of public finances and incentives to supplement them by means of individual plans.
I shall end, ladies and gentlemen, by stating that we still have a long way to go in order to achieve an effective and inclusive European labour market, which above all is focussed on life-long employment, and in which everybody, regardless of their age and conditions, receives the assistance and opportunities they require.
(NL) Mr President, I should like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on his excellent report, and I am pleased that other political groups are backing it too.
The report can already be seen as a first instalment on the discussion which is indeed to take place some time later this year about the review of the broad economic guidelines.
It is vitally important for this report to be used properly in this context, because it contains a number of points that will prove very useful during this evaluation.
It assesses the achievements by the Member States and the European economy as a whole in the light of these recommendations.
I would, in this connection, like to move the focus slightly away from Commissioner Almunia's statements.
He claimed that the countries that comply with the Stability and Growth Pact most effectively, are the best achievers.
I would, based on my own experience in the Netherlands, put this slightly differently, and I can identify more with the rapporteur's statement that it is mainly those countries that have carried out structural reforms, combined with investments, that have done well.
I am delighted that we will now have a Cabinet in the Netherlands - the team of ministers will be put in place this week - which will put investments first, in combination with the reforms that have already been carried out, while carefully observing the standards of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is a very important basis, to my mind.
A number of recommendations that are made in the guidelines are also reflected in the present government agreement, for example about labour market participation of the elderly, women or migrant groups.
One point that is very important in this connection - and I should also like to underline it on behalf of my political group - is the emphasis on European coordination.
Member States should not have to act as individuals, but a simultaneous, coordinated effort is, in fact, of key importance.
This is why I should very much like to advise the German Presidency to work hand in hand with this interinstitutional working party that is being introduced, and, in particular, to look at what can be coordinated macro-economically at European level.
This whole discussion on more coordinated economic and employment policy started in Essen 10 or 12 years ago.
It is a challenge for Germany to develop this further now.
(ET) Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the new three-year steering cycle that was launched two years ago with the revision of the Lisbon Strategy, with which the general guidelines of labour and economic policy were merged, permits Member States to adapt national Lisbon programmes to the conditions in a particular country.
For the first time after the slow economic growth or even standstill of the past six years, European economic growth has begun to accelerate.
This positive trend is also reflected in the labour market, and proves the mutual connection between economic policy and social protection.
The twofold increase in labour productivity has reduced average unemployment to eight percent.
Last year 2.9 million new jobs were created, but much still remains to be done, and we should not yet feel completely satisfied.
Today only a few Member States have adopted a fully integrated life-cycle-based approach to work.
We must take seriously the implementation of decisions we have already made; that is, that each young person who graduates from school or university be offered work, that child care be broadly available, that laws and regulations concerning labour protection be up to date, and so on.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for a realistic report and emphasise that the European Parliament is a suitable forum for the assessment of strategies and measures to enable us to fulfil the Lisbon objectives through joint action and improved cooperation.
This is the right and obligation assigned to us by the people.
(EL) Mr President, I have read both reports by my honourable friends with interest and would like to comment on three numbers: 8, 17 and 12 500
It is true that unemployment in the European Union is fluctuating today around 8%, which is an unacceptable figure in a Union with the declared intention of becoming the best and most productive economy by 2010.
The second number is the percentage of citizens in the Union living below the poverty line which, at 17%, corresponds to 80 million European citizens who cannot get by on a daily basis.
Finally, as you will already know, the multinational Alcatel Lucent has decided to lay off 12 500 workers over the next three years, most of whom work in Europe.
After the Volkswagen scandal, you will understand that the social and employment fabric of the Union is being seriously shaken up.
We can therefore continue wishful thinking about the Lisbon Strategy repeatedly.
Unfortunately the truth is different and bitter.
However, if there is one thing that I can retain from the reports, it is the need for Parliament to have more say on employment matters.
(PT) The news brought to us by Mr Almunia is encouraging but I feel that more ambition is needed when it comes to productivity and job quality.
Jobs - productive jobs - are what Europe needs and they are created in companies, and companies will only appear if there are plenty of high-calibre entrepreneurs ready to take risks.
Consequently, we must do everything we can to promote an appetite for risk-taking and to raise the profile of entrepreneurship.
It is an area in which I feel much more can be done.
Another vital ingredient in creating jobs is confidence, without which it is very difficult to have investment growth.
The factors that can help engender that confidence include balancing public accounts, developing the internal market, and good coordination in the Member States' economic policies and in economic and monetary policy.
Much has been done already, but much remains to be done.
Job creation should be a priority for a number of reasons.
Firstly, because unemployment discourages people and makes them stop believing in themselves and in others.
It is also the biggest factor in social exclusion.
Job creation is the only way of preventing young Europeans wasting their opportunities and talents.
Yet there are other reasons why job creation remains necessary in Europe, the most important of which relates to the financial sustainability of social protection.
It is indisputably true that it will eventually be impossible to maintain the systems we have inherited if we are incapable of creating more jobs.
Remedying this situation entails reform in many fields of the social economic systems of the various Member States.
These are necessary reforms, not on account of any kind of accommodation with liberalisation theories that see the market as the solution to all evils.
These reforms are urgently required and are justified in the name of the values that lie at the heart of the European project that they seek to preserve and to leave for future generations.
The extent to which European labour markets are able to respond to the challenges of globalisation, of the technological revolution and of the ageing population continues to be a key issue, despite the positive progress that has been made in the past two years.
Mr President, we cannot afford to be complacent that the unemployment rate is currently reduced.
The Lisbon Strategy calls for both more and better quality jobs.
Currently, the concept of 'flexicurity' is seen as a threat by many millions of our fellow citizens.
It means for them and their families ever-greater insecurity.
The Commission's proposal on the employment guidelines notes this, saying: 'a more comprehensive approach is necessary, better combining flexibility and security'.
That is often repeated, but in reality things are getting worse, not better.
In its Green Paper on modernising labour law, the Commission highlights some of the issues 'through non-standard contracts, businesses seek to remain competitive in the global economy by avoiding the cost of compliance with employment protection, notice periods and the cost of social security contributions'.
That does not sound to me like the path toward competing through quality and high added value in a globalised world.
The Commission also notes that fixed-term, part-time, on-call and zero-hour contracts, contracts for workers from temporary employment agencies, freelance contracts, etc. have become an established feature of European labour markets.
It notes that they are on the increase, up 4% between 2001 and 2005, and show that a significant minority, round about 16%, remain trapped in a succession of short-term low-quality jobs, with inadequate social protection.
Thankfully, we now have directives covering part-time and fixed-term contract workers.
But those initiatives date from a time when the Commission still believed it had a role to play in establishing minimum standards, when it believed in using the legal bases available to it.
But what about those other proliferating forms of insecure, low-paid, low-quality, atypical jobs?
The best the Commission can do nowadays is to ask a series of rhetorical questions in its Green Paper on how to rebalance 'flexicurity'.
Well, maybe it is time the Commission returned to a social agenda with legislative content; a signal is desperately needed to the Member States.
Mr President, this is an important debate on two very important reports, but it is an issue which the House has been covering both earlier today and indeed yesterday.
Earlier today we voted through by a large majority a resolution in relation to the Lisbon Strategy regarding the Spring Council.
It covered growth, employment, competitiveness; it was an important statement of what needed to be done and how to get here.
Yesterday there were other important statements.
Commission President Barroso reminded us that EU institutions had to focus on citizens' priorities; that we cannot build tomorrow's Europe with yesterday's tools; that we needed change.
Chancellor Merkel, on behalf of the Council Presidency, said to loud applause that we needed less bureaucracy, not more; that better and simplified regulation was the direction to follow; and she urged the Parliament to back this process.
With our resolution today we have formally given this backing.
But I do wish that this might mean that here, across all political groups and indeed within political groups, the old argument that we can either have more competitiveness or more social justice could be seen as an old argument.
The reality is that they are two sides of the same coin.
The biggest social injustice of all, as several colleagues have mentioned, is that which is inflicted on those millions still unemployed who want to work but cannot find a job.
This is not just their problem, it is our shame.
MEPs should no longer be seen in two camps, either on the side of employers or on the side of employees.
Let us please all agree to be in the same camp on the side of employment - of more jobs.
That remains the priority of all our citizens.
So let us not just give the Council Presidency and the Commission our backing for their agenda, let us make it our job to work together to deliver it.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report makes it a good day for Parliament for a number of reasons.
First of all, the inseparable links between economic, social and environmental policy have, as has already been pointed out, gone beyond the level of trite statements and can now be seen in practice.
We need only compare the title and the content to appreciate this shift.
The report states quite plainly how long this has been on the books of the Community institutions.
The economic policy guidelines need to include the social and environmental dimensions, in the sense that these are the most important aspects of them.
It is not just a case of combining three equivalent areas in the best way possible, but of recognising that economic development is based on social cohesion and environmental alertness.
Secondly, since competitiveness requires compatibility, action is needed in specific sectors, such as research and development, energy and the environment, as well as equally specific objectives for creating full employment and good quality jobs, guaranteeing dignity and security for people in work, and addressing calls for flexibility from both sides of the employer-worker relationship by means of measures aiming not just at conciliation but also at worker redeployment.
In addition, since the coordination method can provide useful results, it is not only good practice that should be pointed out and exchanged, but also obstacles, difficulties and adverse outcomes.
Great care is always needed when going down the road of harmonisation, since it is important to take account of contexts and legal systems; they may appear similar, but they retain their own peculiarities.
However, understanding not only the proposal but also the implementation procedure and the impact caused will facilitate everybody's work at European, national and regional levels.
The final reason is that national decisions must in turn follow an integrated, cross-cutting approach, and the prearranged plans and priorities must be reflected in the national budgets.
(ES) The representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs in 't Veld, began her speech by saying that Mr Bullmann's report was a good report, as previous reports on the broad economic guidelines had also been, but that those fine words had not been turned into concrete action, that we have never been able to move beyond the talking stage.
In the short space of time available to me, I am going to focus on the institutional reforms.
A period of reflection on the Constitutional Treaty has been opened up and is now on the point of being concluded, and practically everybody has expressed their opinion.
Mrs Merkel is proposing a roadmap; the Socialist candidate SÃ©golÃšne Royal, to question the role of the Central Bank; the presidential candidate Sarkozy, the reforms that need to be introduced in order to make the Treaty viable.
Everybody talks about this issue apart from us.
I know that Mr Almunia believes that the great economic Treaty was Maastricht, and that may be true, but in Marxist terms, what Maastricht did was change the economic structures.
It now falls to us to change the political superstructures, to bring the institutional architecture into line with these changes.
I would propose that Parliament become involved and produce a few lines on what the Commissioner, from his vantage point, believes should be introduced in the Constitutional Treaty.
An exercise of this kind was carried out in Group VI in the European Convention that failed, but the list remains in force.
What are our views about what should be done on the Union's list of economic objectives?
How do we believe, and how far do we believe, the codecision procedure should be extended in the field of economic policies?
What should we do about the power of retrieval in the Lamfalussy procedure?
How can we guarantee the democratic control of the European Central Bank without undermining its independence?
What should we do about economic governance (this morning, the Italian President, Mr Napolitano, referred to the need for greater economic coordination)?
What should the President-in-Office of the Council do?
Here we are still saying nothing though.
In the area of taxation, and I shall end here, all we need to do is incorporate into the Treaty what jurisprudence has already said, a single definition of tax domicile, an agreement on double taxation, the application of the non-discrimination principle, and I shall not go on because my time has run out.
What I propose, Mr Almunia, is that you produce a few lines and bring it to that dialogue that we approved in previous broad economic guidelines, and that we reach agreement so that we can speak with one voice and make constructive proposals in this reform of the Constitutional Treaty, because tomorrow it will be too late.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the broad economic policy guidelines could be described as a moral, or regulatory, framework for the Member States, since economic policy is a matter for the Member States but our objectives are pan-European.
This tension characterises all our debates.
Those failing to comply with the broad economic policy guidelines undermine and endanger European economic policy objectives.
Secondly, we are seeing a welcome development in economic policy, one that will provide the scope and tailwind for us to apply ourselves to our policy objectives and the necessary reform measures more actively, proactively and courageously than without the economic upswing.
Thirdly, there is no contradiction between the tasks of utilising the internal market, pursuing the Lisbon objectives, complying with the Stability and Growth Pact and meeting the challenge of the consequences of demographic developments.
On the contrary, all these measures must be taken if we are to realise the EU's broad economic policy guidelines and their objectives.
That is why I say that it is not true what is often bandied about in election campaigns: that the independence of the European Central Bank - as the French believe - or the objectives of the EU are the cause of national problems.
Instead, it is the failure to meet these objectives that is causing growth and employment problems at national level.
Let us use the time at our disposal to apply ourselves more actively to our objectives and our agreed policy reforms.
Let us reform our social security systems so that we are able to meet the challenge of globalisation.
Let us make energy efficiency and the strengthening of innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises the model for the European Economic Area, and let us improve economic policy structures - let us make savings to give ourselves scope for the investment needed - to make ourselves sustainably competitive at global level.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks for this stimulating debate.
The positive data reported in various fields are of course welcome, yet we must not rest on our laurels on this account - further action is needed.
Various arguments have also been put forward as to the EU's position on, for example, the issue of employment and economic policies - focusing on the Lisbon process.
It was also important to mention that competition and jobs were joined by sustainability in Gothenburg.
The Spring European Council due to be held in a few days' time will address an issue that intersects with the field of jobs - namely that of energy.
This issue involves, on the one hand, energy as a product and, on the other hand, the question of how to deal with energy in future.
Can alternative forms be found?
How can new fields be developed in this regard?
After all, this is not something dreamed up by one party or another; it has become clear that the promotion of renewable energies represents an important element.
I should like to state on behalf of the Presidency that what is equally important - and Franz MÃŒntefering, the President of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, held a meeting on this issue just last week, in Nuremburg in Bavaria - is how Europe can continue to incorporate the social dimension.
What challenges are to be met?
How can we show that Europe does not represent a threat, but rather an answer to the challenge of globalisation and the issue of maintaining the social security system?
These are very important points, which we shall also pursue within the framework of the G8.
I have already given my assurances that, in terms of not only the dialogue, the Troika, but also of the issue as to how Commission, Council and Parliament deal with each other in order to stay in close contact on this, we are pursuing the same objectives.
Member of the Commission. (ES) I would like to begin by once again thanking the two rapporteurs and everybody who has been involved in the drawing up of these reports and this afternoon's debate - which I believe has been extremely illuminating - on the situation we are experiencing and the challenges we need to face.
The situation - to use a Castilian figure of speech, though I believe that similar expressions are used in the few languages that I know of other countries of the Union - can be defined optimistically as a half-full bottle, or, if not pessimistically, then at least if we are to place the emphasis on what still needs to be done, as a half-empty bottle.
At the beginning of the debate, some of you asked me, 'Is the growth we are seeing cyclical or does it also have structural components?', 'Will the improvement in employment just be temporary for as long as the economic expansion lasts or is it true that we are achieving a better combination of economic efficiency, more employment and greater social cohesion?'
I believe that it is a combination of the two elements.
I believe that the structural reforms that have been carried out over recent years, together with the budgetary discipline and the macroeconomic policies, the mix of macroeconomic policies implemented since the launch of the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union, are beginning to bear fruit.
I believe that it is right that the European citizens should be aware that we are beginning to harvest that fruit, that the economic growth of close to 3%, the two million jobs created last year, the twelve million jobs created in the euro zone since 1 January 1999, the very good economic results of the huge majority of the new Member States, the greater consumer confidence and the increase in investment are linked to the efforts and decisions of recent years.
It is not merely a matter of chance. Otherwise, how can we expect the citizens to believe us and support us when we say to them, 'Look, we have to carry on with our efforts'?
We have to carry on improving the functioning of the markets in products, goods and services.
We have to carry on integrating Europe's financial systems.
We have to carry on improving the quality of legislation in order to create a favourable environment for small and medium-sized businesses so that they can compete without any administrative burden, without a series of obstacles preventing them from moving forward.
We need to provide good arguments so that we can ask workers to allow the improvement in the functioning of the labour markets to go ahead.
Only by making that effort will we genuinely be able to offer high-quality jobs, a future for coming generations and a combination of environmental policies to combat climate change and energy policies that are capable of improving our competitiveness.
Only by doing that will we be able to offer that result.
Therefore, the Lisbon Strategy reforms, which we must continue, call for effort and responsibility on the part of the European Institutions and the Member States, of the public institutions and of the public sector, and the citizens and companies in the private sector, but they also need to be based on certain steps forward that we are already taking and which must be demonstrated.
I do not believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the European institutions should draw up policies pessimistically and with the feeling that the future will be worse than the past, because if we do, if that is the only message the European institutions send out, the citizens will wonder what they want Europe for.
Europe is the best instrument available to us in the 21st century, as the Lisbon Strategy stated from the outset, for making economic dynamism compatible with social cohesion and solidarity with future generations in terms of sustainability, with the elderly, with the environment and with future generations.
Finally, I would like to comment briefly on two aspects that have been raised in the debate.
Firstly, the coordination of economic policies.
If I remember rightly, the Messina Declaration back in 1955 - since we are now talking about the Berlin Declarations as if they are similar to the Messina Declaration - talked about the need to coordinate economic policies, but to that end, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo, there is no need for you to give a humble Commissioner a mandate to become the next European Convention.
What we need to do is to discuss the stability and convergence programmes in depth, as the Commission and the Ecofin Council are currently doing.
What we need to do is to discuss the application of the national Lisbon reform programmes and the Community Lisbon Strategy in depth, as the Spring European Council is going to do, to discuss how to draw up a common energy policy that is compatible with an ambitious European environmental programme.
We need to carry on integrating financial services, to carry on improving our internal market, which, as some of you have said, still provides Europe with an excellent tool for confronting globalisation with optimism.
Furthermore - and this is more a job for national governments than for European directives, given the way things are - we need to improve the functioning of the labour markets, combining flexibility and security, because if there is no security for workers, there will be no flexibility in employment, and if there is no flexibility in companies, there will be no jobs for workers.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that that is the message that emerges from this debate, and the Commission is entirely in agreement.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate on these two reports is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - Within the framework of the recent socio-economic developments in the Union and even if unemployment figures seem to decrease, genuine and thorough attention should still be given to social cohesion in the Union as a whole.
As a matter of fact, despite the increase in employment data, poverty is still growing in the eurozone and part of the jobs that are created are unfortunately of a precarious nature.
Quality and secure employment should go along with economic growth through the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives.
With the increasing disparities between the growth rates of the Member States and the relatively low growth rates of certain large Member States, significant efforts are needed in order to enable the Union to face the new challenges of an ageing population and growing competition as a result of globalisation.
The Bullmann report, by focusing on the role of SMEs, research and development, the environment and the energy sector, aims clearly at creating greater coherence in the policy-making processes and the economic governance of the Union while attempting to develop a genuinely effective and inclusive European labour market.
I therefore support the line adopted by the rapporteur.
Council Question Time
Madam President, I can answer the question as follows.
The objectives of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) are laid down in Article 105 of the EC Treaty.
The main purpose of the provision is the maintenance of price stability.
Apart from this objective, however, the ESCB supports the general economic policies of the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the Community's objectives pursuant to Article 2 EC.
The ESCB acts in accordance with the principles of a market economy and free competition.
This includes, in particular, the effective allocation of resources in compliance with the principles of the EC Treaty.
The provisions of Article 107(5) EC may be amended by the Council acting by a qualified majority; that is, acting either by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the European Central Bank (ECB) and after consulting the Commission or unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the ECB.
In either case, the assent of the European Parliament is required.
Since, however, Article 105 EC mentioned at the beginning is not among the provisions listed in Article 107(5), it can be amended only using the general Treaty amendment procedure pursuant to Article 48 TEU.
The Council is not currently dealing with any proposals to this effect.
deputising for the author. - (PT) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, how do you explain the fact that the European Central Bank is threatening to raise interest rates still further, after almost doubling them over the past year?
This has had serious detrimental consequences for the economy, for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises and for families, especially in countries such as Portugal with the weakest economies.
Is this an example of the Community solidarity and economic and social cohesion that you are advocating?
If so, why not amend the objectives and the modus operandi of the European Central Bank?
When the European Central Bank was established, we laid down an important principle: that of the independence of the Central Bank.
Its job is to assess, on the basis of various indicators, how to regulate the money market at the end of the day, including in the matter of interest-rate increases.
This means that there is no way the Council or a Member State can influence monetary policy.
(LT) The European Central Bank has its own stable inflation indicator, which is just nearing 2%.
However, when the Maastricht criteria are applied, this is not taken into consideration.
Under the Maastricht criteria, the inflation indicator is calculated according to an entirely different methodology, which in no way correlates to the inflation indicator of the European Central Bank.
Would it not appear that these indicators should be coordinated, so that it would be clear to everyone just what exactly the stable inflation rate is?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The EU-Africa Ministerial Conference held on 22-23 November 2006 in Tripoli was an important event, bringing together for the first time all the Member States of the EU and - I should like to underline this very clearly - all African countries, namely the members of the African Union plus Morocco, to discuss migration and development issues.
The purpose of the Conference was to strengthen cooperation in the spirit of partnership in these fields, which are of vital importance to both sides, and also to decide on joint action.
The Ministerial Conference closed by adopting a political declaration listing a series of fields in which action is needed, from development issues through to legal channels for immigration and the fight against illegal immigration.
In addition, an Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings, Especially Women and Children was adopted.
The implementation of these two instruments is expected to begin in the next few months.
(ES) As you know, the Commission is currently making a series of proposals to regulate legal immigration, in agreement with countries of origin, particularly with the African countries.
I would like to know whether, within the context of this Tripoli Conference, the Council will be in a position to support the Commission's proposal in this regard.
Mr Medina Ortega, a whole package of measures was discussed at the Conference in Tripoli, since we take the view that the migration problem cannot be solved by a single proposal or solution, and that a series of measures is needed.
The issue of legal migration was also discussed, including various points relating to the feasibility of addressing this aspect.
Equally, however, the Conference addressed the feasibility of Africans who live in Europe - in the Diaspora, as they see it - returning to their home countries for a given period to help with the development of education systems and with job creation, for example.
It also discussed the possibility of reducing the cost of money transfers to these countries.
For example, it could happen that, out of EUR 1 000 remitted to a country, only EUR 800 reaches the recipient since the charges are so high.
A whole package of measures was discussed with the countries of the African Union plus Morocco, therefore.
Furthermore, discussions are continuing on what possibilities the EU and the African countries could open up for temporary employment in Europe, for example.
(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, another of the objectives of this Conference was undoubtedly to discuss ways of reducing the causes of migration; that is, to take the relevant preventive action.
There are good examples of where such action has been very effective, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo.
There, European police units have provided assistance in the field of legal education and the military field, resulting in the development of the rule of law, with a view to achieving greater stability and enabling economic investment.
Are we prepared to extend this model to other African countries, too, since we know that migration flows come not only from North Africa but also from Central and Southern Africa, where there is instability?
President-in-Office of the Council.
(DE) Mr Pirker, back in July, a Conference was held in Rabat: not one entitled 'EU-Africa', but one initiated by Morocco, Spain and France.
This addressed the West African migration route.
It became clear at the Tripoli Conference, however, that there is a further African route, the East-West route, that should also be the focus of our attention.
To return to your specific question, however, there are indeed examples of successful action.
Another important thing that this Conference needed to make clear was that one way of tackling the causes is through 'best governance', by the Government choosing a form of governance that gives its citizens the chance to become involved in the generation and sale of raw materials and in education.
The obligation of the EU - the Member States - to offer assistance in the field of administration and of police and judiciary systems, where this is requested, was also emphasised.
A few years ago, in the course of various debates in Europe, 'best practices' were discussed - that is, looking at what one's neighbours are doing successfully - and this concept could certainly be transferred to certain African countries.
This kind of comprehensive approach was discussed, and it is now up to us to decide what action to take in the various fields - although I have to say that not all measures are needed in all cases, as some countries have already made very great progress thanks to domestic developments.
However, the EU did give assurances of its support and solidarity on this.
(LT) Madam President, Malta is the country that has suffered the most as a result of illegal migration from Africa.
Several nations, mine among them, in the name of solidarity with Malta, have invited illegal migrants to come to our countries legalising their status at the same time.
Is it the view of the Minister that this will have a positive effect, or will it adversely affect the illegal migration situation?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Demographic change in Europe concerns all the Member States of the EU.
A major feature is the low or even falling birth rates throughout Europe.
The changing demographic of nations necessitates comprehensive structural changes as part of a long-term strategy if the social cohesion of the generations and the competitiveness of the European economy are to be preserved.
In its Communication entitled 'The demographic future of Europe - from challenge to opportunity' of 12 October of last year, the European Commission notes that Europe has never in its history experienced economic growth without population growth.
In this light, confronting the demographic challenge with the help of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs takes on particular importance.
A priority for the German Council Presidency in this regard is enabling men and women wishing to start a family to do so with the help of family-friendly policies.
Experience in a number of Member States has shown that political measures are possible as well as necessary.
There should be a European 'alliance for the family' to serve as a platform for Member States to exchange views and experiences.
Its field of competence should include key tasks relating to the management of demographic change.
This alliance should also actively involve the social partners, civil society and representatives of science and industry.
The key objective of the alliance should be to offer support to the Member States through this ongoing exchange.
The intention is that, by the end of the German Presidency, not only will the political starting signal have been fired, but also the first tangible steps will have been taken towards the realisation of this alliance.
In so doing, the idea is to utilise existing resources and to tie in with existing structures; the European Demographic Forums launched by the Commission in its Communication will be particularly important reference points in this regard.
The European Commission has already set up a high-level group on demography and the family.
The alliance will complement the comprehensive initiatives at European level for the promotion of gender equality, particularly the European Pact for Gender Equality and the Commission's Roadmap for equality between men and women 2006-10.
Only an improvement in the reconciliation of family and career will enable men and women to decide to have more children without giving up their careers.
The Member States must work together with the social partners and individual companies on reducing pay inequality and on supporting parents in the early stages of bringing up their child.
After all, an improvement in the reconciliation of family and career is another chief objective of the European Pact for Youth, with a view to giving young people access to vocational and social integration.
(EL) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply.
However, I would like you to tell me, as far as the Youth Pact is concerned, which particular actions you are thinking of applying.
Given that the policy on the family is a national policy and that, consequently, every Member State has its own policy, what common measures can you foresee in order to apply this intention of yours of helping families?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) In the course of our debate a little while ago, we discussed the employment issue and the fact that different countries have different structures and developments.
There are overlaps, where we see the same trends in different Member States.
Here, too, it is primarily a matter of taking stock and of seeing what specific answers can be found.
In my answer just now, I mentioned several fields that we wish to develop in order to bring this issue into even sharper focus, several of which concern young people.
In the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the following questions arise. How do we ensure that young people find a vocational training place or job?
What prejudices are there in society, for example against young people from migrant backgrounds?
These are all issues we hope to discuss at various conferences this year.
(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if we want to see a sensible demographic trend in Europe, we must at any rate stop clinging to our ideologically skewed, hypocritical blinkers and dreaming of a model of life that existed perhaps 200 years ago.
Children are brought to life not only within traditional families, but also within other models of life.
We have an example of favourable demographic trends here in the EU - in France - as childcare places there are sufficient and affordable.
I should be interested to hear what the President-in-Office is planning in this connection.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Leichtfried, many thanks for your supplementary question.
Here, too, we can pick up the thread of previous discussions at Spring Summits, where the generation of investment in the Member States to enable the reconciliation of family and career has been mentioned.
A number of aspects should certainly be considered in this regard.
A key point, however, is that people have been singling out France and other Member States that are enjoying certain successes.
I hail from one country where the situation is unsatisfactory, but where attempts are being made to find a solution.
It is important not to offer a centralised solution, but instead to be guided by the principle of looking at neighbours who are doing things successfully and seeing how we can implement these accordingly at home.
That is the way to finally achieve an outcome different from the one we are seeing now.
(DE) My question concerns the common measures that could help us.
What does the President-in-Office think of the suggestion that the German Presidency - together with the European Commission, of course - select and recommend the best examples in Europe?
He has mentioned France, but there are other good examples, too.
This would be of particular value to the new Member States.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I shall gladly take up that suggestion again.
It is a valuable idea: rather than keeping quiet, as it were, about the positive developments in the EU, the things that have had positive results, we should find out whether they might also work in our own country on account of our similar structures.
I shall be happy to take this idea away with me and present it to my country's Minister, Mrs von der Leyen, who is of course the current Council President responsible for family affairs, women, youth and senior citizens.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The decision to designate 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All was approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 2006.
The Council agreed that all the types of discrimination stated in Article 13 of the EC Treaty should be covered and addressed equally, including all the groups concerned, by the various measures to be carried out at European and national level.
In the negotiations with Parliament, the Council gave its agreement to including an express mention of the Roma population in the Decision establishing the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
The text contains a recital detailing the situation of the Roma in Europe, in which Parliament draws attention to the prevalence of anti-Roma sentiment and its discriminatory effect on the opportunities in terms of employment, education and social services for the European Union's most disadvantaged ethnic-minority group.
It must be borne in mind, however, that the work as part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All 2007 is based on the principles of personal responsibility and subsidiarity.
Each Member State is therefore responsible for deciding what measures to carry out in the coming months.
Minister, one problem is that evictions and segregation are often condoned or even instigated by local or regional government, and central governments have not been effective in challenging them.
Will the Presidency encourage all Member States to do so?
Secondly, I am not really happy with your reference to subsidiarity.
Anti-discrimination legislation is not sufficient to tackle systemic discrimination.
There needs to be positive action and proactive measures.
In some Member States, public authorities have a positive duty to promote equality.
Surely you can encourage all Member States to do that through a process of peer review.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Baroness Ludford, on the subject of subsidiarity, Member States do indeed bear responsibility.
The large number of progress reports drawn up in the course of the accession of the Eastern European Member States included an examination of the minorities issue from many angles, particularly concerning all aspects of the situation of the Roma.
It is always important to bear that in mind.
On the other hand, there is also scope for establishing programmes to promote the integration of the Roma population, including with the involvement of the World Bank.
I believe that this is an issue that cannot be solved by the respective Member States alone, and that the integration of these sections of the population requires assistance from others.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, I have a question on this subject.
We agree that non-discrimination is a question of time.
In my home country, authorities operating not at national but at lower level are currently endeavouring to impose bans on begging, for example.
They believe that this will offer a solution to the occurrence of at least some phenomena.
In my view, this is the wrong approach.
What is the Council's opinion?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The EU emissions trading scheme is one of the most important policy instruments at the disposal of the European Community and its Member States for achieving their Kyoto objectives in the most cost-effective way.
As the honourable Member will be aware, Directive 2003/87/EC obliges Member States to publish their national allocation plans.
They have to notify these to the Commission and to the other Member States at least 18 months before the beginning of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, namely 2008-2012.
The Commission has evaluated the Member States' national allocation plans.
The Presidency will continue reviewing this EU emissions trading scheme on the basis of the Commission Communication, which identifies the priority issues.
The Presidency will also follow up the proposal to bring aviation into this scheme.
The Presidency is working towards ensuring that the emissions trading scheme makes the expected contribution to the achievement of the Kyoto objectives, and is working to improve and extend this EU scheme with a view to establishing a global carbon market that leads to the emission reductions needed to tackle climate change.
No one doubts the Council's determination on the question of the emissions trading scheme.
No one doubts the good news that we have heard recently.
The question that EU citizens are asking, though, is what is the incentive mechanism for really making this work?
This is an enormous project, and what during the German Presidency would be the scope for further incentives to encourage Member States to hit the targets and indeed oblige them to meet these targets, now that European Union citizens truly believe that something is on the move here and there is something very positive?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Moraes, this instrument is in practical use, so to speak, and I agree with you that there is still room for improvement in the scheme's efficiency and that incentives should perhaps also be used to manage it.
The Presidency will take care of this, too.
As the honourable Member is aware, however, this is always a long-term process - it will not be possible to solve this, either, at the flick of a switch.
The Presidency will see to this issue, however.
I have one brief question.
The Commission came up with its proposal on energy and climate change a few weeks ago.
In that proposal the level of carbon emissions for cars was increased from 120g/km to 130g/km.
Does the Presidency think that this helps or hinders the issue of emissions?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) As the honourable Member knows, there has been a Commission proposal.
This proposal is now being examined and discussed accordingly in the Member States, and responses will be presented.
I am sure that, when the energy action plan is discussed in spring, an acceptable solution will be found that involves the various modes of transport and emitting sources concerned.
The emissions trading scheme is clearly good as far as it goes, and I was pleased to hear the President-in-Office's commitment to try and expand it to include aviation.
However, does he accept that the climate - no pun intended - is now right for negotiating outside the European Union with countries such as the United States to make this a truly global trading scheme, which would of course have a much bigger impact on the environment?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The Presidency would like to answer Mr Davis's question with reference to its report on the implementation of its overall policy on transparency and the assessment of its impact on the effectiveness of the Council's work - I am afraid it is a very long title - that the Presidency presented to the Council on 11 December 2006.
In addition to a preliminary assessment of the impact of the rising number of public debates and deliberations on the effectiveness of the Council's work, the report contains data on the number of visits to the new Council video streaming website and to the website providing access to Council documents relating to public deliberations or debates.
In the first four-and-a-half months of the new transparency measures alone, over 28 000 visits to these new features of the Council website were recorded.
These figures document the positive response of the public and the media to the new transparency measures.
The webcast and the online availability of documents relating to public sessions have thus considerably improved opportunities for following the debates and decision-making processes in the Council.
The Council is constantly striving to improve these features.
Concerning the impact of these transparency measures on the effectiveness of the Council's work, it should be borne in mind that, at the time of the initial evaluation, which the European Council had called for in June 2006, the new rules had been in operation for less than six months, including the month of August.
This means that it was, and still is, too early to issue a definitive evaluation.
deputising for the author. - Madam President, I too am delighted to be able to address you as such.
I am absolutely delighted to hear that there were 28 000 visits recorded and that people can follow debates on the net.
We talk a lot about democracy and plan D for dialogue and this is an opportunity for citizens to see it in action.
I believe this is a real gesture towards greater transparency.
But you did say that the Council is working hard to improve this and what I want to know is, are you satisfied it is working successfully?
Do you have any plans to promote it or advertise it to a wider audience?
And do you have any specific ideas on the improvements that you might make, even though it is only a short time in action?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) As I have already explained, this has been in operation for only a few months, which is not enough time to enable a final analysis at this stage.
I do believe, however, that the figures indicate the interest there has been.
We have talked a good deal about transparency and communicating European policy today, and also about taking decisions close to the citizen.
It remains the ongoing task of many actors in the EU to seek ways of making these policies more transparent.
After a while, when we have reliable data at our disposal, we shall consider where further improvements can be made, and how to attract a broader population of users.
I would appeal for a little patience until we have more reliable figures.
President-in-Office, as a former civil servant, having taken many notes in Council meetings, I know that those meetings are not necessarily the most exciting events in the world and, therefore, 28 000 viewers - hmm, I kind of understand!

I should like to make a practical proposal and test you on it.
Instead of sitting in a circle in the Council with the Permanent Representative next to you, why not sit in a hemicycle with no assistance whatsoever?
Perhaps this would make the debate more interesting and you would get a few more hits on the internet site.
What do you think?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Posselt, my answer to your question is as follows.
Martti Ahtisaari's endeavours have the unqualified support of the EU.
The strategic objective in this regard is still to achieve a lasting settlement for Kosovo quickly without endangering democracy in Serbia or the stability of the region as a whole.
The EU is currently working on plans for three projects.
These are the international civilian mission (ICM), a rule of law mission and programmes for continuing the promotion of economic development and furthering Kosovo's prospects of EU membership.
In all three cases, the plans are being made in close cooperation with the local authorities and other international actors, particularly the United States and NATO.
The team making preparations for the international civilian mission started work in PriÅ¡tina on 9 October 2006.
It has the twofold task of planning the structure and staffing of the mission and determining its infrastructure requirements and, together with UNMIK and the competent Kosovo authorities, preparing the possible transfer of competences to both the ICM and the local authorities.
Since May 2006, a Planning Team has been in Kosovo to prepare a possible rule of law mission within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP).
The planned mission is intended to have a general role in teaching, observing and advising in matters of the rule of law.
In addition, it would have executive powers in some fields relating to the police, the judiciary and customs.
The precise scope of its mandate will have to be established after the resolution of the status issue.
The mission, which would be introduced following the conclusion of the status process and a transitional period where it worked jointly with UNMIK, would be the largest civilian ESDP mission to date.
A successful conclusion of the status process, which is being led by Mr Ahtisaari, is essential not only to give the people of Kosovo clear prospects, but also for stability in the whole region.
The conclusion of this process represents the end point in the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, many thanks for that very good, precise reply.
The longer the settlement of the status issue is delayed, the greater the risk of instability in Kosovo - and this, in turn, could be used to effect the partition of Kosovo after all, even through the back door.
My question is a specific one: could a more intensive international and EU presence - in terms of both civilian and military forces - perhaps be envisaged for, say, potential crisis regions such as Mitrovica; one far exceeding the present dimensions and along the lines of what was seen in Vukovar?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Posselt, you speak of delays and the potential risks these entail.
It is very important that we have stated that a solution is needed - and the General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed this very intensively on Monday.
There is nothing in the Council Conclusions to indicate that things are being put off indefinitely.
On the contrary, we have used the opinions voiced - including on the occasion of the EU Troika meeting in Belgrade - as an opportunity to say that a new parliament is indeed emerging from the democratic forces, that a new government will also be formed; and that we have to give these a while longer to enable the appointment of the new negotiating team so that it can join the negotiations.
The Council has been conscious that we cannot let the whole process start again from scratch, however, as the timing is indeed important if we are to avoid the instability you mention.
For this reason, I do not wish to speculate at this time on other things that may or may not happen.
Minister, you say that EU Foreign Ministers want to avoid indefinite delay, but there is some concern that the Ahtisaari status mission risks being somewhat drawn out.
Do not last Saturday's regrettable deaths at a demonstration attended by, we understand, 3 000 people - and I would say 'only' 3 000 people - call into question the expertise and competence of the policing of demonstrations and make rather urgent a better management of this situation so that things do not get out of control?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I should like to reiterate once more that we are currently at a very important stage of the status process.
Account must always be taken of developments in Serbia, too, however.
The tight deadline that has now been set is important to enable the process to continue.
As we know, it is not the EU alone that decides; the Special Representative of the Secretary-General must of course present proposals to the United Nations to enable the necessary steps to be taken.
(NL) Madam President, Mr Gloser, I think that the business of giving Kosovo de facto independence will prove to be one of the international community's biggest challenges in the next couple of months, and one in which the European Union will need to play an important role.
You yourself talked about the international civil mission, the civil branch of the European defence and security policy.
The figures I hear being bandied around suggest that 71 officials will be attached to the international civil mission and some one thousand more to the European Union to work on European defence and security policy.
Have you any idea how much this translates into in budget terms?
Has the Council put any arrangements in place in order to prepare for a possible budget change?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The Council attaches very great importance to the annual audit and Statement of Assurance of the Court of Auditors and has repeatedly affirmed its unwavering support for sound financial management in the EU.
Following a detailed examination of the annual report of the European Court of Auditors by the appropriate Council bodies, the Council sends Parliament a recommendation on discharge pursuant to Article 276(1) of the EC Treaty for each financial year.
This recommendation on discharge contains the extensive conclusions of the Council on the Court of Auditors' annual report, in which the Council addresses, in detail, the observations of the Court of Auditors and the Commission's opinions on these.
The conclusions also contain recommendations to the Commission and the Member States for eliminating any shortcomings or weaknesses discovered.
These Council conclusions are debated by Parliament at the same time as the Court of Auditors' annual report as part of the discharge procedure.
It does not seem appropriate to introduce another Council report - which would of necessity have largely the same content - in addition to these detailed conclusions.
(DE) Please allow me to ask a question.
The problem with the Statement of Assurance lies in its shared management.
A report such as this could be a solution enabling a positive Statement of Assurance for the shared management.
Why is the Council not prepared to introduce one?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I can give a fairly short answer to this.
There is no majority support for such a change among the Member States.
Mr President-in-Office, do you agree that there does need to be an assumption of responsibility by Member States?
Eighty percent of European Union spending is carried out on its behalf by national governments and it is there that most of the errors picked up every year by the Court of Auditors are found - fortunately neither fraud nor mismanagement - but it is there that they are found, and, until the Member States take their responsibility, we are likely to face the same problem year after year, doing enormous damage to the image of the European Union.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) This issue is not a new one and is being addressed by many experts.
I should like to emphasise once more, however, that, where there is budgetary control, this is not necessarily a matter of a request by the Court of Auditors, but rather of the following question. How can we make the rules, including budgetary rules, more efficient, more transparent, more uniform, so that the necessary control can be achieved?
There is not the necessary majority support for a change among the Member States.
