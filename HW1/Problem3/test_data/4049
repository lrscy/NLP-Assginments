Perhaps of the greatest significance, we are now actually spending the money we commit.
In 2003, 100% of the payments, as well as 100% of commitments, were used.
I want to emphasise once again that relations with Latin America are a geostrategic priority for the European Union.
I have been particularly pleased in recent weeks to be able to discuss our relationship with representatives of Mercosur, with all the foreign ministers of the Andean Community and with representatives of Central America.
I very much hope that we will be able to have a successful summit to follow up the one in Madrid, which will focus on regional integration and social inclusion.
I also very much hope that the summit in Guadalajara will be able to see a further development in our relations with the two regions with which we have only recently negotiated sensible agreements.
Â Â  . Mr President, I was pleased to hear the Commissionerâs words.
They clearly demonstrate a concern and a sense of priority, and I would like to say to him that the assessment of this Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Central American region will essentially depend on one factor, and that is what prospects this period the Commissioner has described as transitional will open up.
From our point of view, and on the basis of this Parliamentâs Resolution of 15 November 2001, this type of political and cooperation agreement must open the way to preparing association agreements which include a free trade treaty, in accordance with the intense aspirations of our Central American partners and, in my view, fully in accordance with the political, economic and commercial interests of the European Union.
In other words, the key question is whether a period of negotiations is really being opened up for an association agreement with the Central American countries, and also with those of the Andean Community, of a similar nature, to those reached with Mexico and Chile, and the one which is being negotiated with Mercosur, as a prelude to a more general strategic perspective which should lead to a global interregional agreement and the creation of a Euro-Latin American free trade area.
We are now being offered an opportunity, at the third Summit to take place in May, to demonstrate a sense of anticipation and foresight, explicitly opening up this prospect.



Changes are taking place in the region, a region â as we all know â plagued with difficult structural and economic situations, serious ones, but there are undoubtedly encouraging signs; there is a shared will amongst the Presidents of the region to move forward pragmatically in the field of economic integration; there is a new stage for the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, which I believe to be very hopeful; there are plans for the reform of the integration institutions, in particular fairly thorough reforms of the Central American Parliament and, in this regard, the European Unionâs presence and voice must contribute to demonstrating clearly that we do not just indulge in diplomacy when there are situations of conflict, but that we apply the same effort and the same sense of priority which was put into decisively assisting the peace processes in the region, that we still have the will and the determination to aim at improving the political, economic and social situation in a region so devastated by historical and current problems.
Commissioner, I would like the Guadalajara Summit in May to clearly open up a stage in which the implementation of this Agreement is handled with the greatest possible will, which also involves maintaining the commercial facilities enjoyed by the countries of that region, within the system of generalised preferences and the special âdrugsâ system, and, above all, that there be a specific commitment made to negotiating a genuine association agreement.
While we are on the subject of the Guadalajara Summit, I would like to mention to Mr Patten in particular an issue which does not strictly relate to Central America, but which could be a success story for the Summit in a specific field: there are several black holes in the current world situation, and one of them is called Haiti.
And the commitment to prolonged and intense assistance from the European Union, in agreement with the Latin American partners and perfectly in agreement with Caricom, with the OAS and with the United Nations, could, I believe, be a success story for the Guadalajara Summit, which will be consolidated if good intentions are then followed by determined and sustained actions.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Commissioner Patten for the efforts I know he has made to attend this debate, despite the difficulties with the agenda.
In order to dispel any doubt, I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its diligence in presenting the guidelines for concluding these Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreements â and I am sure that Mr Patten will remember the meetings we held, with Mr Lamy as well, prior to the Madrid Summit.
I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its diligence, efficiency and speed in negotiating these agreements which, as Mr Obiols i GermÃ  has just pointed out, Parliament sees as forerunners to association agreements.
With the discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the vote, which was unanimous, on these two agreements â something which does not happen very often â and with todayâs debate in plenary and the subsequent vote, one stage is being closed and another opened up, marked, I would say, by the forthcoming Guadalajara Summit.
As Mr Patten knows better than anyone, we live in a complex world, in which the European Union has both internal responsibilities, such as the birth of the Constitution or enlargement, and also external responsibilities: the new relationship with Russia, our continuing problems in the Balkans, our responsibilities in Central Asia, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, the Middle East problem and taking relations with the United States in a new direction.
In summary, Mr President, the world is a big place and Latin America is just one part of it, but I believe it is very satisfactory that we are acknowledging, as the Commissioner has done, that Latin America continues to be a priority area for the European Union, amongst other things because we have common values and a shared history.
On 19 March a meeting was held between a large delegation of Members of this Parliament and representatives of the Latin American Parliament and its President, representatives of the Andean Parliament and its President, representatives of the Central American Parliament and its President and representatives of the Parliamentary Commission of Mercosur and its President as well.
That is to say, a meeting of parliamentarians which represented more than a billion citizens of Europe and Latin America.
That meeting established conclusions on how to mark out the route towards the bi-regional strategic partnership which was established at the two previous summits.
We Members of Parliament who attended it â Mr Obiols was there and other Members of this House who are attending this debate â concluded that we did not need a long catalogue of declarations and statements, but that, in order to realise that bi-regional strategic partnership, we simply needed a series of concrete proposals, which we set out in the form of a decalogue.
That decalogue focuses fundamentally on three areas.
On the area of political dialogue and will, because â let us make no mistake â it is political will which has driven these relations forward over recent years, and we are therefore proposing the creation of a Euro-Latin American parliamentary assembly, somewhat similar to the Assembly which has been established in the field of Euro-Mediterranean relations.
We are proposing to renew and update the ministerial political dialogue, to agree in international fora and in the United Nations system between European and Latin American positions and also to sign a Euro-Latin American Charter for peace and security with a view to creating a forum in which we can deal seriously with issues relating to security and defence, which currently have no specific forum.
Above all, we are proposing a renewal of the bi-regional political agenda in order to be able to discuss issues such as those relating to terrorism, the issue of the reform of the United Nations system, the threats to governability, a review of the fight against poverty and many other initiatives.
Nevertheless, Commissioner, political dialogue, however thriving it is, will end and come to nothing unless we translate words into actions.
It is clear that one very obvious field in which we must translate words into actions is that of commercial relations.
We are therefore proposing that, at the Guadalajara Summit, specific dates be indicated for the association of the Andean and Central American countries, without subjecting them to discriminatory conditions which have not been imposed on other countries or groups of countries, and there are grounds for a debate here â you have referred to integration â on whether integration should be a prior condition or whether it would follow on from association.
This Parliament believes that we must make real progress towards integration, but it is perfectly possible for integration to follow on from association agreements.
We also understand and share the desire for the negotiation of a balanced agreement with Mercosur to be completed before the end of this year and this Parliament also believes that, whilst complying with bilateral and regional agreements that have been negotiated or which are in the process of being negotiated, we should promote a kind of Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) with soul, European-style, in which we provide an institutional dimension and complete geographical coverage for relations between the European Union and Latin America.
We also believe, Commissioner, that we must have a cooperation policy which can in some way be adapted to this new concept, to this new idea of association.
In this regard â and you know what Parliamentâs thinking is â Parliament has insisted on having a differentiated legal framework and we also believe that we must promote an entire range of policies in the field of education, culture, vocational training and scientific and technological cooperation.
As you know, Commissioner, Parliament has proposed the establishment of a bi-regional solidarity fund, an initiative in which we do not want to create additional bureaucratic structures.
We believe that this must be interpreted flexibly and incorporated into the Commissionâs initiatives, but we also believe that this initiative must take advantage of the financial opportunities offered by both the European Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
I would like to say finally, Commissioner, that, as you can see, Parliamentsâ proposals are extremely ambitious.
We hope that this ambition is shared by the Member States and by the Commission in the Communication it is preparing, so that a clear and well-defined message can be sent regarding Europeâs commitment to Latin America.
I would also like to say that, in order for this message to be effective and have a multiplying effect â and I make this proposal on behalf of my political group â we must restore and consolidate the strategic alliance and harmonious partnership between the European Parliament and the Commission, which has resulted in so much progress between the European Union and Latin America, as soon as possible.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the words he has addressed to us, which open up more interesting perspectives for the future of relations between the European Union and Latin America.
Perhaps for this very reason it may be interesting to relate a brief history of this relationship over recent years.
Since being all but absent from the agenda during the seventies, it was enhanced during the following decade, coinciding with the disappearance of the dictatorships and the spread of democracy.
Thus the first generation agreements were born and the economic contributions which improved cooperation were increased.
In the following decade â the nineties â the third generation agreements were born with the inclusion of conditionality clauses and support and promotion for peace processes.
These more committed policies gave the European Union great visibility, ending the century with the negotiation of an association agreement with Mexico, which was a milestone in the European Union's policy.
All of this led to the expectation that we would continue along this path.
Nevertheless, during the first half of this decade association has only been extended to Chile.
The ambition for a new strategy appears to be paralysed and strangely this coincides with the enlargement of the Union.
Meanwhile, the United States is extending and continuing bilateral negotiations aimed at consolidating its position in the region â which, furthermore, is nothing new â with the same countries from which the European Union is demanding the signature of a hypothetical association agreement as a prior condition for regional integration.
Two very different approaches.
In a few monthsâ time, the Heads of State or Government of the subcontinent and the European Union will meet in Mexico.
This summit will be a great opportunity as the Commissioner has stated.
The idea of this meeting is magnificent, provided that it produces more than a list of good intentions.
Perhaps the Commissioner could give us more details so that we are better aware of the agenda.
As has already been said, the city of Puebla has recently been the venue for the meeting between European Members of Parliament and the Parliaments of Latin American political integration.
The debate gave rise to a series of agreements and objectives which are expressed in the final document and which can be summed up as greater bi-regional cooperation, greater integration, strengthening of parliamentary dialogue and the agenda for association.
The agreements we are analysing today are undoubtedly more ambitious than those signed in 1993.
Let us trust that they enter into force within more reasonable timescales.
I would personally like to be optimistic and for these agreements to be a valid instrument for moving forward with association.
It is the case that current commercial exchanges are very modest â and this is reflected in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energyâs text â even with the facilities provided by the system of generalised preferences and, furthermore, these exports, which are not sufficiently diversified, are constantly subjected to reductions in international market prices.
An association, however, is rather more than a commercial agreement, the implementation of an economic policy or a development cooperation project: at times like this, the era we are living in, in which nothing is immune to globalisation â including terrorism â association agreements must also be seen as instruments for collective security.
We are talking about countries with difficulties, with levels of poverty which are so high that that poverty may come to threaten internal peace, but which, at the same time, have extraordinary potential, which are culturally close to us and which see us as a model of opportunity.
Finally, Mr President, given that the texts of the agreements cannot be modified, this debate should at least serve to ensure that Parliament's opinion is taken into account if it is finally decided to take a more committed step and, as has been done with the southern Mediterranean countries, to make progress on association with the Andean countries, the Central American countries and â we should not forget â the countries of Mercosur.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission's two proposals have to do with political dialogue and cooperation agreements rather than with an association agreement.
That is why we regret the lack, in these proposals, of attention to an integrated economic and social development strategy, which, needless to say, is what that region deserves.
First of all, a partnership-oriented agreement on cooperation with the Andes countries can help defuse the explosive political and social situation in the region.
I would mention Columbia as a case in point.
Over the past fifteen years, more than two million people have been driven out of their homes in that country, and there is an enormous humanitarian need.
We need to step up our efforts in order to find a solution, with political means, for the armed conflicts, and to restore peace and social justice.
The social situation in the Andes countries deserves more attention.
Many of their inhabitants are still living in abject poverty.
Two extremes: in Columbia, the so-called richest country, a quarter of the population has to manage on less than USD 2 a day.
In Ecuador, the region's poorest country, this percentage is even higher than 50%.
In the Central American countries, on average, a third of the population has to live on less than USD 2 a day.
In Nicaragua, only four years ago, 10% of the poorest Nicaraguans accounted for less than 1% of total consumption, while 10% of that country's richest inhabitants took up more than half of total consumption.
Malnutrition has been a serious problem for years in those countries, and it has got even worse in Guatemala.
In the political dialogue, the Commission remains focused on the governments and their machinery.
That is necessary, but it is, in fact, of huge importance also to involve the region's parliaments and civil society in the dialogue.
This will benefit human rights, democracy and transparency more than if we focus only on diplomatic channels.
Consequently, the EU should not only broaden the scope of the political dialogue by adding more partners, but should also complement it by integrating social and economic strategy as a priority.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Patten has defined these agreements with two words: âstrategyâ and âtransitionalâ.
I must thank him for his frankness, because in a way the two concepts are contradictory.
The debate on the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreements between the European Union and Central America and the Andean Community are a good example of the current situation of our relations with these countries, which I, in addition to the words you have used, would say is currently unsatisfactory.
This is a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, but we are not making progress with our commercial relations.
In reality, over recent years our relations with these areas of the world have not progressed in the way this Parliament would have liked.
The crisis facing the Andean countries as a whole and in each one of them individually has not been helpful in terms of improving these relations.
Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia are experiencing very difficult times which have hindered their processes of sub-regional integration, and this has not made it easy to make progress on our relations with them.
The same can be said of Central America, where huge swathes of the population, young people in particular, who are increasingly marginalised and turning to crime as a result of their social marginalisation, are becoming an urgent problem for these small Central American States.
I hope that the agreement with Mercosur, which is on the point of being signed, if things go ahead as planned, will be added to those in force with Chile and with Mexico and that these two regions can benefit from more ambitious agreements, the results of which will not be seen by the current Commission and Parliament, but by our successors.
Â Â  Mr President, Parliament cannot raise any objection to these agreements, and that is quite simply because they are two proposals entirely devoid of content.
They are two agreements which I could define as heaven: a lot of good combined with no bad whatsoever.
We are all in favour of cooperation, of exchanges, of the development of democracy etc., but there is nothing tangible in these agreements.
There is no financial obligation, no commercial obligation and no institutional obligation.
This is happening, furthermore, at a time when Latin America, despite its difficulties, is experiencing a period of stability, that is to say, there is some lack of stability but, despite the poverty â which Mr van den Berg referred to â Latin America today is generally speaking a peaceful and calm subcontinent.
There are no international conflicts, there are internal conflicts, but they are on a very small scale compared to those during the eighties, and I have the impression that this is the time for us to effectively help the good people of Latin America to move forward.
In order to do this, however, we firstly need a specific policy with regard to the region.
I do not know whether this policy has to be strictly one of free trade or increasing exchanges with them, but one which at least helps them to form a differentiated entity.
Because what characterises Latin America at the moment is that it is a region which is very different from the other regions of the planet.
In this regard, the Commission's failure to adopt a specific financial regulation for Latin America seems to me to be an enormous error.
I believe that the important thing from now on, rather than offering formulae or recommendations, is to listen to these Latin American countries and to work together to help them to develop and, perhaps, if that continent continues to develop, we may find in Latin America the necessary counterbalance which we are currently lacking in other parts of the world.
Â Â  Mr President, these reports deserve praise for confirming the position of the European Parliament on the important issue of cooperation and solidarity, but they also demonstrate the shortcoming of being simply answers to a consultation, without having the status of a parliamentary âopinionâ.
Despite this limitation, they very clearly express Parliamentâs position on the need for the agreements to go beyond what is known as âpolitical dialogue and cooperationâ and become genuine association agreements.
As a matter of fact, these two reports and four opinions received only three votes against, with the opinions of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy preventing unanimity.
Whilst we all know of Parliamentâs unhappiness with simply creating the political conditions necessary and imposing a model and whilst it is a matter of regret that the Commission proposals do nothing more than pave the way for future negotiations, Parliament uses these reports to suggest that the agreements on which it has been consulted should constitute a stage of transition and of preparation.
We feel that what is at stake is the concept of cooperation and we would, therefore, like to go further, as advocated in the opinions of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
It is indeed regrettable that these agreements are geared towards preparing a political framework that makes matters dependent on free trade agreements and that there is no understanding of these agreements as being part of an integrated strategy for economic and social development to combat poverty.
Through these agreements â to use an expression favoured by Commissioner Lamy at the 7th Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly â it would allow clauses excluded from the WTO Cancun meeting to come in through the back door.
The ACP countries are attempting to prevent this in the economic partnership agreements and, amongst other issues, to prevent various forms of liberalisation being imposed in areas for which they are attempting to find solutions that are best suited to their national situations, specific characteristics and processes.
In particular, we are talking here about public services, the fields of health, education and water supply â particularly the latter, because this is crucial to many of these countries.
It is significant that, amongst the various approaches, as these agreements illustrate, they are looking to achieve the same thing, which is to foist a single-society economic model on a market which is free but not fair.
At the moment, the aforementioned cooperation does not cover economic and social development strategies to combat poverty, and everything is dependent on a market- and profit-driven ideology, thus widening the already shocking social disparities.
Â Â  Mr President, in supporting the political dialogue with the Andean Community, let us recall that only a month ago Colombian President Uribe was in this Chamber championing his so-called democratic security policy.
However, this is a policy that is not democratic, with violent intimidation leading to the withdrawal of candidates in 100 municipalities at last October's elections.
It cannot bring the much-needed security that the Colombian people deserve.
Uribe's policies for mass arbitrary arrest have shot prison numbers up by more than 10Â 000 in the last year.
The countryside is flooded with military personnel, and orders have gone out to kill people in groups of four or less in a sickening attempt to reduce the number of recorded massacres without any real diminution in the grisly death toll afflicting the country.
Indeed, evidence from the Colombian Commission of Jurists, backed up by the University of Bogota, shows that there has been no reduction in deaths at all.
Of course, we also condemn the murderous and brutal activities of the guerrillas, but two-thirds of the human rights abuses are perpetrated by the Colombian military or their paramilitary allies, which Uribe is now cynically seeking to legalise.
That is why we should use the political dialogue to maintain Europe's opposition to the military solution represented by Plan Colombia, to condemn human rights abuses on all sides in the Colombian tragedy, to insist that Colombia abide by all the commitments made in the London Declaration of 2003 and to act as advocates for grassroots projects, such as the EU-funded peace laboratories, which truly point the way to a just and lasting peace for Colombia.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I will join with those who have expressed their congratulations and thanks in this House. Allow me, though, alsoÂ âÂ on the subject of the Association Agreements that we are discussing todayÂ âÂ to point out a more general desire voiced by the European Parliament to achieve stronger, more voluntarist and more incisive agreements between the different stakeholders of the European Union and the Andean Community or the countries of Central America.
These agreements stress and emphasise the institutionalisation of political dialogue and the improvement of governance.
Can we talk about governance without linking it to the issue of the global development strategy, designed, for example, to combat poverty?
Can we talk about improving governance without talking about, and touching upon, the issue of economic and social integration?
These are elements that are, I believe, missing from our approach.
It is imperative that three points are raised. The first is the question of the role of dialogue between the different parliament members and with the national parliaments.
Today, the members of parliament from the different countries represented are pointing out their weak position and their marginalisation in the current type of political system. This was mentioned in the report on our meeting in Puebla at the beginning of the month.
As was done in our final memorandum, it is up to us to once again give them the role to which they are entitled and to also grant a role to the different actors representative of civil society, whether they be unions, companies or organised civil society.
The second point concerns the issue of regional integration, which is fundamental.
Can we, however, be happy with free trade agreements whilst ignoring the social aspects, especially the issues concerning fundamental rights; in other words, without talking about the actual situation when it comes to the populationsâ well-being?
Of course, we are faced with countries where poverty is extreme. That is what we are all saying.
We should, however, have the political courage to know exactly what we are talking about when we talk about poverty.
The poverty of the populations is extreme, but it is on the issue of unfair distribution of wealth that we must speak out and help our parliamentary colleagues to act âŠ
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0131/2004) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs (rapporteur: Horst Schnellhardt);
- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0129/2004) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (rapporteur: Horst Schnellhardt);
- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0130/2004) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing certain directives concerning food hygiene and health conditions for the production and placing on the market of certain products of animal origin intended for human consumption and amending Council Directives 89/662/EEC and 92/118/EEC and Council Decision 95/408/EC (rapporteur: Horst Schnellhardt);
- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0138/2004) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (rapporteur: Horst Schnellhardt).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commission representatives, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by personally thanking the representatives of the Commission and Council for their excellent cooperation over the last two years.
I had the opportunity to work on these dossiers with both the Italian and the Irish Presidencies, to which I am grateful for an outstanding and comradely piece of cooperation.
What is it all about?
The four regulations we have before us are an important part of the measures to improve food safety in the European Union.
They were drawn up with the aim of replacing 17 directives and making the law more coherent and more science- and risk-based.
Do the texts produced by the Commission, Council and Parliament meet those requirements?
I believe they do.
I believe we have created an excellent legal base. The effects may be described as follows:
Firstly, there is greater legal certainty.
The proposals build on tried and tested practices with additional measures for greater food safety, but the crucial thing is that they are a new legislative concept.
The choice of a regulation, which means that the same text applies everywhere in the European Union, was a decisive step for greater coherency and less bureaucracy.
That the Commission, Council and Parliament have agreed to expand the mandatory parts of all requirements is very much to be welcomed.
This will enable firms involved to act with greater legal certainty.
When requirements are constantly changing, that is of immense importance.
Parliamentâs efforts to limit the scope for amending the annexes in the comitology procedure must also be seen as part of this approach for stability and legal certainty.
We have found a more or less acceptable arrangement.
I can, however, also assure you that we shall be watching the use of comitology for amending the annexes very critically.
Legal certainty must be the main concern.
We do of course need flexibility as well to be able to respond to new dangers and new situations.
I believe we have that, too.
The second principle behind the new food safety rules is in the interests of all concerned.
The introduction of the âfrom farm to tableâ principle, self-inspection by businesses with the use of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) principle and of guides, and the greater attention paid to scientific findings are the essence of the new approach.
Everyone concerned is brought into the system.
However, the new system also takes account of the type of production process and the guarantees offered by the food business operator.
That is why the new approach is also marked by greater flexibility.
The fact that exemptions and variations are possible is not inconsistent with the aim of improving food safety.
They are, however, only permitted for traditional production methods in difficult remote areas, that is, in places where remoteness of location or the mountainous nature of the region brings its own problems, and of course where local markets are supplied.
The great variety of means of production in the European Union can be taken into account.
I believe that making this dependent on the competent authorityâs risk assessment was a wise approach.
I will mention only in passing that the Council and Commission have slightly watered down the âfrom farm to tableâ principle in as much as the HACCP procedure will not be mandatory in primary production.
I believe we have managed to find a wise solution here, too, in leaving the arrangements to the Member States.
In accordance with this âlow requirements for low riskâ approach, however, we should give small businesses the assurance that evidence of the results of the HACCP principle can be provided in a form acceptable to the firm.
I am referring here to recital 15 of Common Position No 1 on the food hygiene regulation, according to which good hygienic practices can replace monitoring of critical control points.
I consider this arrangement especially suitable for artisanal small businesses.
The official veterinarian is central to the proposed system of official supervision of meat production.
He performs audits and inspections so that the requirements of the relevant provisions can be observed by all concerned.
The official veterinarian must have the statutory means to enforce the requirements.
This also means that the legal texts must lay down clear criteria for his decisions.
That is why it is important that Parliament has included the basic tasks of official controls in Article 3.
The veterinarian and official specialised assistants must also show evidence of a high level of expertise.
I believe this is right.
In some Member States, however â and that is already evident â this will require a change to veterinary training.
The authorities in the Member States should also act quickly to ensure that enough personnel are available to be able to comply with the wide-ranging regulations.
So far as I am aware, only a few countries currently have the staff to perform such tasks as the rule we have adopted about the conditional approval of establishments.
Let me make this clear: with their current staffing levels the authorities will not be able to check three times in six months that an establishment meets the approval requirements.
Another thing required of the competent authority is the integration of controls.
It is no longer enough to concentrate on the enforcement of statutory provisions.
The involvement of businesses in food safety matters also requires greater flexibility on the competent authorityâs part.
The business operator should see himself as a partner and be seen as one.
That cannot be legislated for by statute, but the foundations for greater food safety through cooperation have been laid.
One point was a matter of dispute for a long time: the involvement of slaughterhouse staff in official controls.
I am aware â and I am speaking here as a parliamentary rapporteur â that the compromise that has been reached may not meet with this Houseâs approval.
There are a number of reasons for this.
Some say, for example, that this rule will not help us in what we have always been trying to do, that is, to improve food safety indeed, that it will have quite the opposite effect.
The regulation on official controls of feed and foodstuffs requires those carrying out official controls to act independently.
The establishmentâs staff are dependent on the head of the establishment.
Staff training restricts the veterinarian and therefore hampers his ability to make controls.
There remains the question of costs.
Does the operator really save inspection costs?
I do not believe so.
All the calculations show the opposite.
I think, gentlemen of the Council, that we should agree here to come back to this and try to clarify it in perhaps two or three yearsâ time.
Since this regulation brings much that is new to the Member States and will require a lot of adjustment by all concerned, we should first apply it for two or three years and then concentrate on this question again.
I think we should use the existing outcome and adopt these regulations in this legislative period without further discussion.
They are an important foundation for food safety.
As the Commissioner has now arrived, I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: my sincere thanks to you and your colleagues for your extraordinarily close cooperation in working on the texts of these regulations.
I think it is a good piece of work and we will come much closer to our objective of improving food safety in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I first express my thanks for all the hard work done by members of the committees concerned with the proposals on food hygiene.
Almost four years have gone by since the Commission presented this package.
I would therefore like to remind you of the objectives that were envisaged when we put forward this recast of the hygiene rules.
In summary, we are pursuing four objectives.
The first objective is to adapt hygiene legislation to the general principles of food law set out in the White Paper on food safety.
The second objective is to make the existing rules more science- and risk-based.
The third objective is to define the role of the competent authorities; and the fourth objective is to consolidate and simplify the regulatory environment.
The discussions on the package have taken a long time, both in Council and in Parliament.
This is not surprising, taking into account the wide interests covered by the proposals and their highly technical nature.
This long period gave ample time to reflect on the proposals and the time is now ripe to conclude the debate and adopt the legislation.
The Council's common position is, in the Commission's view, a fair compromise that clearly reflects the views of Parliament.
I was pleased to hear that the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have recognised this fact.
Nevertheless, a number of amendments were tabled for the second reading.
With a view to addressing the points set out in these amendments, the Commission has contributed to the establishment of a compromise between the Council's position and that of Parliament.
Discussions on such a compromise were successfully completed and Coreper has already endorsed it.
Amendments reflecting this compromise package have also been tabled for the vote later today.
I am concerned, however, lest there be a desire to cherry-pick the compromise negotiated with the Council.
A compromise requires that all parties make concessions.
This relates in particular to the involvement of slaughterhouse staff in meat inspection for veal and pigs.
The common position, approved unanimously by the Council, foresees the possibility of slaughterhouse staff carrying out some inspection tasks.
The Commission believes this is appropriate.
It is not, as some say, a privatisation of meat inspection.
It only allows the slaughterhouse staff to assist the official veterinarian.
There is no general authorisation for involving slaughterhouse staff in meat inspection.
Subsidiarity is the guiding principle here.
The decision as to whether to apply the system will be taken by the Member States on a case-by-case basis.
Moreover, the proposed regulation contains a number of very strict rules that guarantee the independence of the controls.
These include in particular that the slaughterhouse staff involved in meat inspection must be independent from production staff and must report directly to the official veterinarian.
Slaughterhouses that wish to involve their staff in meat inspection must be specifically authorised for that purpose by the competent authority.
I would like to stress that the system has already functioned satisfactorily for more than ten years for poultry meat and rabbit meat in most Member States.
No complaints have been registered and no misuse has been reported on this.
Taking account of these elements, the proposal to extend the system to veal and fattening pigs is proportionate and fully in line with the objectives of the proposed legislation I outlined to you a couple of minutes ago.
The Commission is willing to go along with the compromise proposal put forward by the Council that would defer the entry into force of the system for another three years.
This is reflected in Amendment No 21 to the proposal on official controls.
The Commission cannot, however, support Amendments Nos 9 and 14, which the rapporteur is recommending that Parliament support.
Should these amendments be adopted, conciliation would appear inevitable.
This would be a pity, particularly having regard to the length of time â since July 2000 â that these proposals have been under consideration.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate my gratitude to all those who have contributed to reaching this stage.
The Commission can accept all amendments to the common position that are part of the compromise package negotiated with the Council.
The Commission cannot support amendments falling outside this package.
A full listing setting out the details on this will be made available to Parliament's secretariat(1).
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, who has negotiated tenaciously for many years.
I believe that with the results before us today we have taken a step towards greater food safety in Europe.
It is also important, when food comes over the border, that we should be able to tell the citizens they can rely on that food being safe and that there are no health risks.
We have, however, also managed â at any rate better than in the Commissionâs original proposal â to make the proposals practicable.
I would like to draw attention to one particular point in the first Schnellhardt report on general food hygiene.
The HACCP plan is a very good plan for large businesses.
Large businesses that employ a large number of people, possibly in several Member States, have to keep accurate records of who has handled a product when.
From the outset, I found it difficult to transfer this concept to very small businesses, because if a restaurant or confectionerâs employs only two or three people, we do not need any written documentation to know who has handled the product and where harm may have occurred.
In such cases, verbal information is enough and that is why, in the negotiations, we pressed very hard for the documentation requirement for small businesses to be toned down in line with the risk associated with this type of production.
We do not think documentation is necessary at all for very small businesses.
It would be practicable then.
It would not be detrimental to consumer protection, but we would ensure that small businesses in particular are able to apply the rules appropriately.
The outcome is not exactly what we would have wanted.
We have, however, reached compromises on many points, especially in the first report, and we are therefore able to back the reports with a clear conscience.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is customary at the beginning of our speeches for us to express gracious sentiments about the good working relationship with the rapporteur.
Much as I, of course, appreciate Mr Schnellhardtâs work and efforts, I am, to be honest, somewhat disappointed with the way in which he has gone about things.
It is not very upright to negotiate with the Council on your own initiative and to take only your own amendments into consideration.
Personally, I think that it does not reflect well on Parliament to agree on a compromise with the Council and at the same time to want to adopt the original amendments.
That is not a credible working method.
Today, I should like to take a brief look at five years of food safety and on nearly three years of food hygiene.
When it comes to general food legislation, we have jointly decided that food producers shoulder the main responsibility for the safety of their products and that the way in which they do this should be monitored by the government.
We are now on the verge of turning back the clock.
I do not agree with this, but this is where I am not speaking on behalf of my group.
How did we get into this situation?
I think that first of all, we should search our own hearts.
The food hygiene dossier is complex and contains hundreds of amendments about all kinds of details.
As a result of this, only a few spokesmen are involved in this dossier and it is very easy for outsiders to spread misinformation.
What is it all about?
What is crucial is who monitors the food producers.
In the light of general food legislation, this question seems straightforward to answer.
The producers ensure that their products are up to scratch and the government monitors the final inspection.
The Commission, in agreement with the guiding principle that was established for meat producers, particularly pork and veal companies, under the watchful eye of the government, wants to offer the opportunity of accepting their responsibility and of carrying out the monitoring activities themselves.
Part of the meat sector also wants to carry this responsibility and call an end to cases of abuse.
There is much opposition to the idea that butchers should inspect their own meat, and rightly so, for the government should have a monitoring role and has a clear task in the inspection.
However, giving butchers more responsibility is a positive step.
A majority of our group has rejected the idea of the meat sector taking on the responsibility itself.
According to them, the staff at meat companies are not capable of monitoring quality, or in a position, to do so.
I have a different opinion personally.
I think we should move away from authoritarian companies who do not tolerate any criticism from their staff with regard to the quality of their products.
I do not think that Parliament should regard the workers in the meat sector as frightened and uninformed people incapable of forming their own opinions.
As long as the government has its monitoring role, companies can carry the responsibility themselves.
I therefore urge everyone to support the compromise that we have reached with the Council and to prevent us from adopting the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for that is not the right way to go about things.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now close to the end of almost five years of work on trying to obtain safer food in Europe.
MrÂ Schnellhardtâs recommendations constitute a very important part of these efforts because they affect the issue of how matters should in practice look in restaurants, shops, abattoirs and cutting plants, irrespective of whether they are large or small.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I am not without certain views to the effect that the matter has taken an eternity.
It has been tough.
MrÂ Schnellhardt and I have, of course, had different views on certain technical issues when it comes to both his and my reports, which have a lot in common with each other in certain areas.
Nonetheless, I have to say that, in the last analysis, MrÂ Schnellhardt has done a very constructive and skilful job.
There is no doubt about that.
I wish to thank him for his cooperation.
We shall support the compromise, if not wholeheartedly.
There are a couple of small aspects about which I am extremely concerned, for example when it comes to the definition of cutting plants.
The definition does not expressly state that the rules in actual fact apply to all establishments that cut and otherwise deal with raw meat.
I regret that, because we know how dangerous such plants are for, even if feed producers, farmers, hauliers and abattoirs behave perfectly correctly, hygiene can still be completely ruined at the very last stage.
A compromise depends, however, upon both give and take by the parties concerned.
The ELDR Group, to which I belong, will not get exactly what it wants, otherwise, we should of course be in a dictatorship rather than in a democratic assembly.
I am concerned about the cutting plants.
I hope that the European meat industry will go to court if the definition is not interpreted as best it can be.
Otherwise, we support these recommendations and are very pleased that we have reached this agreement.
I should like to state that those of us who have worked on it have, in general, done some skilful and persistent work to make food safer.
I should also like to mention MrsÂ Corbey and MrÂ Whitehead.
It is perhaps we who have been most industrious in these matters.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Â Â  Mr President, this hygiene package consists of a number of elements, all of which are very important: a proposal on general food hygiene, a proposal on food and animal origin and a proposal on official controls mainly concerning slaughterhouses.
The Council's common position has taken on board the majority of Parliament's amendments from first reading, but there remain differences mainly concerning the following points.
How far can hazard analysis and critical control points â HACCP â be implemented in primary production on farms?
What flexibility is going to be granted to Member States?
Will it be a general clause for comitology, or a more specific rule which allows comitology only within a set of fixed aims, as it would appear the rapporteur prefers?
Will we see the self-control of the meat industry by employees working as meat inspectors?
Would the flexibility foreseen for small artisanal slaughterhouses be defined by marketing only regionally as a result of requiring the presence of official veterinarians during every slaughter process?
The key issues for my Group at the first reading were basically the direct marketing of food on the farm or at local retailers and flexibility for the processing of traditional products.
These are mainly covered by the Council's common position which we very much welcome, because we feel it is important that there be some flexibility for the processing of traditional products and also in relation to artisanal production.
The problem for my Group with the compromise package now proposed by the Council is where the latter insists on extending controls by slaughterhouse employees to include pigs and calves.
My Group â and as far as I know the rapporteur â strongly objects to this self-control.
It would allow self-policing and it could end up with a blind eye being turned in certain circumstances, depending on how productive some of the slaughterhouses are: so this is not a good idea.
It is not in the interests of what we are trying to achieve.
We do not want this point accepted.
That is the key issue for us as regards this report.
We are pleased that the issues of artisanal and local production of traditional products have been taken into account in the common position.
Â Â  â Commissioner Byrne, today Parliament is going to vote on a very important package, the one on hygiene, and I must say that the initiative started by the Commission White Paper on food safety to recast all food legislation has been one of the topics that have made this parliamentary term stand out, with its basic aim of assuring consumer health and safety, at least from a legislative point of view.
This is an absolute priority, given the âpoor hygieneâ episodes that have occurred in recent years and also in view of the backlash that many primary sector activities have suffered as a result.
If we look at the compromise position proposed by the Commission, the Councilâs response and Parliamentâs own position, it is clear that, as with all compromise and mediation positions, everyone would always like something extra.
I believe, however, that this is a very sensible compromise position because it is a compromise between the demands of producers and those of consumers, between good business and safeguarding the basic right of citizens to safe, healthy food and produce.
There are three considerations I should like to make.
We should have preferred it, of course, if the regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs provided for a perhaps more forceful implementation of the HACCP system and probably referred more closely to the .
We should probably also have liked greater insistence on the âfrom farm to tableâ principle, a principle that is very attractive to consumers but which needs to be made much clearer and involves additional costs to the farming sector.
Lastly, we should have liked to underline more strongly the fact that we consider it essential that regulations approved in the Community should be equally valid in all the Member States; it would therefore be appropriate to restrict the possibility of approving changes and to authorise them only to give greater protection to an individual countryâs traditional products, without ever relaxing food standards and safety.
One final word on Amendments Nos 9 and 14, Commissioner: they are dear to us; they put us in the forefront, so to speak, as Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, first, we should all congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his work on these reports.
It has been something of a marathon and a lot of hard work, but he has done a very good job.
We now have a package of measures that is going to ensure the health and safety of the European public and the quality and safety of the European meat supply for the foreseeable future.
These measures, when put in place, are ones in which we can have confidence.
Some of the issues have been more difficult than others.
We all recognise that the system should not be overburdened with too much bureaucracy, and we have acknowledged the need â certainly in some sectors â for self-inspection or inspection with a light touch.
In the areas of poultry and rabbit production, there is clearly a demonstrable need for that and there is no serious problem of public health.
However, there is a need for an independent inspectorate to keep a close eye on certain sectors, such as the work in abattoirs and slaughterhouses across Europe, where there is a lot of time pressure and pressure to perform and where there is evidence to suggest a potential public health risk â most notably in the red-meat sector.
Whilst I do not know anyone who eats raw rabbit or raw poultry, I know many people â some are Members of the European Parliament â who eat red meat that is either raw or close to raw.
Consequently, there is a greater and more serious health risk in that sector than in meats that are cooked before being consumed by the public.
For that reason, I consider the compromise arrived at by the Council â regarding the possible extension of self-inspection to areas such as pork and veal â to be a dangerous one.
I feel it is one that we should not be stepping into at this moment: it crosses the species barrier and it opens up the possibility of self-inspection in the red-meat sector in the future.
I cannot support that.
All of us realise the importance of these public health measures: we need only recall the terrible food poisoning incident that took place in Scotland owing to the contamination of red meat only a few years ago.
We have got to protect public health.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to echo the words of thanks that have been expressed not only to the rapporteurs, but also to the shadow rapporteurs.
Today, we are presented with a good opportunity of completing the whole food legislation package, namely the assessment of safety right down to the last step.
What we are discussing today makes possible the repeal of a huge number of directives.
We will be able to tie up all the loose ends with regard to the issue of the verifiability of food production, the integral chain approach, or in other words the stable-to-table approach.
There are quite a few snags in the compromise package that the Council and the Commission have tabled and which was rubberstamped by Parliament.
However, everything is at risk of falling somewhat into disarray at the last minute because there seem to be a few misunderstandings.
I am also addressing Mr Bowe when saying this.
What is it about?
It is about defending the compromise that the Council has tabled.
What is at issue is that it should be possible for companies where food is produced to take on some additional responsibility, that a thorough check is carried out into what is wrong with the meat and that we subsequently, under the final responsibility of the official veterinary and the government that has appointed the veterinary, state whether we think the meat is up to scratch or not.
In the Netherlands, this system has been functioning to everyone's satisfaction for some years now.
Mr Bowe stated a moment ago that a few years ago, there was a problem in Scotland involving red meat, but I should like to point out that a different system is used over there.
What we have to do is to ensure that the responsibility is laid on those shoulders that can unreservedly carry it.
That means that the system needs flexibility and that red tape should be reduced to a minimum, but that, however, guarantees must be in place such that the consumer can count on being given food that is safe.
I would therefore urge the House to support the Council's compromise.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the threat posed by the Commission's proposals in terms of the privatisation of the independent meat inspectorate in the United Kingdom.
This issue has been raised, not only by the Consumers' Association, but also by the UK trade union Unison, which represents meat inspectors.
The feeling is that the Commission's proposal would allow privatisation through the back door by placing the responsibility for hygiene in abattoirs on the meat plants themselves.
Therefore the independence of meat inspectors would be compromised, as those paying their wages would then be the companies they are in charge of inspecting.
Consumer protection should be our Number One priority and no consumer should be put at risk of consuming unsafe meat.
Just last week we saw the issue of chicken on sale which, according to the Consumers' Association, had incorrect sell-by dates on the packets.
On top of this we have the backdrop of BSE, the tragedy of foot-and-mouth, and E.coli scares.
In fact, the situation that happened many years ago to which Mr Bowe referred involved the butchers my family used in Wishaw in Scotland.
There has never been such a need to reassure consumers that the meat they are consuming is safe to eat.
It is in the interest of the consumer, but it should also be in the interest of the industry.
When visiting a meat plant some months ago I was reassured that the quality of meat was of the highest standard and that the meat inspectors played an important role in securing quality and safety.
We should not put at risk the independence of the meat inspectorate.
There are 1200 independent meat inspectors in the United Kingdom and I hope they will be able to continue the work that reassures us as consumers that the meat we eat is safe.
Â Â  Mr President, this is part of the health package put together with the food law legislation, and I salute Mr Schnellhardt for what he has done over many years in this regard.
I support him in his urge that we should limit the degree to which the annexes here can be altered by comitology.
The devil is in the details.
We do not want the disease to be in the details as well.
We have cause for concern in all circumstances where food of animal origin is being packaged and identified.
The Commissioner knows from my own correspondence with him of the difficulties we have had in the East Midlands with the Denby scandal and others where meat was wrongly identified and sold when it should not have been.
The extension of inspection by ancillary staff in the case of red meat causes us special concern.
We do not want to see this extended to fattening pigs and calves.
The Commissioner said that this is perfectly safe and it has worked very well with white meat.
I am not so sure it has, and if he sees the Consumers' Association survey of the conditions in which chicken is being packaged and sold, he will see that there is room for doubt and concern even here.
It is not a reflection on the hard work and dedication of the staff who are employed in slaughterhouses.
It is only to establish that they are not put under intolerable pressure and that every possible safety means is employed.
I personally salute Unison, the trade union, for campaigning on this issue.
On this and this alone I believe that we have reason to go beyond the common position for safety's sake.
Â Â  I thank all colleagues who have contributed to this very pleasant debate.
Obviously Parliament and the Commission are making a lot of progress.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon.
Â Â  .
Consumers are entitled to demand that the food they buy and eat is as safe as it can be, and I fully support that principle but, in our anxiety to put in place regulations which will work, giving consumers the guarantees they require, we should not throw out existing measures which are already proving effective.
I find it unbelievable that the present independent meat inspection system in the UK could be bettered by adopting the same style of controls currently operating in the poultry sector.
To anyone who has visited a modern poultry processor, it will be obvious that the process is entirely different from that which applies in an abattoir.
Of course I accept that controls are put in place from farm to plate, but surely it makes sense to retain those parts of the chain which are successful, and to add in controls in areas where improvement is seen to be required.
For that reason I will be opposing the parts of this package which would dismantle or privatise the independent meat inspection service.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0197/2004) by Albert Jan Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EEC.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I first express my thanks for all the hard work that has been done by members of the committees in respect of the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport.
Let me acknowledge, in particular, the efforts made by Mr Maat on this important initiative.
Animal welfare is an emotive subject.
This is reflected by the wide participation in the debate and in part by the large number of amendments tabled.
The Commission proposal aims to achieve significant improvement in the welfare of transported animals.
It focuses in particular on long journeys, as it is these journeys that are most likely to cause problems.
It seeks to introduce clearer and upgraded standards, as well as stronger enforcement rules.
This proposal has been the result of extensive analysis, scientific advice and stakeholder consultation.
I am sure it does not fulfil the wishes of the ardent proponents of both sides of the animal welfare debate, but I am quite sure that if introduced now it would implement major improvements in the transport conditions of animals that have been the dream of animal welfare enthusiasts for years.
I make really sure that any amendment which either seeks unduly to liberalise transport conditions or restrict them is doomed to failure.
I have indicated that I am willing to participate in constructive dialogue with a view to reaching a speedy agreement and an early improvement of transport conditions.
One of the major political aspects of the dossier concerns travelling times.
The Commission proposes to replace the current rules by a simple scheme for all species involving a nine-hour maximum travelling time, to be followed by a minimum of twelve hours' rest if the journey is to be continued.
It is no accident that these times coincide with the travel and rest rules applicable to drivers.
Hence, enforcement should be much more straightforward â a crucially important aspect of this legislation as far as I am concerned.
I am prepared to consider variations on the theme proposed by the Commission in order to reach a durable compromise.
However, let me be very frank: I cannot accept amendments which have as their practical effect a ban on the transport of live animals whether for slaughter, further rearing or breeding purposes.
I believe such a move would be illegal and of the Treaty.
It would be liable to be struck down by the Court.
In all events, there is no chance of such an initiative being supported in the Council.
That is why I have been suggesting the adoption of an intelligent and sophisticated approach to the improvement of animal welfare.
Putting it bluntly, tilting at windmills will be poor consolation if the greatest opportunity in a decade to improve welfare arrangements is not to be grasped.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his initial contribution.
However, before I add my own comment to the new animal transport directive, I should like to dwell briefly on an event in my own country, namely the departure of our Queen Mother, Princess Juliana.
During her reign, she always showed a special interest in the agricultural sector and cattle farming in my country.
To her, each and every human being and animal mattered.
I would like to commemorate her today at the start of this debate and commiserate with her family and with all those who will miss her.
The review of Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC on the transport of animals has been rather a long time coming.
I appreciate Commissioner Byrne's contribution, because after our debate on the resolution of 2001, he took up the gauntlet after all.
In addition to animal welfare, it was mainly the FMD crisis and the outbreaks of swine fever that were reasons for me as rapporteur to subject legislation to a thorough overhaul.
I have to say, though, that the Commission's proposal does not offer a real choice.
Given the proposed time limits of nine hours in transit and twelve hours rest, with unlimited repeats of this cycle, and the very generous expansion of space allowance per animal, one can confidently conclude that transport in excess of nine hours would become unaffordable.
As rapporteur, however, I distance myself somewhat from that approach, because it does not do any justice to the already difficult income situation in cattle farming and because the limitation of the risks of animal diseases and the regularisation of the slaughter practice are insufficiently addressed.
Moreover, too much space per animal leads to an unnecessary risk of injury during transport, so let me now set out the line I have decided to take.
First of all, transport up to 100 kilometres should be kept outside of the scope of the directive, to avoid the so-called farmers' transport for slaughter and productive cattle from becoming unnecessarily expensive.
Moreover, this transport mainly involves regional cattle farm systems and during these transports, there are hardly ever, if any, problems involving animal welfare.
Secondly, space allowance requirements for cattle for slaughter should not be considerably altered.
The restriction in the transport of cattle for slaughter to nine hours or 500 kilometres, the time and distance covered by 97% of cattle transported for slaughter, already applies.
Transitional provisions should be put in place, though, for regions that have few slaughterhouses or special market problems.
In addition, I should like to argue in favour of specifically promoting the establishment of slaughterhouses in regions where animals are kept.
Why, when milk and sugar are generally processed in the regions where they are produced, would this not be possible in the case of animals for slaughter?
Thirdly, with regard to productive cattle and traditional systems for fattening animals, I suggest a transport limit of 30 hours, including eight hours rest, but no unloading at staging places.
I would also argue in favour of a separate regulation for cattle for breeding and racehorses, with a strict rest and feed regime.
In general, however, the transport conditions for this group are already excellent.
Fourthly, I am in favour of more, and also more specific, controls of international transport.
This point, in particular, is the Achilles' heel of current EU practice.
Fifthly, I would like to see rest periods and driving times in existing EU directives for the transport sector coupled to fresh legislation.
Furthermore, the GPS system should be introduced for international transport, so that unnecessary bureaucracy is prevented and controls can be carried out much more effectively.
The fact that especially this latter point is no unnecessary luxury has, , been demonstrated in unannounced road checks in Austria, where no less than 50% of the animal hauliers appeared to break the law.
It also raises questions when no fewer than 221Â 000 live cattle are exported to Lebanon every year, which translates into an entire cow for every two families in Lebanon on an annual basis!
As far as I am concerned, there is every reason to adapt legislation, particularly with regard to the transport of animals for slaughter.
I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to support Amendments Nos 1 to 97 inclusive, Amendments Nos 109, 110, 111, 112 and 115.
This strikes the best balance between animal welfare and what cattle farmers would find economically acceptable.
If the Council adopts this proposal, cattle farming in Europe will not be squeezed out of the market and animal welfare will enjoy a structural improvement.
I would ask the Commission and Council to adopt a preliminary position at this stage.
Finally, I should like to thank the different groups for the excellent cooperation during the preparation and discussion of this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Environment Committee's opinion on this issue was very positive: it was clear that the committee wanted to stand by the position taken by many Members of this Parliament â over 400 Members signed a resolution calling for 8 hours as a maximum overall journey time.
In relation to the Commission's proposal, many of the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee were not taken on board in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but I hope the amendments that have been tabled will be supported when the vote takes place.
The rest period on the vehicles, for example, is completely impractical.
A rest period on a vehicle cannot be considered as a rest period for a number of reasons.
Firstly, conditions do not change at all for the animals.
It would be very difficult to water and feed those animals unless the vehicle is equipped to make that possible.
If that were the case, it would be economically unviable for transporters to have such a vehicle.
It is going to be very difficult to look after the animals if the rest period is on the vehicle.
How are dead animals going to be removed from the vehicle?
There was a recent case in Ireland in relation to Pandora, which said it did not want to transport live animals any more, presumably for economic reasons.
They can see it coming in the future.
Also, in relation to the continued cycle, the idea of a period of rest on a journey that can continue indefinitely is completely unacceptable.
Even the industry does not agree with the rest period on the vehicle.
This is one of the key issues that have to be addressed in Parliament this week.
In relation to fraud in export refunds â an issue that came up during last night's sitting and in the media recently â one of the ways to avoid that would be to get rid of export refunds.
The vast majority of European citizens do not want their money used to subsidise the inhumane transport of animals, which causes untold and unnecessary suffering.
I agree with Mr Maat about the provision of local abattoirs.
In some places in Germany, mobile abattoirs are provided to slaughter animals if no abattoir is available locally.
We must ensure that animals are not subjected to unnecessary suffering, and this is clearly unnecessary.
The Environment Committee is strongly of that opinion.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Maat for bringing forward a very practical report on animal transport, because it is absolutely sure that we all want to see animal transport tightened up.
It is a very emotive issue, nowhere more so than in the UK.
I would also like to thank him straight away for co-sponsoring my amendments to ask the Commission and the UK Government to look for an opt-out, especially on the transport of live horses to the continent for slaughter.
This is something that has not happened in the UK for over 70 years, and we want to make sure it does not start to happen again.
I thank Mr Maat very much for that.
One of the good things about Mr Maat's report is that he has differentiated between animals going for slaughter and those going for further fattening.
There is no justification for taking animals on huge journeys for slaughter â whenever possible they must be slaughtered in the country where they are reared.
We have also heard that at the moment about EUR 52 million is still being paid out on export subsidies.
A lot of these cattle are going to Lebanon, and their journeys do not end there: they continue for a great many hours after that.
We have to make sure we put an end to that.
As we put this legislation in place, one of the keys to this whole process is proper enforcement: to ensure that we have the right type of lorries and the proper rest periods.
We must also ensure that if these international transporters do not meet the requirements, they have their licences taken away.
This would send a very clear message to the industry that you cannot abuse the system.
What we are trying to do is good, and we need to get the right type of transport in place.
I disagree with the Commission proposal on the idea of a 12-hour rest on a lorry, especially if it concerns sheep.
This is not practical and we must have an overall end to the journey.
That is what Mr Maat is proposing in this report.
I very much recommend the report to the House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all, I should like to thank my esteemed fellow MEP, MrÂ Maat for his outstanding work on the report and also for the very constructive cooperation we have enjoyed.
Only because of the rapporteurâs persistence and huge efforts have we got so far as to have the report on the agenda for this part-session.
Animals will benefit from the fact, and it should be to the delight of the many Europeans who are concerned about animal welfare.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have tabled an amendment that limits the journey time for animals for slaughter to eight hours.
There was no majority for this in the committee, but hopefully there will be a majority for it during the vote.
I am genuinely pleased that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted my amendment concerning differentiated places in the case of journey times of less than four hours, for this will contribute to still more journeys taking place over short distances and, thus, to animals remaining in their countries of origin and being slaughtered there.
In addition to journey times, there must be a lot of focus upon the conditions under which animals are transported, for even a journey time of two hours can be too long if the conditions are not as they should be.
I am therefore delighted that the proposal on the table contains so many good decisions about ventilation, temperature and gradients of loading ramps.
In that connection, it is definitely also worth mentioning that certificates are now being demanded of haulage contractors and that there is a demand for drivers and others who have dealings with animals to be trained to recognise and respond to issues concerning the animalsâ welfare.
Â Â  Mr President, we are dealing with an important issue which, like many other issues, faces scientific uncertainties.
What is peculiar about this issue is the erratic nature of the Commissionâs proposals.
Faced with the difficulties of defining animal welfare in an objective manner, the Commission has been making proposals by trial and error.
Having tried to apply the inapplicable rest centres, it is now making the current proposal which is just as extraordinary, in my view.
How can we imagine that an extended stop during the journey can benefit animal welfare?
Looked at in this way, it seems to me to be extremely simple-minded.
We can imagine the effects of such a proposal if applied to ourselves.
Allow me to offer this comparison: if on a car journey, just before reaching our destination, we were obliged to stop for a considerable length of time, without getting out of the car, our nerves would naturally suffer considerably.
While the Commission's proposal poses serious problems in terms of rigour, we must acknowledge that the draft report, despite the efforts of Mr Maat, represents little more than âevery man for himselfâ.
Firstly, a distinction is established between animals intended for slaughter and animals intended for fattening.
Why should animals intended for slaughter have more right to well-being than those intended for fattening?
As far as I am aware, according to the Treaties, all men are equal, and animals as well.
It is clear that the draft report guarantees that 40% of Dutch exports of pigs go to their farthest destination: the Spanish market.
Alright: 1Â 400Â 000 pigs will be able to travel for 30 hours, while the poor pigs intended for slaughter will have the right to a final wish and will not be able to travel for more than nine hours.
What a wonderful achievement for the welfare of animals!
It is true that, with the nine hours, pigs originating from Poland, for example, will be able to be sacrificed in certain nearby countries, leaving the added value there and not exactly promoting compliance by Polish slaughterhouses with Community legislation.
In my opinion, this draft report addresses many issues and not simply animal welfare.
We must recognise that nobody transports animals for the fun of it.
The transportation of live animals is expensive and complicated, and is only done when necessary.
I believe that the essential thing as far as the welfare of animals is concerned is to reduce the total travelling time for all animals.
Â Â  Mr President, it is nothing short of a tragedy that the Commission proposal before us is not proposing an end to the long-distance transport of farm animals and a ban on live exports.
Huge numbers of people oppose live exports; they are unnecessary, cruel and unjustifiable.
My Amendment NoÂ 114 would enable Member States to ban them, and I urge colleagues to vote for it.
This is not 'tilting at windmills', as Commissioner Byrne put it.
It reflects public opinion, it respects much scientific opinion and it is the only humane and acceptable approach.
That the EU can continue to allow animals to be transported across Europe for many hours â sometimes over 40 or 50 hours, sometimes up to 90 hours â is completely unacceptable, both from an animal welfare point of view and from the point of view of trying to prevent the spread of disease.
It is therefore crucial that Parliament accepts our amendments, particularly Amendment NoÂ 123, for an overall, final maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for fattening.
Although it now seems that the United Kingdom Government is apparently â at the last minute â supporting the amendments for an overall eight-hour limit, I fear that this can only be a cynical PR stunt, since for the last six months it has been wrecking just such an outcome in the Council of Ministers.
Not only that, but the United Kingdom Government has also completely failed to guarantee to protect our horses from being exported to the continent for slaughter.
These are hugely important issues and we must make sure that our parliamentary response addresses them properly.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EU is the reason for the long journey times for animals.
The implementation of the internal market has required the elimination of the veterinary borders.
Systematic veterinary controls at the borders are viewed as technical obstacles to trade.
It must be possible to transport livestock freely around the whole of the EU like any other goods.
Effective border controls on the transportation of animals are being made unlawful.
The Commissionâs proposal is a consistent implementation of this idea.
The Commissionâs proposal ensures that the fullest possible use can be made of all the economic advantages.
A small pig born in Sweden can be fattened in Portugal and slaughtered in Poland, as long as savings are thereby made.
That is the heart of the Commissionâs proposal.
Animal welfare has nothing to do with it.
Long journeys amount to cruelty to animals, and livestock diseases are becoming more widespread.
Veterinary safety is threatened, with animal and human health suffering as a result.
For example, we now have the multi-resistant salmonella DT104 in Denmark.
This must be stopped.
There must be legislation in relation to the internal market.
Amendment NoÂ 100 exempts livestock from the rules governing the internal market.
It must be possible to devise more far-reaching national rules governing the transport of animals and the equipping of vehicles.
It must be possible to introduce veterinary inspections at the borders with attendant quarantine arrangements.
This will be effective in limiting livestock diseases, and it will decisively reduce the number of long journeys so that, as a minimum, the longest journeys will be of eight hours.
Moreover, this will apply to all animals, both those that are going to slaughter and those that are for fattening.
In another amendment, I propose that, for journeys of over eight hours, there should be systematic veterinary checks at the beginning of the journey and on the unloading platform at delivery.
That is necessary in order constantly to evaluate whether the journeys have been defensible in terms of the animalsâ welfare.
At present, it is only the driver who provides feedback on the schedule, and this feedback contains no information about the condition of the animals.
In the amendment, I also propose that animal transport exceeding eight hours should be subject to a levy towards the funding of checks and supervision.
If the controls are to be effective, they will involve costs.
The expenses linked to this aspect of livestock production must be defrayed in the form of a charge paid by the haulage contractors to the local authorities.
There is no question of an EU tax.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Byrne, the incredibly detailed draft regulation that we are debating this morning is a perfect example of a useless text.
There are already sensible provisions regulating the transport of animals and favouring their well-being, which is one of the characteristics of the European agricultural model.
The only problem is that these provisions are not adequately applied everywhere and are not monitored enough.
Rather than, however, ensuring that there is better application and control â too difficult a task â the Commission decided that it was more rewarding for it to once again rush headlong into regulation by presenting us with this hefty new tome which concedes to the most radical demands of the ideological lobbies whose influence it is under.
The major repercussions that its wording could have on our transporters and breeders are of little importance to the Commission.
It is not visibly the problem of the European Commission which, as is its wont, does not even think about providing, alongside the legislative project, a study of the impact of the measures that it is proposing on the activity of the professionals concerned.
We had lengthy discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development about how steep access ramps to livestock trucks should be.
Should they be no steeper than 33.3% in relation to the horizontal, or 30% for pigs, calves and horses, and no steeper than 50% or 30% for sheep and cattle other than calves, provided that the ramps are equipped with cleats at intervals of no more than 30 centimetres?
All that remains to be taken into account is the friction coefficient of the hooves on the ramp.
This gap will certainly be filled in the next draft regulation submitted to us by the Commission.
Frankly, is it really our role to overburden our producers, breeders, transporters and wealth and employment creators with such meticulous instructions and to force them into such a tight straightjacket?
Is it not downright suicidal to establish such heavy burdens and such costly constraints only upon European economic operators in a context of free trade where we ourselves are managing without regulatory instruments?
Is that not working to benefit third countries, discourage our producers and encourage imports?
Despite the few common-sense remarks inserted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, such as the need to slaughter livestock as close as possible to the place of rearing, the structure and the spirit of the Commission regulation basically remain intact.
This is why, MrÂ President, we will vote against this damaging text.
Â Â  â Mr President, animals in the past, apart from those traditionally involved in transhumance, did not travel long distances and so throughout their lives they only made the journey to the slaughterhouse.
Today, however, the problem of regulating the various aspects of transport has become a major component of legislation in the animal production sector.
The first requirement that has arisen concerns health, especially the spread of transmissible diseases.
Added to this is the increasingly important question of animal protection and stress factors.
Animal welfare during transport more directly involves operators other than farmers, even though the latter often suffer its consequences, both upstream, when they receive the animals to be added to their holdings, and downstream, because of the effects that transport can have on quality and hence on the return they get for their products.
Legislation protecting livestock during transport, in particular the regulation on which we are preparing to vote, is based on scientific and technical evidence.
In this specific instance, we recall the studies following the report by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, which took into account over 300 sources and drew up 55 recommendations.
If we consider the five freedoms mentioned in the Bremmer report in 1995, we realise that the unloading, loading and moving operations will have a profound effect on each of these five freedoms.
Indeed, it has been proved that this set of operations causes the animals greater stress and suffering than any other farming practice.
I therefore think that the maximum hours proposed and the system of rest periods are too reductionist, and the reasoning adopted in support of shorter travelling times cannot be justified from a scientific point of view: the Scientific Committee itself did not set this limit when it drew up its report.
There is no doubt that transport can have a great many adverse effects on animals, but the whole situation must be analysed in technical terms for the good of both the animals themselves and the operators.
Â Â  Mr President, the objective of this Directive, which is to ensure that animals are transported in dignified conditions, deserves all our support, but we want all decisions we adopt in this regard to be based on scientific and technical criteria.
Furthermore, we must not forget that the transport of animals is subject to the rules and standards of the internal market and that we cannot legislate without taking account of economic reality, because surrounding the transport of animals there is economic activity for many areas of the European Union.
We cannot agree with the rapporteurâs proposal with regard to the difference between animals intended for slaughter and animals intended to live.
Dignified transportation affects both equally.
With regard to the duration of transportation, from the outset the Commission has maintained its desire to bring the permitted duration of transportation into line with social legislation, but the truth is, Commissioner, that the best thing for the animalâs welfare is to reach its destination as quickly as possible.
A rest of 12 hours for animals in the vehicle blatantly violates the welfare and dignity of the animals being transported, but the restriction of nine hoursâ transportation also blatantly violates the principle of the internal market.
We therefore believe that the coherent and correct solution or proposal will be to establish the obligation for two drivers, with a cycle of nine hours which would allow for a brief rest in order to be able to continue another cycle of nine hours in the transportation.
Finally, I would like to say that we believe that all our efforts on this proposal to guarantee the dignity of animals in transport must focus on good conditions for the vehicles which transport them, good preparation of the people responsible for the transportation and, above all, ensuring that the rules we decide on here are complied with throughout the territory of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank Mr Maat for the skilful and sensitive way in which he has handled a complex dossier.
I am particularly grateful that both the Commission proposal and the report recognise the practicalities of transporting animals in remote and island regions, such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
The distinction between journeys for slaughter and for other purposes is an important one.
Other than in the most exceptional circumstances, eight hours on the road should be sufficient for slaughter and the recommendation in the report to promote the use of local slaughterhouses should make these circumstances less likely.
Movements of animals for other purposes â such as bringing on, breeding or restocking â may genuinely require longer journey times.
However, both the Commission proposal and the report seem to allow too great a repetition of travel time sequences.
Our Amendment No 105 seeks to place a limit on these, but one that is still consonant with reasonable farming practices.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is good that greater attention is to be paid to animal welfare requirements in future by shortening transport times and improving transport conditions.
It is far more important, however, that there should be a marked reduction in animal transports themselves.
That really would be in the animalsâ interests, and it would also make it more difficult for dangerous animal diseases to spread and reduce environmental pollution from carbon dioxide emissions.
Most people think it is uncivilised to drive animals hundreds or even thousands of kilometres across Europe and the world for slaughter.
They rightly demand that animals be transported to the nearest abattoirs and be marketed from there.
It is after all much easier to deliver frozen meat to remote areas.
Transports of slaughter animals should be limited to four hours.
That is long enough to reach an abattoir from almost any farm anywhere in Europe.
The report says the cross-border transport of animals is necessary because of the unequal distribution of resources and demand, owing to geographical and historical factors.
I cannot support that view.
EU subsidies have nevertheless been widely used to encourage concentration of abattoir capacities.
The main reason is the policy of liberalisation and concentration, which is destroying regional trade patterns.
So long as this policy is applied, everything that is to be done to protect animals during transport will be treating the symptoms and not the cause.
What the report says about giving priority to slaughter close to place of rearing, financial support for local slaughterhouses or the use of mobile slaughterhouses will be impossible to achieve in a European Union of 25 Member States.
The reality is different.
The merger trend in the slaughtering industry is continuing.
The distances over which animals are transported are growing.
Monitoring animal transports from space by satellite positioning may be a very interesting technology, but it is just one method of surveillance, of which in my view we have too many.
The effectiveness of all methods should be looked at again.
This report ought to be promoting regional business cycles.
That is why I can and must say that it needs to be completely revised to that effect.
Â Â  Mr President, every day, animals are transported for appallingly long distances across our continent.
Dutch pigs spend 30 to 40 hours being transported to Spain and Italy; Irish sheep travel to Greece and even the Middle East.
Transport times of 90 hours are not uncommon.
That is cruel.
Horses from Eastern Europe are taken to Italy and Greece.
That should stop, but the Commission has not proposed anything to that effect, and unfortunately, Mr Maat's report does not call an end to appallingly long transports of this kind either.
More than one million Dutch pigs travel over the Alps and Pyrenees to Italy and Spain in order to be fattened there.
My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, wants to put a stop to this.
Although Mr Maat has joined 333 MEPs in signing the written declaration to call an end to all animal transports lasting over eight hours, he is now sadly backtracking.
This is, regrettably, typical of the Christian Democrats, for whom economic interests take precedence over animal welfare.
For my group, precisely the opposite is the case, and a huge number of Dutch people and Europeans are on our side.
The discussion in the Council, it has to be said, is even worse.
Nobody in the Council is calling a halt to anything anymore.
We have to stand firm on our views, give a clear message and not give in at this stage, for otherwise, alas, the Council will make an even worse job of it.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to comment on the Commission recommendation concerning staging posts when live animals are being transported from one Member State to another within the Union.
Whilst the welfare of animals being transported from one jurisdiction to the next must be of paramount importance, I do not believe the policy direction proposed by the Commission to Parliament with regard to this measure is correct.
Staging posts were originally introduced as a disease-control measure when the problems concerning BSE were first discovered.
A lot of research has been carried out in Ireland on the merits or demerits of staging posts in general, and studies by leading agricultural research institutes have shown that it is better for animal welfare on long journeys between Ireland and the continent that staging posts remain.
Staging posts allow animals to be unloaded, watered and rested, and also the essential cleaning and rebedding of trucks.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recently approved an amendment which stated that the competent authorities in each Member State shall identify a sufficient number of suitable unloading premises and notify the European Commission at regular intervals.
This is a wise approach by the Committee on Agriculture.
We all want to see the welfare of animals being transported long distances protected.
The provision of proper conditions for live animals moving from one Member State to another must be guaranteed.
However, how do we ensure that this is the case?
I for one believe that the retention of staging posts is of key importance in this regard, and I am certainly not alone in this view.
Â Â  Mr President, as long as people eat meat the treatment of farm animals will be the subject of lively debate.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wisely chose Mr Maat to prepare this report, which largely succeeds in reconciling animal welfare with the economics of farming.
The fact that over 450Â amendments were tabled showed the extent of interest and the wide range of opinion as to detail.
MrÂ Maat handled this with skill, but on such a high-profile issue the amendments tabled before Parliament calling for even tighter conditions were to be expected.
The committee's report achieved a number of important objectives: a reduction in travelling times; upgraded transport conditions, including provisions for rest periods, feeding and watering; additional training for drivers and animal handlers; improved enforcement of the rules; stronger rules relating to journey planning and registration; satellite monitoring of vehicle movement; the ability of Member States to ban export of animals for slaughter is included; there is a preference for slaughter near to the farm and encouragement for mobile slaughterhouses.
Looking ahead, we must ensure that the rules are properly implemented, that transport as meat increasingly becomes the norm, and that the rules are driven more by science than by emotion.
I shall support the report and look forward to early adoption of the revised rules.
The provision of a review clause would be helpful and I trust the Council will introduce this.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 95% of live animal transports are by road and we are all familiar with the images of tormented animals confined in a very narrow space for days on end as they are transported across Europe and beyond.
There can be no doubt that something needs to be done.
I support the proposals made in this report that will help to improve standards in live animal transports, such as setting minimum standards for the vehicles used, but above all the introduction of additional supervisory measures, because however good the rules may be, they will not work if there are no controls.
There are already plenty of rules, but enforcement and controls are lacking.
Amendment No 2, of which I am a co-signatory, is designed to clarify the term âjourneyâ in order to prevent the maximum duration of transport being exceeded by the back door, so to speak.
Transport times must be reduced in any case.
The vote has been brought forward to today.
Amendment No 81 states, and I quote: âsequences of travel times may be repeated during a journeyâ, which means there can be repeated journeys and the time limits can be avoided.
As a block vote has been applied for, it is no longer possible to vote against Amendment No 81 on its own.
I consider that unacceptable.
The best thing would be for animals to be transported as little as possible.
That is probably pie in the sky.
We must be clear that sales-based support for live animal exports is an incentive and that we are therefore deceiving ourselves if we want to cut animal transports to a minimum so long as such support continues.
Â Â  â MrÂ President,I too would like to thank the rapporteur for producing an excellent report.
Animal welfare must be ensured during transport.
This is an important issue.
Most consignments are of course undertaken in the proper manner.
We have nevertheless seen horrendous instances of problems occurring. They have to be eliminated by means of clear regulations and effective monitoring.
Circumstances vary from Member State to Member State and region to region.
The circumstances in Finland are the ones I know best, especially in the sparsely populated areas of the north.
Distances there are long, farms are few and far between, and slaughtering is concentrated in just a few large units, partly owing to stringent EU regulations.
Animal transport is nevertheless handled excellently.
Vehicles have camera surveillance and air-conditioning, and the animals are loaded using lifts.
The proposed maximum transport time, however, is not totally adequate.
It is necessary for the welfare of the animals that a derogation is granted in the case of sparsely populated areas, mountains and islands and that this time limit is extended.
A derogation is also required for the transport of breeding calves.
Keeping animals on vehicles during long breaks or unloading them periodically is impossible.
If this derogation is not granted, agriculture in the peripheral regions of the Union will become impossible, which surely is not the purpose of the report.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism agreed to the derogation, and it is also contained in MrÂ Maatâs report.
I hope that Parliament will also agree to this derogation and that agriculture may also be able to continue in thinly populated areas.
Â Â  MrÂ President, for us, the European Commissionâs proposal in this area is completely unacceptable.
It seems as if the starting point for the proposal was that it should be about goods being transported as efficiently as possible in an internal market.
This is a mistaken point of departure.
We should instead be proceeding on the basis that what is at issue here are animals, that is to say sentient creatures.
It is this insight that is the very basis of the rules to be adopted.
We in the Nordic Green Left welcome the fact that the committee has made this progress.
We believe, however, that still further progress can be made in several areas.
We shall vote in favour of the Member States being entitled both to introduce and to retain national rules that are stricter than the EU rules in this area.
That applies not only to journey times.
We recommend that an absolute maximum of eight hours be introduced for journeys and that it should not be possible to circumvent this time regulation with reference to rest time in the vehicles that are being used for transportation.
The rules in the Commissionâs proposal relating to space in the vehicles used for transportation are inadequate and need to be improved.
We believe that the same rules should apply to all types of transport, irrespective of whether it is transport to slaughter or transport for fattening elsewhere.
Strict rules regarding this point are positive above all in terms of the animalsâ well-being, but also because they will favour local abattoirs and the development of mobile abattoirs.
I wish to add a few words about the EUâs export refunds in connection with the export of livestock from the EU.
Large sums are at present used for these export refunds.
This practice is completely indefensible.
It means direct support for comprehensive cruelty to animals, with very long journey times.
It is entirely obvious that there are large problems involving the misuse and direct misappropriation of money within this sector.
Budgetary control is very deficient in this area.
It is not reforms that are needed where this issue is concerned. Refunds for the export of livestock from the EU should instead be completely abolished as quickly as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome MrÂ Maat's attempt to tackle this very difficult subject.
Animal welfare is a very emotive issue in many ways, so any new legislation must be based on sound veterinary and scientific information.
To judge from the amount of lobbying on this issue, this is clearly a very important issue for the citizens of the European Union.
I particularly welcome amendments acknowledging difficulties facing remote and peripheral areas for the transportation of animals â including Wales and the Western Isles of Scotland.
That is an important inclusion within the body of the report.
I hope we do not get bogged down, for example, in whether it is to be eight or nine hours.
Rather, we should focus on what in my view is the far more important issue of proper policing of the regulations and ensuring that the rules are as practical and as workable as they can be.
I would like to see the live trade ultimately replaced by a carcass trade, with animals slaughtered locally.
We know of the dangers of not slaughtering locally in the wake of the epidemics of foot-and-mouth and other diseases, where because of transportation of animals, those kinds of diseases spread across the country far more easily.
Where the transport of live animals is necessary, I hope we will end up with legislation that is both firm and fair for the industry.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have always held that the degree of civilisation of a people can also be measured by how much they respect animals.
In this regard, I should like to thank Mr Maat for his excellent report, which is a move in this direction, and for the improvements made in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which, in relation to the Commission proposal, help to give a more civilised image of our continent in the field of protecting animal rights.
Of course, it is not just a matter of image â of projecting a more humane image outside the confines of the European Union â but it is also, and I might say above all, a matter of substance.
Some aspects of the problem involve animal health, as has already been mentioned.
Let me underline a few of them.
First of all, the maximum length of time spent on the road: given that livestock should be moved as little as possible, it would be appropriate to limit transport to eight hours or 500 km per day at most.
That would apply both to slaughter animals and to those intended for fattening.
As regards the transport of animals for breeding, shows and competitions, however, transport for more than eight hours should require the use of special vehicles.
What does âspecialâ mean?
It means that these vehicles should be fitted with equipment to measure the temperature and humidity in the livestock compartment, and there should be a forced ventilation system that operates when the vehicle is stationary.
Finally, in addition to the quite reasonable requirement of special training for drivers of vehicles intended for the transport of livestock, because we know that inappropriate driving inevitably causes the animals serious and unnecessary damage and suffering, I should also like to underline the need for an official veterinarian to be present while the animals are being loaded.
This is to ensure that the rules for transport â the fitness of the animals to travel, and the minimum space allowances â are observed.
For this reason we particularly support Amendments Nos 121, 122, 123 and 124.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Maat, most sincerely for his report because he really has tried to reconcile the very contrary positions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in a document that we can live with.
I would also like to support what has already been said today.
Animal welfare must be dealt with scientifically and not just emotionally.
The avoidance of unnecessary animal transports and the protection of animals during transport are fundamental concerns of agriculture, especially of farmers and producers.
It must be ensured, however, that the statutory provisions are realistic and that their enforcement will not place our European farmers at a competitive disadvantage.
It must all remain within a sensible economic context and it must also comply with the European Unionâs laws.
That was also something that Commissioner Byrne mentioned.
It is of course in everyoneâs interest â farmers, animal welfare and the animals themselves â that animals should arrive at their destination safe and sound and in the best possible condition.
This is particularly the case of animals for slaughter because the quality of the meat depends on it.
Let me make one observation here, Mr President: once the animals leave the farm, they are in fact no longer the producerâs, the farmerâs responsibility, but the responsibility of the carrier or buyer.
I am also very grateful to the rapporteur for paying attention to traditional pasturing and transhumance, which is absolutely essential in mountain regions.
One last thing.
An international organisation called PETA is currently mounting a large-scale campaign in Austria, and I believe in other Member States as well, about the keeping and slaughter of farm animals.
The treatment of animals is being compared with the horrors of the Nazi regime.
That is an insult to all those who perished in the Holocaust, and I ask you to protest against it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commission has given its proposal for a regulation the title âProtection of animals during transportâ.
I should probably say that, in my view, there is a considerable disparity between the title of the proposal and its content.
With the Commissionâs proposal, it is still possible to transport animals thousands of kilometres throughout Europe under wretched conditions and, moreover, without the animals being allowed at any time to leave the lorries.
In my view, that cannot be called protection of animals during transport.
Nor do I think that the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development remedies the Commissionâs proposal, and I therefore hope that, in the vote, Parliament will stick to the position it has, moreover, held for two years that the transport of animals to slaughter or for fattening should not be for periods in excess of eight hours or for distances in excess of 500 kilometres.
Because it is defensible in terms of animal protection, that would be the proposal to implement.
I am, moreover, also able to support our obtaining better conditions for animals during transport.
There is a long list of amendments that I think would remedy some of the shortcomings in the Commissionâs proposal, so that animal welfare is given precedence over the financial considerations that otherwise govern the transports.
I also think it important that we implement tighter controls, including random checks on the roads.
I believe that these would be some of the most effective measures that could be implemented.
As others too have mentioned, I think that export refunds for livestock should be abolished.
It cannot be right that, under the EU system, we give direct transport subsidies to these long transports of livestock.
Finally, I also think that individual countries must be entitled to give higher priority to animal welfare and so to lay down more restrictive rules than those proposed by the Commission.
I hope that the majority of Parliament will show that it is considerations of animal welfare that are crucial in connection with the transports.
Â Â  Mr President, the problem here is that Member States fail to enforce the rules in far too many instances.
Therefore, there are horrific cases of animal cruelty and far too many cases of animals â living creatures â simply being treated like so many nuts and bolts on a manufacturing production line.
The Commission does not have a police force, and I recognise the attempts being made by the Commissioner to try and introduce a system that is more capable of being enforced.
However, that is no way near enough.
Inevitably horrific practices will continue to occur.
We will find many instances of dead animals being left amongst live animals on journeys taking many days.
It is now some 150 years since refrigeration was introduced, which allowed beef from Argentina to be imported into Europe.
It is simply incredible that all this time later we are still transporting live animals huge distances within our continent.
The time is going to come when we will impose a ban on this, when carcasses only will be permitted.
Refrigeration permits this.
We should introduce a ban on the transport of live animals at the earliest possible moment.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate Mr Maat on his efforts because he tried hard to reach consensus.
I want to put on the record the total commitment of farmers to animal welfare.
Animal welfare is central to the ethos and the profession of farming, and I am amazed that there are always people in this House who would like to convey an alternative impression.
Animal transport is central to Ireland's agricultural economy.
We export 90% of our entire production, be it processed or live.
Much of the discussion in committee centred around transport of mature animals for slaughter on mainland Europe.
In the case of Ireland, we export young animals for finishing; so live transport is essential and central to the agricultural economy.
The retention of staging posts is important and the question of density also has an impact on the economics of transport.
The provision of staging posts, therefore, is a central requirement.
Finally, decisions must be made on scientific findings and I draw the attention of the House to the findings of the recent report prepared by DrÂ Bernadette Earley, which presented a very coherent, balanced and objective view of live animal transport to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year, millions of animals are hauled across Europe, quite often under dire circumstances.
This should stop.
The Commission has come up with a plan that definitely improves the transport of animals, and, in its opinion, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has imposed strict conditions with regard to the way in which this is done by road.
Animalsâ welfare should be improved, control should be stepped up and enforceable, and the personnel should be better trained.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tabled an opinion to the same effect, but unfortunately, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has not adopted all recommendations.
Do not get me wrong; Mr Maat's report is sound and considerably improves the Commission's plan.
For this, the rapporteur deserves all credit, but a number of important issues remain outstanding, and I should like to ask you to put this situation right.
Transport should be of a high quality, so that the welfare of the animals is optimal and stress during transport is minimal.
I think we are accommodating these requirements with this report, but the driving times should also be restricted.
There is no reasonable explanation for the fact that transport of slaughter animals is being restricted, while that of animals destined for fattening is not.
We must apply one rule for all and restrict transport in both categories.
The hauling of animals should stop.
We in this House said this years ago and underlined this once again by a large majority in a written declaration in 2003.
We now have the opportunity to translate our requirements into legislation.
Let us seize this opportunity with both hands.
I should therefore ask you to support the amendments in which driving times are restricted, the beginning and end of journeys are defined effectively, the presence of a veterinarian is made obligatory and animals in lorries are given sufficient space.
These are Amendments Nos 121, 122, 123 and 124.
Â Â  Mr President, at this stage of the debate we have said practically everything in favour and against the Commissionâs proposal, which, as Mr JovÃ© said â and I entirely agree with what he said â is being made by trial and error, with no technical or scientific rigour, and without taking account of the fact that, according to the legislation in force in the European Union, we must promote the free movement of goods, persons and capital between all the Members States of the European Union, including the outlying and accession countries, which from 1 May will be full Members.
This is not a proposal for the welfare of animals â the welfare of which I support entirely.
How can we try to justify this being applied to animals for slaughter and not to all other animals?
Transport and welfare affects all animals, not just those intended for slaughter, or is this perhaps a commercial measure, a commercial restriction?
What do we want?
For the peripheral countries to be left out of the market?
What is the technical and scientific basis for laying down this differentiation in European legislation?
Why are we justifying four hours, eight hours, nine hours?
Why increase spaces?
In order to increase costs?
Whom does this benefit?
The animals are seriously harmed, because of the risk of the friction, rubbing, injuries and fights which may arise.
What is the justification?
This is demonstrated by scientific and technical studies carried out at European level by the association of transporters.
Nor do I want to go into loading and unloading operations, temperature, etc. This is not justified either, which is what the report attempts to do in technical terms.
We call for support for the amendments we have presented so that specific treatment is given to peripheral areas â Sweden, Finland, Portugal, Italy, Spain, etc. â so that we are not left out of the market.
With proposals of four hours, in my region I cannot even get from one part to another, let alone participate in other international markets, which is my right.
Â Â  â The many opinions and different arguments show what a sensitive subject this is and what a sense of responsibility we need to show here.
We are talking about transports of living creatures with which people work and in which they trade and which, in the end, are also eaten.
Everyone who is not a vegetarian must acknowledge that.
The question is: how do we treat those animals?
The question is also: why do animals have to be transported so far?
Is it necessary for animals to be transported across half of Europe to be slaughtered?
No, it is not.
That is why this report clearly calls for slaughter animals to be slaughtered within a 500 km radius.
I believe we must insist on their being able to be slaughtered within that radius.
It must be no excuse to say there are not enough slaughterhouses; we must ensure that there are.
That will stimulate the regionâs economy and be of particular help to the animals.
That is one of the most important points and also one of the trickiest: how far should animals be transported?
Animals for fattening are counted as animals for slaughter, but I believe we should nevertheless make a distinction here.
Animals for fattening should not be lumped together with slaughter animals, but they should be taken to a farm within the same short distance.
Another important point that seems to have been overlooked is that controls are carried out.
There is a directive; there used to be one.
If anything went wrong, it was because the system was not working.
It was the failure to implement the directive properly in the Member States and the inefficient control system that caused and still causes animals to suffer.
I believe that needs to be said.
The best rules and the best directive are useless if there are no controls and they are not enforced.
In the end, that is the decisive factor and that is what will benefit the animals.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on the tremendous work he has done.
This topic has been the subject of debate for a long time: sometimes heated, sometimes misrepresented, sometimes taken in the wrong way.
I believe we need this, but it has to be realistic and it has to be workable. If it is not, then it will not work.
Nine hours is about right.
I do not think it makes much difference if we made it eight or ten hours, but we have to decide something.
I think nine hours is right, but if it is not right, then we will revisit this at some stage in the future.
But let us start somewhere!
There is a difference between animals that are going for slaughter and animals that are continuing their journey, and there is a difference between cattle, sheep and pigs.
Cattle travel long distances to go to agricultural shows, but these animals are well cared for by their owners.
The problems start when the animal leaves the farm, goes to a haulier and moves onward.
I know there are lots of differences between Member States and indeed between regions and I understand the concerns in remote areas, but we must address that.
It has to be left to some extent to individual countries and indeed regions as to how they work their way through this.
Animals should not be transported for long periods where at all possible, and the standards and the quality of lorries must be monitored very closely, especially the ventilation.
Animals should always be slaughtered close to the place where they were reared.
We should export on the hook and not the hoof.
That is the reality of this.
We should be limiting export on the hoof.
I know there is a difference, but animals must be respected and they must be protected.
Â Â  Mr President, I regret to say that, although the Commission very often surprises us with the immense quality of its documents and the time it has dedicated to analysing the reality, this Regulation presents numerous technical problems and is practically devoid of scientific basis.
Evidence of this is that it was initially proposed that animals should be unloaded to rest in open spaces and subsequently it has been demonstrated that that is also prejudicial to their health and contributes to the spread of diseases.
These are reprehensible aspects indicating the lack of maturity of a document which is being presented for other reasons.
And what do I believe are the main reasons for this document?
Firstly, there is no scientific certainty and, therefore, there is no willingness to wait for it.
That is why we have introduced an amendment which states that we must continue to carry out acute-phase protein research, which defines the stress suffered by animals.
There is no knowledge of many of the aspects indicated and therefore certain measures, for example, such as excessive separation of animals, is going to harm them, or in other words, things are going to be worse than before.
The second hidden intention in this document is clearly to create a glass barrier, a new border for the countries of the East.
In other words, on the one hand we integrate them and, on the other, we create a glass barrier, an invisible one, that is, a new form of customs, which will prevent them from crossing from one end of Europe to the other.
This concept is furthermore entirely in opposition to the general policies we are implementing on other points.
Above all, however, the intention is to dress everybody in the same suit: all animals in the same suit, like Chairman Maoâs suit.
We have therefore also tabled an amendment calling for the exclusion of certain animals, such as, for example, those for repopulation, wild animals, circus animals, because there is no doubt that a measure for animals for slaughter cannot be applied to all the others.
This is an impoverishment, a shackling, and goes against the ideas of sustainability, which are to adapt to reality and make things viable.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not find the arguments advocating a restriction of the transport of animals to a certain number of hours to be appropriate.
It is in fashion, as the Commission just acknowledged in its intervention, but they are not based on any proven scientific basis.
The possible effects on the economy of regions and even whole countries could be very serious.
The current legislation is more than sufficient to safeguard the welfare of animals during transport.
The problem is not the existence of gaps in the legislation, which already covers all the requirements necessary to ensure comfort, but rather compliance with that legislation.
The new rules should be directed towards improving controls in order to ensure respect for the legislation, rather than taking advantage of a debate such as this one on the welfare of cattle in order to introduce stringent restrictions on the free movement of goods, particularly restrictions which will not have the same effect in all countries.
The amendments presented by certain Members of this House clearly represent a step backwards in the achievements made in the creation of the single market and could lead to the isolation of many regions, especially the European Union's peripheral and outermost regions.
A restriction of the duration of journeys, without having made a prior in-depth impact study, is a measure which I would describe as clumsy and disproportionate, particularly if we bear in mind the harm that will be caused.
I would finally like to draw attention to another element of this debate whose effects could be entirely contrary to those pursued: the reduction of maximum densities, which are already laid down in the legislation.
This measure promotes aggressive behaviour amongst animals, as well as injuries due to the greater mobility of the cattle within the compartments of lorries.
We should consider very carefully our decisions on all the points of the legislation which are equally incongruous, and thereby prevent our work from simply causing greater burdens for the sector and isolating economic sectors of entire regions.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is not the first time that this argument has caused lively debate and equally lively and difficult decisions in this Parliament.
It is our job once again to attempt a real balancing act in reconciling as far as possible two opposing demands: the demand to limit the effects of transport, by those who mainly see an environmental cost in this and are therefore primarily concerned with the animalsâ health, and the demand to take financial costs into account as well, by those who want to keep transport costs down, but without ever neglecting the physical wellbeing of the livestock being transported.
In short, the matter deserves our full attention, but in these difficult judgments it is a relief to note the great advances made by technology, which today provides hauliers â that hard-working, industrious group â with increasingly comfortable vehicles, fitted with fans, mangers and drinking systems with water for rehydration.
With these new devices, more comfortable and especially longer journeys may be possible, although there must still be rest periods, which should in turn be increased to up to two hours.
Then there is a debate on the problem of unloading and reloading the animals, an operation which does not always achieve its intended aim, which is to help the animals rest.
Farmers and hauliers, and also environmentalists, tend to think that this type of operation, especially for small animals â I am thinking of calves â may cause even greater stress than remaining on board, especially on those vehicles that I have mentioned, with air-conditioning, water for rehydration and a ready supply of feed.
This too is a proposal that should not be ignored, so as not to make the wrong decision or repeat problems that have already been debated.
One would, of course, have to be inside the head or the mind of a calf to be sure of reaching the right decision, but unfortunately a calf does not think and, most of all, it does not vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, first a brief word on a point of order.
The vote has been brought forward to today, but Members have not been made aware of it.
I think it is a little undemocratic that it is not possible to hold single separate votes or to ask for roll-call votes.
The public will be very surprised and will say yet again how undemocratic this European Union is.
I want to thank Mrs Schierhuber.
She has made a clear distinction between humans and animals and I, too, would like to reject the disgusting comparison with the Holocaust.
I would like to say something to Mr Adam. It is not correct to say that anyone who eats meat is a torturer of animals.
You see, in Austria we have a national dish, , and if you come to Austria I can tell you precisely where the meat for it comes from, from the forest area of Lower Austria or from Styria.
In most cases, that is only two or three hours away.
In Austria, animals are allowed to be transported only for six hours.
It is not necessary to torture animals if you want to eat them later.
That is a change of thinking, and thinking is of course painful.
You see, Christian Democrats naturally have a perhaps rather different relationship with animals.
For me, animals are Godâs creatures and capable of suffering.
I do not know whether you have saints, Mr Adam.
My favourite saint is Francis of Assisi, and he did not only love people, he loved animals as well.
Â Â  . Mr President, the purpose of this debate is to formulate an opinion for the guidance of the Council and the Commission in coming to a final conclusion in relation to this issue.
Certainly we have had a very wide expression of views and opinions from one side and the other on the issue, and I hope and expect that the Council can draw some guidance from what has been said.
Allow me to express the Commissionâs opinion in relation to the main points of concern.
On travelling times, the European Parliament wants to introduce a fixed and final time limit of nine hours for slaughter animals, while allowing the others to travel with fewer restrictions.
As I said at the outset, we cannot adopt measures which would effectively ban a trade, particularly in circumstances where there is insufficient scientific information to support such a move.
In order to limit the transport of animals for slaughter, the European Parliament advocates the use of mobile slaughterhouses.
At present there is not enough expertise or practical experience to support this solution and the animal welfare advantages have not been clearly demonstrated.
Regarding the scope of the regulation, the European Parliament suggests a derogation for journeys of less than 100 km, as well as for certain categories of animals such as animals transported for sporting events and shows.
The Commission could support retaining the current derogation for journeys of less than 50 km, but there is no reason to exclude from the scope of the regulation other animals that are at risk of suffering poor standards of welfare.
The Commission supports the proposal to open up the possibility for Member States to adopt stricter national rules, provided that they are compatible with the general rules of the Treaty.
I am pleased that this would effectively maintain the UKâs restriction on the export of horses destined for human consumption.
I have consistently said that I would look at this matter with a view to supporting a legally sustainable text.
In relation to the authorisation of transporters and the pre-approval of vehicles, the European Parliament proposes having a single system for short and long journeys.
One of the major objectives of the proposal is to focus checks on long journeys â these are the most critical for the welfare of animals.
I believe that by removing the distinction between long and short journeys, the efforts of inspection and the administrative burdens would be diluted and animals transported over long journeys would not benefit from a higher degree of attention from the competent authorities.
The European Parliament suggests introducing the use of a satellite navigation system.
This idea is most innovative and the Commission fully supports it in principle.
I should add that the Commission proposal already includes a requirement to check the vehiclesâ tachographs as a new enforcement tool.
As regards sanctions, a number of amendments have been proposed.
Most of the suggestions are already covered by the Commission proposal through a stricter system of authorisation for transporters.
A number of other amendments on sanctions need to be examined with regard to their compatibility with the principle of proportionality.
A full listing of the Commissionâs position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament and I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for this part-session(1).
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, please be patient, I have the floor.
I have two reports, but you may be reassured to know that I shall be speaking only once.
As rapporteur for all regulations on the basis of which Eurostat has to quickly compile the best of statistics for us, I would again like to recommend here and now that you approve my two reports with the usual enthusiasm.
The first is about a regulation under which we and everyone concerned â primarily the European Central Bank â will now receive quarterly information on Member Statesâ debt.
That is very important, even if the blue letters for the deficit procedure continue to be issued on the basis of the annual figures â and even if they do not.
As you know, Member States are not treated equally in this respect.
Mr Eichel and Mr Mer might, however, discover the scale of their budget problems sooner.
They might even find out sooner what their efforts at consolidation have achieved, if they have made any.
The second report is concerned with a regulation that is to provide us with quarterly national accounts data, specifically on the contribution made by the individual sectors âhouseholdsâ, âcompaniesâ and âgovernmentâ.
The United States have had that for a long time now, because it is important for monetary policy and economic analysis to know how the various players are behaving.
The Ecofin Council recognised a year ago that the lack of information on the behaviour of households and companies in the business cycle was a major deficiency of EMU statistics.
However, all countries whose gross domestic product is lower than 1% of the EU25 total will not have to report data on transactions in the households and companies sectors.
Mr President, I have twice two minutesâ speaking time and I will keep to that â you can make as much noise as you want.
Those excluded are Luxembourg and all the new Member States except Poland.
They, too, however, must supply the quarterly data on transactions in the âgeneral governmentâ and ârest of the worldâ sectors.
Now you know what is involved and, as in the past, you can vote in favour of my two reports with a clear conscience.
They are my last reports for this legislative period, in which, counting today, I have spoken nine times on statistical reports.
I do not know whether I will be able to take care of these statistics regulations after the 13 June elections; they are much drier than wine and honey.
However that may be, I thank you for the confidence and enthusiasm you have always shown for my reports.
Â Â  Mrs Lulling, never before have European statistics been presented so elegantly in this House!
Â Â  . Mr President, on a technical matter, I want to add the words 'and to the Commission' to ArticleÂ 4 of the Schulz immunity report.
I would make the same request in relation to the Lehne report.
To explain, as Members of the House will know, ArticleÂ 9 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of Parliament confers an immunity on Members of Parliament for expressions of opinion and votes cast in the exercise of their office.
We believe that part of the German MEPs' Statute is incompatible with that.
We request, in paragraphÂ 3, that the Commission should verify whether clauseÂ 5 of the second sentence of that Statute is compatible with Community law.
However, in ArticleÂ 4, we omitted to refer the matter to the Commission in the properly formal way.
Members will also wish to know that this concerns a case in which two Members of this House have been subjected to an injunction at the instance of to prevent them holding press conferences in this House criticising the conduct of in relation to the Members' Statute.
Â Â  Mr President, as you will be aware, the debate on this report only concluded just before the vote.
This is a very complex and important report.
There have been a number of problems regarding amendments such as the order of the amendments and how they have been grouped together.
Because of this complexity and because of the importance of the report, I would like to propose that the vote be delayed until tomorrow to give people more time to gather their thoughts and to take into account what the Commissioner and others have said this morning.
I am asking for the vote to be postponed until tomorrow.
Â Â  Thirty-two Members support Mr Evans' proposal.
Does anyone wish to speak against it?
Â Â  . Mr President, MrÂ Evans' argument does not hold good.
This morning, we already voted on two other reports â four, in fact â which were also discussed this morning.
In that respect, the debate is finished.
There was, however, a chance that we had to vote on my report tomorrow, Wednesday, had the debate not been concluded.
As it happens, the debate is finished, all nominal lists were available last night, and there is no problem at all about the order of the amendments, because given the contributions of the various groups, I cannot imagine that the voting list would look any different.
I cannot therefore see any formal, or other, argument to postpone the vote.
â That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . This report addresses the Commission proposal for a regulation that has arisen following the Court of Justice ruling on bilateral âopen skiesâ agreements between EU Member States and the United States of America.
The relevant part of the ruling states the opinion that these agreements contravened Community law, since the Member States did not have the right or competence to conclude agreements of this nature.
With this proposal, the Commission has proposed three measures: to provide a legal basis for relations between the Community and the United States in the field of air transport, to create a legal framework for ongoing negotiations and for all other agreements and to ensure an appropriate division of competences between the Community and the Member States.
From the legal point of view, the Commission proposal has a very solid basis, given that it manages to plug a legal loophole created by the Court of Justice ruling.
With the measures adopted in the Council common position, which were supported by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the political limitation imposed on the Member States to negotiate and conclude bilateral air service agreements with third countries becomes much less harsh and I therefore felt able to vote in favour.
Â Â  . This proposal for a Regulation follows on from a Court of Justice ruling arising from an action brought by the Commission against Member States that had signed bilateral âopen skyâ agreements, for having infringed the Communityâs external competence and the freedom of establishment.
The Commission proposed that the Member States should initiate procedures to terminate the agreements that they had concluded and asked the Council for permission to open Community negotiations with all the bilateral partners.
As regards matters lying partly within Community competence and partly within the competence of the Member States, the Commission proposed a common approach, in other words, close cooperation.
In its Common Position, the Council accepted the positions of the EP.
The Member States will thus still have the right to negotiate and conclude bilateral air service agreements, without need for prior authorisation from the Commission, even if the subject matter of these lies partly within Community competence, provided that they include certain types of clause defined jointly by the Commission and by the Member States.
This approach will continue to guarantee the Member States freedom of action, and so we voted in favour.
Â Â  . The Commission proposal for a regulation follows on from the Court of Justiceâs ruling on the bilateral âopen skiesâ agreements between Member States of the EU and the United States of America, concluded in the 1990s by some Member States and deemed to contravene Community law.
The Commission proposes a set of rules that the Member States must adhere to when negotiating and implementing air service agreements for this category of joint agreements requiring the participation of Member State governments.
Specifically, these must support the Communityâs negotiating strategies and aims and must not enter into negotiations that lie within the exclusive competence of the Community.
The Council common position incorporated Parliamentâs basic request for the Member States to maintain the right to negotiate and conclude bilateral air service agreements, without needing the prior agreement of the Commission, even if the subject matter falls within Community competence.
The proviso is established that âstandard clausesâ laid down jointly by the Commission and the Member States must be incorporated in any agreements concluded.
With the measures adopted in the Council common position, supported by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy, Health and Tourism, the restrictions on the action undertaken by States become less stringent and I consequently voted in favour.
Â Â  . The interinstitutional agreement of 7Â November 2002 provided for the creation of a Solidarity Fund to support the population of regions struck by disasters.
The Fund can be mobilised within the annual ceiling of EUR oneÂ billion.
This is a proposal that took several years to be adopted, following our parliamentary groupâs insistence in the annual budgetary proceedings prior to 2002.
This fund helped, last year, by providing emergency aid as a follow up to the major forest fires that devastated around 5% of Portuguese territory.
Bearing in mind the urgent nature of the situation, we supported this proposal to mobilise around EURÂ 22Â million from the Fund to cover the damage caused by the storms and floods that occurred in Malta (September 2003), the forest fires in Spain (in the summer of 2003) and the floods in France (December 2003).
The inadequacy of the sums involved, however, in light of the damage that has been suffered â and Portugal last year is a case in point â raises the issue of the scale of Community solidarity and of the criteria for eligibility for this Fund.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of Preliminary Draft Amending Budget No 5/2004 in order to allocate the budgetary resources mobilised from the EU Solidarity Fund as swiftly as possible, to ensure the necessary Community assistance for communities affected by natural disasters in Spain, in France and in Malta in 2003, thereby helping to ensure that this assistance is provided as quickly as possible.
To this end, it is also crucial that this amending budget is adopted at first reading, as has happened in the past, specifically in the case of the forest fires that occurred in Portugal in the summer of 2003.
