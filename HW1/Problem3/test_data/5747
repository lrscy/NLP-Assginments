I do not think this reclassification is called for because, although the Helsinki Council of 13 December 1999 did indeed approve Turkey' s candidate status (something I would challenge, personally) it was specified that negotiations proper would not be opened with Turkey until it had satisfied the Copenhagen criteria, particularly those relating to democracy and respect for human rights.
This is a condition with which Turkey has not adequately complied to date, as everyone in Europe acknowledges.
In such circumstances even those who are in favour of Turkey' s accession are forced to accept that it is more a virtual candidate than a real and genuine candidate.
Why then should we grant Turkey a financial status which is not appropriate to its real status?
Our concerns are only intensified by the provocative actions of that country, following the French National Assembly' s recent acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide.
Not only has Turkey failed to acknowledge its own responsibility (even though the crime should theoretically be remote enough in the past not to implicate the current government) but it has also denied the facts of the case and has even taken unjustifiable reprisal measures against French firms.
This type of pressure and ongoing blackmail are inadmissible behaviour from a country which seeks admission into the European club.
We do not therefore comprehend why the Swoboda report is now seeking to implement a measure which would support these misplaced positions.
We are in favour of Turkey' s being granted financial instruments and financial aid in proportion to its size and to its needs on the same basis as the other candidate countries.
This particularly concerns the restructuring of agriculture, raising the profile of the rural environment and environmental protection.
Any discriminatory action in this respect would penalise not the leadership of the authoritarian Turkish Government but the workers of that country.
It would do nothing to support proper conditions for the necessary fight to impose respect for basic democratic rights, quite the opposite.
The best way for the European Union to force the Turkish Government to meet its commitments, a method which is lacking in hypocrisy and which does not allow a pretext for further liberal pressure, which only in any case serve the interests of free trade in Europe, would be to support the democratic opposition.
The initiatives by militants working for human rights, trade unionists and politicians may, if they are given sufficient funding to mobilise public opinion, make it possible to put an end to a regime which murders the Kurds, causes political prisoners to 'disappear' , restricts the movements of detainees, tortures democrats and lets ÃÃ§alan stagnate on death row.
. (NL) If Turkey was an EU Member State there would be a whole host of reasons for suspending its membership.
Officially this country is a parliamentary democracy which outwardly resembles Member States in terms of custom and practice, but for large minority groups amongst the population, this comparison does not hold water.
Sadly, the inhabitants of Turkey are not participants with equal rights yet, because they have different political beliefs or speak a different language.
The countless political prisoners, the ban on organisations, the press censorship, the army' s internal war against the Kurdish-speaking population, the denial of the mass murder of the Armenians and the Turks' persistent refusal to completely abolish the death penalty, show that Turkey is still a very different sort of country at present than a large majority of people in the current Member States would think desirable.
Under these circumstances, there is not a single reason for tightening the bonds of friendship and allowing Turkey to qualify for contributions from pre-accession funds such as ISPA and SAPARD.
Awarding Turkey this funding would only create the misunderstanding that the country is on the right path and that Turkey is going to accede to the EU just as soon as the Czech Republic, Slovenia or Malta.
It is not possible to bring about change in Turkey by giving money to the government.
It will only come through supporting the struggle of the internal opposition there and that of the exiles living in the EU Member States.

Action taken on EIB annual report
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2001) by Mr Lipietz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on action taken on the EIB annual report [2000/2173(INI)].
Mr President, the exercise I was asked to participate in has proved extraordinarily instructive and, I must say, a real pleasure.
There were three constraints I had to manage: the doubts and questions of my fellow Members in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the criticisms expressed by civil society, particularly through the CEE Bankwatch Network and finally the answers and arguments presented in response to both these types of question or criticism by the European Investment Bank.
I would like in particular to thank my fellow Members on the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs for the relevance of the questions that they, in a way, entrusted to me to put on their behalf to the European Investment Bank.
I would like to thank the civil society volunteers for their competence in monitoring the activities of a bank which, in the final analysis, has an influence on 5% of all investments within the European Union, making it the EU' s largest investor.
Finally, without any sycophancy whatsoever, I must thank the President of the European Investment Bank, and his colleagues, for the good will and indeed the warmth with which they undertook to discuss matters with me, to take on board and respond to criticisms, either convincing me of the legitimacy of their approach or accepting our comments and outlining with me appropriate solutions.
We have thus arrived at a report on which we are practically unanimous.
You have been able to note, indeed, that the amendments concern two mere details. I shall discuss these in the latter part of my speech.
Broadly speaking, we were unanimous on the proposals for policy which are directed at least as much to the other bodies of the European Union, and even the Member States, as to the European Investment Bank.
We fully share all the priorities which the European Investment Bank set itself and indeed with the pillars forming the basis of the bank' s policy, and grant it full discharge.
We must, however, stress that times are changing.
Europe is expanding eastwards.
It is taking on greater responsibilities with regards to the Balkans, which are not yet included in the accession process.
Moreover, Europe has signed up to the Kyoto Agreement which requires it to reduce its production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 8% on average by the year 2010.
In other words, this international agreement will become binding in 7 years' time.
Furthermore, since Lisbon, Europe has given itself the objective of becoming a world power in terms of the knowledge economy and new technologies.
Finally, Europe has given priority to the development of SMEs.
Europe is seeking to obtain this position of excellence not by means of a 'Europe Incorporated' with huge multinational businesses but rather by relying on SMEs.
There are three new objectives, then, in relation to the 1999 report, which we shall examine formally today.
However, in so doing, we shall of course be examining all the policy directions of the EIB: accession, Kyoto, the development of SMEs towards achieving excellence.
We wished to call upon the constituent bodies of the European Union and the EIB itself to reorient its policy in the light of these three objectives which were perhaps not as clear at the time when the EIB adopted its priorities or drew up its 1999 report.
The initial paragraphs of the report before you are absolutely unanimous and aim essentially at expanding or facilitating loans in these three areas.
To briefly mention the points on which we did not achieve unanimity, there was the official importance of the NGOs in the preparations for the EIB' s decisions, the affirmation of the Kyoto objectives as a genuine leading factor and finally, the arrangements for the prudential supervision of the EIB.
These three points I refer to the decision of the House.
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report on the EIB 1999 annual report and my compliments to the bank of course for the report itself.
This is the first time that the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on the annual report.
Naturally this opinion is of a political nature and it casts a critical eye over the institution.
Thus, for example, the report examines such things as the priorities and the internal and external scrutiny of the resources employed by this bank.
The EIB is the primary banker and investor for the European institutions and that is why the report analyses what the EIB' s priorities are and whether these priorities are in line with the European Union' s priorities.
Where significant differences were found, the rapporteur has looked at what the EIB should give greater or less priority to.
For example, the report asks the EIB to concentrate more on those investments that enable the EU to meet the Kyoto criteria.
As we see it, the fact that more priority should be given to this does not mean that matters such as the trans-European networks should be given less priority, as the rapporteur proposes in one of his amendments.
Next, the report draws attention to the EIB' s internal scrutiny.
The rapporteur believes that the EIB should have a better overview of the quality of the loans.
To this end, the EIB should devote more attention to evaluation of projects in the fields of regional and environmental investment, for example.
At present, there is still too little insight within the EIB into the effectiveness of the loans.
In a normal operational management process, a company keeps tabs on the returns on its investments.
The EIB should also evaluate effectiveness and the return on investments more.
A final important point is that the EIB is subject to scrutiny by the European Court of Auditors where the Community resources are concerned.
The European Court of Auditors is then required to scrutinise the resources at the disposal of the EIB as to the effectiveness and lawfulness of the investments made.
We have tabled another amendment in order to ensure that the EIB is supervised adequately and according to the same rules as any normal commercial bank regarding its banking business.
The rapporteur proposes that someone from the European Central Bank should be appointed as a member of the Audit Committee, but an audit committee has more of an accounting function than one of real banking supervision.
Both functions must be fulfilled.
However, my group feels that the European Central Bank does not have the in-house capacity for banking supervision in the real sense.
This must be organised differently, for example by the Luxembourg Central Bank.
My other two amendments are adaptations designed to remove a few minor flaws from the text.
For example, we recognise the important role the EIB has in the European investment climate and we also feel that the EIB should take more account in its internal scrutiny of the effectiveness of the European funds spent on the environment.
I am sorry to say that we do not agree with the majority of the rapporteur' s amendments because he is using them to emphasise a radical and one-sided position.
Naturally we also appreciate the importance of the environment and of NGOs, but other priorities must also be given a crack of the whip.
The Socialist Group has also tabled two further amendments and one of these has to do with a promise made by the President of the EIB.
This promise related to recruiting more women, so that the EIB employs roughly the same number of men as women, or at least works towards that goal.
That is also one of the European Union' s priorities.
We call upon the bank to make a start with this. I hope that the EIB takes Parliament' s advice to heart, particularly where the scrutiny of European funds is concerned.
That is why we support this report wholeheartedly.
Mr President, I would like to start by welcoming Mr Maystadt warmly to this almost empty hall, but I can assure him that even when we have the President of the European Central Bank visiting us, by no means all delegates attend.
So the fault does not lie with you.
First and foremost, I would like to propose that we make a tradition of this, just as we do with our debates with the European Central Bank, with Wim Duisenberg.
I think it would be a good idea to carry on the tradition of devoting attention to the European Investment Bank here in Parliament, and I hope this will then stimulate more interest than is in evidence today.
A few days ago, you held your annual press conference, and presented the results for 2000.
What we have here is nothing new, but it is something that happened at roughly the same time.
I think we may be able to do it next year but in any case, I would like to propose that we put the annual report on 2000 on Parliament' s agenda just as soon as we can, and prepare it at least as thoroughly as we have done with this annual report.
Before I make a few comments as to content, I would just like to compliment the rapporteur too.
If the press report from last week is anything to go by, he has acquitted himself well.
I think the said press report also revealed that the bank has given a great deal of thought to environmental groups in its policy, and to the environment in general, and I believe its activities have contributed to this as well.
I myself have concentrated, on behalf of my group, on a number of other key points which, incidentally, largely coincide with those of the PPE-DE Group.
My first point concerns job creation, particularly in SMEs and the social sectors, whilst my second point is about transparency and supervision of the EIB' s activities.
I will talk about employment first.
The employment objective, which is also one of the European Union' s priority objectives - I think Lisbon confirmed this once again - is expressed too implicitly in your plans and reports to my mind, and is not sufficiently visible or verifiable.
It seems as if the reasoning prevails that economic growth will automatically create jobs and so there is no need to treat it as a separate issue, let alone consider the quality and sustainability of the jobs.
You certainly aligned yourself with the policy initiatives from the European Councils, as we can recognise the incentives created by the Luxembourg Summit and the special action programme promised in Amsterdam, in this report.
And then you rightly took up the initiatives from the Lisbon Summit held last year and in particular, launched new initiatives for the knowledge-based economy and new technologies, notably the innovation 2000 initiative.
I would now like to present you with the challenge of aligning yourself with new initiatives in the coming year, at the Stockholm Summit scheduled for next month.
There, the Swedish Presidency will pursue the line taken in Lisbon, and hopefully also succeed in making an annual tradition of these spring summits on socio-economic affairs.
The Swedes are not planning to establish a whole host of new procedures and processes on this occasion.
What they have succeeded in doing to my mind, is add a very important feature to the policy agreed in Lisbon, that of attention to the qualitative aspects of employment.
The quality of work is an extremely important consideration if people are to be able to function properly in the economy, in an economy based more on knowledge and creativity.
Attention must also be given to adequate participation in the labour market.
These are very important matters that we must concern ourselves with in the months to come.
Perhaps you could take up the challenge of including this investment in quality in a follow-up initiative after Stockholm.
Also on the SME front, I see that in 2000 you very nearly doubled your efforts to EUR 6.2 billion.
I think that is to be welcomed, but I would also ask that special attention be given to the SMEs that have difficulty acquiring risk capital through normal channels.
These are often highly innovative businesses too and so they do not belong to the very sectors of the economy that do attract capital from the stock market and risk capital, which is precisely why I want to draw attention to those flanking businesses that can provide quality work.
That is why we ask that attention be given to the social economy and to the development of what the French so beautifully call service de proximitÃ© (local service).
I have a final comment to make.
Perhaps I should leave it out though because I think I can concur with what Mrs Peijs had to say on the matter, with the exception of her comments on the role of the ECB.
What our group does want to do is pursue the discussion on the potential role of the European Central Bank, also with regard to scrutiny of prudential rules and banking supervision.
Mr President, Commissioner, President of the EIB, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, for his excellent report.
The European Investment Bank is a non-profit-making body because that is what the Member States' governments decided, since its mission was not to obtain economic benefits but rather to contribute to the balanced development of the European Community through granting medium and long-term credits and guarantees for investment projects in the poorest regions, thus fostering economic and social cohesion.
But if we examine what the prime orientation for EIB funding is, where have the loans granted in 1999 ended up? We see that most have been used to cofinance investments in the four richest Member States (Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy), which received over 60% of the EIB resources supplementing the Community structural funds, while the so-called cohesion countries, that is, the poorest and most needy ones (Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland) got only 26%.
Even if I am told that this inequality occurs on account of the populations of these Member States, I believe we have to think about this aspect, since balanced development will not be achieved through proportionality but through solidarity.
This will become even more necessary as we proceed with enlargement to include new Member States.
Do not let it be said, either, that what is happening is that the less well-off countries do not submit projects to be funded; what is needed is a better policy of information, transparency, aid and monitoring.
To that end, it could well begin by facilitating communication with possible applicants, providing for the use of all the languages of the European Union, including regional and minority languages, so that everybody can have access to the European Investment Bank.
Mr President, Mr Lipietz has written an excellent report which highlights two of the European Investment Bank' s real weaknesses.
The first is that the bank has had a terrible information policy, and there has been poor supervision of the bank' s decisions and work.
The second is that the bank' s environmental work has, as I see it, been extremely poor.
There are numerous examples where the bank has supported projects within the EU and in the candidate countries which have actually been indefensible from an environmental point of view.
With regard to the area of environmental impact analysis, it is clear that the World Bank, for example, is better than the European Investment Bank at making analyses public before decisions are taken.
We have at least recently encountered a new attitude from the EIB.
There has been more talk about dialogue, openness, environmental considerations and change.
We hope this will lead to real reform of the bank' s work - which we would of course welcome - and to the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters being implemented in full at the bank.
I would like to say that we support this excellent report and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and the EIB for the very open dialogue we have been able to have over recent months.
Today' s debate shows that the work of the European Central Bank has, in the main, been assessed very positively, which, President Maystadt, I am sure you welcome.
The European Central Bank has an especially important role when it comes to improving European Community structures in less developed regions.
Two thirds of its disbursements go towards this.
But I also believe trans-European networks are of major importance, especially for transport, and they need to be set up along European lines.
We see that a common European economic area is emerging. But we also see that the traffic situation is very often still following the old limitations and priorities of past centuries.
I believe that a common European market, a domestic market and an optimal currency area must incorporate a corresponding infrastructure and transport infrastructure.
All the activities of the European Central Bank in this area are of special importance.
I also believe that the work of the European Central Bank in other areas is of great importance, especially where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned.
For SMEs, especially those which are innovative and assume risks, simply granting loans is often insufficient; venture capital also needs to be made available.
In recent years the EIB has developed its own initiatives which, in my opinion, are especially welcome.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first thank Parliament' s President and Bureau for suggesting that, for the first time, the President of the European Investment Bank should be invited to speak at a plenary session on the occasion of the discussion of the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the activities of the EIB.
I regard it as an honour, but also as a sign of Parliament' s desire to take an interest in the activities of all the European institutions, in order to ensure that the voice of the citizens it represents is heard more effectively.
May I also reiterate in Parliament what I have already had the opportunity to stress at committee level, namely how much I appreciate the constructive dialogue that has been established with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, at the instigation of its Chair, Mrs Randzio-Plath.
With regard to Mr Lipietz' s report, I found it both stimulating and useful, and I can tell you that work has already started on implementing a number of the recommendations made in the draft resolution.
I shall, if I may, deal with both these recommendations and the questions put by the honourable Members in the following order: first, the bank' s operational priorities, followed by evaluation methods and, finally, external monitoring and the policy of transparency.
To begin with, the bank' s operational priorities.
I should like to point out that the new Corporate Operational Plan, which covers the period 2001-2003, redefines our priorities along the lines proposed in recommendations 3 and 5.
We have, in fact, included among the five priorities adopted by our board of directors, and here I quote, "encouraging environmental protection and sustainable development, in particular implementation of the Kyoto Protocol" .
This approach in practice already existed, given that last year lending for projects contributing directly towards improvement of the environment amounted to EUR 6.4 billion within the European Union, an increase of 39% compared with the previous year, and EUR 740 million in the candidate countries.
In addition, we have reorganised our Projects Directorate in order to ensure that the environmental impact of the projects for which finance is sought from us is systematically evaluated.
With regard in particular to our contribution towards implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, a general policy note will be submitted to our board of directors in May.
Having said that, this emphasis on the environment must not, as Mrs Peijs very aptly put it, make us forget the other priorities, which I shall very rapidly refer to.
Regional development: we consider that at least two thirds of lending within the European Union must go towards projects located in assisted areas.
Support for the Lisbon strategy: we intend, over the next three years, to advance project finance totalling EUR 12 to 15 billion in the fields accorded priority by the Lisbon European Council and, of course, as Mrs van den Burg has suggested, we shall have to take account of the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit.
Preparing the candidate countries for accession: over the next three years we intend to earmark between EUR 3 and 4 billion a year to projects aimed at helping the candidate countries to satisfy the conditions for accession, especially with regard to transport infrastructure, the importance of which Mr von Wogau has rightly stressed.
Lastly, I would mention as the final priority support for the Community' s cooperation policy, notably in the context of the recent Cotonou Agreement.
I now turn to assessing the real impact of the projects financed by the EIB, as a number of speakers have rightly dwelt upon this aspect.
In particular, recommendation 4 calls upon the EIB to undertake an in-depth study of the real contribution made by projects to regional development.
First of all, I should like to point out that, since 1995, the EIB has had an independent unit for ex post evaluation of projects, a unit whose reports are transmitted directly to the board of directors, without any possibility of their being changed by the hierarchy or the Management Committee.
These reports are then made available to the public and Mr Lipietz' s report in fact refers to a number of these.
The initial reports were, of course, fairly critical.
Why?
Because we asked this newly created unit to concentrate first on those cases which we considered to be most problematic.
Today, we have reports covering a larger number of projects and the evaluation results are distinctly more encouraging.
Thus a recent report dealing with a number of projects in northern Portugal and southern Italy shows that the vast majority of these have had a positive, and in some cases very positive, impact on the development of the regions concerned.
However, the same report emphasises the importance of further refining the methodology, particularly in order to identify more diversified and more specific criteria for improving the selection, a priori, of the projects that are most promising for regional development.
That is why, in close cooperation with the staff of the Commission' s Directorate-General for Regional Policy, we are currently working on developing a battery of performance indicators for loans for regional projects.
I would add that similar work is under way on evaluating global loans, that is, the loans that we grant to intermediary banks for lending either to SMEs or to local authorities.
Here again we are endeavouring to improve the ways of verifying that these loans are indeed used for the benefit of SMEs and that the most favourable terms are passed on to the ultimate recipients of these loans.
With regard to external monitoring of the bank, I can only unreservedly endorse recommendation 10.
I should like to confirm before you that the agreement entered into in 1999 between the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the EIB concerning the bank' s activities based on Community resources is being implemented to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned and that, of course, the EIB will continue to meet its obligations vis-Ã -vis the Court of Auditors resulting from that agreement.
I should also like to confirm that we are currently negotiating a similar agreement with the Court of Auditors with regard to monitoring the European Investment Fund, which has become a subsidiary of the EIB.
I would add that we are amenable to any practicable form of banking supervision.
This is a matter that has been discussed by your committee.
We are completely open to any proposals in this connection.
In any case, in the short term perhaps the most practicable approach is no doubt to strengthen the Audit Committee by seeing to it that members are appointed who have experience and expertise in the field of banking supervision.
Finally, with regard to the policy of transparency, we are willing to sign up to the guidelines set out in recommendation 11.
However, we must emphasise that, unlike the institutions referred to in your rapporteur' s text, the majority of the EIB' s clients are private commercial companies and obviously do not want the confidentiality that is standard practice in commercial negotiations not to be observed in relations with the EIB.
But, subject to that reservation, we have decided to move towards greater transparency.
I am thus able to announce to you that we are going to publish on our website a list of all projects in the pipeline, before they are even submitted to the board of directors, except of course where the promoter has good reason to object on grounds of confidentiality.
With that sole proviso, all projects will be announced on our website.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Investment Bank is, as you know, unlike other banks.
It was established to serve the objectives of the European Union.
It is therefore only natural that it should be called upon to explain itself before the European Parliament.
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so today and am delighted that I shall be able to continue the dialogue in the future, as Mrs van den Burg has kindly suggested.
Thank you, Mr Maystadt, for the contribution that you and your bank make.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Parliament and Mr Lipietz on the analysis he has presented on the European Investment Bank annual report.
I share the idea mentioned by the President and included in the report that the European Investment Bank is an instrument of European Union policies, but we must not forget either that the EIB has the obligation to make optimal use of the resources at its disposal.
To a great extent the Commission shares the views contained in the report, but I should like to make a few comments on two or three subjects that I think are particularly relevant to the call for the Commission and the Council swiftly to extend the mechanism for subsidising interest rates on loans given by the bank, especially external loans as well as internal ones.
This is a difficult subject that the Court of Auditors has come out strongly against, expressing clear reservations as to its effectiveness.
From the Commission' s viewpoint, it is true that we must do everything we can to ensure that the instruments we have are effective in facilitating investments, but it is no less true that there are projects, such as in the environmental field or from the countries applying for accession, which, in view of the interest rate levels we are working with today, could be resolved more efficiently by means of cofinancing systems, for instance through some of the current programmes.
Such efficiency could be even greater at a later stage, when said countries are members of the European Union.
The report also calls on the bank to ensure that its risk-capital activities are adequate and to make the necessary effort to attract risk capital via the stock exchange, especially in those sectors with problems.
The President of the bank has already made some reference to the efforts made.
The Commission, for its part, has supported the bank' s ideas of arriving at a better distribution of functions between the former European Investment Fund and the bank.
We think the current model, in which the Fund has become the arm of the bank for carrying out these risk-capital investment projects, is a good one and the current availability of greater resources is without any doubt a clearly positive factor compared with the former situation.
Allow me to comment on the greater importance to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are going to be able to take advantage of this possibility of access to risk-capital, but they are also going to be the great beneficiaries in the bank' s Innovation 2000 Initiative, especially in its support for investment in information and the knowledge-based economy.
All this supports the Lisbon proposal, but it also supports this possible action on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises.
A subject I think especially worth highlighting is global loans, which are also put forward in terms relevant for small and medium-sized enterprises and without any doubt will enable us to solve two problems that some of you have mentioned.
First, sharing out resources more efficiently.
We must not forget that these global loans at the moment are practically one third of the bank' s new loans.
Secondly, the idea of the bank' s activities being more consistent with Community policies is also important.
I think all of this will end up benefiting the bank' s activities and the policies defined.
One last comment: on page 18 of the report the Commission is called upon to perform a monitoring role, especially in connection with risk-capital and also the control and management of interest rates.
On this subject in particular I can tell you that my colleagues responsible for these areas, especially as regards external assistance, are analysing the topic so that in accordance with the criteria and comments that I set out earlier we can reach the best possible solution to use the bank' s funds in the most efficient way.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Lisbon (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on:
the report (A5-0034/2001) by Mr Bullmann, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Spring 2001 European Council: The Lisbon process and the path to be followed [2000/2280(INI)],
the Commission report on progress since Lisbon and future measures, and
the report (A5-0020/2001) by Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the impact of liberalisation and the process of economic reform on the European Union's economic growth.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very important report for which I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr Bullmann.
I would like to make two points.
When we talk about the special things Europe is doing and why hopefully in the future we may be a model for the world, we must be able to support our facts with figures.
How do we measure this success?
We have very traditional instruments: GDP or the unemployment rate which, according to research carried out by the Munich-based institute, the IFO, has fallen from 8.1% to 7.6%.
We also have the external value of the euro. But there are many other indicators we have hitherto not taken into consideration.
That is why I would particularly like to express my support for paragraphs 24 to 29 of this report, which redefine quality of life and quality of employment.
That would help our debate a great deal.
What has also been lacking hitherto is introduced by Amendments No 13 and 17, namely the environmental aspect, which also seems to be a special concern of the Swedish Presidency. It is an area where there is still much to be done.
To Mr Friedrich, who spoke of the danger of knowing too much, I would say that we are rather in danger of knowing too little.
This particularly concerns Parliament, which brings me to my second point: access to information in the follow-up to the post-Lisbon debate.
It is undignified for preparatory documents on Summit meetings to be slipped surreptitiously into Parliament, and often not before they have first been made available to the press.
There is nothing unifying in this; it is simply divisive.
With the partitioning off that is being practised, especially when Parliament is involved, the Council is doing itself a disservice.
It is simply promoting the delegitimisation of holders of political office.
Why are we in Parliament no longer trusted?
Let the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, or the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, or the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in.
Give one of the chairmen of our committees, Christa Randzio-Plath for instance, the chance, give Parliament the chance, to work with you on equal terms. What are you afraid of?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the strategic goal of full employment established by the Lisbon Council has been achieved in some parts of the European Union while many others still have a long way to go.
This not only raises a problem of cohesion - since it is not just a matter of compensating the less favoured areas - but also the problem of how to manage European development in the future, so as to promote the spread of development, and hence of employment, from the most favoured to the least favoured zones.
In this regard, I call upon the Commission to combine its economic perspectives with identification of the territorial benefits to be had from the plan for European area development.
I urge the Commission and the Union to pursue this 'good' full employment we want for Europe - 'good' in the sense of being capable of respecting environmental and social obligations - applying the method used up to now to drive forward the formation of the single market, with enlargement regarded as a valid part of this approach.
Enlargement should not be seen just as a supplementary cost for the Union but as an opportunity to create wider market opportunities, where the method pursued so far can be developed, both by progressively liberalising the old markets - and I strongly welcome the invitation, which I believe we should extend to ourselves and to Parliament, to adopt new directives on procurement quickly, for example, and open up a huge market currently closed to European competition - and by preventing the new markets from creating a new monopoly situation as may happen in the case of telecommunications.
For this purpose - both to liberalise the old markets and to prevent monopoly situations being created in the new markets - information can be very important and a bold strategy, helping the citizens participate in the process, can certainly be useful here.
Mr President, one word on sustainable development and the Lisbon process. This was already addressed by some Members of the Green Group this morning.
What should be done in the Stockholm meeting is that the governments' presence there should give the Commission a mandate to take the results of the Gothenburg Summit and to prepare benchmarking and concrete targets for the 2002 spring meeting during the Spanish presidency.
Only if sustainable development becomes as important in benchmarking as economic and social values can we advance.
I will take the opportunity to address the liberalisation aspect where there has not been a lot of reflection hitherto in Europe.
We need a new merger control and a new competition policy.
We have abolished monopolies, but we will have the same operators appearing as oligopolies in Europe if we are not prepared to have a different merger control and competition policy.
We need the biodiversity of a lot of small and medium-sized actors and not a monoculture of eight or ten major electricity companies which will employ blackmail on policy-makers as they did before in the monopolistic structures.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a careful assessment of the follow-up to what has become known as the Lisbon Strategy clearly shows that that Summit, which sought to present itself as the defender of employment, was, in fact, a powerful boost to speeding up the process of liberalising fundamental sectors of the economy.
In its report, the Commission now highlights what it considers to be 'good results' achieved with regard to the liberalisation of the telecommunications networks, the creation of a legislative framework for electronic commerce and the definition of the European Company Statute. At the same time, the Commission regrets what it considers to be delays in the regulation of public contracts and the liberalisation of the markets in gas, electricity, transport and postal services.
In other words, the Commission is insisting on the need to move ahead even more rapidly with the total liberalisation of the most varied sectors, including public services, and on more rapid progress in the capitals market, including the regulation of financial services. The Commission' s aim is to boost pension funds and other types of funds, but this will lead to greater attacks on social security and other essential public services, specifically in the areas of health, education and communications.
Meanwhile, in the social sphere, despite the statements of intent, fundamental decisions on protecting workers' rights are being delayed, as happened here only yesterday when we discussed industrial restructuring.
At the same time, statements are being made once again about the need to create a more flexible labour market, which is more mobile and able to adapt. I understand this to mean more precarious employment, with fewer workers' rights, although it is acknowledged that unemployment is still too high and that poverty and social exclusion are unacceptable at the beginning of the new millennium.
These policies therefore need to be amended, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. What is required is not to touch them up to make them look better in one way or another but to make far-reaching change to the policy in this field.
Mr President, I can only assume that the Presidency which claimed to prioritise employment chooses to direct its attention to other matters rather than take part in our important debate on issues to be taken up at the European Council in Stockholm, but I am all the more pleased to see that the Commission is represented here today.
The presidency said they could not be here before 4 p.m. because - believe it or not - they are discussing with the contact group the Statute for Members which is understandable in the circumstances and the amount of time they have in Strasbourg.
So they are not here but they will be joining us as soon as possible.
Mr President, may I then just add that I am extremely happy that I raised it, as this gave you the opportunity to provide a good excuse for the Swedish Presidency.
I believe it is a mistake for us to draw up long, extensive and contradictory documents such as the llmann report, which risk not being taken seriously.
I also believe it to be a mistake to allow issues of work, growth and competitiveness to be reduced to statistical number crunching.
It is clear that we need indicators in order to make assessments and comparisons, but to use them to excess in this way just makes one think 'Gosplan' .
Honourable Members, absent Representative of the Council and Commissioners, one does not need to be a politician to see the way powerlessness is spreading and divisions are widening in society.
We have major groups of poor, working people and we have a terrible proportion of long-term unemployed, benefit-dependent and marginalised individuals and families in Europe.
At the same time the EU still has difficulty matching the US with regard to job creation, research and development and population growth.
I believe the hunt for new indicators and more figures on employment simply delays the necessary renewal and liberalisation of European markets.
The Lisbon process requires a move from words to action.
One of 10 years will soon have passed.
Therefore, I am asking today for concrete targets from the presidency ahead of the European Council in Stockholm.
It is no longer a matter of directions and timetables such as we heard about this morning.
What decisions will you produce in the next six months to achieve increased competitiveness in Europe?
I believe that the Swedes have an excellent opportunity to show some leadership.
Rather sceptical though it has been, the Social Democratic government has, for all that, continued with the successful liberalisation programme set out by the right of centre government at the beginning of the 1990s.
Thanks to a forward-looking policy which included opening up markets, Swedish industry in both the old and the new economies shows significant success.
With this in mind, the presidency could establish a modern agenda to enable the EU to live up to its proud aims.
Both the Council and the Commission have today addressed demographic development in the EU.
In this regard, I wonder when the Commission will be taking initiatives to stimulate increased labour immigration to EU Member States.
Yesterday, I listened to State Secretary EkstrÃ¶m, who is responsible for the European Council in Stockholm.
She introduced important elements into the discussion on growth, including the significance of trade.
This is excellent, as it is vital for both growth and solidarity.
Therefore, I wonder if the Commission and the Council can report on how work on increased trade and reduced tariffs can progress under the Swedish Presidency.
In this context, it would be interesting to hear whether the Council is still of the opinion that the question of the Tobin Tax is a national debate which has no place in this Parliament.
In its communication, the Commission takes up the need for simplification of regulations in the EU.
Bearing in mind the vote we had today on the awful Miller report and the old Bus and Coach Directive, I hope this was the last time we need concern ourselves with such issues.
It is fine to write that simplification of regulations is desired, but the Commission must also show that it is able to act on this.
Finally, I would like to say that economic growth is naturally linked to employment and social security.
A good economy is a prerequisite for welfare.
However it is not politicians and more statistics which create social security, but it is only with the help of a good economy and successful companies that the EU can create cohesion and social security in a new age.
Mr President, we must now rethink the future cohesion policy in view of the challenges arising from enlargement to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Enlargement will mean a large increase in population and geographical area, but also a dangerous increase in regional disparities.
Statistics are misleading, and a region that now has a per capita income of 70% of the Community average will not have improved its situation when after enlargement this percentage rises by 10 or 15 points.
Income is one element defining regional development, but it must not be the only one.
For the new programming period we must have new indicators that reflect the growing complexity of our societies and our regions' economies: the unemployment rate, especially one referring to young women and the long-term unemployed; a region' s dependence on sectors in crisis, such as steel-making or fisheries; a low level of worker qualification; a lack of occupational training or education; limited economic diversification; the demographic situation; poor penetration of new technologies; or poor integration of women in society in the least developed regions, which is a reason for their backwardness.
Cohesion must not be restricted to the Structural Funds.
All Union policies have to respond to this aim, helping improve competitiveness in the most backward regions and helping create more jobs and more skilled ones.
The Union will have to act in those areas where a stimulus that does not entail a large outlay is needed.
A stimulus that leads to regeneration and an increase in competitiveness and productivity.
The Commission should have a greater capacity to intervene and an overall view, and Community initiatives should be better-funded, in my opinion, in the next period.
Similarly, again in my own opinion, we should rethink how many of them there should be.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak on the subject of items 9 to 12 inclusive of the report by our fellow Member, Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, in order to specify our approach to the concept of universal service.
Universal service must be defined in relation to the new technological environment.
Current developments, particularly in information and communication technology, tending towards digital technology, have an irrevocable catalysing force.
It is up to the authorities to meet the challenge by enabling every citizen, whatever their situation, to benefit on a fair basis according to their needs from an identical quality of service.
That is where the advantage of a universal service lies.
In actual fact, technological developments make it possible to view universal service in an offensive and proactive manner rather than in a defensive backward-looking fashion, as a limited set of often mediocre public services, which people carefully avoid using, unless really driven to it.
Thus, the prospects offered in the medium term by the generalised use within Europe of new 'smart card' type identity papers lead to a redefinition and readjustment of universal service, polarised on two vectors of change: a service level agreement and a rich content.
We should like to see the real possibility of developing in this direction so that this universal service may contribute to balanced realisation of what was set as a strategic objective at the extraordinary European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000.
Mr President, on the report on the impact of liberalisation and the economic reform process our opinion can only be highly critical.
It is not because we do not share general ideas on the broad economic policy guidelines but because here, under the pretext of liberalisation, it is trying to lead us along paths which, instead of increasing the well-being of our societies, will only deepen the social inequalities in our supposedly more advanced societies.
In the report under discussion there are enough generic references to the United States model and phrases that have become the canon of right-wing economics that they cannot be accepted uncritically by those of us who try to keep a balance between broad economic objectives and building fairer societies.
This progressive attitude cannot be reconciled with statements made in this report.
Not only the ones I have just mentioned, but also others such as the statement on labour market reform, where it says, and I quote: "it is high time for labour market reforms that promote mobility and make it worthwhile for the unemployed to take up job offers" .
This - and I say this with all due respect for Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm - is treating the unemployed as if they were so many parasites.
The key to achieving a balance between economic objectives, competitiveness and cohesion and social justice is not in this supposed liberalisation but in designing and putting into practice policies that make our economic systems more effective, extracting from other economies - copying if necessary - things that can enable us to move forward in both directions.
We do not want models like that of the United States, which will lead us to greater imbalances and social injustices or resounding disasters, such as the liberalisation of the electricity sector in California.
While you are at it, why not copy the American Treasury' s policies and abandon the European Central Bank performance model, which has caused us so much harm in the past?
The rapporteur mentioned in passing this morning that there were European countries with models of interest.
Of course there are.
But why is this not highlighted?
Because it is of no interest, or rather, it is of no interest to those who speak of liberalisation at all costs without thinking about the consequences.
Mr President, I would like to make three points with regard to the Stockholm Summit.
First of all, it is not justified, in my opinion, to hold this discussion here at Parliament' s instigation whilst there was no document from the Commission available at the time to back it up.
If a summit on socio-economic problems is arranged in Stockholm and if this is done year after year, as was decided in Lisbon, then I expect each time - and I hope that the Swedish Presidency will take a decision in this respect - to see a framework document from the Commission which can be debated beforehand in Parliament.
We have now done just that, but on our own initiative.
Accordingly, the report that is before us is calling for an interinstitutional agreement to that effect.
My second point concerns social protection.
I would like to echo the view of a number of our fellow MEPs, namely that the topic of social protection is new.
It has taken ten years finally to grant the topic political status.
This has now been done.
But this is, of course, a very apprehensive start.
If we begin by prescribing indicators, then this is a good start, but it cannot, of course, be the final step.
The final step should be a process similar to that which we have followed for employment.
Indeed, we should end up drafting guidelines.
I hope that Stockholm too will take matters one step further.
My final point pertains to employment.
It is true that the number of unemployed across Europe is still high, and I am always surprised when it is suggested that we should most definitely encourage the influx of immigrants.
Some say that they should fill the jobs which require the highest qualifications, whilst others believe they should fill those functions which require the lowest qualifications.
First and foremost, our own unemployed should be trained, and the lowest qualified functions should be reassessed in such a way as to ensure that our own people at least accept this work in the first place.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I support the political line and all the proposals in the Bullmann and GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm reports. They highlight some of the qualitative goals which ought to be turned into binding decisions at the Spring European Council.
Amongst these I would like to stress the importance of certain initiatives relating to sectors central to the Lisbon and Feira Council guidelines, but where progress is still much too slow, as President Prodi recognised in his speech yesterday.
The most important is coordination of research and development policies.
While the European Commission has set up some highly significant European initiatives and projects in this area, there is still a lack of effective coordination of national programmes and public and private projects developed by each country.
This leads to a situation where meagre national financial resources are often spent on duplication or wasted investment, and where there is a failure to adopt certain shared priorities.
I would like to ask the Commission whether or not it intends to give effective impetus to the implementation of the open method of coordination, adopted by the Lisbon Council.
It can work if the Commission uses its knowledge of existing national programmes and projects to become the promoter and monitor of open methods of cooperation between certain Member States on specific priorities, thus testing national governments' willingness to cooperate and converge to build a European Research Area.
Secondly, the introduction in the Union - also based on some experiments in open coordination - of a system of lifelong learning and training.
We are right to call, in Mr Bullmann' s report too, for a combination of flexibility, mobility and security in employment policy, to prevent the emergence of insecurity and marginalisation of both young people and women and older workers as well.
Now, I do not know of any kind of security that can operate in a labour market characterised by flexibility and mobility, apart from the security that comes from employability, a process of lifelong learning and training guarantees.
Setting up a system like that to benefit as many working men and women as possible will overcome the resistance developing in various sectors, because the temporary nature of jobs - and that is a very real factor in our labour market - deters companies from investing in human resources.
All this means mobilising major resources and great individual determination, which can only happen if effective cooperation is established between the European Union and the national States, on the one hand, and between businesses and workers, on the other.
That is also a way to create the necessary conditions for the Spring Council to be a significant event ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I welcome the Swedish Presidency' s arrival.
I hope that they have taken positive steps with regard to the Statute for Members, as we are on the edge of our seats.
I would first of all like to congratulate Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm on his sterling report.
He has succeeded in listing our ambitions one by one in a readily understood manner.
It is our wish to become the world' s most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy, according to our leaders in Lisbon.
Upon which they went home, and everything carried on as before.
We are still having to put up with stifling bureaucracy.
Attempts to liberalise and introduce simpler rules for small and medium-sized businesses never come to anything on account of short-sighted national interests.
I sometimes dream about this, but I always wake up screaming.
In order to streamline legislation, we should not only scrutinise our activities here, but also examine how a directive emerges from the national transposition processes.
A simple and clear-cut customs act suddenly appears to be backed by legislation which fills three thick volumes.
Moreover, I am of the opinion that the fiche d'impact should be given the kiss of life.
It should not amount to pure guesswork but to an actual business test.
A test of how a certain piece of legislation will be received in industry.
The problem Europe has - and I trust I can be so outspoken after eleven years in this Parliament - is that I am always duly impressed with the rhetoric, but never by the action that follows.
I would like to quote the liberalisation of the postal services as a case in point.
Not only Parliament, but also the Council, which had explicitly welcomed the liberalisation in Lisbon with open arms, have taken a step back rather than forward.
If we compare this situation in Europe with that in the United States, we are still in complete deadlock in certain areas.
It is not yet the case - not by a long chalk - that Europe can lead the world economy now that US leadership has temporarily lapsed.
Europe' s core countries, France, Germany and Italy, have enjoyed the benefits of the cheap euro to the full, and have not made any structural changes to their labour markets and their economies.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, economic policy in Europe has chalked up a huge success and a huge failure.
Its success is, of course, the single currency; its failure is that we have still been unable to mop up unemployment and achieve full employment.
What we wonder is why, despite our success with the one, we cannot achieve the same degree of success with the other.
In this sense, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Bullmann, both on the professionalism of his work and on his enthusiasm for the resolutions of the European Council in Lisbon, which try to build a bridge from our success in the monetary sector towards similar success in the real sector, the real economy.
If you define Europe not by its political borders but by its economic borders; in other words, if you include eastern Europe, Russia and North Africa, then you will see that we have the largest market in the world, with the highest per capita income and the largest concentration of educated workers.
Not even in Latin America or Asia or the whole of America do these three factors exist side by side.
On this basis, we can work miracles, and from this point of view, the Lisbon objectives are commensurate with our abilities.
The problem is: are our policies for implementing the objectives equally commensurate?
I have the impression that, when it comes to implementation, we are overly impressed by the huge success of the process of nominal convergence.
However, I am not convinced that we are making proper use of our experience in the real economy.
Mutual monitoring, the famous peer pressure which we now want to transfer to the real economy, was not the only factor.
We must not forget the other factors, i.e. the simple, purely quantitatively defined objective of reducing inflation.
We must not forget that, in the case of the euro, there was a clear time limit: either you boarded the train, or the train left without you.
We must not forget that the aim of squeezing inflation took absolute priority and, in my personal estimate, even worked to the detriment of employment.
If we really want to transfer this method to the real economy, we should apply the wisdom of one quantitative target and one simple tool.
You do not need a great deal of wisdom in order to determine what they are.
The target is full employment and the method is to increase the quantity and quality of investments.
This combination has the additional advantage of indirectly resolving - en passant, as they say in chess - the second major objective of technological progress.
We should have had the courage to give these targets the same absolute priority as we gave legal stability.
I am not sure if we have the courage to do so now.
We have, of course, made some progress by quantifying the indicators, but typically here too, there are no detailed, analytical indicators; the Commission has not proposed analytical indicators, Commissioner, on investments, public, private, infrastructure, on so many things we should like to promote.
And the rapporteur's ambitious efforts notwithstanding, I should like to point out that increasing the number of quantitative indicators does not lead us into dead-end street, because we may find ourselves in a position where, to quote the Bible, someone one day says to the Commission: Ãartha, Ãartha, thou art careful, and troubled about many thingsÂ·
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak today to express a concern which we also share about what we can achieve as a result of the Lisbon decisions.
In particular, with a view to the forthcoming Stockholm employment summit, I think we may have to develop some methods which might improve the evaluation of the goals gradually achieved, and emphasise the need to intervene forcefully and rapidly when those objectives are not achieved.
As many honourable Members have stated, we set ourselves an extremely important goal at Lisbon: achieving a competitive and dynamic Europe and, above all, a knowledge-based European society.
We also decided to compare our successes and, if you like, our shortcomings, with another great economy, the economy of the United States.
At present, United States statistics represent a target for us to achieve, in terms of both employment and, to some extent, development and economic growth, taking into account, of course, our totally different society and community, something that should not be forgotten.
I too believe that the goals of full employment, respect for a social market economy and rapid progress towards liberalisation in many sectors are objectives we can and must set ourselves.
However, I also think account needs to be taken of two things in Europe: the first is that the situations are completely different, and we are trying to solve problems that have already been solved there, and comparing different situations by applying the same rules does not seem to be ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Commission President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the merits of benchmarking in our economic deliberations, yet I would urge Mrs Peijs, Mrs Carlsson and all those that continually cite the American model as an example to ask the people of California what they think of the virtues of liberalisation and the disruption of a public service as vital as the electricity supply in a modern twenty-first century economy.
I consider the reports before us today to be good ones insofar as they seek to consolidate growth in Europe.
They are based on the idea that such growth must be supported by structural reform.
We share this point of view, on condition that such structural reform is appropriate to one objective which is also our chief objective, as our committee chair, Mrs Randzio-Plath, stated: social reform must also lead to greater social integration.
No economic policy without this objective is possible.
We hope that Stockholm, too, will provide an opportunity to reaffirm that the strategy of full employment is now perhaps one that is feasible in Europe.
From this point of view, we find that Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm' s report occasionally expresses a rather liberal approach.
Liberalisation is not tolerable unless it is progressive, unless it goes hand in hand with a regulatory process.
Nor can it be carried out safely without supporting the European Union' s objectives in terms of social and territorial cohesion.
From this point of view, we should like to see considerable progress in drawing up a framework directive on general interest services.
We would urge those that advocate excessive liberalisation and a fast track timetable for liberalising the electricity and gas sector to be very careful with regard to the postal and rail sectors, for these form the basis of social and territorial cohesion in our countries.
Mr President, I am very pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council is once again in this Chamber.
But, with all due respect to you, Mr President-in-Office, in view of the fact that Sweden constantly promotes equal opportunities, I would have liked Secretary of State EkstrÃ¶m to be here.
Yesterday she was at the joint meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
On the Bullmann report: The Lisbon Council resolved to turn the EU into the world' s most competitive area by the year 2010.
Was that just an idle boast?
Yet, with four million new jobs in four years, mostly highly qualified and ICT jobs, the signs are good.
A new dynamic with more flexible labour markets has emerged, but not everybody is keeping pace.
There are big difference between the regions, with high levels of employment and room for manoeuvre for enterprises in some regions but, in others, increasing unemployment causing people to leave their homes on economic grounds.
But we want economic and social cohesion in the Community and active labour market policies, which are reflected in the four pillars of the Luxembourg process.
The priority is clear: the promotion of innovative SMEs.
We have what it takes to shape the future and create jobs, but we need to dismantle bureaucratic, legal and tax obstacles and facilitate access to risk capital.
By implementing the directives in the NAPS, the employment rate within the EU can be raised to 70%.
Quantum leaps need to be made in education and training.
Priority should be given to the upward revaluation of vocational training, the implementation of a concept of life-long learning, better framework conditions for cross-border activities, the promotion of mobility through joint training programmes for young people and pan-European recognition of qualifications.
The Hughes procedure brought together the findings of the Bullmann report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Cocilovo report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Although the details may be assessed somewhat differently, this final report merits our support.
Mr President, the principles in the Bullmann report are linked to the basic ideas from Lisbon, which are to be made more concrete at the European Council in Stockholm in the spring.
These principles for Europe' s aim to be a word leader in terms of economic development and growth are necessary in parallel with the development of an ambitious social dimension; this is the whole point.
This balance is crucial not only to our success in implementing our strategies but also to the EU achieving increased public support and understanding, especially prior to expansion.
On the one hand we have right-wing liberals maintaining that the EU is only necessary for deregulating and opening the markets, creating free trade, etc, while the battle against unemployment and the development of social welfare are exclusively national issues.
This implies that some would like to be able to undermine the influence of labour law and the employee and tear up welfare policy, etc without the EU' s interfering.
On the other hand, certain GUE politicians are now entering this current debate and attacking the Bullmann report for focusing too much on deregulation and competition.
I am therefore pleased that we have still established widespread agreement, excluding the outer fringes to the right and to the left, among those who realise that development of a social dimension is actually a crucial element of a successful economic policy.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the EU should take over the Member States' powers to legislate, although the open coordination method naturally does not exclude legislating.
The most important thing is that we develop common aims.
These must address both deregulation and liberalisation to a certain extent, as well as common aims for dealing with the problems of unemployment and social exclusion.
Few have taken up this aspect.
But do not forget how vital this is to expansion, as the content of the Bullmann report will then be even more crucial.
The new Member States have an extra need for parallel development within the areas of growth, welfare, social rights and influence for ordinary citizens and employees.
Mr President, at the Lisbon Summit full employment was defined as the overriding objective of EU policy.
I approve Mr Bullmann' s report, which was based on the employment guidelines first formulated in 1997 at the Employment Conference in Luxembourg.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
He is correct when he says that, in the future, more qualitative indicators need to be established which, for instance, take account of the variety of jobs and the minimum consultation rights of workers in their organisation, or environmentally-friendly technologies.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to call for this method of combating youth unemployment.
The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Cocilovo, expressed this excellently.
Economic realism is necessary in all the targets we set ourselves within the framework of employment policy.
As the European People' s Party, we will not be pursuing any pipe dreams.
The transformation of our society into a service and knowledge-based society is making great strides forward.
That is why all our demands are targeted at life-long learning and at restructuring the education systems along the right lines.
We often raise our employment plans in official addresses; they feature in many papers, in European directives, in national action plans, where they are wonderfully expressed.
But paper is patient.
What matters now is that these plans are put into practice.
As its contribution to achieving the goal of implementing the proposals that have been made, the European People' s Party will assess the Spring Summit.
We do not need a literature Summit.
I am convinced that Stockholm will not be a literature Summit, as action, not proclamations, is now called for!
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteurs and the many speakers for their contributions to the debate.
I shall try to make a few comments.
The debate has been full of ideas and very varied, and a number of aspects have been aired.
First, I should stress a point that I think is fundamental, which is that Lisbon has not, of course, changed its goals, i.e., full employment and the modernisation of our society, not forgetting respect for our social system and strong cohesion.
When we analyse the employment figures, it is quite clear what results have been achieved.
We can mention public investment, as some of you have done.
But for us the important thing is the global strategy.
When we analyse the global strategy - and this is the content of the synthesis report - the emphasis is on the need to make progress in the various areas simultaneously in order to achieve the goals we set in Lisbon.
For instance, the broad economic policy guidelines for 2000 are already making substantial changes to their historical structure in order to include in the various policies those measures arising out of the Lisbon strategy.
Clearly, Lisbon is based on the idea, which all or most of you have highlighted, of a society with a dynamic and cohesive economy as I have just mentioned.
This means advances in innovation, education, training, liberalisation, and also adequate regulation, and of course the whole system of social protection.
Neither these instruments nor these policies can exist by themselves; they are all linked together.
It is not a matter of balance between the various policies: it is more a synergy between different policies, which in the end should enable us to achieve the desired results.
If we analyse the report, it is clearly demonstrated that we have advanced since then.
I do not think we should be as negative as some of you have been, saying, "Nothing has been done."
I think a lot has been done, in terms of liberalisation or in terms of economic results.
It is also true that not many other things have been done, and therefore in our report we define certain priorities that we consider fundamental for the immediate future.
There is one point I think is of interest, which was raised throughout the debate, especially in the first part this morning.
It is the role of indicators with regard to the goals we are seeking. It is true that indicators should not be seen as some kind of inventory, of position-taking on specific policies.
It is true that indicators are not goals in themselves, but are tools that should enable us to make progress and interpret reality more globally and accurately.
Contrary to what some of you have said, it is important to have indicators what in themselves tell us the reality of our situation.
There is no doubt at all that comparison with other models is useful.
What doubt is there that comparing certain rates of technological penetration in the European Union and the United States, for instance, will give us a measure of where we are with regard to the most advanced country in these matters?
Making a partial comparison - only on certain things and not on the whole model - between the two economies may give rise to interpretations that are not always correct.
In any case, when we are talking of comparative indicators there is always a difficulty, which is that we often do not have sufficiently homogeneous indicators for the realities we are comparing to be revealed through these figures.
Throughout the morning you also debated whether the number of indicators was excessive.
It is true that cutting the number of indicators would make the report more visible; in terms of public opinion it would make it possible to send out clearer and more direct messages.
But it is also true that a smaller number of indicators would make it much more difficult to interpret the reality we are trying to understand.
I think that having 28 indicators classified under the four basic Lisbon goals is the least number required to provide a good understanding of where we are at this moment.
As I said earlier, however, we designed the indicators as a working tool.
This does not necessarily have to be a permanent tool, since real life and a better understanding of it will make us revise the indicators continuously, possibly changing some of them during this process which we began in Lisbon.
A subject I think is of interest, which some of you have raised, is to what extent we can achieve greater participation by Parliament in all this debate through an institutional agreement.
I believe that right now we already have enough instruments, at least for relations between the Commission and Parliament, to be able to make progress in our joint work.
In any case, the institutional agreement should also include the Council.
I should like to stress one point: participation by both Parliament and public opinion in the debate on Europe is always open.
The Commission has taken the initiative, for instance, with the economic interviews held once a year, the basic aim of which is to analyse the European economic situation specifically in this global world and in comparison with the context in those countries that serve as a reference for our situation.
This subject is always open to Parliament, and naturally we hope you will cooperate this year as you have in the past.
Another point I also find of interest is the scope of the synthesis report.
I have seen at least two references that seem to be of interest: Why do we not speak of sustainable development?
What is happening with the enlargement of the European Union?
Would it not be appropriate to mention both subjects?
For its part, sustainable development will be the goal in Gothenburg; for that reason there is only one clear reference to it in the current report, when it indicates that the economic and social dimensions of Lisbon will have to be completed by integrating the environmental dimension, which will contribute to a European Union strategy for sustainable development.
This, then, will be an open possibility after Gothenburg and will certainly figure in future debates.
A different problem is that of enlargement, which is also clearly referred to: the European Union economy must not only take this essential element into account, but our whole design must also be based on the consideration that the Union will enlarge in a relatively short time.
The European Union must take this element as a point of reference, but the applicant countries should also involve themselves in the Lisbon strategy by adopting its objectives as far as possible.
This text, practically in the same words I have just used, is included in our synthesis report.
In speaking of Lisbon we are also speaking of the new method of coordination, the method of open coordination.
It is true that this is an interesting method, which makes it possible to identify good practices and gradually develop a joint focus on topics of interest; the method, however, should not replace existing Community instruments of a regulatory or quasi-regulatory nature, or the guidelines that already exist in areas such as economic policy or employment.
One point I should like to highlight is that of structural reforms.
We certainly included some specific references to structural reforms.
We consider that these have a highly diverse content, and among them is the concept of liberalising our economies.
This should certainly make us more competitive and will benefit users and make it possible to improve the quality of services of general interest.
But it is clear that a liberalisation process will only be efficient and not cause problems if it is carried out in a legal framework with adequate control as regards regulation.
We must not think of liberalisation processes that do not fit into a global framework.
This regulatory process will doubtless be a fundamental topic in forthcoming debates, and the references to public interest services that have been made this afternoon come into this framework
Another point I found interesting in today' s debate is the extent to which an excess of bureaucratic posts is having a negative impact on the European development process.
I shall just say that this is a point which the Commission is concerned about; at times we have even worked on an indicator for bureaucratic posts.
It is obviously a difficult subject and it is being piloted by Eurostat, where a working party intends to define elements of precisely this nature which will provide us with more detail as to whether the concerns of a part of our society about the excess of bureaucratic posts reflects the reality of the situation or not.
Coming to the end of my comments now, I must say that at the moment, it may be worth stressing that the synthesis report process is a global process that requires coherence between macroeconomic stability, a subject we consider fundamental, employment, reforms and social cohesion.
Within this concept of social cohesion, we must take a broad approach and keep a broad outlook; it must not confine itself exclusively to individual topics but must also address regional topics, as some of you have proposed.
It is easy to highlight the progress that has been made in general terms, but it is rather more complex to point out how these advances in each of our countries, or in each of our regions, can be compared with the others.
In any case, and I think this point is fundamental, the reforms we are putting into motion will make sense insofar as we are able to increase economic productivity and efficiency.
Introducing elements of the new economy in the European Union will be the key to our future development.
Growth yes, growth with social cohesion, growth that will enable us to face the future in terms of technological challenge; in the end, these are the Lisbon goals and these are the goals we have tried to include in our report.
Many thanks for your contributions and your participation in this debate.
We shall try to take into consideration all those elements that have arisen today, which will certainly be useful for our debate in Stockholm.
Free movement of persons
The next item is the joint debate on the following:
the oral question (B5-0005/2001) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to the Council on Regulation No 1408/71/EEC on the free movement of persons - legal basis;
the report (A5-0026/2001) by Mrs Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 [COM(2000) 186 - C5-0217/2000 - 2000/0070(COD)].
Mr President, when the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs decided to present this question to the Council, it wished to focus on two specific and interrelated points: firstly the free movement of third-country nationals following the decision of the Tampere European Council and secondly, the expected legal base for this.
At the time, our question was also, of course, related to the preparations for the Nice Summit, since we hoped that decisions in favour of social policy and freedom of movement would be taken.
Since then, particularly in the lead-up to that European Council, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has had occasion to look into the issue of freedom of movement in more general terms.
This more general consideration has proved useful in indicating to us that, before extending freedom of movement to third-country nationals, we must, of course, ensure that it operates smoothly for European Union citizens.
We were concerned to note, however, that Regulation 1408/71 was becoming less and less appropriate, and that every month saw further postponement of moves to modernise and simplify it.
This is a serious situation, for freedom of movement is one of the truly fundamental principles of the European Union.
This is what enables EU citizens to move, reside and work without obstruction.
That is why Regulation 1408/71 - which was originally designed to coordinate national social security systems - is one of the keystones in Citizens' Europe, and any obstacle or delay to its being modernised is a serious matter.
Permit me, Mr President, to take these three aspects in turn.
Firstly, let me hark back to the wording of our question.
Firstly, what do we have to say regarding the extension of Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals?
We are forced to note that the action taken by the Council does not always, or rather does not yet - which is not quite the same thing, reflect the expressed political will of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 to create within the Union, I quote, an "area of freedom, security and justice" in which "the legal status of third-country nationals should be approximated to that of Member States' nationals."
Indeed, I would remind you that Parliament had already decided the same thing in October 1998, when the Commission proposal under review at that time was adopted, without amendments, by Parliament.
In other words, the Commission had taken the initiative, Parliament had supported the proposal in a clear vote and the European Council at the highest level, in Tampere one year later, gave legitimacy to this policy direction. Yet, in 2001, the Council has still not adopted a common position to enable us to continue the procedure.
What is the reason for this intolerable delay and this denial of political will by the Heads of State and Government even though, for once, there is perfect agreement between the three institutions, when this is not always the case?
Apparently this is due to the question of the legal base of this text, which sets the Council against the position adopted by the European Council and the Commission.
But if you will permit me to express this legal dispute in readily accessible terms, what is the Council after in opposing this legal base?
It is seeking to take the European Parliament out of the codecision procedure (you will tell us that it could do this).
That is what is at issue.
So, do not shake your head!
You are rejecting our right to take part in codecision.
This business does not affect just the role of the European Parliament; it is of direct political interest to the citizens of Europe.
The extension of Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals is such a sensitive issue that the citizens of the European Union ought to be fully involved in the form of the European Parliament, which represents them.
That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs cannot accept the reference to other legal bases other than those given in the Commission proposal, and would like to point out that Regulation 1408/71 cannot be amended except through the codecision procedure.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what we are challenging in the Council proceedings is one and the same issue, whether it concerns European Community citizens or third-country nationals.
In both cases, the slow progress of work in the Council is obstructing the development of free movement.
The Council cannot shirk its responsibilities; it must apply the decisions of the European Council and apply them transparently with regard to public opinion and in proper compliance with democratic rules while respecting the role of the European Parliament.
Failing to go down this route, Mr President, would doubtless impel the Members of the European Parliament to respond firmly - and with public support, we have no doubt - and to take action to oppose these obstacles to free movement.
I would add that my protest is not, of course, directed at the Swedish Presidency as such but at the Council.
Indeed I believe that the Swedish Presidency, on the basis of its traditions, may make a great contribution towards solving this problem.
Finally, I would like to conclude on another matter relating to the imminent future of the European Union, enlargement.
The Committee on Employment deems it essential for the countries involved in the next wave of enlargement to be informed of the various outstanding proposals regarding reform of the relevant article in Regulation 1408/71.
The issue of freedom of movement is, as we are well aware, one of the sensitive aspects of the accession negotiations.
What are the Council' s plans in this area?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rocard' s question is very important.
The presidency therefore welcomes this opportunity to debate it and will of course be listening very carefully to the analyses of this issue by all participating Members.
As Mr Rocard points out in the question, the conclusions from the European Council in Tampere addressed equal treatment of third-country nationals who are legally resident in the EU or in the EEA, for example by according them rights and responsibilities similar to those of EU citizens.
It is therefore necessary to adapt the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 with regard to harmonisation of social security systems.
The rules for harmonisation contained in this regulation are a prerequisite for the free movement of persons.
If third-country nationals are covered, they will also receive the opportunity of guarantees for 'acquired rights' .
This is in contrast to the current situation in which harmonisation is only regulated through bilateral agreements, to the extent that such exist.
In 1998, before the European Council in Tampere, the Council received a proposal from the Commission aimed at expanding Regulation No 1408/71 to cover third-country nationals.
This proposal was addressed by the Council in November 1999.
However, the Council has not yet been able to reach a decision on the proposal, as there is unfortunately no agreement on the appropriateness of the proposal and its legal foundation.
In parallel with this, the Council is currently considering the Commission' s proposal on simplifying Regulation 1408/71.
This proposal also advocates the regulation being expanded to cover third-country nationals.
The Council is currently giving the proposal its first reading.
We are well aware of the criticism of the Council for the fact that this matter has taken so long.
However, one should remember that we are addressing a technically very complicated subject.
The technical review currently underway will help us to establish difficulties which may arise from an expansion of the scope of Regulation No 1408/71.
The political negotiations necessary to complete the reforms will, without doubt, benefit from this detailed technical review.
With regard to Mr Rocard' s third question on consultation with candidate countries, there is no formal consultation either with the candidate countries or with the EEA countries.
Mr President, I must say that I am slightly disturbed by the lack of response on one or two of the issues there, but I will come to those in one moment.
My report deals with this regulation and, as has been said, it concerns a key mechanism in the implementation of the European Union's goal of free movement of people in that it coordinates social security systems.
It certainly does not seek to harmonise them.
There are three aspects to today's debate.
We have heard already about third-country nationals and the legal base which should be applied to include them in the scope of the regulation; the comparative lack of progress in including accession countries in the coordination process; and the update of the regulation in my report to bring it into line with the changes made in the social security systems of certain Member States.
I will say more on that, but touch on the other two issues as well.
As has been stressed, a crucial factor underlining all these elements is the need to make rapid and positive progress on the Commission's proposal for a simplification and modernisation of the whole of Regulation 1408/71.
It is essential for the Council to understand that in Parliament we have consensus and are determined on that point, whatever the differences that might appear elsewhere about the right strategy.
We have been looking to the Council for a positive response about the speed of that overall reform.
Paragraph 4 of the resolution tabled by four political groups makes it clear that Parliament is no longer prepared to continue with the piecemeal amendments and technical updates - of which my report is the latest and, we believe the last example.
We must now have overall integrated changes necessary to resolve the bulk of the problems currently arising from this regulation as soon as possible.
That is why the amendments proposed and supported by the committee are technical ones.
We prefer generally not to accept amendments concerning the scope of the regulation, the benefits covered, the changes in the competent authority and so on.
Our aim is to deal with this report most speedily so as not to give the Council any excuse for not moving rapidly to the conclusion of its initial debate on overall simplification - again a point raised in the joint resolution.
That is also the primary reason for my not accepting the amendments tabled in the name of the PPE, although I also have difficulties with the content of one or two of them.
Amendment No 8, for example, deals with occupational pensions which are not state-provided benefits and therefore currently outside the scope of the regulation.
I also consider that Amendment No 10 might be regressive in some Member States, as it proposes a general condition governing entitlement to unemployment benefit.
I accept that certain of the proposed amendments touch on some important issues and Parliament recognised them in its vote on the report on frontier workers last month - again, as recalled in the joint resolution.
Such workers are of course an issue for accession countries.
We are aware that free movement both to and from those countries depends to some extent on successful coordination of the social security systems.
Much of the debate about free movement tends to neglect the fact that people from current Member States wish to work and establish themselves within the accession countries, and hence our interest in the state of those negotiations.
Personally, I strongly support the Commission's proposals to include third-country nationals in the regulation and to do so on the legal base it has proposed.
Parliament should be involved in codecision on this issue, as it now is on matters relating to coordination of social security in general.
The inclusion of third-country nationals seems to me to be recognition of the principle of equal treatment of those who contribute to the economic and social life of the Union.
The joint resolution recalls the Tampere Summit when Member State governments stated that the legal status of third-country nationals should be approximated to that of Member State nationals.
I was at a European Union migrants' forum conference representing the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs soon after that statement was made.
It was welcomed as a strong indication of the Union's desire to be anti-discriminatory in its actions.
I regret that the Council cannot yet uphold the proposed legal base and live up to the hopes it has raised in the EU's so-called "16th Member State" of third-country nationals and among those of us who wish to see them treated fairly and equally.
To sum up, I would urge Parliament to move to a rapid conclusion on my report so that we can turn our full attention to the much-needed simplification and modernisation of the whole of Regulation 1408/71 to make it more inclusive and effective for all of those covered by a social security scheme.
Mr President, the issue we are addressing today, has divided this House and has evoked some strong emotions, particularly for the rapporteur, although she is hiding them well.
It has had the same effect on my fellow MEPs of the socialist group, with whom I usually manage to come to an agreement very quickly whenever I mention frontier work.
I therefore wonder whether there is a fear of getting in the way of our own Social Affairs Ministers, or does it, Mrs Lambert, amount to a well-intentioned difference in political strategy?
Every year, we receive from the competent committee a report on Regulation 1408, which attempts to coordinate the social security of frontier workers. This contains amendment proposals, in order to bring this regulation up-to-date.
For years, the EP has used this as an argument to extend our wish-list without causing any division in the House.
Unfortunately, Mr President, despite all the resolutions, the Council of Ministers has never taken the trouble to so much as glance at Parliament' s proposals.
I should also therefore address the European Commission in my lament today.
For as early as in 1998, the Commission, which is, after all, the originator of legislation and guardian of the European Treaty, made an excellent proposal to modernise, adapt and extend the regulation.
But the Council is playing the same game with the Commission, unfortunately.
The Commission proposal has been, and is being, discussed and is the subject of debate, but we have been awaiting a concrete result for the European Commission for the past three years.
I would ask Commissioner Solbes Mira whether this might not be a reason for joining our camp now, rather than waiting patiently for the moment when the Council, in its great wisdom, will take a decision?
I have also listened very carefully to the chairman, Mr Rocard, who I value greatly.
I have heard his passionate plea before the Council for the recognition of the rights of the European Parliament and for Parliament to be able to play that role.
I do not need a plea for this.
The EP has a role to play in this procedure.
We are co-legislators, Mr Rocard, so that role has already been carved out for us.
Could I therefore also express my deep disappointment at the words which Minister Danielsson spoke a moment ago.
He has given any response to what Mr Rocard has said.
None whatsoever.
They may be in favour of debates and of adapting and extending regulations, but how they intend to bring this about, or what the timeframe is, is a mystery.
I wonder whether this House cannot even expect an answer to this, and I therefore wonder, on behalf of all those who face those commuting problems on a daily basis, whether we, the Commission and Parliament that is, should not make use of our powers and invite this Council around the table to establish what we can do with the proposals which we have tabled.
Mrs Lambert, there is absolutely nothing in them which is even slightly peculiar.
We mention pensions, and the Commission comes back with the proposal.
The same is true for unemployment and medical expenses. This is all enshrined in proposals which the European Commission has also made at the request of Parliament.
There is, therefore, nothing out of the ordinary in them, Mrs Lambert. I suggest you have a look at your own dossier and you will find that it is better to join our camp and to ensure that we can get this Council to join us at the negotiating table.
I would have been quite happy to tell my group tomorrow that we have received nice pledges, but nothing came of them, and that is for me a reason to call on everyone once again: let us ensure that we now get to talk to them and I hope that the Commission' s reply will also be another acknowledgement of Parliament' s plea.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make two points.
The first of these concerns Mrs Lambert' s report, which is sensible and pragmatic and contains the necessary changes in the light of the annual updates.
This is a technical report and the Group of the Party of European Socialists thinks it right and proper that it has been separated from our political reports.
For this very reason, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I do not understand your outburst.
I think you are getting worked up about a report which really does not warrant it and that you are putting the rapid harmonisation of legislation in jeopardy.
The position we have adopted, which is one we have held for the last six years and more in our committee, is, quite understandably, to secure the right to freedom of movement, the rights of frontier workers and also the rights of third-country nationals whose families are in Europe, as quickly and as comprehensively as possible.
That is why the position of the Council seems to me somewhat lacking.
But our motion for a resolution, which we tabled together with the other left-wing groups of this House, contains a clear and, I think, urgent request for the Council to lay the directives, the regulation and the revision of the regulation on the table by the end of the year.
From what I have heard, I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will follow suit.
Mrs Ria, I regret, therefore, your zigzag course. When we look at your proposals, we find they do not tally with what you have said.
For instance, in Amendment No 1 on paragraph a, why did you remove social security?
We all want social security to remain a component; we do not want only economic interests to be to the fore.
In the case of Amendment No 4 to paragraph 1, you have removed third-country nationals. That is a big problem.
It has always been close to our hearts that we are dealing not only with the citizens of the European Union but also with workers and people from other countries, who are legally resident in our countries.
That is why we expect you to include these groups of people.
You can be sure that this problem will return to haunt us at the time of enlargement - but probably sooner - namely when the glaring deficit in qualified workers, which will make itself felt in all 15 Member States, is all too apparent.
We cannot restrict legal status to workers; we must also include workers' families.
Mr President, we are all aware, of course, that Mrs Lambert' s report is ill-timed, because it concerns a technical amendment.
We know. We all do.
However, because it has taken the Council, or Commission, such a long time to pluck up the courage to assess this regulation and to include it on the agenda, this was simply a cry from the heart from people who believe that it should at long last be included on the agenda so as to make it possible to hold a broad, political debate using sound arguments.
Mrs Lambert said that discrimination must be prevented.
I could not agree more, and everyone should support this view.
However, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has already indicated, frontier workers are still being discriminated against, and the Left has no intention of doing anything about this.
Do not ask me why.
I would urge them too to roll up their sleeves in this area, as these people are still being discriminated against.
That is my first point: we are drafting a directive which evidently has a discriminatory effect, especially in terms of frontier workers.
Something must be done about this.
There is also another point, which is possibly of even greater importance, namely the future of the Union.
We are now addressing the subject of interest at European level, and we are currently controlling the economy centrally, from Brussels.
This is to be welcomed.
What has not been tackled yet is the mobility of workers, since each Member State has its own wishes and legislation.
This will be a threat to the European economy in due course.
It is vital that mobility is established.
As far as frontier workers, as well as people on secondment, are concerned, I am of the opinion that they should be given a choice.
When I see how journalists who are stationed in Brussels for five years have to return home because they would otherwise have to surrender their pensions, I consider that the European Union is behaving quite outrageously with its legislation.
Certainly if this period is reduced to twelve months.
I therefore believe that the employed should have far more freedom of choice, leading to a widening and improvement of worker mobility.
I believe that a) not discriminating any longer, at any level, represents a positive step forward for us and b) that this will benefit the European economy.
Mr President, the annual adaptation of Directive 1408/71, which we are dealing with at the moment, is a technical matter.
The likelihood of implementing fundamental changes at the moment is therefore rather slim, although these changes are desperately needed, as everyone is all too aware.
My group would therefore argue in favour of a resolution which has been tabled jointly with the PSE, the ELDR and GUE, as was indicated a moment ago.
First of all, the Council should adopt the Commission proposal for extending the directive' s scope, in order to cover third-country nationals who reside in the EU lawfully, for they are clearly being discriminated against at present.
This is in contravention of the Charter of Fundamental rights and Article 12 of the Treaty, and clashes with the concept of the Citizens' Europe.
'Citizens' Europe does not only refer to the European citizen, but also to all citizens in Europe.
I hope that the Council will commit itself to a so-called inclusive approach.
A second important point, which has already been made, concerns frontier workers.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and, in actual fact, Mrs Van Lancker before her, as well as others, have already made huge efforts in this respect.
Time and again, Parliament has asked the Council and the Commission to lift the barriers in terms of taxation and social security for this group, but so far to little or no avail.
It is therefore high time that legislation was drafted in this field.
But there is a time and place for everything.
The place is this Parliament, but the time, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, is not now.
It would be short-sighted to try to improve the position of frontier workers or third-country nationals in the present technical amendment without any chance of success.
Not only will this slow down the completion of this resolution, it will also slow down the much-wished-for, wholesale reviews.
Let us not pursue a defeatist strategy, but rather focus our efforts on actual improvement.
Mr President, there is no option but to agree with the idea that any person with the right to move freely within the European Union should be protected by a social security system, regardless of whether they are employed or unemployed.
The European Union must indeed guarantee equal treatment for third-country nationals legally resident within a Member State territory, according to the Tampere Conclusions.
It must also, however, grant the same rights to the people who, driven by the increasingly restrictive policy on identity papers, visas and asylum rights, are forced to work in unacceptable conditions, without social protection.
At this time when 700 "immigrants in an irregular situation" in Spain are on hunger strike, we need a policy to regularise their situation throughout Europe.
The report makes reference to freedom of movement, but establishing genuine freedom of movement would entail putting an end to the requirement to declare entry into European territory and doing away with the Schengen Information System and the Eurodac system.
Finally, truly fair treatment would entail equal access to public sector jobs, and equal wages and social rights, as well as to European citizenship based on residence and not on nationality, with, consequently, the right to vote and the eligibility of immigrants that are third-country nationals.
Mr President, I come to this debate today with a lot of reservations because of some of the comments made by other speakers in a previous debate.
In particular when we speak about the free movement of workers, as was pointed out in the two previous debates on Lisbon and on the Lipietz report, the free movement of workers is not just about internal barriers.
It is not just about lack of social security protection.
It is also about lack of recognition and about hindrances at national level whereby the internal market is not completed.
It is about lack of recognition of qualifications.
It is about lack of opportunity for training and also a lack of opportunity for knowledge of what opportunities and what rights are available to people.
So when we speak about the free movement of workers and when we speak about updating regulations we should be clearer in our focus on two points, namely that, firstly, in Nice the governments decided that this should be done by unanimous voting, not by qualified majority voting, and secondly that there should be no discrimination - either positive or negative - against any worker who is legally resident within the Member States of the European Union.
My Group will therefore be supporting the resolution from the PPE-DE Group.
Mr President, I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Rocard for his question and moving speech.
As for the rapporteur, I would like to say that perhaps it would have been better for her to occupy a seat in the Council section rather than our section as far as the defence of Parliament' s interests is concerned.
After all, the free movement of persons is still very badly regulated in Europe.
The brochure seems to be painting a rosy picture, but the reality is very different indeed.
People who make use of the free movement of persons are brought down to earth with a shock.
Just ask journalists in Brussels, for example.
They are now being covered by Belgian social security, but lose all their rights elsewhere.
They are left with the choice of paying twice or else leaving, unless the Belgian government shows mercy.
Journalists are, of course, a group of people who can fend for themselves to some extent; others fare much worse.
I would like to cite the example of a Swedish lady who lives in the Netherlands, is insured in the Netherlands, returns to Sweden but cannot benefit from the health care system there because the Netherlands refuses to include the so-called private patients in the regulation.
Examples of this are legion.
People who experience this kind of treatment end up in a Kafkaesque situation.
Who are the architects of this system?
They are in the Council and are keen to keep things as they are.
This is also evident from the replies.
The question now arises as to whether we want to change this or not?
We have had precious little opportunity to do anything so far, for the only right Parliament has had has been advisory.
The only thing we could do if extremely bad changes were announced was to settle for a recommendation which prevented discussion in the Council.
We now have another right: that of codecision.
That is why our group is of the opinion that we should use this right at long last to force a dialogue with the Council.
That is exactly what the rapporteur has tried to prevent with all his might, with all possible means, and backed by the UK representatives.
I believe that that is not right.
This is today' s topic of discussion.
That is why we are in conflict, and not so much in terms of the objectives.
There are naturally always differences between the way in which the one amendment would have been worded compared to the other, but they boil down to the same thing.
It is extremely odd that if we discuss a legislative matter, we at the same time want to express our true interests in the form of a resolution.
If we were to adopt this approach in other codecision matters, we would not make much progress.
This morning, we managed to conclude quite a few codecision matters successfully, and I do not believe that there is a resolution in these, the exact meaning of which would need to be reiterated.
That proves just how odd this procedure is here today.
That also proves that we are on the wrong track.
Someone might say that perhaps this is the last time. I do hope so.
I hope that this will prove to be the case in a year' s time.
If that is so, Council, you will really need to watch your step, because you will be unable to continue in the same vein.
You will really need to look after those ordinary people who are continuously at the receiving end of your stipulations.
Then, there will be no need to give less consideration to the interests of the bureaucracies which so far, the parties to the Left have valued more than the interests of the electorate and the people they represent.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying that I empathise with many of my fellow MEPs, including those occupying the EPP benches, in terms of their feelings of anger and even frustration, and I also share these feelings, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
We have cooperated for years in order to break the deadlock in the issue of the free movement of persons and hence of frontier workers.
It is utterly disgraceful that the European Commission' s proposal on coordination and extension is, after so many years, still on the Council' s table, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
To tell you the truth, Mr Danielsson, I had hoped from the bottom of my heart that you, on behalf of the Swedish Presidency, would have shown the greatest commitment to ultimately making decisions, and to at least producing a timeframe indicating when a decision would be taken on this important regulation.
I happen to know that the Belgian Presidency is very much prepared to reach political agreement on the content of this dossier and on the timing.
Mr Danielsson, I believe we need this, but we cannot do this, of course, without Sweden' s strong commitment.
Our group is also of the opinion that pressure should be stepped up.
But our group does not believe that the annual technical amendment, Mr Pronk, is the right way to achieve this.
It does not move the issue on frontier workers along one inch, not even if we call on Parliament' s codecision. You are all too aware of this.
Quite the reverse in fact.
A number of vital adjustments which are equally important, such as the situation of the Belgian frontier workers who should be able to enjoy supplementary French pensions, Mr Pronk, are under threat in this dossier.
The best approach is to continue to form a united front in these issues and not to use this directive to pull cheap party-political stunts at the expense of frontier workers.
This is not why we pursue this strategy.
Whatever the case, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the Belgian Presidency and the Swedish Presidency should facilitate a speedy breakthrough in this issue.
In fact, it should be possible for the final discussions in the Council to coincide with the prospect of a conference on frontier work, which the European Commission has promised us.
I hope that this will at least win over the hesitant Member States and that we will have clarity in this matter by the end of this year.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the best line of attack is not a divided one, for this is not the impression we want to convey to the Council.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, something which worries me a great deal is the fact that the Council apparently does not intend to extend the scope of the regulation on social security to include third-country nationals.
At least, that is what I could gather from the whole dispute regarding the legal base.
I have to tell you in all honesty - and I echo Mr Rocard' s view on this - that this is diametrically opposed to the conclusions reached in Tampere, where it was decided that third-country nationals should be given equal treatment, and it is obvious that this Parliament will not accept this unacceptable discrimination.
But if I can ask you something: I would very much like to know how Sweden, not only as the country holding the presidency, but also as a Member State of this European Union, intends to break the deadlock in this issue and how you stand on the extension to include third-country nationals.
Mr President, I also wish to emphasise that people' s opportunity to move freely to another EU country and work across frontiers is one of the major advances in European cooperation, and I believe we can all appreciate that it is only right and proper for people who obtain work in another EU country to be able to retain their social security rights.
Our framework - Regulation No 1408/71 - whereby countries' reciprocal agreements ensure that people also have these rights in practice has become more and more complex throughout the years and, what with this and general bureaucracy, it is often no simple matter at all to move from country to country.
That is something we must change, and I therefore think it is right to call for more progress in the work on simplifying the regulation, as proposed by the Commission at the end of 1998.
The question arises as to whether, in addition to simplifying and improving the regulation for EU citizens, we can also ensure that it will be possible for third-country nationals engaged in active employment and resident in EU countries to be covered by the regulation.
Several countries, including Denmark, have opposed the Commission' s proposal by referring to the legal basis, Article 42, which of course only covers EU citizens.
At the Nice Summit, Denmark fought hard against changing Article 42 and against majority voting in connection with Article 42.
I understand that work has been done on possibly seeking another legal basis, for example in terms of legal cooperation.
I would urge that it not all be allowed to collapse in legal wranglings and problems concerning the legal basis, for Danish business too will have an interest in a solution' s being found to this problem so that, for example, foreign experts legally resident in Denmark can be posted to another EU country for a period and retain their social security rights and so that we can have experts over to Denmark from other EU countries.
Mr President, I should like to raise a point in connection with the application of social security schemes which has upset workers in my country and in every other country, and that is the future of social security.
Big business and the European Union, in their full frontal attack on everything the working classes have struggled and fought for, have now set their sights on social security.
They are using groundless arguments, such as longer life expectancy and the allegedly excessive cost of labour, in order to introduce measures such as increasing the retirement age, reducing employers' contributions and replacing insurance funds by private, profit-making companies.
This, together with the continuing privatisation of the health system, means yet another burden on the workers, a lower standard of living and huge profits for the monopolies.
The working classes in Greece have already mobilised in the face of this attack.
They are ousting the trade union leaders who have been bought off and who are being dragged into so-called social dialogue with so-called social partners, and they are organising their resistance and counter-attack.
Similar action is being taken in other countries.
The Communist Party of Greece hereby declares from this tribune that it will do everything it can to support this movement.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to this debate with great interest.
The Council fully understands the frustration apparent in many of the speeches in this debate.
I can understand why you think that the work on Regulation 1408 which has taken place since the Finnish Presidency in 1999 has seemed extremely long drawn out.
I would nonetheless repeat what I said in my introduction.
This is technically a complicated issue and it has been necessary to take the time to test the Council' s reactions and to provide the Council and the Commission with the opportunity to consider, reflect and create a foundation for future negotiations.
However, we Swedes have high hopes that, in the next six months, the Swedish Presidency will be able to complete this technical work.
If we succeed, and we are hopeful that we will, this will allow the forthcoming Belgian Presidency to move on to a strategic discussion on the proposal to simplify and modernise Regulation No 1408.
Both the Swedish Presidency and the forthcoming Belgian Presidency want to break the vicious circle in which the Council has found itself on this issue.
We believe this is extremely important.
We hope to be able to agree on a continued timetable for the work.
The Council and the Commission may need a mandate in which the working method and approach are clearly stated - whether the proposal is to be divided up, whether certain sections are to be omitted entirely, whether we are to try to simplify the regulation further and if so, how, etc.
I am hopeful that we will not need to repeat this debate many more times and that the Council will be able to return with better news than I can provide in this debate.
Let me finally say the following in answer to Mrs van Lancker' s question on what the Swedish Presidency intends or would like to do to tackle the problems of discrimination.
In this I will remove my Council hat and put on my national hat.
In brief, as we see it, the only way to tackle these problems in the long term is to agree on qualified majority voting on Article 42.
We did not succeed in Nice, but we do not intend to give up.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Rocard for his support for the Commission proposal to extend Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to third-country nationals.
The Commission also thanks him for his support for Articles 42 and 308 of the Treaty as suitable legal bases for this objective.
An extension of this nature, in my opinion, is fully consistent with Community policy, particularly if you take into account the conclusions of the Tampere European Council on the situation of third-country nationals who reside legally in the Member States.
The Commission therefore regrets the fact that the Council has not yet been able to support this and other Commission proposals to amend the Regulation and, in particular, the global proposal to simplify and modernise it.
We are delighted at what we have just heard Minister Danielsson say in this respect, and we hope his wishes come true over the next few months.
The Commission insists that the Council should intensify the debates on the proposals mentioned and is grateful for Parliament' s support on this matter.
This leads me to Mrs Lambert' s report; I offer her my most sincere thanks for her highly constructive contribution to the Commission proposal.
Our proposal is a technical proposal, aiming as you well know at filling gaps in legislation due to changes in national social security laws.
Community coordination of national social security systems is a means to foster the free movement of workers, and in order to guarantee that this coordination works properly the amendments to national legislation also require the amendment of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71; this is basically what it is about.
The proposals made by Mrs Lambert, whom we thank for her support, are very useful since they clarify the Commission' s original proposal and make it more specific.
I can agree fully with the proposals contained in Amendments Nos 1 to 7 in the report.
I also agree with the general idea that underlies the two additional amendments that have been tabled in the House, Nos 9 and 10.
Their aim is to extend the right to sickness benefit to frontier workers, and if I have understood correctly, to expand the Regulation to cover early retirement benefit.
In fact the Commission included the same provisions in its 1998 proposal for the simplification and modernisation of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71.
The amendments that concern us now, however, propose a substantial change to the Regulation and clearly go beyond the technical nature of the update proposed by the Commission, and in my opinion the debate on the technical update should not be confused with a debate on the substantial amendments.
Therefore the Commission cannot accept the other additional amendments on supplementary pensions.
With regard to Amendment No 8, I should like simply to underline the fact that the Commission has agreed to submit a proposal this year on its transferability.
To sum up, therefore, we can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 7, but we cannot accept Amendments Nos 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13.
May I thank you all, and especially Mrs Lambert, for your general support for the Commission' s proposal.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have received three draft resolutions submitted under Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Questions to the Council (B5-0007/2001).
First Mr Alavanos has a point of order.
Mr President, it is a point of order based on Annex II to the Rules of Procedure.
I tabled a question to the Council for February's Question Time on "the responsibilities of Mr Solana and the Balkan syndrome" under Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure.
I have received a letter from Mr Correa in the Division des activitÃs des deputÃ©s, which says that the President instructs me to inform you that your question number such and such has not been entered for Question Time because questions are only accepted on condition that they do not contain assertions or opinions.
Annex ÃÃ to the Rules of Procedure does indeed state that questions must not contain assertions or opinions.
However, I see here, for example, that Mr Gahrton's valuable Question No 3 states: "Unfortunately, the Finnish, Portuguese and French Presidencies chose to disregard Parliament's recommendation." Similarly, question no.
7 by Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n states: "In view of the reprehensible inertia of the Spanish authorities, what steps has the Council taken to put an end to this tragic situation?" Not just opinions, but opinions on the liability of European Union government authorities for the deaths of immigrants.
Having said which, I think that this intervention and the withdrawal of my question on Mr Solana are unacceptable and I would ask the Bureau as a whole to reconsider and enter it on the next agenda.
It does not contain any more opinions or assertions than most questions tabled by Members.
I must tell you, Mr Alavanos, as you already know, I am the President of the sitting and that, before the sitting, in accordance with Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure, it is the Presidency of Parliament, in this case Madam President, who has the power to accept a question or not.
You have read out certain criteria; then the criteria are applied and that is where there may sometimes be disagreement.
I shall pass your point on to the President of Parliament because I am not a court that can judge even your arguments of unfair treatment today.
I have listened carefully to your legal and political arguments on the matter and I shall pass them on.
As you know, you too can also use whatever means you find appropriate to achieve the fullest transparency so that the criteria can be interpreted as clearly and extensively as possible.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 1 and 2 will be taken together.
Question No 1 by (H-0015/01):
Subject: Crisis management Can the Council clarify one aspect of the EU's new defence policy which has not been made plain in the debate in Sweden: will military intervention by the EU's planned rapid reaction force always require a United Nations mandate?
Question No 2 by (H-0022/01):
Subject: UN mandate for peace-enforcement operations The Swedish Defence Minister, BjÃ¶rn von Sydow, wrote in the Sydsvenskan newspaper on 7 January 2001 that '... Sweden will take part both in humanitarian and civilian measures as well as in peace-promoting and peace-keeping operations.
Within the EU, we are agreed that our actions will be in keeping with the principles of the UN Charter. This means that a UN mandate is required for peace-enforcement operations.'
Where in documents adopted by the European Union is it unequivocally stated that peace-enforcement operations by the EU require a UN mandate?
As the EU develops its common foreign and security policy, of which the common European security and defence policy is a vital element, the EU undertakes to maintain peace and strengthen international security in line with the principles of the UN Charter, the principles set out in the Helsinki Final Act and the aims of the Paris Charter.
This responsibility is stated in Article 11.1 of the Treaty on European Union.
It has been confirmed by the Council in drawing up the framework for strengthening the common European security and defence policy since the European Council in Cologne in June 1999 when this process was set in motion.
In addition, in the conclusions from the European Council in Helsinki, and recently in the Military Capabilities Commitment Declaration, which was presented after the conference held in France in November 2000 and which accompanied the presidency' s report to the summit in Nice, it was emphasised that 'the Union recognises the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.'
Thank you for your answer, but my question was about the UN mandate.
Mr Danielsson said nothing about this.
Instead, we received a report on the fact that the EU will act in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.
But what about the mandate?
Is a mandate needed?
We must have a clear answer to this.
Is it the case that the EU needs a UN mandate to intervene with its planned rapid reaction force, i.e. a positive decision from the UN?
That is my question.
I believe it is extremely difficult to be any clearer than the European Council in its conclusions from Nice.
I once again refer to the 'capacity declaration' .
I do not think it is possible to be any clearer than that is.
It states that everything done with regard to the common European security and defence policy must be carried out in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.
Let me stress what is already well known to Mr Schmid, that it is also the case that all measures taken within the framework of the common European security and defence policy are a type of intergovernmental cooperation, which means firstly that there should be agreement among the Member States and secondly that there should be the opportunity for individual countries to decide for themselves the extent to which they want to participate in such operations, if at all.
We also know that in a number of Member States, depending to some extent upon national tradition, various forms of reference to the UN Charter are required for the country to take part in an intervention.
As such, it is a case of belt and braces regarding this issue.
I believe we can sleep soundly in our beds.
European crisis management will be carried out in line with the principles of the UN Charter.
I think Lars Danielsson is doing what is known as a Dinkelspiel, i.e. he appears to be answering the question, but is avoiding giving a proper answer.
We have asked a very clear question about whether an absolute mandate is required for military action.
It is not about the general principles.
It is not about spirit or other higher values.
It is about the concrete fact of having an express mandate from the UN for military action.
There are two possible answers to this question: No, no absolute mandate is required, even though it may be desirable.
Or yes, such a mandate must be obtained.
I would like to be given a yes or no answer.
I believe that the regulations surrounding the common security and defence policy fully guarantee that all measures taken within the framework of that policy will be taken in line with the principles of the UN Charter.
This is sufficient for the Swedish Government, and it is clearly sufficient for all the other governments in the Council.
However, I realise that this is not sufficient for Mr SjÃ¶stedt and Mr Schmid, for which I am sorry.
However, I believe that we can rest safe in the knowledge that all the measures we might need to take within the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy will follow the principles of the UN Charter, and not of course forgetting those of the OSCE.
I think that should count for a great deal.
Mr President, I heard Mr Danielsson say that it would be difficult to be clearer than he had been in his answers.
I would also say that it is difficult to be the Swedish President-in-Office of the Council for, as my fellow MEP Mr SjÃ¶stedt said so clearly, there are two possible answers to the question that has been asked, and they are either yes or no.
Instead, Mr Danielsson comes out with a long explanation to the effect that the operations are in keeping with the UN Charter.
I have never heard any head of state or any representative of an international organisation maintain that what they were doing was contrary to the UN Charter.
They always maintain that it is not. However, it is very interesting that, after four successive attempts to obtain a clear answer to the question that has been asked, we cannot obtain such an answer.
There are, as likely as not, people who draw the conclusion that no UN mandate is required.
And that is a scandal.
Scandal or not, I can only assume that there is a fundamental difference of opinion.
There is a view widely held in Europe that we need to develop better instruments for preventing and managing crises which may arise in and close to Europe.
We need to do this in the spirit of the UN Charter and in accordance with its principles.
We need to do it in line with the OSCE' s principles.
There is major support for this view. Then there is a small group, of which we have heard a few representatives, which wants to try by all possible means to block this development towards stronger and more stable peace and security in and around our continent.
I can only regret that we cannot really agree on this important issue.
I feel safe in the knowledge that everything carried out within the framework of the common security and defence policy will be fully compliant with the principles of the UN Charter.
Question No 3 by (H-0031/01):
Subject: European Parliament recommendation on the establishment of a civil peace corps On 17 January 2001, the European Parliament delivered its opinion on a proposal for creating an EU rapid reaction facility, pointing out that priority must be given to non-military crisis management and citing as a suitable way forward the recommendation it made to the Council in spring 1999 that a civil peace corps be established.
Unfortunately, the Finnish, Portuguese and French Presidencies chose to disregard Parliament's recommendation.
Will the Council therefore state what initiatives the Swedish Presidency intends to take to comply with Parliament's unanimous recommendation?
Conflict prevention and crisis management employing all civil and, if necessary, military instruments is an extremely important priority for the EU.
This has been reflected in the conclusion from the European Councils up to and including the Nice Summit.
The Swedish Presidency is actively proceeding with the task assigned by the European Council in Nice.
The work is quite complicated both in the civil and the military spheres as the EU is creating new resources and structures.
The work in the civil sphere is currently focused on achieving the concrete aims established at the European Council in Feira, i.e. by 2003 to be able to mobilise up to 5 000 police for international assignments across the spectrum of operations to prevent conflict and manage crises.
It must be possible to mobilise 1 000 police within 30 days.
The work in other prioritised areas, as established in Feira - particularly with regard to strengthening the rule of law, but also rescue services and civil administration - will continue.
In addition, the Swedish Presidency has clarified the fact that it is appropriate, as the EU' s civil crisis management continues to develop, also to establish other areas within the framework of civil crisis management in which EU resources may need to be developed or used more effectively.
Such areas may include expertise in democracy and human rights plus monitors and observers of various kinds.
Mechanisms for improved cooperation with voluntary organisations which participate in conflict prevention and in initiatives to promote peace after a conflict, such as improvements to the EU' s diplomatic instrument for conflict prevention, will also be drawn up in the European programme on conflict prevention, which is expected to be approved by the European Council in Gothenburg.
Alongside this, the EU has reformed and concentrated the work of its monitoring missions and placed it under the control of the Secretary-General.
Moreover, the monitoring mission recently showed its value when it was deployed in Presevo Valley.
All this work is moving in the same direction, and has the same aims, as the European Parliament' s recommendation on establishing a civil peace corps.
The Council prefers to complete the aforementioned work, i.e. an operational capacity in the field, before the end of the year with the aims and deadlines set out by the European Council.
The Council will then be better able to assess what other arrangements might be warranted or necessary.
Mr Danielsson appears to be trying to incorporate an old Swedish expression into general EU jargon - you see, I do not think there is a good translation of 'goddag yxskaft' [literally 'hello, axe handle' ].
Mr Danielsson' s replies to question after question are like the complete non sequitur 'goddag yxskaft' .
My question was also one with a yes or no answer.
I did not ask about police and a host of other pleasant or less pleasant, friendly or less friendly measures for civil crisis management.
I asked a question about the recommendation, adopted by Parliament and passed on to the Council, for the Council to initiate a pilot study on a possible European peace corps.
Does the Council intend to take any initiative on the basis of this recommendation?
Yes or no?
It is very easy to answer yes or no.
But perhaps I should interpret the reply as a no, as with the previous question to which the answer was in fact no.
In that case, Parliament, having unanimously adopted this recommendation, will draw its own conclusions as to how the Council intends to work with Parliament.
I understand that my long reply was somewhat too comprehensive for Mr Gahrton.
Let me therefore try to summarise it as follows:
No now.
Yes possibly later.
Question No 4 by (H-0018/01):
Subject: Turkey and military crisis management Does the Council consider it appropriate to include Turkey in cooperation on military crisis management when, at the same time, Turkey violates human rights in its own country, occupies the northern part of Cyprus and conducts offensive operations in northern Iraq?
Turkey was accepted as an applicant country at the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999.
Human rights in Turkey plus the Cyprus issue are therefore dealt with within the framework of the accession partnership with Turkey, about which the Council reached political agreement at its meeting on 4 December 2000.
As we all know, Turkey is also a member of NATO.
The presidency report on the Common Security and Defence Policy, which was approved by the European Council in Nice, confirmed that the EU project is of an open nature.
It contains arrangements for the EU' s military crisis management which enable consultation with, and participation of, European NATO members which are not members of the EU and other countries which are candidates for accession to the EU.
The principle of the EU' s independence in decision-making must, of course, be taken into account in this openness.
In addition, in the conclusions from the European Council in Nice the EU reiterates the importance attached to being able to call on NATO' s funds and resources when necessary, in line with the Washington Summit CommuniquÃ©.
In such situations it is vital to ensure approval from all NATO members of guaranteed access to NATO' s planning capacity and assumed access to previously identified NATO resources.
In contrast to my other Swedish fellow MEPs who have spoken, I take that as a yes.
It is appropriate for Turkey to be involved, while the discussion on the other aspects taken up in my question will be continued elsewhere.
I found it particularly interesting to hear the Council' s representative mention the close link between NATO and the EU' s military crisis management cooperation.
It is not that common - particularly in our home country Sweden - to emphasise this link between the EU and NATO.
This is also sometimes the case with regard to military cooperation.
I would also like to take this opportunity to express my extreme irritation with the answers which my Swedish Left Party colleagues received, namely that there should be only a small group to discuss UN mandates, neutrality, non-alignment and Turkish involvement in crisis management.
I would not say that the majority of the Swedish people is a small group.
I also know that these issues are being discussed in all Member States.
I have a supplementary question concerning the forces which are to make up the EU rapid reaction force.
It is a fact that the British forces and others have weapons which employ depleted uranium and that it will also be possible for these weapons to be used by the EU crisis management force.
Does the presidency have any views on the appropriateness of this?
I believe we had the opportunity of discussing this last time I had the honour of taking part in question time in this House.
I also believe that I answered this question on that occasion.
Generally speaking, we all know the importance that not only Parliament but also the Council attach to obtaining full clarification as quickly as possible of environmental and other problems which may arise due to depleted uranium.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt must accept responsibility for his statement.
I cannot verify it.
Obviously, it is up to each Member State to decide what equipment, etc. they will use in a European crisis management situation.
Question No 5 by (H-0023/01):
Subject: Long settlement procedures following road accidents in third countries In its answer to question E-2656/99 the Council said that 'the problem of long settlement procedures concerning road accidents in third countries has been recognised by the Institutions of the EU and they have been prepared to tackle the problem with the proposal for the fourth motor insurance directive...'
However, the fourth directive affords no solution to settlement procedures currently under way.
What initiatives will the Council take to achieve a 'rapid, fair and reasonable solution' for the victims of road accidents in third countries (in this case: Switzerland) currently involved in settlement procedures?
I will be brief.
As the honourable Member rightly points out, the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive does not solve disputes already underway, partly because of the prescribed implementation period.
In the absence of proposals from the Commission, the Council is unfortunately unable to deal with problems of disputes already underway.
I am the first to agree that the problems highlighted by Mr Staes are real and serious.
However, it is currently the case that, in the area discussed by Mr Staes, the Council can only act on proposals from the Commission.
We are currently awaiting such proposals.
I can however promise, for my part, that when the Swiss President visits Stockholm on Friday I will refer to the debate we have just had and point out that this is a problem which has clearly attracted interest in the European Parliament.
However, I shall do this on my own behalf, not on behalf of the Council.
Question No 6 by (H-0026/01):
Subject: Swedish Presidency's rules on public access to information Will the Council give an assurance that Sweden will also be able to maintain its rules on public access to information and freedom to pass on information to the full extent while holding the Presidency-in-Office of the EU?
According to Community law, national laws are not harmonised where they apply to Member States' documents.
As Mr Bonde no doubt knows, Parliament and the Council are currently debating a proposal, based on Article 255.2 of the Treaty on European Union, for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
This proposal was tabled by the Commission on 21 February 2000.
Mr President, it is precisely this proposal which means that, when a document is delivered from Sweden to the Commission, it is no longer Sweden that decides that it can be made public but, rather, the new rules that decide that it can be confidential. In this way, it will be prohibited, where such documents are concerned, to exercise the right to freedom of expression and public access to documents under the Swedish constitution.
And we shall, of course, be seeing the first real test of that kind of potential conflict on 6 March when Bernard Connelly' s case is heard at the European Court of Justice.
The Court will adopt a position on whether what counts is the interpretation of the Council of Europe, Sweden and Denmark and a few other countries of officials' right to express opinions, or whether it is, instead, the advocate-general' s restrictive interpretation that counts.
That conflict will be clearly decided then and there, and that is why I should like to see a commitment from the Swedish Presidency that it will not under any circumstances agree to a situation in which either the regulation concerned or any other authority is able to restrict either officials' current right to express opinions or the public' s current right of access to information.
As the honourable Member Mr Bonde well knows, intensive discussions are now underway between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the issue of making documents public.
Mr Bonde is fully aware of the deadline set for this work.
The aim is for us to come to an agreement by 1 May 2001 in line with the provisions set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I am convinced that the end result of this process will be increased openness in the EU Institutions, thanks to a large extent to the serious work done by this House on operating in a spirit of openness.
Therefore, as a representative of the presidency, I look forward with a certain amount of confidence to the no doubt difficult but very important discussions to be carried out in this area.
I am extremely moved by, and grateful for, Mr Bonde' s concern over Swedish legislation.
I can assure you that the Swedish government will not accept any change whatsoever to Sweden' s Freedom of the Press Act.
I ask Members to try to formulate a question, even though they will of course argue their point; do not just make a statement or expound a doctrine to the Council, but ask a question instead, as the Rules of Procedure require.
Mr Bonde asks an important question.
I think I can give a clear answer and possibly help Mr Danielsson a little for, in several interviews last Christmas, I heard the Swedish Prime Minister state that any changes to the Constitution of Sweden, in this case Sweden' s Freedom of the Press Act of 1766, would create a domestic political crisis.
Prime Minister Persson wants neither to have a domestic political crisis nor to change the Freedom of the Press Act.
I would like Mr Danielsson to confirm that it is the Prime Minister' s absolute intention that the Constitution of Sweden will not be changed in any way.
I thought that is exactly what I just said, i.e. that the Swedish Government will never accept any changes to the Freedom of the Press Act.
In addition, I think that that debate might perhaps best be continued in a more national context.
However, Mr Schmidt need not worry.
Question No 7 by (H-0027/01):
Subject: Tragic deaths of African immigrants on the southern Spanish coast Every week, men and women trying to enter Europe in search of work are drowned along the Andalusian coast of southern Spain. In view of the reprehensible inertia of the Spanish authorities, what steps has the Council taken to put an end to this tragic situation?
The honourable Member' s question applies to the Council' s initiatives for Member State control of external sea borders and to the measures which can be taken in the country of origin to prevent illegal immigration and to stop trafficking operations.
Measures to improve the effectiveness of Member States' control of airspace and external sea borders have mostly been drawn up within the framework of the Schengen cooperation and, now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into force, have now been incorporated into EU legislation.
These measures are carried out by the Member States themselves, but the Council monitors actual implementation through its relevant subordinate bodies.
Practical measures are carried out in cooperation with selected African states, for example, to prevent illegal immigration, by air or by sea, based on the decision of Schengen' s Executive Committee of 18 December 1998 on a coordinated initiative from the document advisers.
In a decision on 28 April 1999, the same executive committee also approved a plan for mutual placement of liaison officers to offer advice and support when security and control assignments are carried out along external borders.
In addition to issues concerning the Schengen acquis, illegal immigration to the EU constitutes one of the major issues being dealt with by the Council, based on conclusions from several meetings of the European Council - Tampere, Feira and Nice to name but a few.
As the honourable Member no doubt knows, the European Council obliged the EU to intensify cooperation to combat trafficking in human beings following the tragic events in Dover last year.
After the conclusions from the European Council meetings, which emphasised the importance of controlling migration flows, the Council has discussed both operational measures and regulations for combating trafficking in human beings.
In this regard, the Council adopted resolutions on 30 November last year which contained various operational measures to combat illegal immigration, such as the exchange of information on observed migration flows, the optimisation of the early warning system, the transfer of information on illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and the coordination of the network for Member State liaison officers in the countries in which the illegal immigration originates.
With regard to the basic causes of flight or migration from a number of African countries, we refer you to the action plan for Morocco which was approved by the Council on 11 October 1999 and of which Parliament is hopefully aware.
Within the framework of implementing the action plan for Morocco, and as the EU is aware that the action plan must be implemented through partnership and cooperation with the Moroccan authorities, a delegation from the EU under the leadership of the presidency made a second visit to Rabat to open a dialogue with the Moroccan authorities.
The message which the presidency wished to get across during this visit, which took place on 3 October last year, was that the action plan for Morocco was the result of work originally started by the Member States and the Commission and that it was now time to ask for the reactions of the Moroccan parties and to make the necessary adjustments of the action plan so that it could be implemented jointly.
I believe that the Moroccan authorities welcomed this course of action and the idea of opening a dialogue with the EU on immigration issues.
This dialogue will take place within the framework of the association agreement with Morocco once agreement has been reached on setting up a working party on social and migration issues.
The Council' s subordinate bodies are currently looking at a proposal from the Commission on this matter.
Mr President, I should like in fact to reformulate the question.
Mr Danielsson, I see this question as a political question, which it is; but most of all as a humanitarian question.
You have just mentioned the Dover tragedy, which all Europeans regret, but I must say - and I have direct experience of this problem, even though I do not live in southern Spain - that there in Andalusia and also sometimes in the Canary Islands we experience a Dover every week.
What is happening in southern Spain is much more serious than Dover, Mr Danielsson, and I believe it requires some interference, if I may use this expression.
In Austria, the European Member States interfered when faced with the threat of xenophobia.
I believe this question is so serious that it requires some special action.
I am grateful for your answer, which was otherwise full and informed, but I believe a far more serious intervention is needed.
Every week, hundreds of people are detained on the Spanish coastline and every week people die, often pregnant women, and as I said the other day, children too.
