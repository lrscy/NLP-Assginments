In terms of justice and home affairs I do not think we should be looking for a harmonised system across the European Union.
That is generally undesirable, but in any case, what model would we take?
But we do want a structure and process that give confidence and deliver the right outcome.
Among other developments in Bulgaria there is now a new penal code, a new chief prosecutor, constitutional changes have been passed that allow the easier lifting of immunities, and the Judicial System Act is going through Parliament.
But it is concrete results that we want, not just legislation.
Yes, these have been a long time coming â too long perhaps â but they are there now.
The clear-up rate for general crime in Bulgaria bears comparison with that in many current EU Member States.
For example, the crime rate is lower than in Germany, the detection rate higher.
We should recognise that Bulgaria and Romania are being subjected to an unparalleled degree of scrutiny.
There is much still to be done and the process of reform will continue for many years.
The Commission should be prepared to give a clear signal to the Council: take the decision in June for accession on 1Â January 2007; take the decision in December, in the light of further progress by the Bulgarian authorities and in cooperation with them, on any monitoring and other safeguard measures that may be necessary.
At the end of the day, what is important is that the people of Bulgaria should have confidence in their administration and justice system.
Â Â  . Mr President, before giving more substantive responses to the questions by Mr Brok, Mr Moscovici and MrÂ VanÂ Orden, I would like to begin by expressing my sympathy for all people affected by the floods that recently hit Bulgaria and Romania and countries falling outside the scope of todayâs debate, in particular Serbia.
I can assure you that the Commission is following the situation with the greatest attention and is ready to offer advice and support in tackling the impact of the floods once the damage has been assessed, as we did last year in the case of Bulgaria and Romania.
Concerning the first question as to whether the rhythm of reform in Bulgaria and Romania is such that they will be ready for accession by January 2007, the Commission is currently assessing the progress made in both countries and is not yet in a position to confirm the answer to this critical question.
As I said to the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 3Â April, the Commission will report on developments until the end of April, so the cut-off date is 30Â April, the end of this week.
The full factual basis will therefore be available in the first two weeks of May.
The Commission will then provide an in-depth analysis on 16Â May, and we will then be ready to discuss our assessment further with the honourable Members of Parliament.
However, let me underline the priority of all priorities.
The completion and implementation of judicial reform and concrete results demonstrating that these have a real effect on the ground are of paramount importance for our assessment.
Systemic conditions, structural conditions that show that the reforms are irreversible need to be in place.
These are the critical yardsticks, since a fully functioning justice system underpins the functioning of the whole of society and the economy in its entirety.
On the basis of our objective and balanced assessment, the Commission will make a proposal on 16Â May for a carefully calibrated decision that will maintain the momentum of essential remaining reforms up to and beyond accession of the two countries.
I ask for the support of the Parliament and the Council for this rigorous and fair position.
Concerning the second question on the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption and organised crime, both countries have shown determination to undertake necessary reforms in this field.
In Romania we note significant progress, as Romania has continued to pursue the implementation of its legal package of 2005.
I fully agree with Mr Moscovici that the rigorous monetary mechanism and the safeguard clause of postponement have provided very strong encouragement and an incentive, and these have produced very tangible results in the case of Romania.
In Bulgaria amendments have been made to the constitution, reducing the scope of the immunity of Members of Parliament and establishing the leading function of the prosecution service in most investigations.
However, there remains ambiguity concerning the independence of the judiciary and there is a serious backlog in cases related to organised crime.
As regards the fight against organised crime in Bulgaria, there are still very few investigations and prosecutions.
The competent authorities seem in general to have a reactive instead of a proactive attitude.
Therefore, urgent attention is needed in this area.
The same is true concerning money laundering in Bulgaria.
Finally, on Mr Brokâs question concerning the safeguard clauses and monitoring, safeguard clauses are meant to tackle the possible negative consequences that may persist due to shortcomings in Bulgaria and Romania after accession.
Safeguards may for instance involve temporarily suspending specific rights under the EU which are directly related to the shortcomings of a new Member State.
A number of safeguards are already provided in existing Community legislation, for instance in the area of food safety or transport.
In addition, the accession treaty contains three safeguard clauses: a general economic safeguard clause, a specific internal market safeguard clause and a third one which relates to justice and home affairs.
Without going into details of how they can be invoked, by way of example I will take the internal market safeguard, which is specifically designed to deal with cases where a new Member State fails to fulfil commitments made in the accession negotiations.
If such a failure causes or risks causing a serious breach in the functioning of the internal market, the Commission may take appropriate measures to deal with that situation, even before accession, with entry into force upon accession.
It is important to note that this does not require a unanimous Council decision; it requires a Commission decision based on our objective risk assessment of a candidate countryâs possible shortcomings.
It is clear that, in order to have a meaningful system of safeguard clauses, we also need a monitoring mechanism and, in its role as guardian of the treaties, the Commission will assume this duty and will verify the implementation of EU legislation in the two countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank CommissionerÂ Rehn for his reply and to speak essentially about Romania.
Firstly, I would like to say that Romaniaâs progress towards accession is clear, particularly in areas that are of fundamental importance to this House, such as the reform of the judicial system and the fight against corruption.
I can tell you that Romania has listened to what the European Parliament has had to say on these issues.
Romaniaâs efforts must continue, of course, but there is no question that progress has been made in the right direction, as you have just acknowledged, Commissioner.
Passing on to other matters, my personal view is that, if possible, as has been planned for some time, Romania and Bulgaria should find out in June when they will enter the Union, that is, whether it is to happen on 1 January 2007, as we all want to see.
I believe that to further delay a decision on the date of entry would create problems, principally for the countries in question.
I therefore believe that the accession timetable should be set as soon as possible, preferably in June rather than in December, as MrÂ VanÂ Orden said earlier.
Furthermore, if it is confirmed in June that accession can take place in 2007, that should not mean that the Romanian or Bulgarian authorities would then abandon their adaptation and reform efforts.
Furthermore, in your autumn report you will tell us whether it is necessary, as you have just mentioned, to adopt special safeguard measures, in accordance with the accession treaty, in order to deal with any problems, any deficiencies, that may remain in certain sectors.
There has also been discussion of the possibility â and this question is therefore contained in the more general question by MrÂ Brok, MrÂ Moscovici and MrÂ VanÂ Orden â of monitoring during the post-accession stage.
As you have just pointed out, Commissioner, as guardian of the Treaties, it falls to the Commission to carry out the task of control.
Furthermore, the accession treaty provides for specific monitoring, since there are safeguard clauses which can be activated during the first three years.
The coming reports will tell us what you have to say about this monitoring that may be necessary following accession.
In conclusion, these are historic times for Romania and Bulgaria; we shall be completing the fifth accession.
These countries have already suffered delays compared to the other 10 States that entered in 2004.
They now want to prevent any further delays and I believe that we must encourage, support and reward their efforts.
And we will of course study your report in May with great interest, Commissioner.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I listened very carefully to the Commissioner as he answered our questions, and I have to say that those answers were extraordinarily illuminating.
They can be summed up in a single sentence. You answered the questions we put to you by saying that it is too early to give an answer.
Fair enough: we will wait and see what you will have to say in May, but what I would like to tell you is what the Socialist Group in this Parliament wants right now; we want Romania and Bulgaria to be able to become full Member States of the European Union on 1 January 2007.
We make no bones about that being our goal; these two countriesâ governments represent different political camps, with one of them being ruled by our allies and the other by parties of a different political hue, yet we are firmly convinced that both governments â irrespective of their political complexion â are making enormous efforts to do the things that are being required of them.
It is for that reason that I can say today on behalf of our group that, if you believe there to be no enormous obstacles that you would bring to our attention in May; if, then, there is no change in the view you take of the situation, then we are taking it as read that this goal can indeed be achieved, and that the substance of our oral question, namely âwill these states meet the criteria on 31 December 2006?â can be answered with a resounding âyesâ.
If it cannot be, then we will certainly have to debate the matter again, but, as of today, we are working on the assumption that it can be, and that is the message from all the members of our group, the message that my colleague MrÂ PoulÂ NyrupÂ Rasmussen will be giving this House on behalf of the whole family of social democratic parties.
We would like to see both these countries join the European Union, we would like to see them do that because this will be the end of a long drawn-out process.
We would like to see them do that, because they will be welcome in the European Union.
I might add that another reason why we would like to see them do that is that we can see that this process of transformation, while it demands of them enormous efforts, is successful in that it makes them more secure, more stable and more democratic.
No bargains can be struck â we all know that â but we are confident that this process can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, so let me say once more, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that, if the criteria are met, we will welcome these states into the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, assuming that my time is limited, I will launch straight into what I have to say.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have lost count of the number of debates we have devoted to Romania and Bulgaria over the past 12 months.
The large number seems to testify to this Houseâs eagerness to show the EUâs citizens that we share their scepticism and concern about the enlargement.
This debate is ostensibly based on an oral question put to the Commission by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and comprising a number of questions along with direct and/or indirect suggestions.
The text of this oral question has found its way into the Romanian and Bulgarian press and into , and has been the cause of great concern in Romania and Bulgaria.
That is why we have taken the liberty of giving a quite clear response to it even before this debate, but I notice that MrÂ Brok has no interest in my reaction as he has now left the Chamber.
The response I would like to give to this oral question is twofold, in that I would like to cover both the substance and the procedure.
With regard to the procedure, I can only regret once more the fact that neither I nor the group had been consulted about the text.
We would have been able to make it clear that the designation of â and I quote â âa close monitoring systemâ is something we emphatically reject, because for many Members of this House, it smacks too much of Romania and Bulgaria being under guardianship, and hence, of discrimination between the Member States, with which we want nothing to do.
I would add that neither MrÂ Brok, MrÂ Moscovici, nor MrÂ VanÂ Orden have used the words âa close monitoring systemâ; they are only on paper.
In principle, I would repeat what I have said before on behalf of our group during the meeting behind closed doors of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
An overwhelming majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe takes the view that Romania and Bulgaria should be able to accede on 1Â January 2007 and only if there were serious, fact-based shortcomings, would we agree to special safeguard measures being promulgated, which, in our view, cannot be decided upon until the autumn.
Finally, there is something I would ask my fellow MEPs to consider.
It is not a good thing, in the run-up to a debate, to make sceptical noises about the enlargement out of a desire to meet our citizens halfway in their concern, and then to say that we agree to the accession on 1Â January 2007 after all.
We think that too much damage has already been done to the enlargement project.
We therefore hope that all of this will end well and that Commissioner Rehn will suggest the date of 1Â January 2007 to his colleagues, so that we can give that a joyful welcome during the June debate.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the central question in this debate is what is now the best way of ensuring that the reforms, particularly in the area of justice and in the fight against corruption and organised crime, are sustained beyond 2007.
How, in the Commissionâs view, is this best to be guaranteed?
What do we think? Should we keep 2007 as the date, or should we move the accession to 2008 after all?
My group is still as united as ever in its support for further enlargement of the European Union.
If, in future, the Western Balkan countries or Turkey meet the conditions, then, as far as we are concerned, they are most welcome to join.
Nevertheless, if we take that as our starting point, there are two different possible answers to this central question.
There are those in my group who claim that it is precisely because we are so strongly in favour of this enlargement that we should be extra critical and check whether the countries actually meet the conditions at the start of the accession process, so that neither the EU nor its enlargement strategy lose credibility.
If we then look at Romania and Bulgaria, with all the differences that exist between those countries, we have to conclude that, at the moment â and I would make a point of saying this â they do not meet a number of the prescribed conditions, and that we can justifiably be sceptical about whether they will make the grade in eight monthsâ time, on 1 January 2007.
That is why some of my group think it justified that the pressure should be kept on until the very last minute, until 1Â January 2008, in order to guarantee that all countries meet those criteria.
Others in my group, among whom I would include myself, believe that there is a clear difference between Romania and Bulgaria.
Looking back on last year in Bulgaria, we have noticed that reforms are taking place at a superficial level, that implementation is limited, that reforms are being introduced more slowly, and that some vital ones were not carried out until the very last moment.
Looking at Romania, on the other hand, it is evident, not only to us in this House, but also â or so it appears from their reports â to many national and international NGOs and experts, that that rate has gone up and that there is definitely tangible progress, not only on paper but also in practice.
Judges and public prosecutors feel free at long last, free from the burden of political influence.
There are real guarantees of an independent campaign against corruption, and, fortunately, a number of initiatives have been taken in respect of cases of it in high places.
That is why it is also justified to reward this tangible progress in Romania by saying that we abide by the accession date of 2007 but â and I am saying this to MrsÂ Neyts-Uyttebroeck â only provided that there is a strong monitoring mechanism in place, not in the general sense as the Commissioner suggested, but specifically in the areas of justice, reform and the fight against corruption.
It is in that area that we believe it to be necessary to monitor those positive developments even beyond the accession date, and we think that, in the unlikely event of those developments not being sustained, there should be financial implications.
The message we want to send by this to the people of the EU, but also to candidate countries such as Croatia and Turkey, is that if you really try your best to carry out reforms, you will be rewarded for this as a candidate Member State.
If, on the other hand, you believe that the EU will look the other way, you will be penalised.
Â Â  . Mr President, as a representative of two Dutch Protestant parties, I care deeply about the freedom of religion in the candidate countries Romania and Bulgaria, and particularly about the legal position of churches.
In the last quarter, Forum 18 News Service has published a number of reports on this topic which give me cause for great concern about how Bucharest and Sofia are implementing something that is one of the fundamental political Copenhagen criteria.
I should like to know, Commissioner, where you stand on the proposals that are being made in Romania and Bulgaria concerning the mandatory registration of religious societies, which is something to which my Dutch Government is, in line with international standards, opposed.
I do not, in the context of this debate, expect a comprehensive response from you, and so I will give you the Forum 18 documents in a moment.
I would be much obliged if you, in your reports in mid-May, could refer to this topic.
I would make the same request of you in respect of the long-drawn-out issue of the restitution of Hungarian church property illegally confiscated by Romaniaâs Communist government between 1945 and 1989.
According to the information available to me, this involves a total of 2Â 140 church properties, of which the churches are as yet in full possession of only 54.
It would not look very promising, Commissioner, if Romania were to join the EU with this burden from the past distorting its relations with its Hungarian minority.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, once again we face the dilemma â which we have brought upon ourselves â of whether or not we might have to change a scheduled accession date without offending the country â or countries â concerned.
Giving more time to the reform processes that have already begun would, however, be as much in the interests of the EU as of the candidates.
Past experience has taught us that welcoming, out of political â or what are claimed to be political â considerations, a country into a club for which it may well not yet be ready can have devastating consequences.
It is always the public who have to pay the price when the political nomenklatura want to press on towards something for which the time is not yet ripe, and this is something that we have to bear in mind when considering the possibility of enlarging the EU to include Romania and Bulgaria, even though they do, of course, belong to the family of European peoples and must become Member States.
Not only is it questionable whether the Romanian and Bulgarian economies can currently take the strain of accession to the EU, but it is also nothing like clear how the funding required for the first three years â which can potentially run up to EURÂ 24 billion â is to be arranged.
It is possible that we will be left with no other option but to delay this enlargement by a year, or in any case by a certain period of time.
Any other course of action could well send the wrong message to other candidates for accession and would, in the final analysis, be detrimental to the people of Romania and Bulgaria.
Â Â  Mr President, we do not question the timeliness of this accession as we listen to this debate today.
But let me draw your attention, Commissioner, to some important factors when you prepare your report.
One is that, despite the huge steps taken, reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption are still of major concern as regards Romania and Bulgaria.
Dozens of emails and letters inform us that the mere adoption of laws is far from satisfactory in solving the problems or in changing existing practice in this area.
The implementation of these laws and their reflection in everyday reality should also be taken into account by the Commission.
Although it is often questioned whether the situation of minorities is an important factor in this process, their inclusion among the Copenhagen political criteria, as well as the fact that they were monitored during the accession process of the ten previous new Member States, clearly indicates their significance.
Although several problems of the Hungarian minority in Romania were identified in this process and formulated by the Community itself â also reflected in Parliamentâs resolutions and previous Commission reports â they are still left unresolved.
That is the situation, despite the fact that the Hungarian party is part of the ruling coalition.
This is presented as a solution in itself, which is not the case, despite the nice promises made by the government.
In reality, few things have changed and, in any case, far fewer things than expected within the community.
No minority law has been adopted and there are no signs that this will happen in the near future.
Neither the requested necessary institution-building nor developments in mother-tongue higher education have taken place.
I ask you, Commissioner, to include a reference to the unresolved questions that reflect the real, present concerns of one of the largest minorities in Europe with special roots and tradition in this region.
Neglecting these specific concerns, as well as the others regarding the judiciary and corruption, would bring the EUâs credibility into question, both within the acceding countries and within the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, I am not going to repeat the comments made by our rapporteurs, which I fully support, but I would like to come back to ArticleÂ 39 of the Treaty of Accession.
My groupâs opinion has already been stated by our leader Mr Schulz.
During our recent visits to Bulgaria and Romania, we had a great number of meetings â not only with government members and officials but also with opposition members, representatives of trade unions, NGOs, academics, representatives of the business community and the EU Member Statesâ ambassadors â and no one we spoke to came to the conclusion that there is a serious risk of either country being manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership on 1Â January 2007.
As you, Commissioner, have very correctly pointed out in numerous exchanges of views in this House and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Bulgaria has shown continuous progress in all relevant areas, including regional cooperation, modernisation of the Bulgarian police, development of social services, reintegration of persons and minorities, labour and social policy and childcare.
I could go on and on, but let me assure you that in Sofia they have got the message and all the progress that has been made so far or is currently being made has always been progress and always in the right direction.
The Governments of Bulgaria and Romania know that the reforms have to be continued and more progress has to be achieved.
Commissioner, you said in a recent interview that Europeâs borders are defined by values rather than by the geographical guidelines.
You said the values defined the borders.
Well, I fully agree and I strongly believe that Bulgaria and Romania share our values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and their place from 1Â January 2007 should be inside our European Union.
Their borders from 1Â January 2007 should be our borders.
And there the dynamic concept of the EU will move to new borders.
I do not want to repeat what a previous speaker was saying, but I fully share Mrs GÃ¡lâs opinion on the minorities in Romania.
Â Â  Mr President, I see the questions today as pertinent and important, because they reflect the general view that there are still concerns about justice, the rule of law and corruption in the two candidate countries under discussion.
Successive governments in Romania and Bulgaria have made superhuman efforts to comply with the advice and recommendations of the European Union.
Much of this effort is not easy to see by outside observers.
Structural, economic and social reforms are by their very nature unglamorous and not of any interest to the media.
However, in Romania, for example, both the former Nastase government and the current Tariceanu government have shown remarkable commitment to the , as well as playing a steady hand in spite of the cut and thrust of national politics.
Legal reform and the fight against corruption have to be carried through very carefully in order to succeed, so they are always slow to bring results.
If too many high-level politicians are sued it may begin to look like a witch-hunt.
However, in Romania, Minister Monica Macovei, backed up by her Prime Minister and her President against considerable opposition within the system itself, has made dramatic steps.
In my view, to delay accession by one year would bring no real benefit to the European Union, Romania or Bulgaria or to their electorates, as one year is not a significant timeframe in accession terms and no significant reforms at all could be expected in such a short twelve months.
However, it would send a very damaging signal to these two countries, both of which have bent over backwards to accommodate the Unionâs advice and requirements in a spirit of real partnership and openness.
The risk would be to alienate public opinion in these countries against the Union and that would risk us being seen as vacuous and vacillators.
Currently both countries are strongly pro-European Union.
It would be a real shame to risk the high level of trust that those nations have shown â among both the governments and the people â being lost.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to share with the Commissioner a concern I have on the current market situation in Romania by giving him an example.
Last year I visited Rafo, the third biggest oil refining company in the country, and by far the biggest firm in the poor Moldavia province.
The company is trying to overcome major financial problems that have been accumulating since its privatisation in 2001.
Members of its administrative board made me aware of the pressures and obstructions they get from the Romanian Government to continue with the companyâs activities.
Although in July last year a new investor clearly expressed its willingness to clear Rafoâs nominal debt to the Romanian authorities, until now the Government has not shown any interest in this offer.
Moreover, the Governmentâs demand for advanced VAT payments for imported raw materials â which makes Rafo the only company in Romania to have its operation conditional on paying VAT in advance â poses a serious threat to the companyâs viability.
This discriminatory treatment, which is against free market rules and which questions the impartiality of the Romanian Government towards the companies competing in the market, is still maintained in spite of the solvency and serious intentions of the new investors.
Â Â  Mr President, the public in Bulgaria and Romania are pinning great hopes on membership in the European Union.
Commission and Parliament documents about the progress made by the two countries towards accession confirm that both have put a great deal of effort into preparing for membership.
Despite difficulties, they have carried out, and continue to carry out, significant reforms to their political and economic systems.
Recently, though, there has been increasing talk, particularly with regard to Bulgaria, of postponing accession, of vague protection clauses and of âother meansâ.
Bulgaria and Romania are struggling with the legacy of the Communist regime.
Just like the Member States that joined the European Union in May 2004, they have a huge amount of ground to make up in all fields.
This makes it all the more imperative for us to avoid delaying what both countries see as their chance for more rapid development.
We should not divide Europe once again into the better-off and the worse-off.
I am in favour of keeping 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007 as the date for Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that we in this House may well soon be able to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union, for that would mean that that reunification of the European continent â for which we have all been working for many years â would have been successfully accomplished.
I would be even more glad, though, if it were even now clear that all conditions for their accession had been fulfilled and hence that conditions were ideal for these two countries to become Member States of the European Union.
I can, then, do no other than urge CommissionerÂ Rehn to do, as regards the report, what the Commission is required to do in its role as guardian of the treaties, in which capacity it has to ensure that all those things that are agreed are actually done, and to consider whether the period left, which now runs until the end of the year, is sufficient to get those things done that have not yet been.
That is the Commissionâs task, and, having performed it, the accession treaty requires that it draw the necessary conclusions.
In the last few days, I myself have had the opportunity to travel with a delegation to Romania, and I would like to say that what we were able to see and experience both in Bucharest and in other parts of the country was very impressive.
I can do no other than urge all those in positions of political power â not only in Romania, but also in Bulgaria, where recent days have shown that there is some catching up to do where reform is concerned â to maintain their zeal for reform and not, once 16 May dawns, to fold their arms and say that everything has been sorted out.
This is something we have to do together, and we will not be able to unless the process is continued with determination.
Let me conclude by saying one thing, namely that the reason why these reforms have to be carried out in Bulgaria and Romania is not in order that these countries might pass muster in the eyes of Commissioner Rehn or of the European Union; on the contrary, they are necessary in order that their peoples may live in countries in which they may be certain of the lawâs protection, with their interests served by stable and democratic institutions.
If that is understood, then we will be on the right track.
Â Â  Mr President, even though the Commissioner may struggle to answer a number of questions because he is still working through some of the issues, I am convinced that he has grasped the importance of those questions and the fact that we expect the answers by 16 May.
As my group chairman has already said, we assume, hope, and expect that both the countries under discussion today will be able to join on 1Â January of next year.
This is something we have always said, and we also believe that we should not create an atmosphere of competition between Romania and Bulgaria. That is not what this is about at all.
Whilst we should discuss what is yet to be done, we must also, and above all, take stock of what has been achieved so far.
Over the past few years, it has been our constant refrain that both countries still had a lot to get done; now, we can look back and say that both of them have achieved a great deal.
There is also a little coda to this, on which the Commissioner will be reporting in a few weeksâ time.
As my colleague has already stated, we, as a group, did the same thing that MrÂ Ferber has apparently done and launched our own monitoring initiative.
We went to Bulgaria and Romania, and noticed that much progress has been made in both countries.
In all talks, we get the strong impression that both governments, including the Bulgarian Government, recognise what is yet to be done.
I am convinced that the talks that are still underway about a number of problems will reach a successful conclusion.
That is why I am optimistic about the outcome on 16Â May.
We also insist that the Council, in June, should base its decision on Commissionâs proposals and Parliamentâs verdict.
I think â as do many others â that there are a number of areas in which work will continue until the end of the year, that the pressure should be kept on in terms of the process and that we cannot indeed rule out a time when a number of safeguard clauses will need to be put in place, although I would urge both Romania and Bulgaria to do everything in their power to avoid this.
In the final analysis, what matters most to us in the assessment after 16Â May is what the Commissioner said on 3Â April, namely that we can postpone the debate only if it turns out that one of the two countries is clearly unprepared in one or more areas.
I assume that this conclusion, that those words, will not be used in the Commissionerâs reports, but we will have to wait and see.
Finally, if you will allow me to comment on the Commissionerâs opening remark, I should like to draw your attention once again to the floods, particularly in Romania, but also in Bulgaria, and appeal to the Commission to make every effort in order to help those two countries, along with Serbia, and also to examine what can be done to prevent such disasters from striking in future.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I can tell Mr Schulz that, in the âother countryâ the political hue of whose government he seems to be unable to recall, it is the Liberals who are in power.
It may be difficult for a German social democrat to imagine, but there are such things in Europe as Liberal Prime Ministers â there are, indeed, several of them.
Ladies and gentlemen, as has already been made clear by MrsÂ Neyts-Uyttebroeck and Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, we Liberals want Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union, and they will do that on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007, subject to all the national parliaments ratifying the accession treaty, which is what it currently appears likely that they will do.
Not everything, of course, is as yet exactly as it should be, and much remains to be done.
What representatives of the Bulgarian Government have to say about the attitude of the countryâs justice system to reform is contradicted by what is reported by German judges who have been there, and it is for that reason that I myself think it right that the Commission should give serious consideration to whether sensitive areas such as justice, the economy, and the internal market need to be monitored, and report back on the subject either in May or in the autumn.
When our counterparts in the national parliaments vote on the accession of the two candidate countries, many of them will be able to rely on the latest report from the Commission, but we voted at a time when it looked as if Bulgaria was outstripping Romania in the reform stakes.
What has happened since then is evidence of the unsurprising fact that we do not possess the gift of prophecy, and so we should not act as if we did.
What we must do in the case of future enlargements is to take care that we vote on them close to the date of accession rather than a year and a half beforehand, and I want to make it clear that that is our fault and not the fault of the candidates for accession.
Secondly, the Commission cannot recommend that an accession be delayed; so it says in todayâs , and the newspaper is right, for what would happen if its recommendation, for want of a few votes in the Council, was not complied with?
There would be two countries sitting in the Council, a majority of which would previously have been against either of them being present at all.
No, that is not on, and it shows that Article 39, the treatyâs deferment clause, is, in the final analysis, toothless.
That Bulgaria and Romania will accede is not a matter of doubt; both countries have achieved a great deal.
We, too, though, have much left to do in order to improve our enlargement policy, and I would like to add that I am very glad that we are having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  â Mr President, to all those worried and talking about incentives and criteria, I wish to say that there is no need to worry.
Our 'transatlantic friend' has taken steps to ensure that both Romania and Bulgaria will accede to the European Union on time.
To tell the truth, the driver of the European vehicle is sitting in the back seat.
Bulgaria was the first country to support the United States of America in the war in Iraq and now it is again the first country willing to take part in the new venture that leads to Iran.
Let us look at the parallel consequences:
- firstly, the poorer areas of the countries of Europe covered by the Cohesion Fund today will not be covered tomorrow because another two poor countries will join it.
Tell your voters in southern Italy, in France, in Ireland, in Portugal and in Spain that there will be no more money and that they will not be entitled to money from the Cohesion Fund;
- secondly, if a Polish plumber travelled thousands of kilometres to get work in Paris, a Bulgarian plumber, farmer or worker will travel just 15 kilometres.
So protect Greek workers who have been living within the framework of Europe for 25 years and will lose their jobs.
Â Â  Mr President, as a member of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee I congratulate the Commission and the Romanian Government on their continued cooperation in moving close to preparedness for full accession.
I believe every effort should continue to be made, because any deferment, any delay, would have a serious negative impact on public opinion in the acceding state and only encourage those interests most opposed to reform.
There is, however, one area in which the Commission should maintain its vigilance, and that concerns provision of care for orphans.
It is the experience of many charities working in the field that they remain hampered by the failure to enact and implement envisaged legislation which would allow the Government and the charities to enter into contractual relations, thereby permitting the charities to receive matching funds.
It is also the case that the charities are receiving different advice from government inspectors about the provision of services and the necessary technical standards of equipment from that which pertains in state orphanages.
Would the Commissioner impress upon the Romanian Government the continuing need to improve the provision of care for orphans?
Would he emphasise the need to enact the envisaged legislation, enabling charities to have proper contracts with the government and allowing them to have financial support?
In the context of achieving the successful future enlargement of the EU it is essential that humanitarian conditions play a central role in the continued cooperation between the Commission and the acceding states.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to start by extending warm thanks to the Commission for keeping so consistently to a clear line, and for the pressure it, together with this House, has brought to bear, to which pressure alone is attributable our success in getting major changes made in Romania and Bulgaria.
Having visited both countries, I do think that both governments and both parliaments have made significant changes in this respect, and it is this pressure that has induced them to make them.
I think it is simply human rather than something negative for us to give thought to in which areas we should, once the decision is taken â which, it is to be hoped, will favour 2007 â to some extent monitor and exert a certain amount of pressure.
It is the NGOs in both countries that are constantly recommending that we combine a decision in favour of 2007 with â where necessary â ongoing monitoring processes.
This would prevent any âsecond-class memberâ situation arising, for monitoring of this sort has been done in the past; it is going on even now in some areas, and it is also necessary.
There is one other consideration I would like to add; you, Commissioner, have constantly taken a more critical line on Bulgaria, and have indeed done so just now.
Now it may be that the earlier negative assessment of Romania has put that country under greater pressure, but, having discussed this yesterday with the Romanian minister of justice, I would like to point out that neither the number of MPs whose parliamentary immunity is suspended nor the number of them who are charged can be taken as evidence of a country getting better or worse.
What I believe matters is substance, that proceedings should be embarked on where there is real reason to do so, and I do believe that Bulgaria, like Romania, is endeavouring to make charges stick and take hard-hitting action where corruption is to be found.
As we have seen from various peer reviews, too, opinions can differ as to which reform is the right one.
I agree with you that we have to ensure that the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed in both countries, while at the same time pressing the justice system to speed up proceedings, and I am in complete agreement with what MrÂ Schulz said: âWe want it to be possible for both countries to accede in 2007, for that would be, for all of us, the greatest possible success.â
Â Â  Mr President, âwider still and wider shall thy bounds be setâ.
This is not a European Union any more.
What you are all after is a European empire, is it not?
It does not matter whether they reform or not, they are joining â the political decision has been made already.
I was one of only three British MEPs â all UKIP of course â that opposed the last wave of enlargement.
Free movement of goods and services between countries with vastly differing levels of wealth is a plain different thing to the free movement of peoples.
We have had over a third of a million people move into Britain from countries like Poland in the last 20 months, and when Bulgaria and Romania join there will be another flood of migrants into Britain.
It is not just bad for Britain: it will be bad for Bulgaria and Romania because their brightest and best young people will be lured away by money.
It is bad for us.
It is bad for them.
In fact the whole project looks like madness.
Â Â  â Mr President, we all know that the issue is not whether or not Romania and Bulgaria are able to become Member States of the European Union; that has been decided, and we look forward to their accessions.
What is at issue, though, is the application of the Treaty and whether or not the postponement clause can be used, and hence the credibility not only of our enlargement policy but also of the European Union itself.
Does the European Union meet its own requirements and conditions?
You, Commissioner, stressed that justice and home affairs are at the heart of the assessment, and told the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs that there had been much progress, but that there were still serious deficiencies.
You said â with specific reference to Bulgaria â that the independence of judges was not guaranteed, and that, while the first steps to combat corruption had been taken, nobody was being sentenced for it; that not enough was yet being done to combat organised crime and that trafficking in human beings was a problem.
I have to tell you, Commissioner, that, if all these problems can actually be sorted out, then I will be all in favour of both states acceding in 2007, but if the Commissionâs report, presented to us as the fruit of close scrutiny, confirms the presence of deficiencies that cannot be remedied, then we should consider the possibility of allowing these countries still more time in order to enable them to actually meet the conditions for accession.
The fact is that, if there are serious deficits in justice and home affairs, and we still do not avail ourselves of the options contained in the accession treaty â by which I mean the application of the postponement clause â then I am persuaded that that gives the wrong impression of what the enlargement process is about, and both the enlargement policy and the European Union as a whole would have lost all credibility.
I take it, then, that you, Commissioner, are aware of what your responsibility is when you draft the report and present the conclusions to Parliament in May.
Â Â  Mr President, as one who was in Copenhagen when we formulated the Copenhagen criteria in 1993, I have one opening wish to express to the Commissioner: that we do not make any new claims to Bulgaria and Romania compared to the ones we always have based our enlargement politics upon.
No new claims, no extra demands, but exactly the same claims and demands as we have asked from all our Member countries, I take that for granted.
Secondly, as our group chairman Mr Schulz said today, it is our common feeling that we have passed that critical mass where we can say that Romania and Bulgaria are capable now to come into the European Union.
They are not perfect in all aspects.
There are still problems ahead â you have mentioned some of them and we have mentioned some of them, but our common judgement is that we are on the road, the direction is there.
To tell you the truth, as you know Commissioner, I can still see corruption problems in some of the existing Member countries within the European Union.
Even in my own country I can see some types of crime which we can see also in other existing Member countries.
So please, Commissioner, do not make your judgement â and I know you will not, but I am just saying it â based on the number of cases in Bulgaria or Romania.
It is about direction, reform, legislation and decisiveness to implement.
I can assure you that both in Bulgaria and Romania immunity has been now moved away as an obstacle for bringing cases against Members of the Parliament or other personalities within the societies.
That is very important.
Finally, as President of the European Socialist Party, I should like to point out that I totally agree with my group colleagues Mr Schulz and Mr Swoboda.
We find that it is best to take the two countries in now.
Over the next few months â until November and then the European Council meeting in December â we should look into how and whether we should formulate some transitional claims at the top of membership as of 1Â January.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner has received a great deal of advice today, so I am not going to repeat anything other than the fact that we all hope that Romania and Bulgaria will meet the criteria and join the European Union.
I have spoken on one specific issue at each of these debates and I do so again, and that is the case of abandoned babies and children in care in Romania.
I know that great progress has been made there.
I have seen some progress.
There are new laws in place.
We need to make sure that the laws are fully implemented so that the children abandoned and in care receive the proper treatment they deserve.
Unfortunately, we still have a debate about children who are apparently trapped, waiting for adoption out of Romania.
I know that there is a ban in place and I would ask the Commission to give us the decisive view on this, because we have received conflicting information from both sides of this debate.
I think our care for the children involved is central to it, and that must be the beginning and the end of this debate.
My view concerning Romania and Bulgaria â particularly Romania â is that membership of the European Union would be good for those children who find themselves abandoned or in care.
Within the European Union these issues will continue to be raised and progress will be made.
I am glad that we are having this debate today if only to raise this issue again.
I would ask you, Commissioner, because the Commission has observers there, to give us accurate information on what is happening in relation to the numbers of abandoned babies.
What is happening to them?
Is there proper fostering in place and are there pending cases still unresolved?
Â Â  â Mr President, the European Commission has the institutional and political responsibility to submit the most objective and fair progress reports possible on 16Â May, without compromise and on the basis of its own political and economic criteria, as with the other candidate countries.
Bulgaria and Romania â and this needs to be highlighted â have made significant progress and have carried out important political and economic reforms.
That is why they cannot be taken hostage either to the present institutional crisis in the European Union or to the fact that certain European countries dispute the enlargement strategy.
Today, in our debate in plenary, we must emphasise that our fixed objective is still for Bulgaria and Romania to accede on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
Commissioner, I should like to highlight in particular a question which is a sensitive issue and cause of concern to European citizens and Greek citizens: it is the question of environmental protection and nuclear safety, mainly on the part of Bulgaria, on the basis of plans to construct new nuclear reactors in our neighbouring country, Bulgaria.
I believe that respect for and the application of the in the field of nuclear safety must be the European Commission's basic priority in the forthcoming period.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me first of all thank you for this very substantive, serious and responsible debate.
In my view there is lots of common ground for such a Commission recommendation on 16Â May that complies with Parliamentâs views that I have heard today.
I will not be able to respond to all your questions now; I have done so on numerous occasions in the last couple of weeks and months, both orally and in written form.
I am glad to continue to respond to your letters concerning Bulgaria and Romania and the progress made in these two countries.
Let me just sum up the view and position of the Commission as regards the accession date and conditions regarding Bulgaria and Romania.
My goal is that both countries could join in January 2007.
However, my duty is to ensure that when they join, they truly meet the criteria and join as fully prepared members of the European Union.
In that regard, the jury is still out, at least until 16Â May.
I want to add that safeguard clauses and continued monitoring can address certain sectoral shortcomings if need be.
We will also outline this in May and, if necessary, specify in greater detail in our October progress report.
However, at the same time let me underline that the real critical task for both countries is not to lose any momentum as regards the reforms and their implementation.
The essential yardstick will be the progress both countries can still make as regards the reform of the judiciary and their fight against corruption and crime.
I fully agree with those who say that this is not a quantitative matter, but the critical thing is that there needs to be a critical mass moving the reforms further so that they become irreversible.
For that we need to have clear proof that the structural conditions to fight corruption and organised crime are in place in both countries, because these issues underpin society and the economy in their entirety.
In conclusion I can assure you that the Commission shall present a fully objective and balanced assessment on 16th May and I can assure you that we make a proposal for a carefully calibrated decision that will maintain the momentum of essential reforms and their implementation on the ground up to and beyond the accession of the two countries.
That is our task as the guardian of the Treaties and for this I will ask for your support on 16th May and in the coming debate following that report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Commissioner Rehnâs speech on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU is a source of hope to me.
I would like to stress that the Polish Parliament voted almost unanimously in favour of accepting these countries into the EU, with only one vote against.
This is because we believe that expanding the Union to include new countries will on one hand be an expression of solidarity among European countries, while on the other hand creating new opportunities and prospects for both the new countries and the whole of the Community.
I would be delighted if the remaining countries were able to offer this expression of European solidarity in the same way as Poland.
It is to be welcomed that the Commission lays down strict requirements for candidate countries, in this way encouraging them to implement efficiently the reforms that still need to be carried out.
I hope, though, that the Commission will be equally active in encouraging EU Member States to be as open as possible to Romania and Bulgaria when it comes to implementing the freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and renouncing long derogation periods with regard to the labour market, for example.
If we set a high level of obligations, we must also allow new countries to benefit in full, and as soon as possible, from the rights to which they are entitled on the basis of the Treaties.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the suspension of aid to the Palestinian authority.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has a long tradition of solidarity with the Palestinian people, as have all its institutions, not least this House.
In the past, we were always agreed on the basis and the principles by which this solidarity with the Palestinian people â and the European Unionâs Middle East policy itself â were determined.
They were founded upon the right of Israel to exist within secured and recognised borders, and on the Palestinian peopleâs right of self-determination.
What has become known as the Oslo process, and the Roadmap, have begun to give this right of self-determination practical shape in the form of a independent Palestinian state coexisting side by side with Israel.
The European Union, then, is firmly committed to the two-state solution, and to these principles all its policy measures, and all the support that the European Union gives, were made subservient.
These principles continue to apply, and the Council takes the view that the peace process can succeed only if it is conducted in harmony with them.
Let me go through them again.
There must, first of all, be a clear renunciation of every form of violence as a solution to the conflict, with, in its place, a process of thorough negotiation.
Secondly, there must be an acknowledgement of Israelâs right to exist, and also, finally, of the undertakings on the basis of the existing agreement, including the Roadmap.
It is by these principles that the Councilâs Middle East policy is guided, and it is for that reason that the European Union will continue to support the peace policy adopted by the Palestinian President, Mr Abbas, who was directly, and with a large majority, elected by the people.
The Council has very carefully monitored what has been happening in the Middle East over recent months.
We did of course hope that a newly-elected Palestinian government would be guided by the principles I have enumerated, and the Council observed very closely to what degree there was any perceptible movement in this direction.
Today, though, it is an unfortunate fact that we cannot find any evidence of the Hamas Government giving any indication of being prepared to accept without reservation this basis for support from the European Union, and nor was its response to the suicide bombing in Tel Aviv at the beginning of last week an encouraging sign.
At the same time, though, the Council does have an interest in the continuation of support for the Palestinian people and their basic needs.
The Councilâs policy â and the Commissionâs, too â must be determined by the tension between, on the one hand, the Palestinian peopleâs election of a government that is not founded upon the principles that the European Union regards as binding, and, on the other, our striving not to abandon them.
I would like to make it clear that the Commission has acted very responsibly in this regard by taking the precautionary measure of suspending payments and the provision of technical assistance to the Palestinian Government until such time as a final decision is taken.
The last time the foreign ministers of the European Union met in Council, they reached agreement â after very serious and thorough debate â that, while direct payments to the Palestinian Authority were to be suspended indefinitely, at the same time, the attempt would be made to maintain the provision of aid via non-governmental and international organisations in order that the basic needs of the Palestinian people, not least in health and education, might continue to be met.
The major donors â and the EU continues to give more than any of them â will continue to attempt to maintain the supply of aid without funds having to go straight to Palestinian Government institutions, so no funds will go directly to the government or be distributed by it.
The World Bank, too, has carried out a study examining the effects not only of reduced aid provision but also, and primarily, of the Israeli Governmentâs retention of Palestinian customs and tax revenue.
The Council has, in terms that admit of no misunderstanding, demanded of the Israeli Government that it should take action to improve the Palestiniansâ humanitarian and economic situation, and in particular that it should remit to the Palestinian authority the customs and tax revenue that constitute that bodyâs principal source of income.
We must of course ask ourselves whether there is any alternative to this policy.
It is our belief that, given the fact that Hamas is an organisation that is on the list of terrorist organisations and gives no indication of any tendency to acknowledge the fundamental principles to which I have referred, the European Union has no choice but to adopt a policy of suspending direct payments to this government, although it is to be hoped that this will be only a temporary measure.
It will remain a priority that the new Palestinian Government should share with us the fundamental principles that are indispensable to the success of the peace process.
A two-state solution without a Palestinian Authority functioning on a democratic basis is by its very nature unthinkable, and so we must hope that the Palestinian government will be guided, both in the medium and longer term, by these principles, and must work, and send out clear signals, to that end.


It is also important that the European Union should maintain a common front with the international community; the Middle East quartet plays a vitally important part in this, and it is important that we, in our dealings with the Palestinian Government and people, should all be saying the same things, and saying them clearly.
Â Â  . Mr President, President-in-Office, the election victory of Hamas in January presented the European Union with a totally new situation.
We supported the Palestinian elections and we also, I have to say, respect the outcome.
But the heart of the matter is indeed the emergence of a Palestinian Authority whose government is led by members of an organisation included in the EU terrorist list, and that continues to this day to attempt also to justify, for instance, suicide bombings in Israel.
In January, the Council and the Quartet set out clear principles â that have just been mentioned again â for continued engagement with the Palestinian Authority.
I am the first to regret that the new government has so far refused to renounce violence, recognise the right of Israel to exist and accept existing agreements.
These principles are indeed the expression of a commitment to work, as we said, for peace by peaceful means.
They are not new: they have underpinned our cooperation with the Palestinians for many years.
As a result, the Council, meeting two weeks ago as was just mentioned, endorsed the decision of the Commission to temporarily put on hold assistance to or through the Palestinian Government and its ministries.
The Commissionâs action is a precautionary measure taken to ensure that no Community funds pass into the hands of Hamas.
We have taken it pending the possible evolution of the Palestinian Authority position and a definitive decision by the Council on relations with the Palestinian Authority.
It is not a definite decision: we are currently reviewing our projects involving payments to or through the Palestinian Authority to see whether we can find alternative solutions.
My services have already held a meeting for instance with the office of President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss implementing some of those projects, for instance through the office of the President.
I want to make very clear what this means.
We have suspended payments going, as was said, to the Palestinian Government, but we have not suspended aid to the Palestinian people.
On the contrary, since the beginning of this year, we have stepped up our aid to the Palestinians.
On 27Â February, I announced a EURÂ 120Â million package of aid, including help for refugees and help with fuel bills.
This means that we committed almost half of our normal yearâs budget in only two months.
EURÂ 100Â million of this has already been paid: five times more than we paid for the same period in 2005.
This represents an acceleration of our aid to the Palestinian people, not a suspension of aid to the people.
The Commission is all too aware that the economic, social and humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories is unfortunately getting worse.
I have seen the reports from the visits that some Members made to the region in the last few days, and I know you share our deep concern.
We will also come forward with further measures to help the population, but we must also be clear on one point: the key to preventing a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories lies with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, not with the international community.
I have heard some people say that Europe has been paying the salaries of the Palestinian Authority.
This is just not true.
Our support to the Palestinian Authority budget in the past has been linked to reform.
At most it has covered less than 10% of the salary bill.
The real question is that of Israel withholding Palestinian customs and tax revenues.
These are Palestinian taxes which people have already paid.
Withholding them means that basic services will not be delivered, salaries cannot be paid and families will suffer.
Israel has also increased the closures of territory in the West Bank and into and out of Gaza.
Addressing these problems will do more to help the Palestinian people than any measure the EU can take.
All of us in the international community have to intensify our diplomatic efforts with Israel on these two issues.
On the Palestinian side, President Abbas has indeed a key role to play, including in negotiating with Israel.
We are looking at how we might best support his Office, but we are not in the business of parallel structures.
Rather, we are looking with other donors at the possibility of establishing an international supervision mechanism that could facilitate the control of funds for donors to meet needs, for instance in the health and education sectors.
The Quartet meeting on 9Â May is an opportunity for the international community to address this question, as well as measures Israel could take to ease the humanitarian situation.
I wish to conclude by stressing our wish to see an evolution of the positions taken by the Government of the Palestinian Authority, not its failure.
In this way we are looking to address the contradiction between the positions currently espoused by members of the new Palestinian Government and by Hamas as an organisation and the EU objective of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Israel living side-by-side and at peace with a future Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders.
Â Â  . Mr President, following the statements by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and by the Commission, and following the results of the Palestinian elections, to which MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner has referred, it is clear that a political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis, an economic collapse, is brewing.
There is even talk of the possibility of a civil war, which we hope will not materialise.
In any event, as MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner pointed out, we are clearly dealing with a double contradiction: an internal contradiction from the European Union's point of view, because it is not possible for the European Union to include the party that has won the elections on its list of terrorist organisations and, on the other, to make a financial contribution from the Community budget to an organisation that does not renounce violence.
There is also an external aspect to this problem: the international community, Mr President, must be united in its rejection of terrorism and of violence.
I believe that this Parliament must support the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.
We must be forthright in defence of our principles; we must try to channel the aid via the President of the Palestinian National Authority; we must try to ensure that the Palestinian people do not suffer, as MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner has stressed, and we must continue to provide aid for fundamentally humanitarian reasons.
MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner has also said that nobody has helped the Palestinian people as much as the European Union.
And that is absolutely the case, because of every 100 dollars spent on this peace process, 60 have been provided by the European Union.
Mr President, we cannot carry on helping the Palestinian people if their government does not help them, if it does not reject terrorism entirely and for good, if it does not renounce violence and if it does not recognise the State of Israel and the agreements that have been reached between the Palestinian National Authority and the other party in the peace process.
Aid must be conditional upon these things, Mr President, and I believe that we in this Parliament must fully support the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, whose position is more than reasonable.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, I confess to having doubts about the way in which EU policy is shaping up in the difficult situation in the Middle East.
I am worried about the fact that the decisions made by the Council are liable not to facilitate even a gradual transformation of an objectively difficult situation; I am worried about the risk of further radicalisation that may result from the desperation in Palestine.
I am not disputing the fact that the requests directed by the Union to the new government in Palestine are fair; it is the means used for this purpose that puzzle me: the Palestinian people must be able to count on our full economic, political and moral support.
You say that you want to continue to guarantee the provision not only of emergency aid, but also of education and healthcare.
I do not understand how this can be done if the administration is completely excluded.
We also need to pay a great deal of attention to the delicate â and I stress the word delicate â relationship between the presidency and the government in Palestine.
I will conclude by making three suggestions:
- we should work towards consolidating Hamasâ decision to call a truce, a decision that has also been confirmed;
- we should work towards developing, and devolving responsibility to, all of the actors involved in the Palestinian political framework, even with a change in the government in prospect, and propose to both of the negotiating parties that they acknowledge the agreements and the road map;
- we should work towards achieving a new chapter of mutual legitimisation with the prospect of a definitive solution in mind.
In this context, we can only confirm our opposition to any unilateral initiative that might jeopardise the possibility of finding a solution to unresolved issues such as that relating to borders, up to and including the status of Jerusalem.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are in a catch-22 situation.
We supported democratic elections in Palestine and ended up with a government run by a movement which figures on our list of international terrorists.
Continuing financial aid to the Hamas-led government would lend support to a regime which denies the right of its neighbour to exist; stopping financial support renders the Palestinian State unviable, puts the jobs of 140Â 000 public servants at risk and ultimately adds to tension.
All political groups in this House are divided about what we should do.
Mine is no exception.
We supported the Palestinian Authority with USDÂ 600Â million a year because we wanted to influence the peace process.
If we do not, others will.
Hamas needs USDÂ 170Â million a month to pay its wage bill.
Iran said ten days ago that it will give 50Â million; on Saturday Russia offered help; the Gulf countries have promised some 80Â million.
By contrast, Israel is holding back tax revenue which belongs to the Palestinians and the US Treasury tightened the screws on Palestinian cash this week when it banned American nationals from doing business with the first democratically elected Palestinian Authority.
What message is the European Union sending by stopping aid to the Palestinians?
The Council wants to stress that aid is conditional on an explicit political commitment.
The answer that a delegation from this House was given by moderate Palestinians and by EU officials working there was that we are perceived to punish Palestinians for electing a Hamas-led government.
President-in-Office, Commissioner, people read the headlines, they do not always read the details.
And you know from your own country that an opposition party, once it gets into government, does not always do the things it said it would when it was in opposition.
Mr President, Liberals and Democrats urge Hamas to recognise the right of Israel to exist; they must recognise that being a democratically elected government brings responsibilities.
However, we must understand their perception as settlement after settlement is built on the West Bank that Israel denies their right to enjoy a viable State.
The longer we delay recognition of that government, the longer ordinary Palestinians will suffer and the longer Israeli's will continue to live in fear in insecurity.
It is incumbent on us all to create a new dynamic in the Middle East, taking advantage in the change in the protagonists.
Hamas must be made to acknowledge that they will get no quarter from the international community until they renounce violence, recognise Israel and recognise the commitments to the Roadmap.
Israel must be told that its policy of settlement outwith its borders must stop and that parts of its wall must come down.
Officially Hamas's ceasefire is unbroken although there are those who would wish to have it otherwise.
As long as that ceasefire holds there is hope of bringing the two sides together again for dialogue and negotiation.
Let us, the European Union take the initiative, not leave it to countries like Iran.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the situation in Palestine is very tense.
The population has been hit by a brutal blockade, because they have chosen people the West does not like.
Now they are isolated behind Israelâs dividing wall, with no ability to create a healthy economy for themselves.
The only people to gain from what is now happening are the extremists.
There is, in actual fact, an imminent danger of everything exploding.
I was one of seven Members of Parliamentâs five large groups who visited the area two weeks ago and had meetings with representatives of all the parties in the Palestinian Parliament, including Change and Reform, which is Hamasâs parliamentary wing.
It became clear that they recognise the pre-1967 borders and, therefore, Israel.
Hamas has now, for 18 months, refrained from using serious violence against Israel, while Israel has systematically bombarded Gaza and frequently killed civilians, including children.
Hamas has not set its face against the PLO sticking to the negotiating policy it has adopted.
If the EU really wished to do so, it would not, in short, be difficult for it to find means of cooperating with the Palestinian authorities so that peaceful development might be strengthened and Hamas made more democratic.
That is not, however, what we are doing.
Moreover, we accept a situation in which Israel sets aside all of the EUâs conditions.
The EUâs and the United Statesâs double standard is all too apparent.
Why should Israel not recognise Palestine and the pre-1967 borders?
Why should they not respect the ruling given by the Court of Justice in The Hague and remove the illegal wall?
Why should they not call a halt to the annexation of East Jerusalem?
In defiance of the so-called roadmap etc, they are now putting up buildings in E1.
Why should they not pay the Palestiniansâ own money back, that is to say all the money that they are illegally withholding?
MrÂ Solana has said that they ought to do so.
MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner has also now said very clearly that they should do so.
They are not doing so, however, and absolutely nothing is happening.
Lawlessness is on the increase, and it is our, that is to say the EUâs, responsibility because we allow Israel blithely to ignore all the agreements.
When we meet the Palestinians, it is, however, impossible to explain the double standard we have got used to exercising in relation to Israel.
They cannot understand this approach, our employment of which is perhaps the absolutely most dangerous thing we are doing at the moment.
It is not our money dealings but our unsustainable double standard that is the problem.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, between Jerusalem and Maleh Adumin, an occupied territory since 1967, work has begun â today I believe â on building an Israeli police station, which has been paid for by the nationalist right with funds from a nationalist group.
In return, an old police station located in Ras Al-Amud, in the centre of the Arab quarter of East Jerusalem, will be handed over.
Between 13 and 15 April, young people were killed, bombings took place in Gaza, 41 Palestinians were wounded and 10 homes were occupied by soldiers.
I did not compile this list myself, it arrives every day, on a daily basis, from the European Commission in Jerusalem.
There is nothing stopping anyone from knowing about it or looking at it.
In Gaza, the people are being bombed and starved, as you are only too well aware.
In Gaza, the agreements that were made between the European Union and the Quartet in relation to Rafah and the Tul Karm crossing point to Rafah can be enforced by the European Union.
The Tul Karm crossing point is closed, and the issue is not just a humanitarian one, and it is not just a matter of the Palestinians inside Gaza starving: the problem is one of freedom and democracy.
We must ask ourselves a question and then revert the terms.
What should we be asking?
We should not only be politely asking the Israeli Government to pay back customs monies, which were well and truly stolen, or to stop building the illegal wall.
We must push the Israeli Government, not just ask it to do something.
We are continuing to demand, and rightly so in my view, that Hamas, for example, denounces violence, but we must also set store by the fact that Hamas has not carried out any violence for 18 months now and says that it wants to continue like that.
We have made demands, and Hamas has rejected them; but have we spoken to Hamas?
Have any of you spoken to Hamas?
They told us, the ones who went to Palestine, that we had not.
No one has tried to talk to Hamas!
It is really crucial that we do not appear as though we are collectively punishing the Palestinian population.
For although projects have merely been suspended, the fact is that they are at a standstill.
The European Commission in East Jerusalem has indicated that it will stop some project or other; it is the Palestinian population, not Hamas, that will suffer.
Basically, the Palestinians, like us, are divided: 235Â 000 people voted for Hamas and 213Â 000 for Al-Fatah and other parties.
We must have the courage to admit the extent to which we are responsible for a policy that will come to nothing in the Middle East if we do not treat Israel and Palestine in the same way.
It is really essential that we negotiate, just as many Israelis are saying, so let us also listen to those voices in Israel that are pleading for us to negotiate.
Let us try to understand what is happening in the Israeli Government: if a person such as MrÂ Liebermann, a racist and xenophobe, assumes power, what will we say?
The European Union really can say and do more, if we are serious about having two peoples and two States, instead of what is happening now: one State that exists and another one that does not exist and is being constantly eroded.
Â Â  .
Mr President, my party, the UK Independence Party, constantly criticises the European Union, so it makes a pleasant change for me at least partially to be able to support the Commissionâs decision to suspend funding to the Palestinian Authority.
The Palestinian people have made the sad decision to elect Hamas, a terrorist front organisation, to government; they now have to live with the consequences of that decision.
The spending of taxpayersâ money in Palestine by the European Union has long been a scandal in that these monies have never been fully accounted for and have almost certainly found their way into terrorist pockets.
The Palestinian people as such may be a deserving case for humanitarian aid, but such aid should not come from the European Union, whose own accounts have not been signed off by its own auditors for 11Â consecutive years.
The spending of international aid should be returned to national states.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the most difficult situations in which we have ever found ourselves, for what is being done here is wrong.
It is unthinkable that taxpayersâ money should be handed straight over to an authority, a sort of government, that does not renounce violence and is opposed to another stateâs right to exist being recognised.
It is for that reason that it is unthinkable that they should be given the money, although we do know, on the other hand, that there are others who will stand in our stead and gain influence, and that is not a particularly good outcome.
The only way of getting policy right in this area is to welcome the suspension of payments to the authority, while at the same time finding ways in which we may help the population directly, but this aid must have a high degree of visibility, so that the people on the ground see us as supporters of social and humanitarian processes, and so that it dawns on the population that opting for peace is worth it, for it is peace that most Palestinians â like most Israelis â want.
They have had enough of violence and want to live together peaceably in two viable states, whose continued existence in the region is guaranteed.
It is with this in mind that we must continue to explore the ways in which another legitimate authority in the Palestinian sphere, namely President Abbas, can be helpful and what room for manoeuvre he possesses, for he â in exactly the same way as the Palestinian parliament â was directly elected by the people and possesses a democratic legitimacy of his own.
He has renounced violence; he has recognised the State of Israelâs right to exist, and the Commission must consider in what ways this might be given shape in terms of actions and support.
These two possibilities are alternatives to paying the money to the Hamas-run Palestinian Authority, which has responded to the suicide bombing by making appalling statements, while the Israeli Prime Minister MrÂ Olmert has been measured in his words.
I hope that the process may be set in motion by the continued use of well-judged language on our side too, and also wish to thank the presidency for its evident efforts at guiding the process down this path.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have only one question to ask today and I am going to get straight to the point.
I am not going to ask you what you are going to do now, but why you have done it now.
What is the logic I am not talking about the justification but, rather, of the logic behind a decision that has immediately led to a resumption of violence, including the tragic bombing in Tel Aviv which produced ten victims and which constitutes a breach of Hamasâ truce; a decision that has led to the outbreak of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and in the West Bank, with no alternative plan ready to be brought into operation; to Palestineâs swing towards Iran at the very time when the breakdown of negotiations on nuclear power with that country has us fearing the worst; and, finally, to the political weakening of Mahmoud Abbas who, if we support him too openly, is in danger of looking like a puppet operated by the West?
If, in short, elections were to take place tomorrow, I fear that it would no longer be 44% of the votes that Hamas would gain, but perhaps 70%.
That is very serious.
Some Members here, and I am one of them, made a bet that Hamas would embark upon a course of political resistance if given the time to do so.
That is an absurd bet, but the history of terrorist movements shows that there is good reason for such absurdity.
What is the reason, then, for a brutal decision that has had incalculable political consequences?
Palestine is on the brink of civil war, the public services are collapsing and European policy has the image of sticking like a piece of chewing gum to US policy.
People had better not say to us that their patience was exhausted, that Hamas had been warned and that humanitarian aid will continue to be granted.
The enormity of this decision warrants more plausible explanations.
No one in this Chamber is unaware of the fact that a terrorist movement does not lay down its weapons without negotiating and especially not if the purpose of its resistance continues to be a factor.
In Palestine, the occupation is omnipresent.
As MrsÂ Morgantini said, there have been almost 50 deaths since January 2006, the construction of the wall continues, the banks of the river Jordan are being annexed and East Jerusalem is being suffocated.
What kind of game are we playing, then?
Why are the Palestinians being punished?
If nothing else, let us dare no longer to talk about money, but to turn our attentions back to the road map and to schedule an international conference focusing on Palestine and on peace.
That was the second stage of the road map, and it is what we are waiting for.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this decision by the Commission and the Council is one that I regard as inevitable, and one that I welcome.
I regret certain of the interventions made during the last half hour and regard them as excessively partisan.
This House, like Europe, has supported the idea of the Palestinian people having a state of their own for longer than anyone can remember, but we have now reached a point at which it has to be spelled out that no democratic election can legitimise terrorism, anti-Semitism and racism; no democratic election can legitimise a constitution that incites genocide and teems with Nazi slogans, references to Jewish world conspiracies such as that of the Elders of Zion, and similar Nazi propaganda.
That is no basis on which Europe can negotiate and grant aid.
Israelâs misdeeds â or whatever you want to call them â its mistakes, its use of violence, are not capable of being compared with the quite fundamental historical issue that we have come up against here.
I welcome this stance.
In order that this conflict be resolved, much has been demanded of Israel, and much remains to be demanded of it.
It is necessary not only that Israel should recognise the Palestinian state, but also itself bring it into being and make it viable.
It must vacate the illegally occupied territories, hand over East Jerusalem, do away with the death lists, relax its economic stranglehold and hand back the territory it gained by building the wall.
The list could well become an endless one, but there is one thing that must never again be demanded of Israel, and that is that it should bargain for its very existence with a government whose manifesto included the annihilation of the Jews and the destruction of Israel, a government that declared, immediately on being elected, that it would not lose sight of that goal, that it was â of course â not daft, that it would pursue its objective pragmatically and step by step, and that it would not, of course, not make it too obvious to the West that that was what they were about, and yet that is what they want to do â and today we have got to the point where this has to be said loud and clear; thank you for having done just that.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have been monitoring with horror an exceptionally dangerous escalation of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories since 30 March.
According to the official report by the UN special coordinator for the Middle East to the Security Council, 40 people lost their lives last month, including at least three Palestinian children.
And yet the vicious circle of violence continued with suicide attacks.
We condemn the acts of violence against unarmed civilians, which can only cause pain and additional hardship.
This escalation in the situation is not helping to resolve the problem.
The European Union is being called on and must also play its part in addressing the situation, by making an active contribution to stabilisation and to the resumption of talks to resolve the Palestinian problem.
Here, we want to express our support for the recent statement by the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, who is expressing his readiness to resume talks with Israel, and our disappointment, Commissioner, at the recent rejection of this proposal by the Israeli Government.
How in truth can the situation be stabilised when the European Council decides to freeze funding to the Palestinian Authority, support funds connected to whether or not the Palestinian people can survive â albeit with difficulty â and, at the same time, strengthen its state structures as a guarantee for the future creation of an independent Palestinian state?
What message are we sending with this decision to the Israelis, I wonder?
How does the state of Israel see this?
Possibly as a blank cheque for the continuation of the acts of violence and economic isolation, at a time when the international community is punishing the Palestinians.
Who knows how late it will be by the time the quartet meets on 9Â May.
I also wish to comment on the statement by my honourable friend MrÂ Batten, about the 'sad' decision taken by the Palestinian people.
How on earth can we qualify as 'sad' a decision taken in a free, democratic manner, while under occupation, by a people in elections which we have called fair and transparent?
Â Â  Mr President, I stand 150% behind the Council and Commissionâs wise decision to freeze all direct budgetary aid to the Palestinian Authority led by an unreformed Hamas.
I always questioned Western legitimisation and acceptance of Hamas candidates committed to armed struggle and to wiping the state of Israel off the map.
I took the trouble of reading their 1988 charter, which is chillingly medieval, bigoted and steeped in incitement to anti-Semitism and support for Jihad and Sharia law.
With hindsight we should have spelt it out more clearly, as we were clearly warned by Israel at the time that Hamas candidates should not have been allowed to stand unless they foreswore terrorist violence and recognised the right of the State of Israel to exist and they were committed to the undertakings of the PLO and the agreements made by the PLO on the Oslo peace accord, with the Quartet and on the roadmap for peace.
After all, the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamasâs spiritual mentors in Egypt, were not allowed to stand on a platform advocating a violent overthrow of their government.
Furthermore, the entire generous aid package to the Palestinian Authority was predicated on a commitment to a two-state solution, achieved by peaceful negotiations.
I personally find it abominable that the Hamas government openly supported the suicide Passover attack in Tel Aviv recently and continue to allow rocket attacks which fall indiscriminately and deliberately on civilian targets in Israel: a war crime under international law.
Lastly, you know someone by the friends they keep, and last week allegedly Osama bin Laden himself, as well as President Ahmadinejad of Iran, endorsed the Islamist agenda of Hamas in their so-called Holy War against Israel.
We must therefore find ways now to bypass Hamas in the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people, perhaps through UNRWA, NGOs etc., and raise the visibility of the European Union in the process.
We cannot give direct budgetary aid to an unreformed Hamas leading the Palestinian authority, that is completely unacceptable to the people who vote for me in London.
Â Â  Mr President, funding is threatening the very existence of Palestinian institutions and there is a very real risk that they will collapse.
Teachers and doctors have not been paid for months and it is the Palestinian people, civilians, who are paying the price of the EUâs position, which represents a collective punishment against the Palestinian people for their democratic choices.
Not only that, but it is also utterly counter-productive.
To suspend funding is to undermine the very political and judicial reforms which the EU has been supporting; to suspend funding is to drive people into the arms of extremists and into the arms of Iran in particular, with risks of much greater fundamentalist influence.
You talk about principles, but it is vital that the EU is consistent.
You cannot make demands of Hamas that you do not make of Israel.
Yes, mutual recognition and an end to violence on both sides are urgently needed, but it has to be on both sides. Israel has to recognise Palestine and to stop its state violence too.
So my question to the Council is this: in the coming days the Israeli Government will be formed.
Will the Council ask the new Israeli Government if it is committed to the roadmap and to the past agreement as presented by the Quartet, and will it ask if the Israeli Government is committed to a cessation of violence against the Palestinians, just as we ask Hamas to do all in its power to end violence against Israel?
Â Â  Mr President, thank God our political group is fully united in one clear position: full support for the Commission and Council decisions.
Allow me to use this opportunity to thank the Commission very much for consulting us and cooperating with us almost every day in this very particular situation.
We fully support the Quartet and the roadmap â the Quartet because of Russia.
We have to make one thing very clear: this is not the consequence of fully democratic elections, but a failure of the Palestinian partner to recognise a legal base for mutual financing to recognise the Oslo, Paris and Cairo agreements and, of course, to recognise the State of Israel.
We have to be here with humanitarian aid and here I support the position of our group.
Our European aid should be visible and I deeply doubt that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency is actually a good thing to bring European visibility.
We have to try to find another tool.
Financial supervision and international control mechanisms are of paramount importance, and here we will follow your intention and we will support you.
We know that EURÂ 165Â million has already been paid to Palestinians, so we have not stopped helping, we are there, and I think the Commission should be more vocal about the fact that we have paid the money to support the emergence of a viable Palestinian state.
Where are we now?
We are in a position in which the Muslim Brotherhood pilot project Hamas has to turn to Iran to beg for money, making Saudis and Egyptians furious.
This is a great success, because it leads to deep cleavage within Hamas and we are already weakening Hamas.
However, we need to strengthen Palestinian liberals, we need a European initiative for democracy and human rights, and an international financial human rights tool to help the Palestinians strengthen moderate, liberal political parties.
Â Â  Mr President, with regard to the Middle East, we Europeans have a clear choice: we can either join the great international coalition which is seeking the isolation and eventual collapse of the Palestinian authority led by Hamas, or we can opt for an autonomous European policy aimed at allowing Hamas to govern subject to a series of staggered and realistic political and security conditions to which the European Union could respond with more dialogue, more aid and, possibly, political recognition measures.
Let us not repeat the mistakes following the Iraq war: Chaos and the collapse of the Palestinian institutions could harm Israel, which is seeking security.
Israel will not be able to carry out its stated plan of unilateral withdrawal in an atmosphere of increasing violence, social desperation and embryonic civil war.
If we are to make political demands of the Palestinians, we cannot ignore the possible entry into the Israeli Government of Liberman's party, with a political programme that is openly racist against the Arab minority in Israel.
A member of a government talking openly about a mass transfer of Arab Israeli populations and about drastically restricting the rights of Arab Israelis violates the most fundamental principles of our foreign policy.
What are the Commission and the Councilâs views on this?
Â Â  Mr President, I am sure that the decision that was taken about the suspension of aid was the correct one.
It was a correct one taken easily â not lightly, but easily â because it is an adherence to principles.
However, the difficult task now begins.
We are at a crossroads.
I am certain, looking back in history, that if there was a terrorist list 30 years ago, the PLO would have been on it.
What was said today about Hamas, and whatever there is in its statute and its declarations, also applied to the PLO 50 years ago.
And yet the PLO became an interlocutor with Israel in seeking peace.
Therefore we must spare no effort in encouraging Hamas to change its position and come round to a position that we hope will promote the peace process.
It is not that difficult to achieve, provided that we give the organisation some space: perhaps renunciation of violence, maybe an indefinite ceasefire for a long period of time, or something of that nature.
The second difficult task is yours, Madam Commissioner; I am sure you will do it with great effectiveness and dedication.
As you very rightly said, we must not penalise the Palestinian people, the aid will go to the Palestinian people provided that they understand that they are not paying the price for a choice they made during free and democratic elections.
Â Â  . Mr President, this debate has shown how complex and difficult the choices are that the Council and the Commission had to take.
I repeat â and I stand by this â that there was no choice.
I think â and I thank all those who have supported this position â that the European Union is a community of values which stands by principles and cannot deviate from those principles.
This is something that is shared unanimously in the Council, and I am sure this position will also prevail in the future â it must prevail.
At the same time many speakers have insisted that we should not forget the Palestinian people, and we do not.
Mr Kasoulides, Mr Brok and others have said that we should make it very clear to the Palestinian people that it is the European Union that is helping them.
Of course, there is a risk and a danger that the Palestinians will turn to other sources.
We must make it clear to them that we are willing to help them.
They must understand that there is not only the willingness but the wish and the desire of the European Union to help them.
But there must be an understanding that we cannot deviate from principles.
What Mr Watson said about hoping that things that are said when a party is in opposition will change once they are in government is very much the hope of the European Union.
Indeed, it will probably take time, but the Union must make it very clear and must work towards that end. That is what we are doing.
Many speakers have referred to the need for even-handedness.
I would like to make it very clear that the Council in its resolution and in its conclusions over the years, and especially in the past month, has never left a doubt that we demand from Israel the same compliance with international obligations that we ask from the Hamas government.
I would like to quote two sentences from the last Council conclusions to this effect: âThe Council called on Israel to desist from any action, such as settlement activities and the construction of the separation barrier on Palestinian land, that is contrary to international law and threatens the viability of an agreed two-state solution.
The Council urged Israel to take steps to improve the humanitarian and economic situation of the Palestinians including by resuming transfers of the withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenuesâ.
This is very clear language and we are using the same kind of urgent tone with Israel when it comes to compliance with international law.
We will certainly continue to do so.
The Middle East Quartet will meet at Foreign Minister level on 9Â May, and of course President Abbasâs recent appeal to hold an international peace conference will be a subject at that meeting.
I cannot of course prejudge what the decision will be, but this is certainly going to be a subject which will be discussed.
Mr Kasoulides, I agree with you we are at a crossroads: we must make the right decisions; we must help the Palestinian people, but at the same time we must stick with our principles.
This must be the continued basis for our policy, it certainly will be the basis for the policy of the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, it has been said various times that this is certainly one of the most difficult challenges we have at this moment in foreign policy.
I thank the majority of Members that have given us support in this very difficult situation.
Why do we not just give funds to the Hamas-led government?
We have been very clear on that.
There are certain principles that even every democratic government also has to maintain.
That is absolutely clear for every democratically elected government, it should be clear and we have clearly outlined it.
I would like to repeat that we have not stopped aid to the Palestinian people, as some have said.
On the contrary, we have accelerated our aid by already giving more than EURÂ 100Â million at the very beginning of this year.
At the same time last year, we had not even given one fifth of that, as I mentioned very clearly.
It is just a matter of listening to what we are saying.
It is true that we have to make this aid very visible to the Palestinian people.
They have to know we have not let them down, but at the same time it is very clear that we cannot give direct aid to a government that is not responding to this very clear demand on the principles.
However, regarding the second question, it is also true that we will indeed also want to support Mahmoud Abbas in a very cautious way because we do not want to undermine his position.
However, at the same time we want to find ways and means of providing an opportunity for the help to go on, and that is why I also mentioned that we need an international supervisory mechanism to ensure that any financial contribution really goes to the right places.
We are already working with the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank and other big donors in order to see how we can set up such a mechanism.
Of course we have to do it rather quickly, and this also goes for health, education and other issues.
Are we applying double standards?
As our Council Presidency said, we are applying the same criteria that we have applied.
We have always mentioned very clearly to the Israelis that they too have quite a number of obligations.
In addition, in September 2005, for instance, the Quartet expressed very clearly its concern that settlement expansion must stop and Israel must remove unauthorised outposts.
It also pointed out that we continue to note with concern the route of the Israeli separation barrier, particularly as it results in the confiscation of Palestinian land, cuts off the movement of people and goods and thus also undermines Palestinian trust in the roadmap.
I think we could have not been clearer, but what we want to see now is the new Israeli Government engaging with the Palestinian Authority.
Here, President Mahmoud Abbas has shown his readiness.
For the time being we cannot do anything else but clearly follow this line.
I hope that also, from the side of the Hamas-led Government, they understand our messages.
We will want to give them a little bit more time, but they should now also be more flexible in their positions, because then there is also a chance to work with a government that wants peace by peaceful means.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Palestine is becoming increasingly tense.
Now more than ever the European Union must support the Palestinian population, both politically and financially: Community aid and the projects under way must not be blocked when they are needed most, as a cut in funding would only exacerbate the current instability.
Now more than ever the European Union must send out a powerful signal to the international community with the aim of promoting the idea of 'two peoples, two States' and of resolutely responding both to Iranâs provocations regarding the non-recognition of the State of Israel and to the continued interference and lack of cooperation on the part of the Israeli Government.
Now more than ever the European Union must demonstrate that it can accept a democratically elected government, by putting the necessary faith in Hamas, albeit in the knowledge that it will have to watch more carefully that institutional matters are carried out legitimately and ensure that the funds paid out are not channelled into terrorist activities.
Now more than ever the European Union has an opportunity to demonstrate its relevance in the international negotiations for a solution to the crisis, by aiming to establish its role as a main negotiating partner through the promotion of values that have so far prevailed within our borders: peace, tolerance and democracy.
Â Â  I would like to recall the situation of the Palestinian people, who are at this time faced with hardships on a scale that we cannot begin to comprehend.
The EU decision to end direct funding for the democratically-elected Palestinian Authority is likely to have disastrous consequences for the delivery of basic services in cash-strapped Palestine.
As a defender of human rights and an âhonest brokerâ in the Middle East the EU should be consistent in its approach to third countries which flout international law.
Refusal to recognise another state or the rights of its people is a charge of great magnitude.
Yet it is a charge that could also be directed at the Israeli authorities.
Therefore we should reconsider the decision to suspend GBP 340 million aid to the Palestinian authority in the light of the precedent of funding for successive Israeli governments.
For its part, Hamas should recognise that its ability to fulfil its duties and serve the people will be linked to its willingness to renounce violence and recognise the rights of the people of Israel.
I hope Hamas will commit to peaceful means.
However, my view is that cooperation is the only viable policy option and that isolation will only exacerbate the desperate conditions in Palestine, conditions which give rise to frustrations and violence.
Â Â  The next item is the report by JosÃ© Ignacio Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America (A6-0047/2006) (2005/2241(INI)).
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this debate I would like to make three acknowledgements: I would like firstly to acknowledge the Commissionâs excellent communication.
The truth is that it has been many years since we had a communication with as much strategic vision and as forward-looking as the one that has been presented to us by MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, and which is in line with what this Parliament had been calling for since November 2001 on the eve of the Madrid Summit.
I would like to acknowledge the generosity shown by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and, in particular, MrÂ Winkler â who is not listening to me, since he is having a lively chat with MrÂ Voggenhuber â at the Bregenz meeting yesterday and the day before yesterday, in allowing the European Parliament to address the Heads of State or Government, thereby acknowledging the role that the European Parliament has been playing in terms of promoting the enhancement of relations between the European Union and Latin America.
Thirdly, the members of the Committees on Foreign Affairs and on Development, because they have approved this report unanimously by means of a very unusual vote â 51 votes in favour, 0 votes against and 0 abstentions, and with no amendment to plenary on behalf of the political groups â which demonstrates clearly the will of the whole of Parliament to back the report that will be put to the vote tomorrow.
And not because this is an unambitious report, Commissioner: everybody knows that, as I said before, this Parliament has distinguished itself by being one of the great motors for this relationship and by saying that the decisive factor in moving these relations forward over the coming years is first and foremost political will and giving it clear support.
We have therefore made some very clear proposals: we are calling for the creation of a Euro-Latin American Assembly which can give parliaments democratic legitimacy as the promoters and legitimisers of this relationship, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we would like the conclusions of the Vienna Summit not just to take account of the will of the parliaments, but also to recommend the creation of that Euro-Latin American Assembly, as happened in the case of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly.
We are also calling for a renewal and updating of the ministerial political dialogue and we recommend the adoption of a renewed bi-regional political agenda, to include new issues: the threats to governability, the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the preservation of the environment and natural resources, bringing together the positions of the Member States of the European Union with those of Latin America in the United Nations, and many other issues which must be enshrined in initiatives such as the signature of a Euro-Latin American charter for peace and security.
Nevertheless, Mr President, political dialogue and political will will eventually run out and come to nothing unless they are accompanied by actions that move us beyond words, and it is in this regard that summits â and there are too many of them â fail and are much criticised.
One area in which we can clearly move on from words to actions is that of the commercial element of the association agreements.
It is clear that we must make progress on the Agreement with Mercosur, since none has unfortunately been made before, though not through lack of will on the part of the European Union: in Vienna we must set a realistic timetable for the conclusion of that Agreement.
Commissioner, I would like to speak most frankly: in the European Parliamentâs view, the time for cooperation and political dialogue agreements with the Andean and Central American Communities has long since passed, and we recommend that the decision be taken in Vienna to move on to the association agreement stage.
I am aware that there may be a degree of uncertainty at the moment given Venezuelaâs decision to leave the Andean Community, but now more than ever the European Union must send a clear and well-defined message in this direction, in order not to strengthen the position of those people who are against the integration processes.
I shall end, Mr President, by mentioning two initiatives very quickly, so as not to take up too much time: the Facility of the European Investment Bank, which we would like to take the name of the Commissioner, because of her tenacity, of her having promoted a social cohesion fund that is a complete innovation within the European Unionâs history; and an initiative that we do not want to come to nothing: that of the Bi-regional Solidarity Fund, a Fund which is not going to cost the Union any money, because we are not asking for any additional aid, a Fund that is supported by the European Parliament and by our Latin American partners.
Though we are not asking for a complete commitment to this Fund, we are asking that it at least be studied and that it can be taken into account in the Summitâs conclusions.
Mr President, the European Union cannot indulge in navel gazing, with a policy of self-contemplation as in the legend of Narcissus: at the Vienna Summit, it must send a clear and well-defined sign of our commitment to a region which expects a lot from us.
We also hope that the Commissioner and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will demonstrate their commitment to ensuring that, through everybodyâs efforts, this Vienna Summit is a success.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra most warmly for the excellent report, and also for the kind words he addressed to the Council.
I very much regret the fact that my knowledge of the language is insufficient to permit me to deliver a speech in Spanish, but working alongside the present Commission has been a tough educational experience to which I owe the ability to understand enough Spanish to understand what he said to me, for which I am grateful.
My participation in the recent meeting at Dornbirn in Austria was in fact, among other things, an indication of the Council Presidencyâs great interest in enhanced cooperation at parliamentary level, and it goes without saying that the European Parliament will be represented at the fourth Summit in Vienna on 12 May, as will the regional and sub-regional parliaments of Latin America.
That is a very important dimension of cooperation between the regions, and it is something that we in the Council do of course welcome.
We must not lose sight of the fact that this Summit offers a unique opportunity to enhance cooperation, and I can say with a degree of pride that the holding of it was a matter of voluntary choice by the Austrian Federal Government, not least since it would serve as a sign of how important it is to us that this Summit meeting between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean should, for the first time, be held outside an Iberian or American context.
I myself, working alongside the present Commissioner, took part in the first Summit in Rio de Janeiro 1999, and, if we want to draw comparisons between now and then, we have covered a great deal of ground, and that is something we can take pride in.
I also particularly want to thank your House and, of course, the Commission too, for the ways in which you and they have helped make this journey a successful one.
The Council is entirely of one mind with the European Parliament and the Commission as regards the EU/Latin American partnershipâs most important goals and degrees of action, something that is made quite clear in the conclusions adopted by the Council at the end of February, in which the Council reiterated its determination to further strengthen this alliance in the interests of both regions.
It is in our interest to enhance this cooperation if we are to promote our common values and interests and to make a joint contribution to peace and security, to the protection of human right and to greater public participation and democracy.
Social cohesion, sustainable development, the protection and enhancement of the global environment within the framework of the United Nations are topics on which we have established a tradition of good cooperation with our Latin American partners.
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the good cooperation between most of the Latin American countries and the European Union where the reform of the United Nations is concerned, particularly over recent months.
We are also very grateful to those Latin American states that have given remarkable support in reaching the decision on the establishment of a Human Rights Council.
The third EU/Latin America Summit in 2004 was held in Guadalajara and saw us making some very ambitious commitments, which, in particular, involve both partners in striving to adopt fiscal and economic measures that will facilitate the improved distribution of wealth and appropriate social policies.
The European Union will continue to support these efforts at reinforcing democratic institutions, responsible governance and the rule of law and combating drugs and organised crime, including the trafficking in human beings.
The activities engaged in since Guadalajara amount to a very impressive list, of which we, the Presidency of the Council, have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy to your House, for circulation among its Members, and of course to the Commission, since we believe it to be a very important demonstration of what we have achieved in these two years.
The European Union is striving for a purposeful political dialogue not only with the region as a whole and with the various integration fora, but also with the individual countries, and MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra has made reference to the various negotiations that have started, are due to start, and which we are of course keen to continue.
It is to be hoped that one substantial outcome from the Summit will be the beginning of negotiations with Central America.
We are in fact somewhat concerned about the future evolution of the Andean Community, in that Venezuelaâs recent announcement of its secession from it raises questions that need to be elucidated and answered on both the political and legal level.
Only a few weeks ago, I met with the foreign minister of Peru, and we had the opportunity to discuss this issue.
I can assure all Members of your House, and you, MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, that we are very much interested in carrying this process forward, although the conditions for that must, of course, be right.
Thinking back to the debates we had in Dornbirn a few days ago, I would like to shed light on a few areas in which further cooperation strikes me as necessary, without wishing to go into detail at the present time.
The areas in question are education, training, migration and the protection of the environment, and I believe them to be areas in which further enhanced cooperation will be possible.
Preparations for the Summit to be held in Vienna on 12Â May are in hand, and good progress is being made with them.
It has been possible for senior officials to conduct and indeed conclude very important negotiations, and so we can, overall â and not least thanks to the help given by the European Parliament and by this report â be optimistic that the Vienna Summit will be a good one, with real substance and, in political terms, a success.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be here with you once again today, for the adoption of the European Parliamentâs report on a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America.
I would like in particular to welcome this excellent initiative and to congratulate MrÂ Salafranca especially on the great work he has done on this report.
As you know, this report represents Parliamentâs response to the proposals made by the Commission in its Communication of 8Â December.
I would like to express my most sincere gratitude for the political support that you have given us and for the way that cooperation between our two institutions has been strengthened.
I believe that, as far as Europe is concerned, the current context is an extremely good one in terms of creating partnership with Latin America.
On the one hand, the Council has been most receptive to our Communication and adopted conclusions in this regard at the end of February.
On the other hand, the current Presidency sees the success of the 4th European Union-Latin America/Caribbean Summit, which will take place in Vienna on 12Â May, as one of the priorities of its working programme.
Thanks to the three institutions, therefore, the Commission has the necessary political support to continue moving forward.
And I hope that this represents great progress.
This is not enough to make this Summit a success, however.
As the English say, 'it takes two to tangoâ While Europe is prepared to commit itself more to Latin America, I also hope that there will be a firm commitment on the part of Latin America.
I therefore believe that the Vienna Summit also offers an opportunity to test the will and determination of the Latin American countries and I hope that this is translated into concrete progress.
I would like to say to you that I very much appreciate the fact that our two institutions are taking the same line, because we are all convinced that creating a stronger partnership is timely, important and necessary for the following reasons:
Firstly, Latin America is one of the few regions in the world that can be seen as a natural ally to the European Union, particularly given our shared values.
Secondly, there are many challenges that can be tackled more effectively by means of a reformed partnership and one of them is the lack of social cohesion, which affects both Europe and Latin America.
I believe that it is very important that we make more progress in this field and I hope that there are genuine concrete results.
Thirdly, I hope that todayâs debate on Latin America sends a positive signal to our partners, assuring them that Europe maintains a strong interest in its region.
We need strong, solid and reliable partners in Latin America.
I would now like to deal with the next issue facing us, which is the Vienna Summit.
This Summit is taking place within a context of significant challenges and exchanges, and also changes, in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The majority of countries in the region have adopted democratic systems, they have embarked on ambitious economic and social reforms and they have a great potential for development, but unfortunately there are still great social shortcomings, mainly due to the fact that the economic progress has not reached the majority of the population and this is leading, or has led, to a degree of disillusionment with certain democratic governments, as a result of their inability to comply with the terms of the social pact.
Great attention has been focussed on the emergence of the new political movements in Latin America, which some see as a direct threat to the traditional political, economic and social structures.
These phenomena do not have to be seen in negative terms, but rather we should see them within the context of an evolution aimed at achieving a fairer society.
I do not believe that there is any need to stress how important it is for this transition to take place by means of existing and reliable democratic institutions.
I believe that the Vienna Summit offers an excellent opportunity to achieve this visibility and to hold that dialogue on social cohesion, but also on regional integration and multilateralism.
The Bregenz meeting took place within that context and I am very pleased that it has been a real success.
We now have to move forward with the establishment of a network of association agreements between the European Union and the countries and regions of Latin America.
To this end, I would like to recommend that the Member States firstly negotiate with Central America.
This decision still depends upon the Central American countries clearly demonstrating that they are moving forward with their own integration strategy, but I am very optimistic, and I believe that these decisions will be formalised at the meeting of the Central American Heads of State or Government that will take place from 5 to 7 May.
With regard to the Andean Community, the situation has unfortunately become more complicated since Venezuela left the Community a few days ago, as we know.
I have spoken personally to PresidentÂ Morales and we still hope that the internal meetings within the Andean Community can open up a way forward.
With regard to Mercosur, I know that the situation is much more difficult, unfortunately, but I still hope that Vienna will at least provide strong political impetus in order to make progress with the negotiations that are running in parallel with the Doha negotiations.
We intend to consolidate all of your cooperation in economic and development activities by means of aid programmes and we would like significant support from the European Investment Bank, to the tune of EUR 4Â billion.
Furthermore, we hope that Vienna will also be an opportunity to announce the creation of a transatlantic parliamentary assembly between the European Union and Latin America. I believe that this will be very important and will also bring the peoples closer together in the future.
Finally, Madam President, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that the alliance between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean is stronger and more effective and that it has a long-term future.
Â Â  . Madam President, dear Benita, dear Hans, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking as Socialist coordinator in the Committee on Development, but also as draftsman of the opinion of that committee on the partnership between the European Union and Latin America.
We wished to stress that, although these relations certainly have an important political dimension â well expressed by MrÂ Salafranca â they must also be seen and developed from the point of view of development cooperation and the strategic objectives and commitments that Parliament, the Council and the Commission set a few months ago in the tripartite declaration which we know as the European Strategy for Development.
We are therefore pleased that the Resolution that we are to vote on takes up our proposal that the eradication of poverty in Latin America and contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals there within the timescale set should be priorities within Euro-Latin American relations.
We also believe that it is important to acknowledge the efforts that certain Latin American countries, such as Cuba, Venezuela or Chile, are making to realise these objectives amongst their people and, even more admirably, their efforts to help other countries of their region so that these objectives can be achieved in their societies as well.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my solidarity with the Cuban dissident Marta Beatriz Roque, a descendent of European citizens from the Canary Islands, who this morning has been physically assaulted by thugs of the Castro dictatorship when trying to leave her house in Havana.
Commissioner, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is very pleased with your Communication on a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America.
For the first time in years, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, the Commission and Parliament are using the same language when talking about Latin America.
MrÂ Salafranca has presented an ambitious report which I am not going to reiterate.
Commissioner, you should know that, when you defend your proposal in Vienna at the 4th EU-Latin America/Caribbean Summit, you will have the majority, if not the unanimous, support of the whole of the European Parliament.
These are not good times for a proposal such as this, but many of us are convinced that we have a special opportunity to move in the right direction.
The rapporteur has said that for many years we have been stating our good intentions towards Latin America, which is experiencing complex times both internally and in its relations with the rest of the world.
It must resolve many of its problems itself, such as the current crisis with the Andean Community, but we must send an extremely clear message of support.
The Summit must produce a mandate to begin and, where necessary, to enhance, the negotiation towards an Association Agreement with the Andean Community, with Central America and with Mercosur.
This is a minimal requirement below which there is nothing.
If the Union does not take certain clear and unequivocal steps to strengthen our relations with Latin America and with its sub-regional integration institutions, we may not have another opportunity like this for many years.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner and to MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, whom our group supported and whose work today at the centre of our debate it welcomes.
We welcome his report because it is timely, because it is practical and because it has a precious quality: political realism.
MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra reminds us that we must eventually adopt a strategic approach to Latin America, a broad outlook that aims to place side by side all the points that matter to us: the social aspect, the economic aspect and the cultural aspect.
We must bear in mind that many things have changed in that continent.
Major new players have emerged strongly in the social and political spheres; we must take account of these new players, including, of course, the indigenous and mestizo part of society, which until recently was sidelined from the political process.
We must realistically consider the fact, too, that regional integration processes often mark time and, from that point of view, our experience can support and help the work being done by Latin American countries.
Finally, we must bear in mind, as MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra points out, that poverty remains endemic in that continent: 45% of the population live below the poverty line.
However, notwithstanding a few inconsistencies, the income produced by the Latin American continent, in terms of GDP, is equivalent to USDÂ 2Â 800, or three times as much as that produced in China.
That tells us that Latin America remains a continent with significant economic and income-related disparities, in other words a continent of inequality.
From that point of view, the Vienna Summit represents a great opportunity; firstly, in terms of making up for the scant attention that our institution, the European Parliament, has historically paid to Latin America and, secondly, in terms of investing in a cooperation measure that can genuinely overcome poverty and of preventing the political measures from being reduced to a sum of separate measures.
We need the strategic outlook that the Commission is proposing to us and that the rapporteur has been able to take up.
Â Â  . Madam President, in recent years the EU has been very much preoccupied by, and highly focused on, our immediate vicinity, especially in the context of enlargement.
It is only natural that the new Member States and those states bordering the Union have been, and will continue to be, of the highest priority to us.
However, it is important not to forget the rest of the world.
Unfortunately, it still sometimes feels as though Latin America has ended up being somewhat neglected, and that is sad.
The course of development in Latin America is immensely exciting â if highly contradictory â involving economic growth, democratic stabilisation, reconciliation commissions and progress in terms of welfare.
Chile has its first woman president.
At the same time, a very large sector of the population continues to live below the poverty line.
There is great inequality, human rights are violated in many countries, and populists have taken over in Venezuela and Bolivia.
In Cuba, Fidel Castro has now been imprisoning opponents, persecuting dissidents and preventing his people from exercising fundamental rights such as free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and free elections for 47 years.
Parliament has debated Cuba on many occasions.
My group is very critical of the fact that the Council has adopted a softer line on the Castro regime and that not enough support is being given to the democratic opposition, the representatives of which have twice been awarded Parliamentâs Sakharov prize.
A summit is to take place in Vienna in May between the EU and Latin America.
We hope, of course, that it will be a great success.
It is important to actually enter into the strategic partnership about which we in this Chamber have talked so many times and for which we have been calling for so long.
Such a partnership must be a broad one.
We have many areas in which to cooperate including not only politics, the economy, social and cultural issues and so on, but also environmental, research and security policies and, in particular, conflict resolution.
We also need to reform our trade policy in order to increase mutual exchange in this area.
Cooperation must take place on a long-term and regular basis.
Individual summits are important, but they are not enough.
As MrÂ Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra wrote in his report, the parliamentary dimension could be strengthened by a joint assembly.
Contact with civil society, for example with students, is also important in order to strengthen cooperation and the sense of solidarity.
I would like to congratulate MrÂ Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra on his report.
It was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and contains many positive and intelligent suggestions that we support.
The unanimity with which the report was adopted shows how important it is for the whole of Parliament, irrespective of political groups and despite the slightly differing views on individual development processes, to recognise that we really must deepen this cooperation.
The fact that we are so united on this issue is a strength.
We wish to see cooperation that is long-term and of high quality and to which priority is given.
Madam President, I believe that you will see the proof of this unity if you scan down the list of speakers a little, for it is not merely Spanish speakers who are taking part in this debate and engaging with this issue.
Â Â  . Madam President, on the eve of the Vienna Summit, the Salafranca report offers us the opportunity once again to talk about the current situation of two sister regions that are also clearly united.
This is a very good time do so because, as has been said, Latin America is undergoing certain changes that I believe to be genuinely hopeful.
These changes demonstrate that, in some cases, certain groups that have had no voice and practically no rights, are now democratically reclaiming that voice and those rights, and I believe that that is something that we must welcome in any possible way.
The rapporteur is aware that we are not in full agreement on the strategy and objectives proposed in the report: there are certain disagreements, which I believe is to be expected in a situation such as this, but certain elements allow us to be optimistic and positive.
I therefore believe that we must take a generally positive view of this report.
I would like at least to comment on three aspects, however.
Firstly, for us, the great problem â and we must continue to insist on this â stems from the definition of a free-trade area, and that is something we must consider.
We would be much more comfortable talking about a global inter-regional partnership. This is above all because there is no consensus or unanimous view in the region that this free-trade area is as positive an idea as it appears to be.
Secondly, since two Austrians are here â an Austrian Commissioner and naturally an Austrian representing the Presidencyâin-Office of the Council â I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the issue of feminicides, which has been discussed in this House on several occasions, must be given a prominent place at the Vienna Summit.
I believe that the fight against the murder of women is essential, and should not be ignored under any circumstances.
Thirdly, it is also important to remember the fight against impunity, above all because the many things that are being done in Latin America will only yield positive results if impunity is also combated in parallel.
Â Â  . â Madam President, my group accepted the consensus, though we made it clear that we had strong reservations about paragraphs 6, 21 and 66 in relation to the definition of the Euro-Latin American free-trade area.
I would ask MrÂ Salafranca to make one more effort, because, since this report, we have held the meeting in Bregenz â the third very important parliamentary meeting involving more than 90 parliamentarians from Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe.
This concept appears in a very much altered form in the Bregenz declaration.
The notion of the Euro-Latin American area hardly appears in it, essentially at the request of the parliamentarians from Latin America and the Caribbean.
I would therefore like my group to be able to remain part of the consensus tomorrow, but with an altered wording, because the Bregenz meeting has taken place and what we must do is listen to what our partners have said, since it is to them that this fundamental, important and strategic proposal is addressed.
And I believe that we Members of the European Parliament should therefore treat the Bregenz declaration as a meeting point.
Furthermore, I believe that there is a high degree of agreement, on the importance of this bi-regional strategic relationship, on establishing a European Union-Latin American parliamentary assembly, on regional integration and on the Bi-regional Solidarity Fund, which, incidentally, in the Bregenz declaration and as far as MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner is concerned, was also altered, because there was no mention of Latin America and the Caribbean being able to participate by means of proposals.
If they are not able to do so, then we are not talking about a bi-regional fund, but about a European fund which grants aid to Latin America and the Caribbean at Europeâs discretion.
On this basis, therefore, I would ask â and I know that we have very little time left â for a final effort from MrÂ Salafranca so that paragraphs 6, 21 and 66, which mention a Euro-Latin American free-trade area, can be worded in accordance with the Bregenz declaration.
Â Â  () Ladies and gentlemen, IÂ would like to start by thanking MrÂ Salafranca not just for his report, but also for his constructive approach in the discussions between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean earlier this week.
IÂ also appreciate the way the President of the European Parliament MrÂ Borrell conducted these discussions in Bregenz, which concluded with the adoption of aÂ final joint declaration.
The European Union is a key partner for the countries of Latin America, not only in commerce, industry, science and technology, but also from the viewpoint of assistance with the democratisation of society.
Cooperation between the two regions has already reached the stage at which it needs to be institutionalised, which is why I welcome the proposal to set up a Euro-Latin American transatlantic parliamentary assembly to promote and extend information exchange and to provide a proper framework for legislative moves in mutual relations.
Globalisation has levelled out information inequalities, and has hastened the transfer of information, which is why the human aspect of economic relations needs to be intensified.
I would like to thank you for including my remarks on the situation for women and their position in these countries.
The white slave trade, with the abuse of women and children as prostitutes and the inadequate representation of women in society, is an issue that needs to be resolved not just in Europe, but also in the countries of Latin America.
Commissioner, I support the establishment of a bi-regional solidarity fund earmarked primarily for education, eradicating illiteracy and supporting social cohesion.
However, I ask that the money should go where it is meant to go, that is to citizens, students, and the younger generation, and not to regimes that have problems with democracy.
I wish you success at the summit in Vienna.
Â Â  Madam President, regrettably, in the last few years, particularly after the last wave of EU enlargement to the current 25 Member States, Latin America has ceased to be as much in focus politically as it was immediately after, say, the accession of Portugal and Spain in the 1980s and 1990s.
Let us hope, however, that the 12Â May Summit will change all of this.
As ENP rapporteur I have had to recalibrate and accept that clearly our strategic EU interests have by necessity refocused on our Eastern European and Caucasus neighbours and our Euromed partners, as well as our strategic interests further afield in China and India.
Nevertheless, to neglect Latin America would be at our peril.
Not only do we share a common cultural heritage and fundamental Western values on democracy, human rights and the rule of law â as well as having a small piece of EU territory there in the form of French Guiana.
However, in the scramble for natural resources we must not for instance allow China to collar the Venezuelan oil supplies, for instance, or cease to support the efforts of President Uribe and his fight in Colombia against the FARC drug-dealing Marxist terrorists.
We face in the region a degree of potential instability now, with the rise of demi-gods such as Presidents Morales and Chavez in Bolivia and Venezuela respectively, who cosy up to the Castro Communist dictatorship of Cuba and reject Western concepts of freedom and democracy.
Haiti is also a country which also remains lawless and unstable at present.
Fortunately, the huge recent rise in oil and commodity prices has benefited much of the region, but we should celebrate the success of the Mexican and Chilean EU free trade agreements and look to extend these to a deal with Mercosur, because regional economic integration and multilateralism has to be the way ahead to prevent a breakdown in the fragile stability of the region.
Personally, I sincerely hope that we can eventually have a Euro-Latin American free trade area by 2010 as suggested, as the United States of America now seems to have lost all interest in the concept of a free trade area of the Americas and instead is doing bilateral deals with individual Latin American countries which I think in the longer term will undermine the regional integration which is so important for our Latin American friends.
Â Â  Madam President, to keep my speech short, I would like to congratulate MrÂ Salafranca, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner and MrÂ Winkler, for the Council, on this convergence of the three institutions, which they have described very brilliantly.
I believe that the key to Europe and Latin Americaâs relations â and we must not lose this overall picture â is the complementary nature of the two regions, which share values, ideals, history, culture and traditions and which represent more than 50 countries and more than a thousand million inhabitants.
Together they can be worth much more than the sum of their parts and they can tackle the problems and challenges of globalisation much more successfully.
If this is taken into account, the Vienna Summit can succeed.
That is the direction we must take.
Finally, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, let us not abandon the Andean countries just because one of them has cast the Andean Community aside: we cannot reward the country that has boycotted the Community, but rather we must reward those countries such as Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and â who knows? â Bolivia, that want to maintain an agreement with the European Union.
Â Â  â Madam President, the report and the Commission's strategic communication on enhanced cooperation between the European Union and Latin America serve the objectives of European capital to acquire an even bigger share of Latin American by creating conditions for its unaccountable action.
The rest is just pretty words.
Some of us are more honest.
The terms laid down by the motion for a resolution and the Commission have nothing to do with equal and mutually beneficial relations.
In reality they are calling on the countries of Latin America to adopt and apply the policy of the European Union in the economic and political sector and even to accept its foreign policy.
An attempt is being made through this relationship, in the name of development, to plunder these countries still further and, at the same time, to intervene in their internal affairs in order to prevent progressive developments.
No reference whatsoever is made to the lifting of the illegal and unacceptable embargo of Cuba by the United States of America.
Nonetheless, the grass roots and social movements of Latin America and the governments of a series of countries have already denounced and are fighting against the policy being proposed through the reports of the European Union and the USA and are looking for different ways of achieving equal, mutually beneficial relations for their countries for the benefit of the peoples.
We are with them and the Council is right to worry about the departure of Venezuela from the Andean Community; it is an alternative and progressive method of cooperation for these countries.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Latin America has recently recorded higher growth than expected, and Mercosur, the fourth largest economic area in the world, has certainly played a fundamental part in achieving that outcome.
Strengthening cooperation between the European Union and Latin America, by prioritising a two-way strategic partnership in political and institutional terms, with the aim of steering economic cooperation and socio-cultural integration between the two continents more effectively, are objectives that the party that I represent and also the common sense of the citizens and governments generally can only share.
The European institutions and the Member States, foremost among which are Italy and Spain, together with European businesses, have strong interests in that area, which appears to be one of the growth poles of the world economy.
Italy, for example, has more than half of the businesses in Latin America with offices in Mercosur countries.
We therefore support the Commissionâs intention to broaden the dialogue and the subjects of mutual interest to incorporate the excellent recommendations in MrÂ SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyraâs report, while taking care to ensure, however, that the alleged need for greater promotion of trade does not lead to excessive liberalisation, resulting in unfair competition for European industry.
Among the objectives of the SalafrancaÂ SÃ¡nchez-Neyra report are calls to fight poverty.
In that regard, I agree with the need to support agricultural reform in South America; just as in Europe in centuries gone by, the dividing up of large landed estates gave a major boost to land cultivation and, in addition to solving the problem of poverty in our continent, it paved the way for its subsequent industrial development.
I would therefore be grateful to MrÂ Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra if he were to expand his report along those lines.
Â Â  Madam President, Latin America has fired peopleâs imagination and emotions ever since it was discovered.
That is how it was and that is how it is now.
It is a continent of great creative, artistic, musical and literary inspiration; it is a continent of lively and exuberant faith. It is a continent to which Christians from other continents look with hope.
As European politicians, we also look to the region in the hope of close cooperation, and in the hope that we will be able to take advantage of centuries of cultural ties to promote the dynamic development of both Latin America and Europe in all fields.
I would like to turn now to the Salafranca report.
In his report, MrÂ Salafranca has laid the foundations for practical cooperation and has outlined a global policy and a comprehensive vision of a policy of closer economic, security and social ties.
The aim of the report is to provide Latin America with European experience in the area of integration, by which I mean common structures, common practices, organs and institutions that function efficiently, programmes that open the way to cooperation with Europe and a willingness to take on the challenges of the modern world together with the EU.
Latin America is also wrestling with huge problems, however, which include poverty, social inequality, inequality of opportunity, social backwardness, the suffering of the continentâs Indian population, the lack of infrastructure, the power of the drug cartels, gangs of demoralised young people and apathy.
In solving all these problems, Latin America should be able to count on the European Unionâs help.
This does not mean, however, an unnecessary proliferation of EU administrative structures in Latin America.
Forms of cooperation should be found that will not result in a multitude of costly new posts in EU representations that are constantly being expanded.
Finally, I would like to mention one more thing: cooperation should include a clause for the protection of civil liberties and human rights.
Latin America is a very sensitive continent in this regard, a fact to which its history testifies.
Yet we are currently witnessing dangerous anti-democratic experiments in Venezuela, Bolivia and Communist Cuba.
A clause for the protection of civil liberties and human rights must be applied unconditionally.
Â Â  Madam President, promoting trade and economic cooperation provides a proper objective of this report, but economic growth in Latin America can only be sustained by rigid adherence to the rule of law and respect for human rights.
I support what the rapporteur and his party colleagues say in condemning human rights abuse in Cuba, but I call on them to be consistent including, yes, in Colombia, where the Organization of American States has already said that supposedly demobilised paramilitaries are returning to arms.
I hope the Commissioner will tonight confirm her agreement with the UN Commissioner for Human Rights that her office in Colombia retain the double mandate, including monitoring, not restricting its duties to simply technical assistance.
Finally, Latin America is Europeâs strategic partner.
I pay tribute to Brazil in contributing to nuclear non-proliferation and to several Latin American countries for contributing to peace-keeping operations in Haiti, but I also hope that the Vienna Summit secures support from our Latin American partners for a WTO round which genuinely targets development, not least because countries from Bolivia to Honduras to Nicaragua are themselves highly indebted poor countries and have most to gain.
Â Â  â Madam President, the planned Vienna Summit between the EU and Latin America, which is the occasion for this report, will be the biggest multi-state summit during the Austrian Presidency.
That is a good thing in that it at last gets Latin America back on the agenda.
There will also, in Vienna, be an alternative summit with basic-level associations from Latin America and the EU, and it is this alternative summit that enjoys our groupâs firm support.
These grass-roots groups are fighting, in particular, against any association between Latin America and the Member States of the EU founded on the neoliberal idea of unhindered free trade, and it is an unfortunate fact that much thinking of this no-holds-barred, neo-liberal, free-trade kind is to be found in the Salafranca report, which also articulates the idea of Latin America being brought into line with what the EU thinks of as concepts of security.
There is at present a great deal of change in Latin America, much of it positive and deserving of our support, and it is fairly clear to me, on the basis of this debate, that human rights are all-embracing, so that all of them â individual and social human rights and the human right to independent development â belong together.
It is this all-embracing approach to human rights that we should make our own, and ideological speeches such as Mr Tannockâs get us nowhere.
What the people of Latin America need from us is support, not least of a practical and political kind.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to thank MrÂ Salafranca for his report.
I think that those of the 92 points presented that are in our common interest should be selected for rapid implementation.
European businesses are investing in the regionâs economy, and the European Union provides financial assistance with a view to solving social and economic problems.
The Latin American countries achieved GDP growth of 3-4% last year, and are an increasingly large export market not for the European Union, but for Asia.
The âeconomic tigersâ are fighting aggressively for the rich reserves of raw materials that are found in the region, in so doing restricting the chances for cooperation in this field between the EU and Latin America.
In addition to resolutions, we should take advantage of our cultural legacy and existing economic links with Latin America to draw up an efficient economic programme, based on common actions and benefits, in order to avoid losing out on the economic benefits of cooperation.
As well as reports setting out a vision of future measures, it would appear that a review of the working procedures of EU bodies is necessary, in order to react quickly to changes resulting from the functioning of the global market that work to the disadvantage of our citizens.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member of Parliament who was not born in the Iberian Peninsula, one minute is sufficient for me to express my conviction that the current level of cooperation between the European Union and Latin America does not reflect the interests of the countries and the citizens of both parties.
I am very pleased with the excellent report by MrÂ Salafranca, by means of which the European Parliament is demonstrating its contribution to the political will required for the strong and genuine development of strategic relations.
I would like to stress that this development benefits the whole of the European Union, not just a few of its members.
Finally, I believe that not only are bilateral relations with individual countries or with Mercosur or the Andean Community important, but also relations with the whole of Latin America.
Â Â  .
Madam President, in Dornbirn â which, it is worth my adding, is only a few kilometres from Bregenz â something was said in the âDornbirn Statementâ that strikes me as very important, namely this: âThe Summit between Latin America, the Caribbean, and the European Union is not just something that happens on 12 May.â
The summit is a process of which the meeting at Dornbirn is just as much a part as are the events round about the summit.
It strikes me as particularly important that I should point out â as I did, indeed, in Dornbirn too â that there will be, in the margins of the summit, a meeting of the most important business leaders from both regions, for it is the entrepreneurs who can help enable Latin America to enjoy greater prosperity.
I would also like to observe, for MrÂ PflÃŒgerâs benefit, that there will also be a large meeting of civil society representatives from both regions, and to that we very much look forward.
That, too, is important, for the promotion of civil society in Latin America is one of the European Unionâs concerns, and the alternative summit to which you referred will doubtless be a very interesting event, and I hope that it will be well-conducted and peaceful.
MrÂ Romeva i Rueda and MrsÂ BelohorskÃ¡ raised a topic that is in fact also of particular importance to the Austrian President-in-Office of the Council MrsÂ UrsulaÂ Plassnik, that being the issue of violence against women and of trafficking in human beings, particularly of women and girls.
This matter is one of great importance to the Austrian Presidency generally and will of course be discussed at the Vienna Summit.
MrÂ YaÃ±ez-BarnuevoÂ GarcÃ­a appealed to the European Union not to abandon the Andean Community, and that is something it will certainly not do.
While we are monitoring developments very closely, we do of course have an interest in the sub-regional associations and organisations in Latin America remaining strong, since they are our potential partners, and we hope that the secession of Venezuela, which currently holds the presidency, which has not yet officially been accomplished and has as yet not been confirmed by any council of ministers, will perhaps eventually prove not to be necessary, so that we in the European Union may be enabled to commence negotiations with the Andean Community.
As the Commissioner said, there are undertakings to be given by both sides; we in the European Union are prepared to give them, and our Latin American partners must of course be willing to do likewise.
Â Â  . Madam President, seeing as the summit will be held in Vienna, I should like to say a few words in German: I am delighted at the very broad agreement reached between the three institutions of the European Union regarding the Latin America summit and the issue of Latin America.
We have all worked very hard to achieve this, with some excellent preparatory meetings, such as the ministerial meeting on social cohesion in Brussels, meetings on immigration issues and drugs in Cartagena, a civil society meeting in Vienna, a meeting for business that has yet to take place, and, of course, the parliamentary meeting in Dornbirn.
All of that means that we now have a broader basis than we have really ever had, and that is very important.
Nevertheless, we still have a great deal of crucial work to do over the next two weeks, which, above all, will hopefully take us in a direction that will allow us to launch this association agreement with the Andean Community.
I know, in any case, that the Austrian Presidency is putting a great deal of effort into this.
However, summits are always judged according to who attends them.
To my knowledge, we have so far received acceptances from 18 Latin American Heads of State or Government.
I think it is very important that this considerable display of interest must now be translated into concrete action.
We will continue to build on it, because it needs to be the basis of cooperation for the next seven years.
In terms of substance, I should also like to say that, in addition to the topics we have dealt with today, the issue of human rights and the strengthening of the institutions will, of course, also be discussed, including the violence against women in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez.
I myself raised this issue with the Mexican Attorney-General in person on a recent visit to that country, and I know that he is taking a close interest.
With regard to Colombia, too, I would say to you that we obviously support those responsible for human rights there, and also the victims among the population.
The official responsible for these women's issues has recently visited both your House and the Commission, and we held very intensive talks on the matter.
In general, I think, we have covered a really broad range of issues, but we now need to work together to actually achieve all of it, which will make the summit a real success.
Â Â  . Thank you, Madam President.
I wished to make a very brief comment and make two procedural points which I believe may facilitate the vote on this report during tomorrowâs plenary sitting.
My comment is that the President-in-Office of the Council has no need to apologise for his Spanish, which I believe to be excellent, as is his will to contribute to the harmonious partnership between the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
His presence in Bregenz demonstrated this.
My other two observations, Madam President, relate to MrÂ Romagnoliâs initiative to present an amendment on the agricultural reform.
I regret that MrÂ Romagnoli has not presented this amendment within the time limit allowed for such presentation according to the Rules of Procedure, but if the other Members support it, I have no objection to accepting an oral amendment tomorrow in plenary.
With regard to MrÂ Meyerâs comment, I would like to say to MrÂ Meyer that the Bregenz Declaration is inspired by this Parliamentâs report, rather than this Parliament's report being inspired by the Bregenz Declaration.
You are perfectly aware that, if I was prepared to make a concession in the negotiation of the final document, it was out of a spirit of consensus and not because I did not have a large majority in support of the positions we have adopted.
What I would like to say to you, however, MrÂ Meyer, most affectionately and frankly, is that when I vote or speak on my own behalf or on behalf of my political group, I do so in full acceptance of any significance it may have, and, although I have never asked you for this, I would nevertheless be willing to change the reference to the Euro-Latin American free-trade area for the reference requested by MrÂ Romeva, who is not currently in the Chamber, and replace it with an area of global inter-regional partnership, in the three paragraphs in question, which are paragraphs 6, 21 and 66.
That was the comment I wished to make, Madam President, for the sake of consensus, and I believe that tomorrow this Parliament will be able to respond in a united fashion, in order to ensure, amongst all of us, that this Summit is a success, above all thanks to the efforts of the Commission and of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the question for oral answer to the Council regarding the amendment of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, submitted by MrÂ Gargani on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs (O-0002/2006 â B6-0004/2006).
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are once again debating, as we have already done many times in this Parliament, a very sensitive issue, which relates to immunity.
I am honoured to have reopened the debate with my question, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and its coordinators.
I believe that all of my fellow Members are aware of the need for common rules of the European Parliament in relation to immunity; it is a long-held ambition of the European Parliament to have such rules.
Twenty years ago, one of our fellow Members, named MrÂ Donnez, gained approval for a report on European parliamentary immunity with the aim of overcoming a situation that, 20 years back, was already limited and unsuited to the scope of the European Parliament as a whole.
The Protocol on Privileges and Immunity stipulated that Members of the European Parliament could not be questioned in relation to the votes they cast but, at the same time, it deferred to the Membersâ national laws to lay down the rules on immunity.
Naturally, there was a logic to all of this and, at that time, given that Parliament was then an assembly of the various national parliaments, the rule had its own , its own justification.
It will have escaped no oneâs attention, however, that today there exists a body of case-law, thanks to universal suffrage, with all the breakthroughs obtained in the meantime, while Parliament itself has not stood still.
There is also a determined attitude on the part of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which during the last parliamentary term expressed and supported a different need, namely that all Members of the European Parliament should have a common statutory reference, a common organisational reference.
It is clear not only to the Committee on Legal Affairs, but also to Parliament as a whole, how difficult it is for Members to have to refer back to national laws: the United Kingdom has a certain type of legislation, Germany has another, and Italy had yet another one, and then it amended it.
That does not promote credibility and does not result in the European Parliamentâs becoming genuinely autonomous or independent.
Following a great many debates, even you, MadamÂ President, in your current capacity as Chair of this House, will be well aware of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, given that we have debated and approved it within the Committee on Legal Affairs and twice over in this Chamber.

The Council, however, objected to the subjectâs being reincorporated into the primary legislation, so we amended the part of the statute that related to Parliamentâs organisational aspects; an albeit difficult management exercise followed, which subsequently yielded a result: the Council â and here is the crux of the issue MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen â endeavoured to convene an intergovernmental meeting of the Member States, including all of the various countries, in order to be able to ratify what we had decided in Parliament.
I believe that we have now struck a very important balance: we have debated and we have very astutely bestowed on the Members of the European Parliament as a whole prerogatives that enhance the role of Parliament and increase its independence.
Obviously, since the Councilâs commitment already dates back to May 2005 and we are now practically in May 2006, our intention, in submitting this question, was to seek a swift conclusion.
Since our fellow Member, MrÂ Donnez, was already aware of this need 20 years ago and, as Parliamentâs vote has shown, it has remained important and crucial, the Council needs immediately to ratify what we have decided and established.
We have taken a great leap forward; when this is recognised we will undoubtedly be able to bestow on Members of the European Parliament a much more important and much more precious role.
As you well know, MadamÂ President, the section of the statue that we approved was the less important part.
I said in that debate â and I repeat it today â that this is a fundamental issue that affects our rules and enhances the European Parliament and our role, especially our role.
The request to the Council is directed along those lines, and I hope that Parliament as a whole takes account of this request and that each group and each MEP, even on an individual basis, supports it, because only in this way will it be possible to exert pressure on the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Gargani, in answer to your question, I should like to start by saying that I am happy to repeat what has already been said in the past: the Council welcomes the adoption, in July of last year, following lengthy negotiations, of a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament that will guarantee Members the same conditions for exercising their mandate with effect from 2009, in other words in the next parliamentary period.
In a statement on the Statute, the Council did indeed state that it was, in principle, prepared to examine the possibility of amending the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities for Members of the European Parliament when the Statute was adopted.
It goes without saying that the Council will stand by this statement, and I would stress that we are still prepared to look into this matter even though, as you know, the Statute will not enter into force until 2009 when the next European Parliament is formed.
With regard to the question on convening an Intergovernmental Conference, I would first of all point out that the procedure is laid down in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union and that, under that article, the government of any Member State or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded.
Under paragraph 2 of that article, a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States shall be convened by the President of the Council if the Council, after consulting the European Parliament and, where appropriate, the Commission, delivers an opinion in favour of calling such a conference.
Those are the rules in the Treaty on European Union.
As the representative of the Council, however, I should like to raise a point for consideration when examining the question of whether the conditions for convening an Intergovernmental Conference have been met.
If we were to hold such a conference at the present time, we would be interrupting the period of reflection devoted to a fundamental examination of the goals and future of Europe.
I will leave open the question of whether it would be appropriate to convene an Intergovernmental Conference solely for the purpose of amending the privileges and immunities of the Members of the European Parliament.
I must admit that, from our point of view, it is doubtful whether a conference dealing solely with Members' privileges and immunities would be helpful at the moment in increasing public confidence in the European Parliament; we feel it would be more likely to meet with incomprehension.
From the wording of today's question, the Council assumes that, in other respects, the European Parliament does not intend to make any new proposals regarding content, but confirms the wishes of the last Parliament.
This is important for our future work.
In any case, as you know, it is the privilege of the representatives of the governments of the Member States at an Intergovernmental Conference to decide the basis on which their debates will be held.
It goes without saying that the Presidency of the Council cannot, at this point, predict what an autonomous Intergovernmental Conference might decide.
Nevertheless, I wanted to bring these rather more general considerations into the debate.
It is not a question of whether or not the Council is willing to fulfil a commitment it has made: of course it is willing to do so.
The question, though, is whether now is the right time to take such a step solely for the purpose of amending the Treaties with regard to privileges and immunities.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the political Europe that we want to build requires a new institutional and legal order, covering the statutory rules for Members of the European Parliament.
Every Parliament has a Special Statute for Members detailing the values of autonomy and representation, yet the Special Statute for Members of the European Parliament goes further.
It helps us to understand Parliament's significance in the development of the political European Union.
A single Membersâ statute, with an appropriate privileges and immunity regime, is an essential prerequisite for an increasingly well-integrated political Union, whose system of large-scale representation is based on principles of democracy.
The System of Membersâ privileges and immunities is an integral part of the fabric of the Statute.
It is separate from the context of the privileges and immunities of other servants of the Union, and must not be allowed to fragment into the preferences of each Member State.
The question that Parliament is asking the Council today is not merely formal in nature.
Its purpose is to highlight the difference between a concept of Europe as an integrated democratic structure with Parliament at its centre and a concept of Europe as a fragmented structure.
Furthermore, the review of the system of privileges and immunities forms part of a commitment made by the Council.
The possibility of holding an intergovernmental conference, now or at some point in the future, could be discussed.
It is clear that there is a need to match the desired adjustment to the Statute of the Privileges and Immunities Regime.
We are also sure that the Intergovernmental Conference must hear Parliamentâs voice, both now and in the future.
Â Â  . I agree with the suggestion of ChairmanÂ Gargani, that the importance of the MEP Statute is an issue that we should address.
I find it extremely regretful that over the past long decades Parliament has not managed to solve satisfactorily, at its own proposal, this important issue and the status of its Members.
I believe we must give Parliament the right to regulate, at its own initiative, the legal status.
Let us remind ourselves that the European Parliament is the only European Union body that is elected directly, constituting an embodiment of the will of European citizens and national sovereignty, and as such, it plays a crucial role in reducing the democratic deficit of the European institutional system, in creating a citizensâ Europe and overcoming estrangement from the institutions of the European Union.
The importance of holding the Intergovernmental Conference is unequivocal, and instead of arguing, it would be preferable to leave behind all conflicts of interest that are hindering it, because this is a very important issue, indeed.
The falling turnouts at European elections and the â hopefully only transient â halt of the European Constitutional process, as well as the failure of the French and Dutch national vote all show that the realisation of the European idea among citizens is now more urgent than ever before.
However, until there is a possibility for a satisfactory resolution of the status, the regrettable events experienced at the end of the last cycle may occur again, accompanied by the diminishing trust of citizens.
Therefore, I propose that we include the adoption of the MEP Statute in our agenda as soon as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, today we are debating changes to the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of Members of the European Parliament.
In my opinion, we should focus first and foremost on amending the law on immunity for Members as quickly as possible.
The situation we are currently faced with is far from ideal.
We have as many different regulations within the European Union as we have Member States.
Each country has different rules.
This is compatible with neither the principle of equal treatment nor the timely investigation of such matters by Parliamentâs Committee on Legal Affairs.
We should put in place a uniform system which is the same for Members from all the countries within the European Union.
Regulations of this kind would also make it impossible to employ the sorts of practices that we have had to deal with on more than one occasion, whereby governments in individual countries have levelled groundless accusations at Members as part of their campaign against an inconvenient opposition.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that the representative of the Council, MrÂ Winkler, has responded quite correctly to the situation we are faced with today: we have not yet been able to approve the Constitution and, furthermore, if we were to hold a debate at this point on the privileges and immunities of the Members of the European Parliament, we would probably find that the majority of European public opinion would not be prepared to guarantee the Members of the Parliament the immunities and privileges that we have today.
At the moment, I, as a Member of the European Parliament â and I mean this quite honestly â would prefer not to have any privilege or any immunity: I would prefer to be treated like any citizen of the European Union.
And I also say this because, in the past, during the last term in office in fact, this Parliament abused its powers in the field of privileges and immunity to cover up certain kinds of criminal activity.
I believe that there are two possibilities at the moment.
If the judiciary in each of the Member States is independent and partial, then that is the best guarantee we can have; there are certain countries that do not recognise any privileges, there are at least two or three that do not recognise them.
If we were to open up the debate on the Statute at this stage, I believe that what this Parliament would probably have to propose would be quite simply the removal of any kind of privilege or immunity for Members of the European Parliament that is not enjoyed by all of the citizens as a whole.
If the citizens are expected to answer to the justice system and put their trust in it, I do not see why the Members of the European Parliament should have any privileged treatment.
In any event, I agree with the words of MrÂ Winkler, who has expressed the legal point of view and who is right: this is not the time to open up a debate and an Intergovernmental Conference on the subject and, if it were to do so, we in this Parliament would have to reconsider the situation from the point of view of our relations with the citizens.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in my speech earlier, I forgot to say something, which in my opinion belongs to the field of European law: immunities are not a privilege of individual Members, but belong to the institution as a whole.
I believe that this aspect derives from historical tradition and from the primary meaning of immunity.
It really must be said, ladies and gentlemen, that to say otherwise or to seek exceptions to this rule is demagogic.
We have already approved and debated it many times, in committee and in Parliament, and we have established a provision.
If the Council had been diligent, and if the Presidencies of the various previous half-yearly periods had been too, then this provision would now already have been ratified by the Council.
Given that this privilege enhances Parliament's role and increases its independence, if the Council were to include it on the agenda, it might not only be a great credit to the Presidency-in-Office, but could perhaps even pave the way for a constitution.
The brake put on the convention or the difficulties that the convention faces in being adopted in Europe must not compromise the role vested in Parliament as a whole.
On the other hand, national references exist, but they count for little, as the European Parliament is elected by universal suffrage.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make one thing quite clear â my comments should of course not be seen as a rejection of MEPs' rightful privileges.
They exist in all of our states, they have their justification, and it goes without saying that the Council recognises that.
As the Presidency of the Council, we will of course submit the wish expressed here to the Member States, referring to all elements including the statement that has already been cited here several times.
