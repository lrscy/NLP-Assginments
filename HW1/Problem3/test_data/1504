Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I often take part in this Question Time and I find it shameful that recently this has become a routine excuse: the representative of the Council informs us in advance that they must leave the Chamber urgently.
Since it has become routine, this sounds â it shames me to say it â a little like a kind of subterfuge by know-alls.
I therefore support the proposed agenda of the Conference of Presidents, which sets the length of Question Time in accordance with our Rules of Procedure: an hour and a half.
I am going to put my supplementary question, since I have the right to do so, which relates to Question No 17, relating to an enormous tragedy.
My supplementary question...
Â Â  Mrs Izquierdo, the Council is not present.
Â Â  Within the meaning of the Rules of Procedure I have the right to put it.
It relates to Question No 17 and says: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, following this tragedy, has the European Union acted in relation to Morocco in view of the fact that the Kingdom of Morocco has reacted positively through the measures it has adopted recently?
Â Â  Yes, MrÂ President, I obviously support the opinion of the two previous speakers that it is indeed deplorable that the Council is treating Parliament â if you will forgive my putting it like this â in a rather offhand manner.
This situation is all the more regrettable because we all have obviously very important questions to put to the Council and because we are awaiting its reply.
I shall not repeat my question about the banning â improper, in my view â of a Basque newspaper, issued nine months ago by a judge, apparently under the influence of the Spanish Ministry of the Interior.
For nine months, there has been no sense of urgency at all about discovering the reasons behind this obvious infringement of freedom of expression in connection with a newspaper â the only daily in the Basque language which, I would point out, is the most ancient language on our continent.
Such a situation seems to me to have disastrous implications for freedoms.
The concept of security is taking over our European Union, to the detriment of freedoms, and that is something I deplore.
I should have liked the Council to have provided some explanations regarding this point.
They would certainly have said to me in reply what they said to my fellow MEP, MrÂ Wynn, in which case I should have reminded them of what my colleague, MrsÂ McKenna, pointed out to them on the subject of the Treaty of Nice.
Â Â  Mr Mayol, the Council will reply in writing, as it is obliged to do.
Â Â  â Mr President, one reason why I would ask that we be given statistics on the Councilâs attendance during the course of the last Presidencies is that I believe that the press would find it very interesting to see with what assiduity the Council attends the sittings of this House.
Â Â  I am almost certain that we will deal with your request because it is positive and welcome that we should have statistical knowledge of the situation.
I would remind you that in the Bureau of Parliament this evening from 7.30 p.m. we are going to hold a debate on Question Time and also the Conference of Presidents will have news.
As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 13 to 32 will be replied to in writing (4).
That concludes Question Time to the Council.
(5)
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the second report (A5-0370/2003) by Mr QueirÃ³, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions European Defence Industrial and market issues Towards an EU Defence Equipment Policy (COM(2003) 113 2003/2096(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, given that the Unionâs Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence launched the European Arms Agency at the beginning of this week with considerable media coverage, I am sorry to see how discreetly our Parliament is promoting this important debate, which has been incomprehensibly moved to the quiet of this cold Thursday night.
This is a contrast in which, as a Member of the European Parliament, I take no pride.
Having said this, I wish, of course, to express my thanks to my colleagues from the other political groups for the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that I was shown from the outset in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
This approach enabled us to adopt a balanced, coherent and, therefore, credible report.
The only reason I cannot claim to be totally satisfied is because the amendment I tabled to have the reportâs fifteenth and final paragraph removed was not successful.
I believe that Parliament would do well to acknowledge that defence is an enormously sensitive field in political terms and currently falls directly within the competence of the Member States.
Calling for codecision for industrial policy in the field of defence equipment is not realistic and affects the balance reached in the committee.
I would therefore ask my fellow Members to accept the proposal that I tabled to have the paragraph removed.
Mr President, despite the fact that the European Union has already demonstrated its willingness to assume, in addition to the financial contribution it makes, further responsibilities for managing and undertaking peacekeeping operations â as we are currently seeing, for example, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - weaknesses and shortcomings still remain.
Like the conflict in the Balkans, the war in Afghanistan clearly demonstrated the disparities that remain between the United States and Europe in the field of military capability and of defence technology.
This difference in capability must, therefore, be reduced, in order to achieve a more balanced transatlantic cooperation, thereby increasing stability and security in the euro-Atlantic area.
Increasing the Unionâs military capability does not, however, mean that we need, straightaway, to create new structures and devote more financial resources to developing this policy in practice.
We all know that the overall spending by Member States on defence is around half of what the USA spends, but that, in terms of military capability, this percentage falls to around 10%.
In this context, one might conclude that the budgetary resources the Member States allocate to defence capability are insufficient.
On the contrary, because the Union does not have the same needs or the same strategic objectives as the United States, it is in a position to meet its needs with the financial means it has currently.
This is primarily a question of Europeâs making better use of the financial resources available to it, and I will tell you how this can be done.
Major changes have already taken place or are now taking place in the national defence-related industries in various European countries, in a concerted effort to improve the management of their industrial arms policies.
The European Union, therefore, has an obligation to promote these attempts at approximation with the aim of ensuring the interoperability of means both at intra-European and transatlantic levels, in order to avoid pointless and wasteful duplication and overlapping.
Furthermore, prudent harmonisation between regulations for the defence equipment market and for the civilian market is desirable, particularly in the case of the countless companies that produce for both markets at the same time.
It is clear, however, that defence equipment is not a product like any other and should be treated differently.
A first step in this direction could be to simplify the administrative formalities governing intra-Community transfers of defence products, and gradually to harmonise national licensing systems.
If these attempts to streamline are to succeed, there must be better coordination between Member States.
Therefore, as I said at the beginning of my speech, we welcome the decision that has just been taken by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence to accept the objective of making the European Arms Agency operational as of June 2004.
To bring my speech to a close, I shall take this opportunity to summarise the main conclusions of the report that we will be voting on tomorrow.
These are: increasing European military capability, so as to ensure the credibility of its foreign and defence policy objectives; improving the interoperability of defence equipment, at both intra-European and transatlantic levels, with a view to guaranteeing the security and stability of Europe and of the Atlantic area; establishing, in this framework, conditions favourable to developing a competitive and viable European defence equipment industry; better use of public monies in this field, in particular to prevent overlapping, by promoting industrial and technological interdependency and research linked to this sector; involving the new enlargement countries in this process of industrial reconversion; promoting adequate rules governing competition and security of supply while taking account of the gradual opening up of the arms markets; creating financial support measures for new defence equipment, in particular to develop equipment to protect the Unionâs external borders, including its maritime borders; and, finally, the need to improve parliamentary monitoring and follow-up mechanisms for security and defence policy at both levels at which it is implemented - the European and the national levels - with the appropriate involvement of the respective parliamentary representations.
In todayâs world, which is threatened by terrorism, security has become a global and indivisible concept, quite different to traditional concepts of security.
The obligation incumbent on the European Union and on its Member States is, consequently, in cooperation with their allies, to streamline their military and arms capabilities and at the same time increase resources for diplomatic cooperation, for the information services and also for police and judicial cooperation in a genuine synergy of national and trans-national policies.
This report on the defence industries seeks to contribute to enhancing the climate of collective security that we would all like to see.
Support from my fellow Members of this Parliament will give it the political clout needed to bring about the changes it recommends.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrÂ QueirÃ³ for his excellent report on the Commission communication on issues related to the defence industry and market.
In its resolution of April 2002, the European Parliament urged the Commission to address industry- and market-related issues in the context of the European defence industry.
Developments in recent years, such as the gradual piecing together of a European security and defence policy, and changes in the industry itself have set the scene for a re-evaluation of the issue, which a few years ago was considered premature.
The Commission is perfectly aware of the sensitivity of this area and of the specific characteristics of the defence sector.
Consequently, we adopted a cautious approach, focusing on the prospects for developing Europeâs industrial and technological potential in the long term and stating our determination to make a substantial contribution to the efforts of the European Union, wherever possible.
As everyone knows, we presented proposals for practical action, in particular on research in the field of security and defence and on developing a European defence equipment market.
Our proposals were well received by the Member States and I am pleased because the Commission has now been implementing some of these decisions since March of this year.
In this context, I should like to emphasise that an impact assessment study is currently being conducted on the issue of simplifying intra-Community transfers of defence equipment.
As regards the issue of calls for tender, a Green Paper is being prepared to open the debate on a set of adequate rules for the profitable acquisition of goods and services by the Member Statesâ defence procurement agencies and by the future European Agency in an entirely compatible and integrated way.
The joint efforts in the field of standardization with the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in order to draw up a European manual that can be applied to defence contracts are continuing; the principles for undertaking economic control of the defence industry and market in the enlarged European Union have been delineated; and there has been a change of approach to controlling the export of dual-use products, in the broader context of European Union strategy and of the action plan to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
With regard to research issues, I should like to inform you that the Commission is putting the finishing touches to a communication on preparatory action for increasing European industrial potential related to research in the field of security for the period 2004-2006.
At the beginning of next year, a call for tender will be published.
A group of experts has been set up with the aim of advising and assisting the Commission in this task, which we hope will contribute to a substantial European research programme in the field of security, from 2007 onwards.
Mr QueirÃ³âs report broadly supports the Commissionâs approach of strengthening the European defence base in industrial and technological matters, by gradually establishing a European defence equipment market and by promoting research in the field of security.
He welcomes, in particular, the proposals for standardization, the rules for public tenders and for intra-Community transfers, emphasising as regards the latter the link with controlling arms exports at the Unionâs external borders and, in particular, Parliamentâs proposals for an EU code of conduct.
The report welcomes the idea of pilot projects to be undertaken in research and development in the field of security.
All of these suggestions encourage the Commission in its action and we also feel encouraged by the favourable opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the creation of the common European market for defence equipment and its explicit support for various proposals by the Commission in this area.
As far as the creation of an agency in the field of defence is concerned, following on from the mandate given by the Thessaloniki European Council, the Member States, through the Council, asked the Commission to clarify how the Community could work with and/or within the future agency so as to maximise synergies in pursuing common objectives.
The Commission reacted favourably to this request and can today confirm its desire and willingness to contribute to this task, using the means already presented in the communication of March of this year, which is the subject of todayâs debate.
In this spirit, the Commission plans to be involved in the Agencyâs development and operations, to help it to achieve its objectives, as defined by the European Council.
To conclude, I should like to emphasise the Commissionâs appreciation and hopes for the European Parliamentâs support for MrÂ QueirÃ³âs report, and for close collaboration with the Member States, in order to move ahead in an area that presents many challenges.
European citizens and taxpayers are entitled to hope that we are moving towards greater effectiveness in the defence sector and towards greater credibility for European security and defence policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is no coincidence if, on the eve of the vote on the resolution prepared by our estimable fellow MEP, MrÂ QueirÃ³, we are able, as he has just reminded us, to share his delight at the announcement last Monday of the decision by the External Relations Council to create the European Defence Agency and to ask a team responsible for establishing this Agency to propose the relevant legal, institutional and financial arrangements.
Thanks to the impact of the Iraq crisis, we have in fact been able, throughout last year, to see a new convergence between Parliamentâs, the Commissionâs and the Councilâs approaches to common foreign and security policy.
We may therefore begin to hope that, in this area at least, the progress made by the Convention will not be fundamentally called into question by the expected decisions of the Intergovernmental Conference.
That being said, I include among these instances of progress the resolution to make a better job of spending the funds allocated by the various Member States to their defence, avoiding the present dissipation of effort in terms of research, development and the production of equipment necessary to the modernisation of the armed forces.
With this in mind, we must hope, Commissioner, that, as our rapporteur requests, the Commission communication entitled âIndustrial and Market Issues â Towards an EU Defence Equipment Policyâ will present â as I hope, and am sure, it will do â a favourable framework for increased cooperation.
I think it important to emphasise the fact that the opening up of national markets, which will thus have been made necessary, must be aimed not only at bringing about greater savings â which goes without saying â but also at guaranteeing security of supplies at national and European levels.
I am well aware that this is a difficult need to satisfy, particularly for states which â like my own country, France â have so far made sure they retained as much independence as possible in this area.
One of the Agencyâs priorities should consist of proposing, for this purpose, the necessary changes to the current Treaty provisions.
That being said, let us be very wary of being satisfied with the impact of creating this much-vaunted Agency.
Let us not forget that, prior to this, there existed OCCAR â the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation â which, at least to my knowledge, has never been able to be very active, for want of possessing the minimum Community budget needed for it to be effective.
Let us be aware, ladies and gentlemen â particularly those of you in the Committee on Budgets â that, if we wish to progress beyond vague desires, we must lose no time in reflecting upon these issues and amending the 2004 budget to include the sums required if the Agencyâs activities are to take off.
Nor must we forget to provide our High Representative with the resources he needs in order to take action since, according to the Councilâs proposal, it is he who will assume the direction of the Agency.
I was happy to hear, Commissioner, that, like ourselves, you are convinced of the need to give priority, in the area with which we are concerned, to research and that it is perhaps at this level that we could undertake the type of pilot project you mooted.
In order to give our enlarged Europe the place expected of it on the international scene, it has, finally, to be given the resources for taking action.
As we have said, we need, therefore, to make a better job of spending, but we shall also definitely need to spend more.
It is not easy for someone with political responsibility to acknowledge this truth, particularly at a time when it is so difficult to balance the budgets.
I would therefore take this opportunity to salute the courage of the rapporteur and of all those within the committee who have backed his report by having written, or agreed, that the persistent refusal of many Member States to increase their defence expenditure is in danger of jeopardising the European Unionâs military capability and the very coherence of its action within NATO.
As I have said before in this House, MrÂ President and Commissioner, let us not forget the old French adage about false economy, widely heard in pre-Revolutionary France: no money, no Switzerland.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ QueirÃ³âs report and the Commission communication are along the lines of our previous parliamentary resolutions, adopted since 1984, on European security and defence policy.
The Commission communication and this report have come at a good time for continuing the progress it has already been decided should be made by the ESDP, notably since the Cologne European Council in June 1999.
Since then, new bodies have indeed been put in place: the PSC (Political and Security Committee), the Military Committee, the Military Staff and others placed variously alongside the High Representative responsible for foreign policy.
It has been decided to set up a rapid reaction force of 60Â 000 men.
Several conferences have been held to evaluate our military capability and deficiencies.
Throughout this period, a lot has therefore been done, but an observation, remarked upon many times, has also been made, namely that our defence industries are in great need of reform, without which we shall continue to waste funds by using them to no purpose.
I shall not refer again to the various analyses and wishes expressed both by the Commission and by our rapporteur.
I share them unreservedly, MrÂ QueirÃ³, apart from your desire that we vote in favour of your AmendmentÂ 1.
I cannot help but like paragraphÂ 15, and I shall therefore vote against your wishes, for which I am sorry.
Allow me to emphasise one point, because it is important and also because it is topical, as pointed out before me by MrÂ QueirÃ³ and MrÂ Morillon.
It concerns the creation of the European Armaments Agency.
For a long time, the European Parliament has â inevitably, given what has just been said â expressed its support for creating such an Agency.
We shall again express our support tomorrow by voting in favour of this report and of an excellent amendment tabled on this subject, that is to say the Agency, by MrÂ vonÂ Wogau.
Matters have, I am very pleased to say, proceeded quickly, however, especially since good news from Europe is pretty rare at present.
Last Monday, a joint decision by the foreign ministers, including those of the new Member States, in fact launched this Agency, which had been decided upon in principle at the Thessaloniki Summit and which must therefore begin its work in January 2004.
That is good news.
Let us hope that, despite the inevitable obstacles and resistance, this Agency will be a success.
It should, I hope, go beyond the OCCAR â the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation â which was a big disappointment.
This European Agency will have a broad range of tasks.
It will have to concern itself with military capability, in terms of armaments and equipment, but also â and it is my turn to be emphatic â with research, which is a vital sector, to say the least, but one that has been rather neglected, not only by the European Union but also by its Member States.
I listened to you very carefully just now, Commissioner.
I hope that the Commission will continue in the vein you have just indicated.
In its favour, this Agency has the political will of those who are creating it and placing it alongside the Council of Ministers.
What it also has in its favour is support from industrialists, who are perfectly aware of the need to work together at European and intra-European levels and who have already, moreover, begun to combine of their own accord.
The Agency is supported by the European Parliament and the Commission.
In short, a lot of good fairies are present at its birth.
It will need their help in order to grow and have the prosperous life we wish for it, as well as for European security and defence policy as a whole.
Â Â  Mr President, the Green Group very much opposes the idea that military research projects should be financed by the EU budget.
We feel it is totally unacceptable to propose that European citizens should be asked to pay even more for military expenditure, when we should be going in the opposite direction and ensuring that European citizens' money is used for the good of society and mankind as a whole, not for destruction.
We have tabled amendments to that effect.
We firmly believe that this report, and the Commission communication on which it is based, are being pushed forward by the vested interests of the European military industrial lobbies, who are clearly the real policy makers.
They have the unquestioning ear of the EU institutions, which appear to jump to their commands and do what they want.
This report supports the European Arms Agency, established last Monday by the Council of Ministers.
The military industrial lobby has even succeeded in having this agency included in the draft EU Constitution.
The inclusion in any constitution of a military agency whose aim is to promote common military procurement and to improve the arms industry's efficiency just beggars belief.
Regardless of whether one is in favour of or against an EU Constitution, there is absolutely no justification for the inclusion of an agency that promotes the tools of death and destruction.
There is also the question as to why this particular agency was selected for inclusion in the draft Constitution rather than, for example, a conflict prevention agency, which my group would have supported.
At the EU summit in Thessaloniki, the Irish Prime Minister, Mr Ahern, gave his backing to the establishment of this EU arms agency.
I was shocked that the leader of a so-called neutral country, in which there is strong public opposition to the immoral arms trade, could give the go-ahead for such an agency.
The decision could not have been adopted without the agreement of all the Heads of State.
Our government clearly failed to stop this very dangerous and unacceptable decision, even though it had it within its power to do so.
It was clear from the presidency's conclusions that one of the main objectives of this decision is to strengthen the EU arms industries and make them more competitive on the global stage.
It beggars belief that, at a time when EU leaders are talking about reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction and making the world a safer place, they could agree to such a strategy.
The presidency conclusions stated that this agency, which will be subject to Council authority and open to participation by all Member States, will aim to develop defence capabilities in crisis management, promote and enhance European armaments cooperation, strengthen the European defence industrial technology base and create a competitive European defence equipment market, as well as promoting, in liaison with the Community, research activities, where appropriate, aimed at leadership in strategic technologies for future defence and security capabilities, and thereby strengthening Europe's potential in this area.
This is heading in totally the wrong direction.
It is clear that these decisions are geared towards the vested interests of the European arms industries and that progress and research are going to be diverted away from useful aims towards products that kill and destroy people, rather than products that make the world a better place.
The Irish Government's failure is a national scandal and one of the worst decisions that any Irish government leader has taken since 1990, when our Minister for Finance backed increased low-interest loans to the nuclear industry.
Another point I would like to raise during this debate is the issue of low-frequency active sonar.
My Group tabled two amendments on this report to underline that, apart from being against the development of weapons in general, we are very much against the development of military technology, the use of which is damaging to the environment.
We firmly believe that, as was proposed last year, a ban should be put on the use of high-frequency sonar to detect submarines, but this very advanced technology is currently being used by the navies of NATO countries and the US in European military exercises.
There are major problems, even at the experimental phase.
The noise of these sonars kills whales and other species of marine life because it disturbs their orientation systems.
This is completely unacceptable.
EU research money should be used for ecologically responsible peaceful projects, rather than for this.
I shall finish with a comment on the EADS, which is the European Aeronautics Defence and Space Company, the second largest aerospace and defence company in the world.
Its CEO bemoans the fact that the US already invests six times as much as Europe in armaments and research.
Whilst research budgets in the US continue to rise, those in Europe remain stagnant.
Why people have to criticise this is beyond me.
This is something we should be welcoming.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, to have the opportunity to defend my honour.
MrsÂ McKenna said that this report was the product of the defence or arms industry lobbies and I wish to state that, as far as I and indeed my colleagues are concerned, no lobby...
Â Â  I would say to the rapporteur that the Presidency will give you the floor at the end of the debate.
This is not the appropriate time for you to speak.
I take note of your request and I will give you the floor at the end of the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, it is clear that if we want to develop credible cooperation in the field of defence in the future I will not anticipate here the form it will take, its limits or its future legal status it will be necessary for the States involved to provide each other with mutual support in the field of military equipment.
However, the Commission's communication of 11 March 2003 on this subject is disappointing for three main reasons.
Firstly, it deals with the issue of the arms industries essentially from the point of view of the market and competition, because it is obviously in this field that it has a degree of competence.
This is, however, an extremely reductionist point of view, because in this area security concerns are and must remain predominant.
Lower costs in the acquisition of equipment is an important consideration, certainly, particularly in a period of budget deficit, but it is not the only one, far from it.
For the sake of their security, the States must remain the sole masters of their considerations.
This has always been recognised within the meaning of Article 296 of the EC Treaty, which is retained in the same form, I would remind you, in Article 342 of the third part of the draft European Constitution.
Secondly, the Commission communication shows an excessive tendency towards communitisation, with codecision, and also by creating a Community framework for defence equipment which would apparently centre on the Arms Agency.
Such communitisation is in no way in the interests of cooperation in the field of defence, which requires intergovernmental relations and variable geometries, under the control of national parliaments, so that the Member States are not discouraged from participating in it.
I am pleased, incidentally, that this Arms Agency, which is in the process of being launched, finally, on the basis of Article 17 of the EU Treaty, is of an intergovernmental nature.
Thirdly, I have found in paragraph 6 of the report by Mr QueirÃ³ â and I congratulate him very warmly on this â a key notion, which is absent from the Commission communication, and also from the draft European Constitution, which is the notion of Community preference.
Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I do not understand how we can both want a European arms agency, intended in particular to promote and coordinate harmonisation of military equipment, and not at the same time commit the Member States to buying this equipment.
This European preference must clearly remain flexible, since high-tech military equipment is not the same as agricultural products and, as I have already said, the States must retain control of their security.
Therefore, even if this cannot be laid down in a strictly legal sense, there should at least be a statement of intention to this effect somewhere.
I would thank Mr QueirÃ³ once again for having stated this clearly.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr QueirÃ³'s report has to some extent been overtaken by events, in that on Monday the Council took the decision to create an EU Defence Capabilities Agency.
I wonder if this might not prove to be a contradiction in terms, as I see little evidence that many European countries have the political will to improve their defence capabilities or to provide the necessary additional financial resources for this.
As so often in Commission communications and reports in this House, the solution that is offered to a particular problem is to extend EU competence.
That is our fundamental objection here.
The emphasis, as always, is on creating the institutions of an EU defence industrial policy, rather than meeting military equipment needs and industrial requirements.
The consistent failure of many European states to spend more on defence not only undermines the transatlantic alliance, but also damages our defence industries.
Our armed forces need the best state-of-the-art interoperable equipment for their difficult tasks.
Defence industrial link-ups and collaborations should be with the most advantageous partners, wherever they might be.
I am therefore very suspicious of any mention of Community preference when it comes to activities by European countries in this field.
There are serious deficiencies in the equipment and organisation of the armed forces in many European countries.
The argument that there is duplication of effort among individual European countries and that economies of scale, as well as improved interoperability, would inevitably follow from a more harmonised EU defence procurement system is therefore seductive.
But where is the reassurance that this is the motivation for an EU role in defence procurement, rather than - in terms of Western solidarity - a divisive intention that lies at the heart of ESDP?
Given that just six countries in Europe account for more than 90% of Europe's defence industrial capabilities and 98% of all R[amp]D expenditure, it is a peculiar logic to suggest that the representatives of 15 countries - let alone of 25 - should be involved in decision-making and monitoring in this area.
The QueirÃ³ report insists on the need for the EU to endow itself with military capabilities so as to ensure the credibility of its foreign and defence policy objectives.
Is this not the true aim of the agency and an EU defence equipment policy, rather than the improvement of European defence industries and the development of our military capabilities?
Heaven forbid that the British armed forces should come to rely on obtaining their vital munitions and combat equipment needs from sources under the direction of Brussels.
Â Â  Mr President, it is true that tonight's debate comes after Monday's Council decision in favour of a European Defence Capabilities Agency but I welcome that decision, as I welcome Mr QueirÃ³'s report.
I am pleased that the report reaffirms that NATO is the cornerstone of Europe's collective defence, recognising that 11 of our existing EU Member States - 19 in the enlarged EU from next year - are members of both bodies.
But if we want the EU to make a serious military contribution to the Petersberg task of peacekeeping and peacemaking, the European security and defence policy needs to be underpinned by a credible ability for EU nations to conduct military operations when NATO as a whole is not engaged.
For those who want a greater EU role in global affairs vis-Ã -vis the United States, it is absolutely right to state that Europe is tied to US support for every military initiative and operation.
That is why it is important in this debate to support the creation of a European Defence Agency, an agency that should be primarily focused on developing European military capabilities and establishing a framework for measuring them.
Importantly, in the context of tonight's debate it will also have a wider commitment to promote cost-effective procurement and competition.
I say to the previous speaker from the British Conservatives, who sees in every action a conspiracy to increase EU competence, that it is in Britain's as well as in Europe's interests to create a truly competitive, internal defence market.
British industry has always been one of the most competitive and open.
There are many examples, such as the recent A 400 M contract, where simpler and clearer administrative procedures for procurement would have been welcome.
I look forward to firms and employment in Britain, including in my region, the east of England, which is the second most defence-dependent in the United Kingdom, benefiting from this opening up of markets.
That brings me to my final point.
Although tonight's debate focuses on defence equipment industries and procurement, we must not forget the importance of increasing civilian capabilities for the prevention of conflict.
The importance of trying to build a sustainable peace also requires serious action on conflict prevention and post-conflict strategy.
I am very pleased to see progress on this aspect too and its inclusion in the Council conclusions from Monday.
Â Â  At times, it is said that when the European Union cannot create a policy it creates an agency, and this is the risk that we are facing: tackling military and defence policies from a business and competition perspective.
If, then, we act from a European protectionist standpoint, the risk is even greater.
The objective should be to draw up, as Europe, an innovative security and defence policy promoting stability and peace and opposing dictators: this should be our policy.
The rapporteur mentioned the need to control the export of arms to third countries, and I am thinking in particular of dictatorships.
This type of control is not being carried out at present in Europe: on the contrary, we are giving arms to dictators the world over.
Another point regards civil expenditure.
The European Union is not doing enough about this; indeed, it is doing almost nothing.
The Commission maintains that we must not copy the United States.
Of course, but so as not to copy the United States, it would mean seeing if we could convert our military expenditure and structures into civil expenditure and structures, which could, perhaps, complementÂ âÂ not compete with or be an alternative to but complementÂ âÂ those of the United States.
Â Â  Mr President, like my colleague, Mr Van Orden, I am not persuaded of the necessity or the efficacity of European defence.
However, we must recognise one fact: sooner or later Joe Public in the United States is going to wake up one morning and ask why it is that 3.2 cents of every dollar he pays to Uncle Sam goes to European defence.
It is a good question.
If I were an elected representative in Washington I would find it hard to answer.
It seems we are all agreed that we have to take greater responsibility for our defence, whether as independent nation states, or under the banner of Europe, or as partners in NATO - which I favour.
Whatever the route, we will have to increase defence spending.
If we were to continue procurement as we do now, we would have to increase tax by between 3% and 4%.
As an elected politician, I would prefer not to have to tell that to my voters.
It comes down to more bang for our buck.
In order to do that we must rationalise our defence spending, as Mr QueirÃ³'s report has pointed out.
However, we must face two realities: first, the best and biggest bang may involve buying outside the EU.
For example, the A 400 military transport may be a worthy successor to the Hercules, with a greater capability, when it flies, but the only long-range heavy lift aircraft in Europe today are the Boeing/McDonnell Douglas C17s leased, not owned, by the Royal Air Force.
I am sure that all the various attack helicopters have their good points, but spending money on developing four of them wholly or in part is folly.
And the list goes on: communications equipment, next generation missiles, remotely piloted vehicles, etc. But the worst example of duplication is the next generation fighter.
The Eurofighter Typhoon is a superb aircraft.
Millions of euros have been invested by four European countries and the weapons systems built around it.
But it is not the only European fighter on offer.
Dassault is selling the Rafale.
Why am I not surprised that it is the Rafale that meets the requirements of the ?
I am sure that it has nothing to do with supplying the many air forces of the world that have purchased Dassault Mirages with the next generation fighter, at a price that would not be so low were it not for the purchase by the French Air Force.
We must be honest.
We must have a proper evaluation of the role and requirements of our armed forces before we can develop a capability to meet them.
It is only under NATO that this honesty and lack of national partiality can be achieved.
Of course cooperation and economics go hand in hand, but we know that for our troops the equipment and the training are what count.
Hard training makes for easy battles.
We must give our troops the best, both in equipment and training.
We owe them nothing less.
Â Â  I would say to the rapporteur that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, the President can give him the floor at the end of the debate and it is given for one minute and a half, but the debate must not be re-opened, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do not wish to reopen the debate; I simply wish to respond to MrsÂ McKenna, who claims that this report represents a victory for the arms industry lobbies.
The offensiveness of this claim does not deserve a response, but the slur on my good name that it represents forces me to protest.
I have nothing, of course, against MrsÂ McKennaâs opinions, which are bound to differ from my own.
What I cannot accept, however, is her insinuation that I have supposedly acted subserviently to the interests of this sector or even that I represent these interests.
I am quite aware of what to do in the event of a conflict of interest.
Apart from being offensive, this insinuation is false and completely inappropriate to the serious political context in which this debate has taken place.
MrsÂ McKennaâs claim and the disgraceful lack of ethics that it reveals therefore reflect on the person who uttered it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to welcome very briefly the fact that this House to a large extent, I believe, supports the Commission's communication.
I would like to stress that the Commission's initiative in this field relates to 1996 and 1997.
At the time it failed precisely as a result of certain arguments that I have heard once again today in this House.
I would like to draw your attention, however, to the fact that the initiative taken by the Commission following the request from the European Parliament and the Council must be based on the Treaties as they exist at the moment.
While it is true that we are concerned to stress the importance of an economic and industrial basis for the development of this sector at European level, it is also important to stress the responsibilities of the Commission in the field of research and, above all, that this research strategy hinges on the concept of security.
It is not therefore a form of research hinging on the concept of defence.
This is why the Commission is rejecting certain considerations concerning the nature of this research.
I would like to add that even when the debate involves crisis management or conflict prevention, we must not forget that the credibility and effectiveness of crisis management action within the framework of a conflict depends to a large extent on the capacity for military support allowing crises to be managed.
We do not live in an ideal world in which everybody would welcome humanitarian action just like that.
No, humanitarian action, in order to be successful, requires the support of force and it is on this basis that we are in the process of creating a foreign security and defence policy.
The Commission's initiative takes this precise approach, which is our approach, which is the European perspective and which is taken up by the Convention in the draft Constitution.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0397/2003) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe: Second Annual Report (COM(2003) 139 2003/2094(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to clarify three points in my report.
The first point, and probably the most politically controversial, is the final status of Kosovo.
That is a hot potato, which everyone, including Parliament, has preferred to avoid.
Following various discussions in the region, but also with a large number of people here, I have concluded that it is no longer an option to wait any longer, thus delaying the definition of the final status.
If you see what problems Kosovo has now, it becomes increasingly evident that, for example, the socio-economic problems can only be solved if Kosovoâs final status becomes clear.
After all, many investors refuse to invest in Kosovo, because it is uncertain what status that country has.
It is also becoming increasingly clear, sadly, that a process has been started in which the international community, once hailed as a liberator, is increasingly being regarded as an occupier.
This is very close to my heart, because I believe that the work that was done there was sound.
This is, however, the reality in Kosovo and I think that Parliament should also base its conclusions on this.
It is the EUâs responsibility to take the lead to ensure that within a period of â as far as I am concerned â two years, there is clarity with regard to Kosovoâs final status.
It is quite clear to me that this will be a difficult choice.
I also think that the European Union need not make that choice yet, but the Kosovars do need to know that a decision will be taken on their status in two yearsâ time.
I therefore have a double message to give to the Kosovars: we are prepared to give you clarity about your final status in two yearsâ time, but you have to prove to us that you are able to manage your country in a proper manner, that is to say in a manner that embraces a decent minorities policy, including respect for the borders as they currently stand.
If the Kosovars are able to do this, I think that we should say that in two yearsâ time, we are prepared to take a decision on their final status.
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether he can confirm once again what the Commission has already said in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, namely that the European Commission is pleased about â and, as such, is in agreement with â the fact that the European Union is taking the lead in drafting a roadmap, a timeframe â whatever you want to call it â as long as it becomes clear at the end of it what is going to happen with Kosovo.
My second point is about Serbia and Montenegro.
I think that two years ago, Mr Solana had good reasons for trying to keep those two countries together.
That was necessary then to avoid chaos in the region.
Two years have now passed and after trying for one year, those countries have another two years to try to see whether things work out.
I think that now, the conclusion can, and should, be drawn that it is not working.
Nobody, neither in Montenegro, nor in Serbia, is prepared to invest in this new federation, in these new structures.
I think it is therefore appropriate for the European Union to say: we will no longer try to force you into something that neither of you want.
We will adopt a neutral position.
We will leave it up to you to decide, which also means that if we spend our money in Montenegro or Serbia, we will spend it on areas that need to be improved anyway.
There are many of those areas, both in Montenegro and in Serbia, that need funding, irrespective of whether those countries become independent or carry on together.
In conclusion, the final topic.
Now that the committee has reached agreement on the above two points, the following point is now at risk of becoming the controversial point in plenary.
It is about the fact that a number of countries in that region, three to be precise, have concluded a bilateral agreement with the United States to exclude American citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
It is very clear what the report states in this connection.
We regret that Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania have concluded an agreement of that kind.
In our view, this should not have happened.
We applaud, however, the fact that Croatia has not concluded such an agreement.
Moreover, it is laid down that ultimate EU membership of those countries at some point in the future is not compatible with such a bilateral agreement.
Accordingly, my message to you is that you will need to discontinue those bilateral agreements in a few yearsâ time.
However, does that now mean that we need to penalise Albania and Bosnia for concluding such an agreement?
I would specifically address Mr Swoboda in this respect. He has tabled an amendment by means of which, in my view, he seeks to penalise Albania and Bosnia for making that mistake in the past.
Indeed, he wants to rule out an agreement of any kind with those countries, as long as they have this agreement with the United States.
Mr Swoboda, I think you have made a big mistake by saying this.
Like you, I am angry with the United States for having forced those countries into concluding such an agreement, but I do not want to penalise the Albanians and Bosnians for that reason.
In my opinion, we should not hold a competition here in Parliament about who is the biggest fan of the International Criminal Court.
I would remind you that the NGO coalition in favour of the Criminal Court did not ask for this either, and to be honest, I think you are asking too much.
What should matter to us is to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, our criticism of the United States and of those agreements, and, on the other, recognition that we also want to bring those countries closer to Europe in the next couple of years.
We will need an agreement for this.
We must not allow them to become the victim of pressure from the United States.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk for his excellent report on the annual report on the stabilisation and association process produced by the Commission in March 2003.
The Commission and the Council need the full support and commitment of Parliament in our efforts to help these countries with their reforms and in bringing them closer to the European Union.
Mr Lagendijk's report touches upon some of the essential issues in our current relations with the Western Balkans.
We have taken note of all the suggestions made in the report and will consider them carefully.
I would like to comment on some of the specific points raised in the report.
Firstly, financial assistance.
We are grateful for the support expressed in the Thessaloniki agenda for the Commission's proposal to increase the CARDS budget by more than EUR 200 million for the period 2004-2006, and welcome the fact that the Commission's proposal for the 2004 budget has been approved at first reading.
We will also need to reflect carefully on financial assistance for the Western Balkans, in view of the next financial perspectives starting in 2007.
Concerning the visa regime, the peoples of the region attach great importance to this issue.
The Commission will hold discussions with the countries in due course, within the framework of the SAP.
This is a long-term issue, however, and has to be put in a broader context.
Any progress in this area is also linked to the country's ability to implement major reforms in areas such as the rule of law, combating organised crime, corruption and illegal migration, as well as improving administrative capacity, border control and the security of documents.
As regards the Thessaloniki commitments, I believe that work is well under way on implementing our part of the commitments made in Thessaloniki.
I am pleased to report that the framework regulation, which will provide the legal base for the European partnerships, was adopted by the Commission last week.
These partnerships will help the countries to focus their attention on priority areas and will thus contribute to speeding up the European integration process.
Twinning, which involves using the human resources of Member States to help the countries of the Western Balkans, is already being used.
TAIEX, the Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office, which will help these countries harmonise their legislation with the , will be operational in the near future, and preparations to open up participation in Community programmes and agencies are ongoing.
I am pleased to inform you that the feasibility study on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina was adopted by the Commission yesterday.
The study points to both progress and continuing weaknesses.
Against this background, the Commission thinks that it should be able to recommend to the Member States the opening of SAA negotiations when Bosnia-Herzegovina has made sufficient progress in meeting a number of short-term priorities that are central to the implementation of such stabilisation and association agreements.
Croatia's application is being dealt with in accordance with the usual procedures.
We received, within the deadline, more than 10 000 pages of answers from Croatia and if all goes well we hope to finish our work on the opinion by March or April.
We also hope that Croatia will be able to improve in areas which are, by the way, indicated in paragraph 37 of the Lagendijk report.
I note the suggestion of a neutral stance on the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro.
The policy of the European Union is to support the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro for the period of the three years provided by the Belgrade agreement.
The terms of the agreement are that at the end of that period, it is up to Serbia and Montenegro whether they wish to stay together.
The Commission has begun work on a feasibility study for Serbia and Montenegro.
This will be a thorough objective assessment designed to determine whether the countries are ready to start negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement.
As things stand today, we need to see further substantial progress on key issues such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, cooperation and development in the Serbia and Montenegro internal market and a single trade policy, as well as political and economic reforms.
As regards the process leading to the decision of the final status of Kosovo, let me recall that the European Union supports full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1224 and the 'standards before status' policy.
Like the Council, we welcome the intention of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Harry Holkeri, to set out more concrete guidelines for progress, and to implement the 'standards before status' policy on the basis of a work plan to be coordinated with the European Union's monitoring of standards.
We have taken note that the first opportunity for an overall review will be in mid-2005.
2004 is, therefore, an important year for Kosovo's provisional institutions of self-government to consolidate a truly multi-ethnic and democratic society.
Let me reiterate one key point.
Whatever the final status, the people of Kosovo will have their place in Europe.
Â Â  . Madam President, within the framework of the second report on the stabilisation and association process for South-East Europe, the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy supports the Commission proposal and I should like, of course, to congratulate the rapporteur.
We believe that, within the framework of the commitments made by the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, launching European integration partnerships for the Western Balkans merits setting a medium-term objective based on an action plan â this is our proposal â setting out the measures and actions which need to be undertaken by the countries of the Western Balkans and the European Union.
The action plan should contain an enhanced support for institution-building, of course, but also for infrastructure projects and regional trade and economic cooperation projects.
In other words, priority should be given to structural and economic reforms leading to functioning market economies and sustainable development.
The rate of integration into the European Union will obviously depend on the countries themselves.
Nonetheless, I want to emphasise that the stabilisation and association process is the institutional framework for the course towards Europe of the Western Balkans and marks a shift in the centre of gravity from stabilisation to association with the European Union.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as was laid down in Zagreb and only very recently reconfirmed in Thessaloniki, each of the countries of South-Eastern Europe has its own individual prospect for accession.
It follows that we are right to adopt the strategy of commencing negotiations towards a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with each country one at a time.
It also follows, however, that preparations for accession are primarily in the hands of the governments in those countries.
While all the countries listed in the report have problems specific to themselves, there is much that is, more or less, in equally poor shape in all of them.
That is why they have to join with us in stepping up the fight against trafficking in human beings, which actually amounts to trafficking in women.
They have to combat crime, arms dealing and corruption.
Their justice systems are developed to differing degrees, ranging from the just about acceptable to the utterly inadequate.
Education and training are key areas in which these countries also have to make progress or else have no future, as their young people will otherwise leave.
No satisfactory solution has yet been found to the problem of refugees returning to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Hardly any of the Croats expelled from the are returning to it, which makes the return of Serbs to Croatia and the restoration of their property there more difficult.
A creditable number of Serbs are returning to Croatia, but implementing the restoration of property to Croatiaâs Serbs is still not progressing in a satisfactory way.
There is, moreover, a great deal of anti-Serb sentiment in several regions, especially in the hinterland of Zadar, and this results in major problems on the ground.
In contrast, co-existence in Eastern Slavonia around Vukovar is characterised to a much greater degree by cooperation.
There is a good law on minorities, which community leaders must now put into practice.
Croatia is cooperating properly with The Hague; even archive documents have been handed over to the tribunal.
Indeed, it was in Croatia itself that three accused persons, including a General, received lengthy jail sentences.
One accused person, General Gotovina, is on the run.
Let us not ask for the impossible; the state has offered a reward for his capture, but so far have not managed to track him down.
He is a member of the French Foreign Legion and holds a French passport; heaven knows where he is now.
If the international community could not get its hands on Karadzic or Mladic despite SFOR having been present in Bosnia-Herzegovina for seven years, then we should not, in this regard, apply the wrong standard to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to the Croats.
Serbia and Montenegro have demonstrated their willingness to cooperate with The Hague.
Things could get even better.
They handed Milosevic over, thank God, as well as the three butchers of Vukovar, but many more are still awaiting extradition.
It is in Serbiaâs interests to be allowed to sentence some war criminals in Serbia itself.
It would help the Serbsâ understanding of the situation if the KLA leadership were also, at last, to stand trial in The Hague for their crimes.
There is an absolute need for improvements in the poor economic state of much of the region, and so the CARDS programme must facilitate more infrastructural measures than before, or else there will be no recovery there.
There have been improvements in Bosnia-Herzegovinaâs development at State level, but there are still many deficits.
I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that the High Representative does not always make use of the powers he possesses.
The metaphorical sword of Damocles hanging over Bosnia-Herzegovina would be unnecessary if the EU were â as Commissioner Vitorino has just said â to make demands that Bosnia-Herzegovina can actually meet.
I ought also to say something about Albania, but I shall skip that; everything is in the report, and I assume that everyone has read it.
My congratulations to Mr Lagendijk.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his report, which is, as always, a very comprehensive and balanced one.
I do not, admittedly, agree with all the points he makes, but that is the way of things in politics.
As far as Kosovo is concerned, I am right alongside him when it comes to getting a final decision on its future as soon as possible.
Any demand for one must be addressed to Kosovoâs government rather than to the Commission, for just as the report states and as we had confirmed to us recently in discussions in Albania, I am firmly convinced that the authorities in Kosovo are not doing enough.
I am not saying that they are doing nothing, but they are not doing enough to make it clear that Kosovo is a multi-ethnic state, one that wants to adhere to European standards.
Commissioner Vitorino also referred to the issue of âstandards before statusâ, which should be given practical expression by such things as the stipulation of more precise deadlines; it is, though, above all for the Albanian authorities in Kosovo to take the necessary action themselves.
Whilst I personally favour independence, something has to be done to make it happen; it will not just be presented on a plate.
Turning to Montenegro and Serbia, I do in essence take the view that nobody can force them or anyone else to stay together.
We have to consider whether the existence of so many small states there will make the process of integrating them into the European Union any easier.
It will not be made any easier for the states, but, if that is what they absolutely want, then that is their decision, and they have to know what its consequences will be.
Finally, let me address a point to which Mr Lagendijk alluded in connection with one of my amendments.
Had we been even only half as courageous, determined, and willing to implement our own decisions as the United States of America, we would have achieved more in the Balkans.
Our problem is that we say things like âpleaseâ and âif you would be so kindâ and âdo somethingâ, whereas the Americans lay down stringent conditions and say âyesâ or ânoâ.
That is why I do not think we can accept the evident willingness of some states to comply with these conditions.
As Mr Lagendijk himself mentioned, Croatia has not concluded the treaty that the United States wanted of them.
We must state loud and clear our view that we cannot simply relegate to the background the International Criminal Court, the case for which your group put to this House with such vigour.
If you read the amendment, you will see that I do, in any case, draw a distinction whilst sticking to the view that membership is not a practical option, but saying no more than that one ought not actually to conclude any agreement.
That is just an opinion of this House rather than an explicit condition.
If we get to the point where draft treaties in respect of these countries are put before us, then we will in any case have to take a decision on their individual merits.
I do not think it right that we should retreat so far from a position of this House as made explicit in a motion, but I am still willing to accept a compromise.
We should send the clear message that we attach great importance to this International Criminal Court especially in a region in which crimes are committed against human beings and contrary to human decency and that we ask all the states in this region not to play down the issue of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but to unambiguously affirm their political responsibility.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his report on the development of the current stabilisation and association process and on the future challenges in the Balkans.
I believe this is a full and exhaustive report which truly deals with the whole range of problems affecting this region.
On behalf of my parliamentary group, the Liberal Group, I would like to stress the following points: we fully support the process of integration of these countries of the south east of Europe and we highlight the need to fulfil the political and economic criteria laid down by the Union.
Furthermore, the history of these countries â and specifically what took place during the final decade of the last century â has been very important and this demands cooperation from all of them with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia â as other speakers in this debate have stressed â and this should be demanded of all the States.
I would like to point out, in this regard as well, that the signature of bilateral agreements with the United States clearly restricts the effectiveness of the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, and is not in line with the European Union's approach.
What should the European Union do in these cases?
Clearly, it should not accept any process of integration.
The signature of agreements is an arguable issue and it would be good if on the basis of the discussion which has just taken place the compromise solution could be reached which would indicate that the European Union is not prepared to accept any agreement unless certain conditions are met.
Furthermore, I would like to point out our group has presented certain amendments, suggested by a Slovenian observer Member, on Kosovo, on the responsibility of the Albanian population in Kosovo, so that it can decide on its future by means of the free exercise of the right to self-determination.
We have also presented another amendment on the issue of fishing in the Adriatic.
I would like to point out finally, Madam President, that the report analyses the situation of all the States and, if in any case it appears excessively critical â as we have been told by the representative of Macedonia, for example â it should not be understood as a lack of support on the part of the European Union, but as a contribution to constructive dialogue aimed at improving the situation of these countries.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Lagendijk for this report and his spirit of cooperation and receptiveness to a series of suggestions made in committee.
We agree with the ultimate objective of the report, which is to aid the democratic and economic recovery of this region and its possible integration into Europe.
However, we believe that some of the problems have been due to the development of Europeâs own dynamic and also to the fact that at that time we lacked a coherent, constructive and democratic foreign policy and, with our support for ethnic or religious identities, we have created a problem whose consequences we are now paying for.
All the aspects pointed out in the report are positive.
I would like to stress the need to support cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, the criticism of the possibility of signing agreements with the United States, outside of the International Criminal Court, the support for the return of the refugees and displaced persons and, above all - perhaps the most important aspect â the fight against corruption, the fight against organised crime, against the trafficking in women and children, the fight against all trafficking â of drugs, of arms etc. â which is a cancer which is eating away at this region.
We believe that we must offer effective help, that the current financial support is insufficient and that therefore we should review the financial perspectives, in order to provide more resources to assist the region in the necessary manner.
We believe that the points made on the different countries are absolutely correct â as Mr VallvÃ© has said â and the European Union must therefore consider them.
I am referring to respect for national minorities and the management of borders in Albania.
In the case of Bosnia, it is important to build state structures and promote cooperation with the war crimes tribunals.
In relation to Croatia, the importance of national minorities and cooperation with them should be stressed.
In Macedonia, the Albanian National Liberation Army must be dismantled and corruption combated.
In the case of Serbia, there must be cooperation with the international court in The Hague.
We do not agree with the insinuation in the report of possible independence for Kosovo, because we believe that what was agreed in the United Nations resolution should be respected, making Kosovo a province of the Republic of Serbia and Montenegro, and we see the UN as an international reference body.
Â Â  â Madam President, we all bite off more than we can chew at times, and that applies to politics too; that is what both the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans risk doing during that regionâs Stabilisation and Association Process.
Concerned internal and external Balkan experts have expressed this warning.
According to them, the European Union is trying too hard to copy the success of the process of the ten accession countries in South-East Europe.
By doing so, the European Union is making excessive demands of states that are not ready for this.
The result is that the Stabilisation and Association Process is threatening to degenerate into feigned developments in the countries in question.
A simpler, realistic approach to moving closer to Brussels would avoid mutual disappointment.
Moreover, it would give the governments of the Western Balkans a real opportunity of scoring political successes in the direction of Europe. This is certainly not insignificant from an electoral viewpoint.
Does the Commission share this opinion and is it prepared to help give this shape?
Allow me to be very direct and specific.
These days, I am picking up vibes that, generally speaking, the educational level in the Western Balkan is dropping to a worrying level. This applies to primary, secondary and university education alike.
I would ask the Commission whether that is true.
If so, then here lies an opportunity for us to offer a helping hand by providing the Western Balkans with free access to European education programmes.
In that light, Mr Lagendijkâs useful report offers ample opportunity for European self-reflection.
Allow me to make three observations.
First of all, in paragraph 10, does the rapporteur not turn matters on their head in connection with the present visa regime between the European Union and the so-called SAP countries?
It seems more logical to me to link a possible easing of the visa regime to a number of EU conditions.
This has nothing to do with the humiliation of Balkan citizens to which the rapporteur refers.
Interestingly enough, in paragraph 42, Mr Lagendijk urges the European Union to play a role of neutral mediator between Serbia and Montenegro.
It is irrelevant to him what form the relationship between Belgrade and Podgornica will take at the end of it.
As far as I know, the European Union has to date not practised such neutrality and, as far as I can see, will not attempt to do this either.
My third observation concerns paragraphs 51 and 52.
In paragraph 51, the rapporteur is still cautiously positive about the start of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina, with good reason.
Incidentally, with this, the UNMIK itself is putting the principle of standards before status under time pressure. That is by the by.
Mr Lagendijk subsequently proposes an extra-fast time frame for a final solution to the thorny political issue of Kosovo.
Within the next two years!
It seems to me that the Serbian-Albanian race for Kosovo is certainly not served, nor helped, by such a political march at top speed.
Moreover, we should not overlook the direct regional effects of any actual attempt to address the Kosovo issue.
Think of the Albanians in Macedonia and the Serbs in Bosnia.
Political stability in the Balkans remains for the time being a precarious matter.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like first of all to congratulate my honourable friend Mr Lagendijk on his well-documented report.
It is a balanced and detailed piece of work which covers the issue objectively and gives an overall picture of the situation in the area and in the individual countries.
It points out the particular conditions which prevail in each and evaluates the more specific data which document the various manifestations of their cooperation with the European Union.
Within this framework, the report â correctly in my opinion â stresses the serious importance within the priorities of the European Union of preparing the countries of South-East Europe for future integration into the European structures.
It stresses that the progress of each country, as far as its accession is concerned, will depend on the degree to which it meets the Copenhagen criteria and the terms of the stabilisation and association process.
In fact, irrespective of the anticipated peculiarities that characterise the countries in question, the basic principle must remain that all are dealt with and judged in the same way when weighing their virtues and their shortcomings, as regards the possibility of full integration into the European family.
I should also like to agree with the rapporteur that the 'hot potato' in the area is the Kosovo regime, but I believe that any rushed decision or action must be avoided in order to first safeguard the necessary preconditions for smoothing out the situation, with respect for the rights of all interested parties and for the related United Nations resolutions and the principle of safeguarding the external borders of the countries in the area.
Allow me to take this opportunity to refer to the particular subject touched on in paragraph 21 of the report and to expressly state that the European Parliament regrets the flagrantly unacceptable manner in which the recent local elections were conducted in Albania.
Unfortunately, the sad irregularities and the blatant violation of democratic procedures and values which provoked this clear remark on the part of the rapporteur â with which my honourable friend Mrs Pack agreed on behalf of my political group â were repeated, to a more acute degree, with a plethora of clashes, acts of violence and undermining of the democratic morale of citizens and candidates in the repeat elections just three days ago.
I want to hope that the Albanian authorities will understand the message which Parliament is sending them via the Lagendijk report and will strengthen their commitment to ensuring the smooth operation of democracy and the rule of law in their country, so that relations between Albania and the European Union and the successful completion of the stabilisation and association agreement are not adversely affected.
Â Â  Madam President, when debating the Lagendijk report, we undoubtedly note that the present situation in the Western Balkans, in the Stability Pact countries, is clearly better than it was a year ago.
It is a serious step in the success of the policy applied in the region by the European Union which, basically, has the main responsibility for the area.
Already, Croatia has applied to join the European Union.
The new constitutional institutions in the FYROM and the new form of Serbia with Montenegro appear to be starting to work.
There also appear to be signs of economic mobility.
However, the situation is far from qualifying as stable from every side.
None of us should entertain any false notions.
The Stability Pact is being applied to an area which continues to be politically fragile and unstable.
The only line of approach of our policy must be the interest of the citizens and peoples in the area.
There can be no thought of special benefits or interests.
Insistence on democratic procedures, human rights, regional cooperation, respect for minorities, the return of refugees, the jurisdiction of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague and, generally, the full application of all the UN Security Council resolutions is the only way forward.
I should like to mention here with both regret and seriousness the unacceptable conditions in Himara â and elsewhere in Albania â during the recent local elections, when every concept of electoral procedure was violated by the official authorities, as was respect for the rights of the Greek minority.
It would be good if the Albanian authorities helped their country to improve its democratic institutions if they want to proceed positively in the twenty-first century.
There are some who speculate about the future of crisis areas such as Kosovo and others who hint at either the creation of a new state entity or broad autonomy which will basically be equivalent to independence.
They must realise that the constitutional and state regime, be it in the FYROM, be it in Bosnia-Herzegovina, be it in Serbia-Montenegro, is based on fine balances, with concealed nationalisms, and that time is needed for the new institutions to stabilise and mature.
It is positive that there is contact between Belgrade and Pristina within the framework of the UN and this must be supported.
However, every new superficial movement will result in a new domino effect with unforeseeable consequences.
In all the countries of the Stability Pact, there are close ethnic minorities which are the local majority and border other countries in which the corresponding ethnic groups are in the majority.
All the states should protect their minorities living within them.
They are also their citizens.
All the state borders should remain stable.
Care must be taken not to expound theories which lead to concepts such as city-states, or may even go as far as state-neighbourhoods or state-families.
We must prevent the mobilisation of forces by neighbouring countries to protect national minorities inadequately protected by the countries of which they are citizens.
We must insist on 'peace, democracy, security, cooperation, stability' and the only message to all the countries is that the European Union is waiting for them, they just have to speed up their efforts.
And now, a comment outside my speech.
There is a technical issue.
On certain sides, the official name of the FYROM is not used correctly.
It would be good if the texts were corrected as usual.
Â Â  Madam President, I am very displeased to see that in this resolution, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - ICTY - is one of the conditions for further Western Balkan engagement with the EU.
That condition must be in respect of progress on association agreements rather than financial assistance.
I will join my Socialist colleagues in voting for that change tomorrow.
It has emerged from repeated meetings between the European Council and the ICTY Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, that this cooperation is still not occurring, which is seriously jeopardising future integration.
She has said that even the most basic cooperation, such as access to documents and witnesses, as well as arrests and the transfer of fugitives, is still not satisfactory.
A large number of indicted war criminals are still at large in Serbia-Montenegro, including Ratko Mladic, who was responsible for killing 7 000 people in the genocide at Srebrenica.
Of particular concern is the case of Croatia.
I join others in welcoming Croatia's European aspirations.
However, requests for cooperation from the tribunal are taking up to a year to process, which is totally unacceptable.
For example, there is the matter of General Ante Gotovina, ICTY's third most wanted man, who was responsible for arranging the killing of at least 150 Serb civilians and the expulsion of 150 000 others in 1995.
Miss Del Ponte has outlined information that he is still in Croatia, with reports that he is being sheltered by people working for the Croatian authorities.
He is reported as: 'enjoying his summer holiday, sailing on a yacht'.
Until further moves are made towards Gotovina's arrest, Croatia is still not fully complying with UNSC Resolution 1503.
There can be no serious moves towards EU accession until this essential step is taken.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Howitt.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0390/2003) by MrÂ Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Foreign and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1080/2000 of 22 May 2000 on support for the United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHR) (COM(2003) 389 â C5-0325/2003 â 2003/0142(CNS)).
Â Â  . Madam President, the European Union has assumed a leading role within the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe.
This Pact has proved a valuable framework that complements European Union policy towards the region as it endeavours to support the countries in that region in their efforts to foster peace, democracy, respect for human rights and economic prosperity, and also to achieve stability in the region as a whole.
The proposal being examined by Parliament today, under which the Stability Pact would be included in the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No 1080/2000, will provide the Pact with a sound and solid basis on which to fulfil the crucial mandate given by the international community.
The Stability Pact is specifically designed to further foster regional cooperation, as was underlined by the Thessaloniki Agenda endorsed on 20Â June 2003 by the European Council.
It will thereby complement the stabilisation and association process engaged with the Western Balkans.
The Commission therefore welcomes the positive opinion on the proposal and hopes that Parliament will share the objective of having this new financial framework fully applicable as of 1 January 2004.
The Commission regards Amendment 1 to Article 1(2) as superfluous, since the principle of cost-sharing by Member States is implicitly contained in Article 2(2) of the regulation, and given that budget line 19Â 07Â 04 is an integral part of the budgetary discussion.
With reference to Amendment 2 to Article 1a, as well as Amendments 4 and 6, the Commission can support the proposal that the appointment of the special coordinator of the Stability Pact be renewed on an annual basis.
The Commission also agrees with the wider objective of closely associating Parliament in following the work of the Stability Pact.
Nevertheless, and bearing in mind the need to keep the appointment procedure as straightforward as possible, the Commission cannot accept Parliament's proposal, in Amendment 2 to Article 1a, to include formal consultation of the relevant European Parliament committee.
Neither can it accept the insertion, in the form of a new Article 1b proposed by Amendments 3, 5 and 7, of a hearing before the committee.
However, the Commission agrees with Amendments 4 and 6, with regard to ensuring that Parliament is informed of the appointment proposal.
The Commission is happy, although it is not possible to include it in the new regulation, to make the commitment before Parliament to arrange for an association with Parliament in practice.
In particular, the Commission will, well in advance of the appointment decision, inform Parliament, via the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, of its appointment proposal.
The appointed special coordinator will appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs as necessary, and at least twice at year, to report on its activities.
The Commission would be grateful if Parliament could adopt a positive opinion during the present part-session, since it is eager to embark on the implementation stage immediately after the new regulation enters into force, in order to provide the special coordinator of the Stability Pact with the timely support that will allow him to fulfil his mandate in 2004.
On behalf of the Commission I wish to express special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, for the quality of his preparatory work and the very good relations he has maintained with the Commission.
Â Â  â Madam President, I am obliged to the Commissioner for his statement.
Whilst we are, of course, convinced that our amendments are absolutely right and proper, what the Commissioner has said does at least, in terms of its content and of what is meant by it, go in the direction we want, that Parliament should be capable â albeit informally â of changing its mind about the appointment of the special coordinator of the Stability Pact.
This statement by the Commission makes that clear.
I would ask you, Commissioner, to thank the services, especially Mr Priebe, for the very good cooperation that we have had in this matter.
I would also like to state that, whatever our concerns may have been, a desire to make life difficult for DrÂ Busek in his capacity as the special coordinator has not been one of them.
I take the view that DrÂ Busek is one of our most outstanding co-workers in the broader sense of the word, who is committed to the region and knows what is going on in it.
You can be sure that, if he were again to be nominated, he would certainly receive this Houseâs full support.
If someone else is nominated, then we will of course give the matter due consideration and state our opinion.
I wish to accept the proposal that the Commission has made, and I will, tomorrow, be recommending to the House that we proceed to a full vote.
Then you, Commissioner, and the Commission would be able to do what you want to do and get things up and running with effect from 1Â January.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Swobodaâs report on the Stability Pactfor South-East Europe has two essential objectives, one being to make the Stability Pact more stable, and the other to take Parliamentâs views into account and involve it in the process of appointing the special coordinator.
On this I am in full agreement with Mr Swoboda.
Hitherto, the Coordinator has been appointed for only six months at a time, but now he is to hold office for a year.
We regard this as progress.
Parliamentâs involvement in the appointment process as a budgetary and political authority is also to be welcomed.
It would be desirable if this process of appointing the coordinator of the Stability Pact each year were to be a speedy one, and what the Commissioner has said leads me to believe that there is the will to make it so.
In every instance, the parliamentary dimension must be built up, and in saying that I am referring not only to the European Parliament, but also and especially to the regional parliaments in the countries to which the Stability Pact applies.
We can never do enough to involve members of the regional parliaments in the important work of stabilising the Western Balkans.
The Stability Pact and its present coordinator Erhard Busek have already had a great effect â something that has been noted with appreciation, and rightly so â on both trade and investment, or in the use of several infrastructural measures to combat crime.
Much, though, remains to be done, and I believe that the Swoboda report, to the content of which we will be giving our full support tomorrow, will make an important contribution to this.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs Stenzel.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0398/2003) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the second-generation Schengen information system (SIS II) [2003/2180(INI)].
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, in 1990 the Schengen Agreement was signed and the need was acknowledged to step up controls in order to prevent threats to our citizensâ security, such as organised crime, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and drugs and illegal immigration, amongst others, from entering the Community.
Applying the principle of free movement and abolishing controls at national borders has heightened the importance of controls at our external borders.
We know that free movement within the territory of the Schengen States is a freedom that in return requires not only a strengthening of our external borders but also a rapid and efficient exchange of information under border controls and police cooperation.
In this context, the Schengen Information System (SIS) has played quite an important role, which we are attempting to extend even further by creating a second generation of the SIS that has been designed for SISÂ II.
The SIS operates as an information system that enables the competent authorities in the Member States to investigate and receive alerts on persons and on objects.
The system currently operates in thirteen Member States and in two other States - Iceland and Norway - and it is hoped that it will soon become partially operational in the United Kingdom and in Ireland.
The SIS is the largest database in Europe and has a dual function: it contributes to maintaining public order and security and to immigration, by supporting the measures intended to compensate for the free movement of persons.
The proposals presented to us for the creation of SISÂ II are intended to extend the systemâs capacity and to introduce new technical and research possibilities, taking advantage of the most up-to-date developments in the field of information technology.
The Councilâs plan is that the system should be up and running in 2006.
This new system is being created in order to address three major issues.
Firstly, enlargement, so as to be able to integrate the new Member States, which will require the capacity to integrate more users, more Member States, and also new categories of users.
There is already agreement in Council on allowing new authorities to access SIS, but it is not yet known what these authorities will be.
The second development is that the current system has functions covering two categories of information (persons and objects).
The intention is not only to increase the number of data categories that will be included, that is, new objects and functions, but also to increase the capacity to process this information, to interlink alerts, to modify the duration of the alerts, and to store and transfer biometric data, especially photographs and fingerprints.
The Council has taken no decision on what new categories of objects or persons will be included.
The third and last issue â that of economy â is that, despite having more functions and more users, the system must be more homogeneous, more flexible, more secure and perform better.
It must also be manageable and cost-effective.
We are, therefore, right to consider that we are no longer talking only about a limited measure of compensation, introduced to facilitate the free movement of persons, as set out in the Schengen Convention, in ArticlesÂ 92 and 102 to be specific.
Indeed, a document issued by the Presidency in February 2002 even suggested that the SIS could be used for the purpose of police information in the broadest sense.
The nature of the SIS consequently underwent a metamorphosis, albeit an imperceptible one; the issue of precisely what the SISâs objective is to be in future or how this âbroadest senseâ referred to by the Presidency can be defined remains open.
In my opinion, only when the question about the definition of the objectives of the SIS is answered in a clear and politically acceptable way can the debate on issues such as new functions or new users be properly answered.
Consequently, discussions are ongoing on proposals for the introduction of new functions, new users, a new architecture, new synergies, in particular with the visa information system, and new management.
Discussions are still taking place on the location, too.
These amendments, which we hope will be accepted, obviously have repercussions for data protection and for the protection of citizensâ fundamental rights.
We reiterate that any decision taken must always be accompanied by the highest data protection standards, specifically the requirements stipulated by ArticleÂ 118 of the Schengen Convention, in a constant attempt to achieve the right balance between security and freedom.
I hope that this report will help to make the debate on SISÂ II more transparent, to accentuate the need for Parliament to monitor the process, to emphasise the need for its management to be supervised by Community bodies and to ensure that greater effectiveness always goes hand in hand with the desirable and necessary reinforcement of the issues of data protection and of safeguarding citizensâ rights.
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Coelho for his report, which clearly highlights the fundamental challenges presented by the second generation of the Schengen Information System, known as SISÂ II, and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate him personally on the initiative that he put forward for the hearing on 6Â October in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this matter, because this hearing directly reflects his concern to give the citizens detailed and clear explanations of the usefulness of the work that has been undertaken on the Schengen Information System, with which the Commission fully agrees.
I should like to reiterate the fact that the Schengen Information System is a key instrument for the principle of abolishing internal border controls and that, naturally, its development and day-to-day running must take place with scrupulous regard for the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.
As to the issue that the rapporteur raised, concerning the nature of the Schengen Information System, I should like to recall that, since the very beginning, police authorities have been authorised users of the System, in particular in the context of their monitoring activities within EU territory.
The Schengen Information System must now, however, be set in a different context â the context in which it came into existence.
Initially, the system was designed as a measure of compensation for the abolition of internal borders, set in a clearly intergovernmental framework.
Since the Schengen was integrated into the European Union, the Schengen Information System has been central to the area of freedom, security and justice.
The acceptance of the United Kingdom and Irelandâs partial participation in the Schengen system without these countries abolishing controls at their borders confirms this development.
The Spanish initiatives to extend the functions of the existing system and which provide for Europol and Eurojust having access to some of the systemâs data â I stress, to some of the systemâs data - also form part of this development.
As regards SISÂ II, the Council has to date confined itself to accepting its existing functions and to providing broad guidelines on new functions.
The debate on precisely what new functions of the system will be implemented in order to enhance its effectiveness and whether these will further alter the nature of the existing system is still to take place.
I therefore welcome the fact that Parliament wishes to play an active role in this crucial debate, which must be as transparent and wide-ranging as possible.
As you all know, the Commission was given the mandate to develop SISÂ II, but the current Schengen Information System, known as SISÂ I+, is managed by France, under the terms of ArticleÂ°92 of the Schengen Convention, and does not, therefore, fall within the sphere of the Commissionâs competence.
Mr Coelhoâs report on SISÂ II is based on the Commissionâs work to develop this new generation, and the Commission has given a commitment to adopt, in the near future, a new communication to Parliament and the Council detailing the state of the work on developing SISÂ II in the first quarter of 2003, as well as the important issue the rapporteur highlighted, concerning the technical synergies that will be possible with the future visa information system, known as âVISâ.
To give you a brief overview of the work that has been undertaken, I should like to remind you that the results of the feasibility study conducted by the Commission were immediately conveyed to Parliament, in the Spring of 2003.
Currently, the project to develop SISÂ II is at the stage of publishing the call for tender.
The Commission services have spent the last few months drawing up the specifications for this tender in close cooperation with the Member States and have kept the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs informed on a regular basis.
In his report, MrÂ Coelho highlights the fundamental challenges in terms of data protection and the importance of involving the authorities responsible for data protection in the development of SISÂ II.
The Commission is fully aware of these challenges, both as regards the systemâs development, and concerning the preparation of its legal base.
This legal base will include rules on data protection that will also cover access by private individuals.
The Commission is also holding regular and intensive meetings with the Joint Supervisory Authority, and has included specifications on data protection in the tender.
Finally, Mr Coelhoâs report refers specifically to the need to harmonise the principles of data protection.
Although this call for harmonisation goes beyond the issue of SISÂ II, the Commission intends, in the course of next year, 2004, to propose a legal instrument on rules for the protection of personal data under the third pillar.
I therefore wish, once again, to emphasise the importance the Commission attaches to Parliamentâs full involvement in the debates that will take place, which I hope will be as transparent as possible, and to which this report will certainly make a decisive contribution.
I hope that this report wins the support of this House,
Â Â  ( We have heard, both from the rapporteur and the Commissioner, that we are dealing with a Schengen Information System which is of a decidedly new generation that is very different from the first and which therefore has a new and different significance for the European citizens and a new and different responsibility towards them.
SIS I was set up as a compensatory measure to allow free movement of people, but, in recent years, it has started to be seen more as an instrument, which is also useful in terms of police cooperation.
The data from SIS II and SIS I can, in other words, now become a useful resource for purposes other than those initially intended.
Furthermore, the enlargement of the European Union means that it is necessary to develop a second generation information system by 2006.
Consequently, the Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States also provides for recourse to the SIS and, therefore, for the need for it to be updated in due time.
On the basis of all this, it is necessary for the Council to promote a public debate on the nature of SIS and on the political objectives to be achieved with SIS II to ensure that the development of this system takes place in a transparent and democratic way.
An assessment will, of course, be made on respect for fundamental rights, and it will therefore be necessary to entrust the strategic management of this and other information systems to an extremely reliable European agency: an agency run by an administrative board composed of representatives of the European institutions and the Member States; an agency that is, moreover, financed by the European Union budget and, therefore, subject to Parliamentâs control.
A swift decision is therefore needed by the SIS centre on the location, if possible the definitive location.
In addition to this, a study needs to be carried out on the possibility of amalgamating the various databases that exist today or will be launched in the coming months and yearsÂ âÂ the SIS banks, Europol, VIS, Eurojust and so onÂ âÂ on the basis of a single technical platform, in order to create a comprehensive, integrated information system across the European Union.
To this end, a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the potential implications of a system of this kind for privacy, human rights and the risks involved in including biometric data.
Citizens should, therefore, be well informed so that nasty surprises are avoided.
I would like to conclude with a point which could seem somewhat out of place, relating to the immigration emergency.
Everyone can see that the illegal entry of immigrants into the Unionâs area of free movement calls precisely for SIS II to carry out an unexpected role: a role of managing data and security that was not conceivable when the first generation Schengen Information System was launched.
Â Â  Madam President, the proposal for a recommendation to the Council on the second generation of the SIS gives us the opportunity to express significant concerns about developments in the Schengen Information System.
The SIS was originally set up as a compensatory measure to allow for the free movement of persons.
It is, however, gradually becoming an instrument of police cooperation, because the Council is seeking progressively to confer new functions on it and to allow various authorities to access its database.
As the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority states, the proposals to develop the SIS and the creation of SISÂ II constitute a sea-change in the nature of the system itself: whereas the SIS only alerts the relevant authorities in the event that an individual, whose details are on file, crosses the Schengen border, SISÂ II will probably become a multifunctional research tool.
This would represent a shift from an approach of reactive security to an approach of active security.
The prospect of a new system that would enable the authorities to share information on millions of individuals for different purposes, probably using the most advanced technologies including biometric data analysis, forces us to consider the impact that this new system could have on citizensâ rights, freedoms and guarantees.
In particular, the right to the protection of personal data recently confirmed in ArticleÂ 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and integrated into the draft European Constitution drawn up by the Convention.
It is true that the need to improve cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs and, in particular, the linking and cross-referencing of information between different databases is one of the objectives of the European Union that the Member States are obliged to pursue.
We all understand the need for efficient information systems that are capable of meeting the challenges laid down for us by international terrorism and by cross-border crime, but this action must never endanger the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded as a Community ruled by law.
The balance between privacy and security must not be altered by adopting information and communication technologies that have been created by governments as a response to the increased risks posed by new and dangerous criminal phenomena.
When the available technologies constitute a threat to the integrity of personal information that should be protected, we are obliged to adopt appropriate legislation that provides for any potential abuse.
The report by MrÂ Coelho, and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate him, contains a set of proposals that move broadly in the right direction: the need for a genuine public debate on the objectives of SISÂ II; the need to develop SISÂ II in a democratic and transparent way, enabling the citizens to access more information about the system and giving people whose personal data are kept on the system to access and correct this data; merging the various existing databases, which will enable us to create a coherent and comprehensive data protection system, which will enable detailed analysis; new authorisations for granting access to the SIS to new authorities; the creation of a European Agency for the Strategic Management of the SIS, monitored and subject to control by the European Parliament.
Â Â  Madam President, this report and this debate in Parliament are, from a political point of view, quite meaningless.
What we have here is a non-binding recommendation in an area outside Parliamentâs competence.
This lack of real significance is in sharp contrast, however, to the importance of the underlying subject.
The subject is frighteningly important. It has to do with nothing less than national, supranational and international police authoritiesâ uncontrolled use of the information and monitoring systems forming part of what is termed the second generation Schengen Information System, known as SIS II.
I am able to say that George Orwellâs nightmare visions of Big Brother pale in comparison with this state of affairs.
The systems are to a large extent secret, particularly for those implicated.
Evermore extended use is being made, officially and unofficially, of the information collected.
In reality, there is no democratic, parliamentary and judicial control.
The original rationale behind the Schengen Information System, or what was known as SIS I â namely nothing more nor less than the securing of border controls â has long since been replaced by an ambition to collect police information in the broad sense of the term.
Involving more and more information on more and more subjects, the Schengen Information System, or SIS, and, for that matter, Sirene are outside the domain of the law and not subject to controls.
I am unfamiliar with my fellow MEPâs, Mr Coelhoâs, background and motives.
I have no reason to doubt his concerns.
What I contest is the realism and usefulness of the proposals.
I am more in agreement with the premises of the minority statement which, in my purely personal opinion, should have emphasised still more strongly that we are not concerned here with the mere dangers of misuse and of a legal vacuum.
The misuse of such a legal vacuum is an almost inevitable consequence of the police state factors that are already present and that have been approved.
Â Â  Commissioner Vitorino, I could, perhaps, as usual, raise the issue of the fact that these developments regarding SIS are happening without common rules on data protection.
There is, therefore, a gradual shift from compensatory instrument for free movement to an instrument for police cooperation.
Instead, I will use my speaking time to simply ask you for a Christmas present: for you to bring us, by Christmas, a nice chart including an exhaustive list of the data that has been handled and the way in which it has been handled within all of these data bases, the categories of data, the legal basis, the method of handling each type of data, the rights of the individual to access and correct data regarding them and abuses concerning them, and the method used for each type of data for transfer outside the European Union.
Commissioner, I do not know if I am particularly inattentive or incompetent on this subject, but I have not yet succeeded in finding a source, a document, which indicates what data has been transferred, how, where and according to what rules.
When we have this document, we will all, at last, know what we are talking about.
Â Â  Madam President, we have a double reason to refuse this recommendation on the second generation Schengen information system.
We refuse to approve this electronic database for personal information, a system which the author wishes to update, since it is a tool of police repression, and we reject even more the policy which this tool is intended to serve.
The States for whom the fight against terrorism serves as a universal justification want this database to receive supplementary data and to be combined with the system managing visas.
The ability to consult it would be extended to judicial authorities which have not so far had access to it.
This tool of repression is drawn up personally against migrant workers, preventing them from coming to the European Union while at the same time threatening the freedom of everybody.
To spend millions of euros on sophisticated surveillance equipment and on a system for sharing information on people who crossed a border which was open to them and which is now being slammed in their faces is scandalous.
This is the way to create and perpetuate the dramatic situations in which unscrupulous smugglers prosper.
We are opposed to the policy of a fortress Europe, surrounded by barbed wire, whether electronic or simply legal.
This is a retrograde, reactionary and inhuman policy.
The destiny of the peoples of the south of the European Union has forever been linked to that of the people of the other side of the Mediterranean, from Morocco to Egypt.
The populations of the new member countries of the east of Europe have thousands of links with the populations of the countries of the ex-Soviet Union.
To restrict the freedom of movement between the European Union and the neighbouring countries is a cruel blow against these people.
We reject it and we will vote against.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, if one considers the SIS in the light of history, it represents Europeâs further development of Germanyâs racist Central Register of Foreign Nationals, which has for years listed every foreigner living in Germany, and if we are to talk, in this House today, in terms of freedom, then the state is free to examine its human material and to sort it into categories, and at the same time has the task of doing so.
To an overwhelming extent, most of the personal data stored in the present-day SIS relates to people who have been refused entry into the EU.
The development of a second-generation SIS is not just, though, about building up its storage capacity and fortifying the new borders in the East; what is even worse is that its operations are being extended by the introduction of new database categories and search options, the aim being to facilitate the use of SIS II for manhunts.
This amounts to a fundamental change in the databaseâs character.
What was a racist index of persons barred from entering the EU is becoming a powerful instrument in the hands of the stateâs apparatus of repression, enabling it to track people down.
This SIS is the first satellite in Europeâs âstar warsâ programme to monitor immigration; we can reject it and, for that reason, we must.
Â Â  . Madam President, I have the greatest respect for those who are critical of the Schengen Information System.
To be honest, however, I do not think that demonising the Schengen Information System is the best strategy, but everyone is responsible for his or her own political positions.
What I would say to you quite clearly is that the Schengen Information System is essentially a system for managing the European Unionâs external border and that this is a prerequisite for safeguarding freedom of movement within the European area.
Consequently, if we wish to continue to guarantee the principle of abolishing our internal borders, we must be able to assume our responsibilities by better monitoring the external borders.
This issue does not only concern entering and leaving European Union territory; it also concerns guaranteeing security within the EU.
The political option that I wish to reiterate here is of a different nature.
I believe that the crucial issue facing us consists of recognising the advantages of the Schengen Information System.
I have a Christmas present for MrÂ Cappato, but this is not it.
I have something else to give, but [let us wait for Christmas], because this would be a less exciting present.
No, it is something else.
On the issue that MrÂ Cappato raised, I wish to say two things: first of all, there are no plans for any form of transfer of data from the Schengen Information System to third countries.
Access to the Schengen database is reserved exclusively for the Member States of the European Union.
As regards the type of data to be included in the system, I believe I answered this point in my speech when I said that the debate on what specific data is to be included in the system is yet to take place.
We conducted a feasibility study, which we forwarded to the European Parliament, identifying the requests made to us by Member States.
The proper identification of this data has not yet taken place and the Commission is currently preparing a communication that it will publish by the end of the year, in which we will make an assessment of the state of the current debate.
I understand peopleâs doubts and fears, but I do wish to say one thing: there is a considerable difference between the fact that I, as Commissioner, am talking to you here about the Schengen Information SystemÂ II and the fact that, in relation to the first system, there was no Commissioner to give an answer here, about what was being done.
There is a considerable difference between that situation and the fact that I am standing here telling you that the Commission will present a proposal to harmonise the control and protection of personal data under the third pillar and that there must be democratic and judicial control of the systemâs workings.
Therein lies the difference between the first and the second Schengen Information Systems and this difference has only been possible precisely because the system has been integrated into the entire Community , with the support of this Parliament on which, incidentally, I hope I will be able to count for a favourable vote on MrÂ Coelhoâs report.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the EU-Canada Summit which will take place in Ottawa on 17 December 2003.
Â Â  . Madam President, the next summit meeting between the European Union and Canada was scheduled to take place on 17 December 2003 in Ottawa.
The timing of the summit has now been called into doubt.
The Commission understands that the presidency has difficulties with the date proposed. The Commission attaches very great importance to this summit with Canada and is ready to do anything it can to ensure that it takes place.
Since this difficulty has arisen, Prime Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien has announced his intention to step down from office on 12 December.
It therefore seems unlikely that the date of 17 December can be maintained.
However, the Commission remains hopeful that a solution can be found so that our final summit meeting with Prime Minister ChrÃ©tien can indeed take place before his retirement.
We have put a lot of work into preparing for this summit, which will be the last hosted by Prime Minister ChrÃ©tien, a long-standing true friend of Europe.
We intend to use this occasion to demonstrate the strong ties that bind the European Union and Canada, and to signal our common intention to strengthen those ties still further in the coming months and years.
In this context the Commission welcomes the statement issued by the Chairman of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association, on the occasion of the recent EU-Canada interparliamentary meeting in Ottawa.
The Commission was gratified to note the great degree of consensus between the chairman's statement, the recent conclusions of the Council of Ministers and the Commission's own communication of May 2003 on EU-Canada relations.
As the chairman's statement observed, the EU and Canada agreed at last year's Ottawa Summit, to undertake a comprehensive review of the bilateral relationship during 2003 and to report back to the December summit this year.
The Commission is working hard, alongside the presidency and with our Canadian counterparts, to finalise a joint report to go to the summit.
This report will take up many of the themes developed by the Commission, Council and Parliament in their contributions to the review.
A driving force behind the review is the changing nature of the EU-Canada relationship.
Given the changing nature of the European Union itself, Canada was the first industrialised third country to enter into a formal relationship with the European Economic Community in 1976.
As a result, the EU-Canada relationship has tended to focus on trade and economic issues.
However, Canada and the EU's common interests extend far beyond the commercial arena.
We share similar social models and global interests.
Canada, like the European Union, is a staunch advocate of the United Nations, the multilateral system and the international rule of law.
By way of example, Canada voted with the European Union 96% of the time during the current UN General Assembly, on those occasions when the European Union had a common position.
We want to find ways of working together more systematically in the field of security and foreign policy so that we can be more effective in carrying forward those policies where our objectives coincide.
We also want to improve our dialogue in other policy areas where we often share common values and face similar challenges.
These areas include education and culture, the environment and justice and home affairs.
We have also maintained our focus on the very important economic relationship that exists between Canada and the European Union.
The EU is Canada's second most important trading partner after the United States.
We are the second source of foreign investment in Canada.
In parallel with our comprehensive review of all aspects of EU-Canada relations, we have also been developing the framework for a new type of bilateral trade and investment agreement, with the aim of facilitating trade and investment flows between the EU and Canada.
Commissioner Lamy and the Canadian Trade Minister, Mr Pettigrew, will report to the December summit on the results of their analysis into the potential scope of such an agreement.
We expect talks to begin immediately in 2004.
The European Commission believes that an intensified dialogue between European and Canadian parliamentarians is essential to maintain the good health of our relationship.
The Commission is grateful for the work of Parliament's Canada delegation and hopes that other Members and committees, working on specific policy areas, will also give consideration to increasing contact with their Canadian counterparts.
The relationship between the EU and Canada is very healthy.
The European Commission is resolved to do all it can to keep it that way.
We want the summit to lift this relationship to a new plateau, at a challenging time for the international community and in preparation for major changes taking place in Canada and within the European Union in the coming month.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner Vitorino was right to refer to the very special relationship we have with Canada, which is in the process of being raised to a higher level.
You mentioned, Commissioner, that our models of society are identical or very similar.
It is indeed the case that Canada is a large country endeavouring not only to permit but also to promote cultural diversity within itself, and so certain analogies with the situation in the European Union present themselves, since our structure differs from, say, the United States of America.
Cultural diversity is present in our European Union too, a diversity that will become even more marked following the accession of new countries next year.
You also mentioned, Commissioner, that we have the same global interests, and this goes hand in hand with the other aspect you mentioned, our shared social model.
Our global interests are in the field of foreign and security policy.
Particularly after 11Â September, we have to engage in a global cultural dialogue, for a clash of civilizations, a will get us nowhere.
In the final analysis, international terrorism cannot be fought by military means.
This leads me to mention another aspect, which is that although Canada, that great country, is in North America, it is one in which French is spoken.
Intercultural dialogue, especially between the United States of America and the Islamic world, grinds to a halt if it is conducted only in English.
I think there is great potential if France joins Canada in promoting such dialogue.
Canada can be a mediator between the USA and the Islamic world.
Not least is this in the interests of our most important partner, the United States of America.
Let me conclude by adding that I believe that our relationship with Canada functions as a model.
Now that the Iron Curtain has ceased to be, we are quite right to work towards a balanced relationship with Central and Eastern Europe and also with those Eastern European countries that will very probably never belong to the European Union, especially with Russia.
We must never forget, though, that we must continue to look westwards; not only to the USA, but to our great ally Canada.
Together with Canada, we must work towards global equilibrium in a multipolar world, and I believe that a productive relationship with Canada in this process is something the significance of which cannot be overestimated.
Â Â  Madam President, it is interesting that we are discussing EU-Canada relations on the same day as Mr George Bush is visiting the United Kingdom and trumpeting the so-called special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
In the corner of the UK that I come from, the special relationship is not with the United States of America but with Canada.
There are very few Scottish families that do not have a relative, however distant, living in Canada.
So the ties that bind Scotland and Canada are much stronger, I would argue, than the ties that bind the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
That is also true for other parts of the European Union.
As Mr SchrÃ¶der, rightly says, the French have a natural affinity to Canada, the Irish also, and when with enlargement on the horizon, the Poles and the Baltic States too have many relatives and many connections with Canada.
So the EU's relationship with Canada is extremely important and we should do everything possible to nurture it.
It was therefore with some sadness I heard the Commissioner inform us tonight that the summit looks like it could be cancelled.
I know from my contacts with Canadians that Prime Minister ChrÃ©tien, a very good friend of Europe, believed that holding this EU-Canada summit would be one of the crowing points of his final few weeks in office.
It would be a slap in the face to a good friend of Europe if this summit does not go ahead in some shape or form.
It does not matter to him, to me, or to the Commission whether that summit is held in Europe or whether it is held in Canada.
The important thing is that it happens before 12 December.
Canada is important for a variety of reasons and I shall be telegraphic in saying this because Mr Vitorino and Mr SchrÃ¶der have already outlined some of those.
The links that we have are important for cultural and historical reasons.
I was hoping that the summit would nurture further exchanges between young people so that we can retain those existing links and build upon them for the future.
The EU and Canada are natural partners on the world stage.
We both value, in a way that some other countries do not, the multilateral institutions of the world and we value the international rule of law.
Much is to be gained by working with our Canadian partners on issues as diverse as the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, and the Doha trade negotiations.
Again, as the Commissioner rightly outlined, our economic and trade relations are good.
Importantly, they are good in a two-way sense: it is not a one-way trading relationship.
Canada's willingness to reach an agreement on trade in wine and spirits demonstrates the goodwill that characterises our relationship with the Canadians.
Finally, on justice and home affairs, we have a common approach to issues as diverse as terrorism, migration, asylum and border controls, as well as issues of the integration of migrants.
I hope - and I address this to Commissioner Vitorino - that we can find a solution to Canada's desire to have a longer visa period for Canadian citizens visiting the EU.
In conclusion, I share the Commission's view about the EU's relationship with Canada.
I hope that this House will join with the European Commission in stressing to the Council the importance of the summit going ahead in some shape or form.
Â Â  Madam President, I share the views expressed by my colleague, Mr Martin.
We would be forgiven for thinking over these last months that Europe has only one transatlantic relationship, so often do we use that term to describe the link between our Union and the United States of America.
The Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, once said that living next to America was like 'sleeping with an elephant'. Even its smallest movements were likely to keep you awake at night.
Europe's own sensitivity to the movements of the current American elephant can all too easily overshadow our relations with its northern neighbour.
The EU-Canada summit is a chance to renew this relationship.
The European Union and Canada have a long history of productive cooperation to build on.
We share the same views on the best strategy for defeating international terrorism and international organised crime.
We are common supporters of NATO, the UN and the ICC.
We share a strong commitment to Third World development assistance and environmental protection.
Both the EU and Canada have ratified the Kyoto protocols, and led the call for others to do so.
The Ottawa Land Mines Convention expresses our joint abhorrence of these weapons and our determination to act.
There was a time when Canada sought actively bilateral trading links with Europe as a way of reducing its dependence on trade with the United States.
It would be facile to see NAFTA as Canada's surrender to economic destiny.
Canadians continue to invest significantly in Europe: almost EUR 65 billion last year.
In return, we provide over a quarter of foreign investment in Canada. We take almost 20% of Canada's service-related exports.
The Commission's strategy document dwells rightly on the good will which exists between us, but identifies rightly that very little positive action flows from it.
We must deliver such action.
High level meetings between Canada and the EU have too often lacked clear objectives.
This summit should re-launch our relations on much more proactive terms.
The presidency has recognised this, in making the negotiation of an ambitious new accord one of the priorities of its tenure.
For this reason, it is extraordinary that the President-in-Office of the Council has chosen not to accompany his delegation.
I have been told by Canadian diplomats this evening that Mr Berlusconi's tactless decision has led Canada to consider cancelling the summit altogether, or to reschedule it for a European venue earlier in December.
Given the importance of this summit and its established place in Europe's diplomatic calendar, Mr Berlusconi has shown an unacceptable willingness to offend our friends in Ottawa.
For the second time in as many weeks he has embarrassed the Union, and in this case offended a valuable ally.
The ELDR urges strongly that the summit goes ahead in December as planned, preferably in Canada, and in Europe only as a last resort.
Even in Mr Berlusconi's absence, this summit must deliver an agreement that takes away regulatory barriers to closer trade and investment.
Given the importance of our large store of common North Atlantic values, this summit should assert that Canada and the EU will henceforth cooperate proactively in foreign and security policy and on environmental questions.
This means aligning our positions before major international meetings.
The summit must also produce concrete proposals for a steering group to assess the future management of our relationship.
We need more formal meetings at official and expert level, and a much more focused relationship.
As soon as a Constitutional settlement is achieved, the 1976 Framework Agreement with Canada should be updated.
In conclusion, it is time to equip our other transatlantic relationship for the new century.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Watson.
The debate is closed.(1)
Â Â  Colleagues, this is a special day for me, as an Irish European.
I would like to alert colleagues to put on their headphones and permit me briefly to speak in our ancient Irish tongue.
A UachtarÃ¡in, is mÃ³r an plÃ©isiÃºr agus an onÃ³ir Ã© fÃ¡ilte a chur roimh MhÃ¡ire Mhic Ghiolla Ãosa, an chÃ©ad UachtarÃ¡n ar Ãirinn as CÃºige Ãrsa Uladh.
De rÃ©ir pobalbhreitheanna a rinneadh le dÃ©anaÃ­, is Ã­ an phearsa pholaitiÃºil is measÃºla Ã­ i bPoblacht nahÃireann.
A UachtarÃ¡in Mhic Ghiolla Ãosa, cuirimid cÃ©ad mÃ­le fÃ¡ilte romhat chuig Parlaimint na hEorpa.
Madam President, six years ago you were elected the eighth President of the Republic of Ireland.
Your election was the ultimate symbol of the healing and reconciliation that was taking place between divided communities on our island.
The theme of your Presidency, 'building bridges' between traditions, cultures, communities and, most of all, between people, was not an abstract theme.
In the course of the past six years you, through your work and dedication, have demonstrated the benefits of bridge-building, partnership and connection.
It is this ability to connect that has served Ireland so well.
30 years ago we, as Irish people, began our journey from the edge to the heart of Europe.
We left behind isolation and stagnation to embrace openness and connection as the foundation of our modern prosperity.
This transition afforded opportunity to a new generation of Irish people that previously was only available to our substantial emigrant community.
I hope, President, you will not object if I quote to you part of a speech that you made in the United States in May 2003 - words which sum up very well the positives of Ireland's European experience: 'the little impoverished island off the west coast of Europe, which became an unremarkable member of the European Union thirty years ago, has become the symbol of the Unionâs potential, the place with the economic success story that everywhere else wants to imitate.
The country that up to 35 years ago offered the liberating key of education only to a small elite has felt the surging energy of its greatest natural resource - the genius of its own people - empowered through widened access to education.'
You went on to say 'the country that has known outward migration for 150 years has suddenly become a place of net inward migration, coping with the complexities of multiculturalism and the challenge of asylum seekers'.
And so President, just as your Presidency marked a healing in our sometimes divided country, the Irish presidency of the European Union will mark and celebrate the healing of our old European continent.
Next year we will be building bridges on a continental scale as we formally welcome our friends from the ten new Member States.
We, in the European Parliament, have worked diligently in this process of bridge-building and are proud of our contribution.
We are confident that under the leadership of the Irish presidency we will celebrate the fruits of that labour.
President McAleese, for me as an Irish European, it is an enormous pleasure to invite you to address the House.
Â Â  . Mr President, distinguished Members and guests, I am delighted to accept your invitation to address this Parliament and indeed to have the privilege of doing so at what is a remarkable juncture in the evolution of our European Union.
This House, I know, is home not just to many political perspectives but to many cultures, languages, identities, traditions and heritages.
You speak many different languages and you particularly understand the connection between language and culture, so I know you will be a particularly receptive audience if I too take this opportunity to speak in the Irish language for a moment.
Is mÃ³r an onÃ³ir dom an deis seo a fhÃ¡il labhairt le Parlaimint na hEorpa.
Is Ã³ shaorÃ¡naigh na hEorpa a eascraÃ­onn ÃºdarÃ¡s na hinstitiÃºide seo agus dÃ¡ bhrÃ­ sin tÃ¡ Ã¡it ar leith aici i gcroÃ­ an Aontais.
Is lÃ©ir dom go maith go bhfuil baill and fhorais ag obair go dÃ­cheallach chun an Eoraip seo againne a neartÃº.
Glacaim uchtach as seasamh daingean na Parlaiminte agus Ã­ ag cur tuairimÃ­ mhuintir na hEorpa chun cinn.
Ireland will assume the presidency of the Union in January 2004, so it seems right that today I should briefly address some of the major agenda items that will feature during Ireland's presidency.
The Taoiseach, our Irish Prime Minister, will of course deal with them in considerably more detail when you meet in January and you can be sure that he and the Irish Government are looking forward to that.
This Parliament gives power to the hugely diverse voices of men, women and young people throughout Europe.
Along with the Council and the Commission, it forms a crucial part of the institutional checks and balances through which the European project has succeeded so well on behalf of all of us.
Naturally, I take a particular pride in the fact that we have two Irish Presidents today in this Chamber.
But perhaps more important than our shared nationality, is the continuing reassurance to small nations which your election, Mr President, brings - the reassurance that our Union truly respects, in its practices, the principles of equality and merit.
I should also say that your term in office has been very widely admired, and nowhere more so than in our native home.
The strength of this Parliament's voice has grown as the Union has grown.
Now transformed from a consultative into a legislative body, a transformation indeed well supported by the Irish people, this Chamber demonstrates the central place of democratic politics right at the heart of the Union and in its debates bears witness to the expanding areas of cooperation within the Union - so much greater today than those early preoccupations with trade and the economics alone.
The valuable role played by Parliament's representatives to the European Convention is a further recent manifestation of the extent to which you are the shapers of the future of the Union.
As the directly elected representatives of the Union's citizens you are particularly well qualified to inform the debate on bringing Europe closer to its citizens, an issue which has taken centre stage and which will form a special focus for the Irish presidency.
The Union's founders knew the devastating wasteland from which this exciting adventure in democratic partnership developed.
They knew the price that had been paid for its birth.
It is an infant still, a robust infant but an infant nonetheless in the scheme of human history and it needs champions to keep reminding us how lucky we are that it was conceived at all.
Infanticide by disinterest or neglect is simply not an option and all of us who believe in this Union are challenged to generate in its citizens a passion and a zest for its continued development and growth - that is what the Irish presidency hopes to do.
I represent, as you know, a country which has arguably changed more in the three decades of membership than at any time in our history: our economy has grown stronger, our population decline has been reversed; our self-confidence has increased; our relations with our nearest neighbours in Britain have never been better; and our standing in Europe and beyond is one of which we can be proud.
Although geographically situated on the periphery, Ireland has had a very distinctive and unique European outreach over many centuries and indeed has played an important part in the cultural, religious, educational and social development of many parts of our continent.
Virtually every time I visit a Member State I am reminded that an Irish saint got there first many centuries ago!
It is not going to be any different with the accession countries.
When we joined the Union there was, therefore, something of the homecoming about it but in Ireland there was also a courageous facing up to the future and an acknowledgement that past insularity and protectionism were dead-weights holding us back.
Through membership we first realised our true potential.
The European Union is probably the world's best example of learning from past mistakes.
This continent paid an outrageous price to learn that collegiality is infinitely more humanly decent than colonialism, that cooperation is better by far than conflict, that peace is essential to prosperity, that difference does not have to mean disdain.
To the Union table we each bring our national sovereignty, our differences, our national identities and our histories.
Through respectful dialogue and a shared belief in partnership we dare to forge a working team of neighbours, each of whom loves his or her native land and yet each of whom shares a devotion to our common European continental homeland.
This Union is living proof that humanity can comfortably carry a range of identities, that they can complement and enhance each other and that we can deliver a better future for our people inside the Union than outside it.
When Ireland's presidency of the Union begins in a few weeks' time we will bring to it the enthusiasm of very committed Europeans and the gratitude of a country which has manifestly benefited from that commitment.
We know that this will undoubtedly be our most challenging presidency to date but we also know that we will have your support as we attempt to be an effective and an impartial arbiter in search of practical and even-handed outcomes in the interests of the European Union as a whole.
The needs are very simple: the Union must be effective internally, influential externally and must equip itself for the future.
The solutions, of course, are not quite so simple and they will be greatly testing of all our ingenuity.
Yet we have no lack of ambition in this Union, no fear of added responsibilities.
The most important moment in Ireland's presidency will, of course, be the formal accession of ten new Member States on 1 May 2004.
It is an awesome, positive answer to the challenge laid down in this very forum just under a decade ago by VÃ¡clav Havel, whom I had the great pleasure of welcoming to Dublin last week.
He rightly declared then that 'history has thrown down a gauntlet - we can, if we wish, pick it up.
If we do not do so, a great opportunity to create a continent of free and peaceful cooperation may be lost.'
The gauntlet has been well and truly lifted.
The citizens and leaders of the European Union, including this Parliament, have shown themselves equal to the mammoth task of preparing both the Union and the applicant countries for enlargement.
The citizens of the accession countries have endured the painful reforms required for membership and thanks to their determination they stand on the doorstep of the Union much more quickly than anyone could have anticipated.
Where not long ago totalitarian regimes reigned, now, respect for the rule of law, democratic institutions, human rights and fundamental freedoms have put down deep roots again.
If the war graves of Europe could speak they would tell us we are living a miracle - a radical transformation of human history is being wrought by a relentless process of sheer hard work and utter fidelity to the vision of the transcendent power of cooperation which is at the heart of the Union.
And, of course, the enlargement process does not conclude on 1 May 2004.
During the Irish presidency, the accession negotiations on Bulgaria and Romania will be pursued, based on the same principles that have guided all the enlargement negotiations to date, with a view to a target date of 2007 for their accession.
In addition, the Irish presidency will monitor very closely developments with Turkey, in advance of the key decisions on opening negotiations to be taken in December 2004.
The new Member States will be ambitious for their futures and we want to see them prosper as they put the opportunities of membership to good use.
They rely on the continuation of that very strong support from existing Member States which has brought them safely thus far.
Now it is our common challenge to ensure the success of a Union of 25 Member States.
The Italian presidency is demonstrating its determination to do all in its power to reach agreement in the IGC by next month, and Ireland, naturally, is strongly supportive of this aim.
The new Treaty will inject fresh excitement into the Union, transforming its unfortunate bureaucratic image, re-energising its relationships with Europe's citizens, making them feel like insiders and not spectators.
The draft text produced by the Convention is a huge step forward in this regard.
Naturally, however, a number of questions remain to be fully debated and finally resolved, including the issue of a reference to God in the preamble to the new Treaty.
The Irish Government has indicated that it would welcome such an inclusion if consensus can be reached on suitable language.
At the end of the day the Union does not live by words alone but by actions which make those lofty words real in our lives.
How we manage economic and social development in the new Europe, how we harness the real potential offered by enlargement, how we breathe life into those words - these are, therefore, vital questions that Ireland will seek to address during our presidency.
A key task during Ireland's tenure will be to advance the Lisbon agenda of social, economic and environmental renewal.
At the Lisbon Summit of 2000, the Union set itself the ambitious objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by the end of this decade.
That strategy was agreed at a time of rapid economic growth across Europe and a lot has been achieved so far.
But these are much less buoyant times, made all the more challenging by enlargement and if we are to achieve our targets we need to increase the pace of reform.
The Irish presidency will seek to increase the relevance of the Lisbon agenda by focusing on areas that affect our everyday lives, because there can be no doubt that economic competitiveness, growth and investment, job creation, social protection, social inclusion, and sustainable development are all critical issues for the quality of life of Europe's citizens and for the relevance of the Union in their lives.
The European citizen is also deeply concerned about world affairs, because ours is an increasingly interdependent world.
The Union has both a duty and an opportunity to exercise its influence in the wider world, in pursuit of our shared values and, of course, our shared interests.
The Union's external relations agenda is simply vast.
It reflects the influence and the respect that the Union garners in all parts of our world.
I experienced this personally during a recent State Visit to China, whose leaders greatly value the development of closer links with the Union.
And, of course, with enlargement will come even greater authority.
Ireland's presidency will be taking place at a time of deep global insecurity.
War, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, famine, disease and organised crime are all vying for places on the international agenda alongside issues of trade, tariffs, global economics and global relationships.
External relations, therefore, will be another key aspect of the Irish presidency.
There is a variety of means by which the Irish presidency will continue to address these and other issues, including the power of our own particular history which makes us an especially effective bridge to the United States, home to so many of our Irish emigrants.
Ireland is also a special bridge to the developing countries, adopted homelands for thousands of Irish nurses, doctors, teachers, missionaries and aid workers who have made common cause for generations with the poorest of the poor.
Underpinning international peace and security is a vital network of multinational organisations and multilateral organisations of global, bilateral and regional relationships.
A stronger European Union makes that network stronger and it makes much louder the voice that champions the cause of peaceful coexistence and the fundamental human rights of every human being.
Close and direct cooperation on bilateral and regional issues will be a feature of our presidency, whether it is in Africa, Asia, the Americas or, closer to home, in the neighbouring countries to the Union's east and south-east - our new borders.
Nowhere is the call for the responsible exercise of power stronger than in the conduct of our relationships with the developing world.
The Union is the global leader in the provision of development assistance and this generosity of spirit is a badge we can wear with honour.
The European Commission and the Member States collectively contribute over 50% of global Overseas Development Assistance: over EUR 25 billion per year.
The European Union is the largest donor to multilateral debt relief.
It is the largest donor to AIDS programmes.
It is, by far, the biggest donor to Africa.
I have been fortunate to see with my own eyes the practical benefits of this aid in countries such as Uganda and Kenya and the real hope it gives to lives otherwise blighted by despair.
However, we cannot escape the fact that the overall level of development assistance from the rich countries has dropped to an unacceptably low level.
Even if we were to ignore the altruistic aspect of development assistance - which, of course, we should not - the single global civilisation in which we all now live highlights the myopia of such an approach.
The human misery caused by endemic poverty should shame us, but the instability engendered by it threatens all of us.
Poverty reduction rather than simply poverty management, is fundamental to Europe's future security strategy and we are in an ideal position to champion and end the poverty, disease, corruption, the oppression, the wasteful conflicts and post-colonial malaise which are denying so many human beings the right to a decent life.
Perhaps this is the new gauntlet that should be thrown down to the 25 Member States of the enlarged Union.
A Europe that has healed its own divisions can advocate its values with genuine credibility on the global stage.
Yet the recent conflicts in Yugoslavia and my birthplace, Northern Ireland, and the relentless misery of the Middle East should keep us humble and alert to the dangers that still lurk on or close to our own doorsteps.
It is chilling to realise that people can live literally right next door to one another and yet live in dangerous ignorance and fear of one another.
We Europeans must ensure that inside each of our nations and between our 25 nations, our children are taught respect for others so that they can grow up completely at home, comfortable, in a world of difference and diversity and be an example to the rest of the world.
The historic Good Friday Agreement was in many ways inspired by the European ideal.
Its institutional architecture was strongly influenced by the experience of conflict resolution in Western Europe.
One Member of this distinguished Chamber has been a tireless and persuasive advocate of the European model and he was, without a shadow of doubt, a key architect - if not key architect - of the Good Friday Agreement.
I refer, of course, to the great Derryman, Irishman and European, your colleague and Nobel Laureate, John Hume.
I am very privileged to be here today to salute with gratitude your vision, your courage and your achievements, John.
In Northern Ireland the European Union's Peace and Reconciliation Programmes, which are generously supported by the European Parliament, have benefited many previously alienated and excluded communities and given a renewed sense of hope and optimism about the future.
Together with the United States, the European Union has also been a very generous contributor to the International Fund for Ireland, which has worked right at the coalface of economic regeneration and reconciliation.
Now all that work is paying off and it is clear that the will for peace is the strongest impulse in the vast majority of hearts.
Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly will take place on 26 November 2003 and it is my fervent hope - and I am sure a hope shared by many of you here - that the choices made will help my birthplace become what I know it is capable of becoming - a showcase of partnership, tolerance, equality and peace.

There is a saying in the Irish language - - 'our strength is in partnership'.
It could be the motto of the European Union.
Its truth has been revealed many times over since the Union was founded and nowhere is its truth more evident than in my own country.
Now, a new generation, probably the most privileged ever to inhabit this continent, will have a chance to see what great strength is created when 15 becomes 25, when the restless energy of a half a billion people, working with each other and for each other, is harnessed to the task of writing Europe's best and happiest chapter yet.
Irish luck places us in the right place at the right time.
We intend to honour it well.
Â Â  I thank the President on behalf of the House.
I should like to say to her that this House is deeply committed to gender equality.
You are a splendid example of female political leadership.
The formal sitting is closed.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, I want to report to Parliament that at the September part-session this Parliament passed a report on the Lloyd's petitions, setting a deadline of 15Â November for the Commission to provide information to Parliament about its regulation of Lloyd's of London between 1978 and 2001.
I have to report that by 15Â November no such communication had been received from the Commission.
As rapporteur, I still am not aware of anything having been received by Parliament, although I am assured by Mr Bolkestein's services that his letter is in the post.
I hope that will be received in due course, but the deadline was not respected.
I shall raise this matter in writing, but I just wanted to put it on record.
Â Â  Mr President, it is now 14Â years since the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, on 20Â November 1989.
Unfortunately, our economies still operate in a way that fails to take account of childrenâs needs.
Child labour still takes place, in Portugal too, where it is estimated that over 4% of children work in various sectors, due to the precarious economic situation of many families.
We welcome the important initiatives condemning such practices and protecting childrenâs rights, specifically the global fight against child labour.
I would therefore urge everyone, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to demonstrate greater commitment to ensuring that a childâs smile signifies hope for a fairer world, in which child labour does not exist.
Â Â  We take note of your remarks, MrsÂ Figueiredo.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on three Community action programmes:
- the report (A5-0384/2003) by Mr SacrÃ©deus, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community action programme for bodies promoting reciprocal understanding of relations between the European Union and certain non-industrialised regions in the world (COM(2003) 280 C5-0350/2003 2003/0110(CNS))
- the report (A5-0368/2003) by Mrs RÃŒhle, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote active European citizenship (civic participation) (COM(2003) 276 C5-0321/2003 2003/0116(CNS)) and
- the report (A5-0396/2003) by Mr Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women (COM(2003) 279 C5-0261/2003 2003/0109(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, since this is a joint debate, the bad news is that I shall have to speak at some length, but the good news is I will be as quick as I possibly can whilst not avoiding responding to the detailed issues that have been raised by honourable Members in their activities, which I know reflect the hard and intensive work they have been doing.
As this House knows, the three European institutions worked together to secure a new Financial Regulation in 2002 that will come into effect on 1Â January 2003.
The regulation provides inter alia a clear framework for subsidies through which we support a large number of European organisations in the dialogue with European citizens, and it also stipulates that each financial decision should have a legal basis to ensure its justification.
That requirement is particularly relevant for those subsidies which have been financed from lines whose position in the budgetary structure the so-called A-part of the budget meant that they could be assimilated into administrative expenditure and consequently be incurred without a clear legal basis.
The modification of the budgetary structure introduced in the new Financial Regulation has brought to an end this assimilation of administrative expenditure, meaning that a legal basis for the subsidies in question is now required.
It is this new obligation which led the Commission in May 2003 to present seven proposals for new legal bases.
These were accompanied by a communication from Mrs Schreyer, which underlined the common context and presented identical solutions for common problems.
The Commission welcomes this report by Mr SacrÃ©deus and appreciates the priority which the drafters and Parliament have given to dealing with the Commissionâs proposal.
With Parliamentâs opinion it should now be possible to have the decision in force in 2004 and following a call for proposals, to go ahead with the selection of beneficiaries for operating grants for next year.
The goal agreed between Parliament and Council during the conciliation of 16 July was the entry into force, by 2004, of the legal bases for grants which did not have that coverage.
The legal base presented today, together with the six other proposals covering grants, is important because it is a direct consequence of the innovations concerning grants in the new Financial Regulation and is firmly anchored in the basic principles of transparency and equal treatment for potential beneficiaries.
Most of the amendments proposed in Parliament's resolution are acceptable to the Commission and in keeping with the spirit of the Commissionâs proposal.
However, the Commission thinks it appropriate to limit the amount of the grant to 70% of the eligible costs and not 80%.
Similarly, the Commission is of the view that a digressivity rate of 10% per year is preferable to 2.5%.
Our view is that both of these requirements are safeguards which will go some way to ensuring sustainability and encouraging beneficiaries to be active in seeking alternative and complementary revenue streams.
One point which should be mentioned is the need to ensure coherence between the proposed Council decision and the budget.
In the Preliminary Draft Budget the Commission proposed one budget line to regroup amounts which, in the 2003 budget, are distributed over four lines in Chapter A 30.
The future legal base for this single line, as required by the new Financial Regulation, is the proposed decision which is before the House today.
This decision provides for the selection of beneficiaries following a call for proposals in accordance with the principles of transparency and equal treatment.
At first reading, Parliament replaced the single line with five lines.
The title of each line is the name of an Institute.
There is a clear incompatibility between the future legal base and the division of the budget line in this manner.
The Commission hopes that the adopted budget will correspond to the PDB proposal, so permitting us to execute the proposal and appropriations in full compliance with European Law as defined by the new Financial Regulation adopted by this House and the Council.
I now turn to the report by Mrs RÃŒhle on the proposal for an action programme to promote civic participation.
I am grateful to Mrs RÃŒhle for having acknowledged the urgency of this matter and for having ensured speedy adoption by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. This has been immensely helpful.
The Commission's proposal before the House seeks to ensure harmonious transition from the old system to the new arrangements and continuity in the activities being supported.
We have endeavoured to produce a text which, to a large extent, extends the 2003 implementation procedures while incorporating the requirements of the new Financial Regulation in terms of sound financial management of public funds.
This proposal for a legal basis should therefore be considered a technical adjustment.
There is, nevertheless, a great and understandable temptation to grasp the opportunity to add innovations and suggest improvements.
Parliament, as ever, is immensely helpful with this creativity.
This may, however, be risky particularly if such additions compromise the subsequent adoption of the proposal by the Council.
The Commission's proposal has therefore been formulated in what we consider to be a measured way, with the essential objective of continuing what has already been accomplished and by providing a legal structure which is consistent with the new Financial Regulation.
I would consequently invite honourable Members not to distance themselves too much from the Commission's proposals and to do their utmost to ensure that this legal basis is adopted as quickly as possible.
Furthermore, in the case of the legal basis for active civic participation, the margin for manoeuvre is even more limited because unanimity is required in Council.
All avenues for compromise must be explored if we are to succeed in completing this procedure as speedily as possible.
In fact, as from 1 January 2004, in the absence of this legal basis, it would quite simply not be possible for us to provide financial support to all the organisations which participate actively in the promotion of European citizenship.
We would greatly regret that, and doubtless Parliament would too.
I shall now outline the position of the Commission on the amendments contained in Mrs RÃŒhle's report.
The Commission can accept in full Amendments 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 13 and 31, which provide useful clarifications to the text.
While recalling the need to apply the new Financial Regulation, the Commission sees no objection to Amendment 45 on the simplification of administrative procedures.
It goes without saying that the Commission will impose an obligation on those who have received a European subsidy to provide adequate publicity.
While entirely agreeing with Parliament on this point, as outlined in Amendment 48, we feel that it would be more appropriate to list this obligation in the conventions to be signed with the beneficiaries.
The same holds true for Amendment 49 on the dissemination and availability of results.
The Commission agrees with Amendment 47, which underlines the need for regular exchanges of views with the beneficiaries.
The Commission can partly accept Amendment 25.
Since the amendment does not alter the substance of the Commission proposal, we can accept the proposal to specify that the budgetary appropriations scheduled after 2006 are subject to an agreement of the budgetary authority on the financial perspective beyond 2006.
However, the Commission is willing to accept the same duration for all seven proposals in the package until 2006 if that helps to find a compromise for all the proposals with a view to having them adopted in time for implementing the budget in 2004.
As this proposal has to be seen in conjunction with the other proposals in the package, the amendments on 'earmarking' and the possibility of an executive agency also have to be settled in the broader context.
The Commission cannot accept, in the same amendment, a reference to the total amount allocated to the programme since this is not consistent with the legislative procedures provided for in the consultation procedure.
The Commission can also partially accept Amendment 28.
We have no objections to sending reports on implementation of the programme, but we cannot accept transferring the content of the Annex to Article 8a, which would not be in line with the usual format of legal texts.
The same applies to Amendments 20, 21, 22, 29 and 30, which the Commission rejects.
The Commission understands the view of Parliament on the matter of focusing on potential enlargement of the scope and objectives of this proposal.
