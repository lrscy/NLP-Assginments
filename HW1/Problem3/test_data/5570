All the transaction costs and lack of security.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, customers in my own country, Austria, have had a free choice of electricity suppliers since 2001 and of gas suppliers since 2002.
It is now time for regulated liberalisation to be succeeded by a period of further deregulation.
Rather than the pressures of regulation, we want more competition.
That is why we say 'yes' to the internal market.
Where this is concerned, I start by asking myself why it is that, in most cases, it is still by reference to the national market that competition is assessed.
Does this old thinking bear any relation to cross-border exchanges in electricity and gas, or to the realities of the networks?
I would say, no, it does not.
Does it not foster distortion of competition in favour of the larger states and energy-producing companies as against smaller ones?
I would say that it does.
Reconsideration of this is necessary and appropriate.
Turning to my second area of concern, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Mombaur, and the Committee for taking on board the concerns of the Association of European Transmission System Operators and of Vorarlberger Illwerke AG.
These have to do with the way in which the definition of cross-border flow is being changed to refer to regulated zones instead of to the borders of the Member States.
The old definition is national rather than European and hence contrary to the promotion of cross-border exchanges in electricity through the integration of the internal market in electricity.
It is something that we have to change.
Thirdly, I would like to have something clarified.
We keep talking about the regulatory authorities of the Member States concerned.
By this, we should always mean the competent authorities - for it is not always necessarily the regulatory authorities that are competent.
. (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the three main rapporteurs, Mr Turmes, Mr Mombaur and Mr Rapkay, most sincerely once again for their superb work and their speeches.
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their speeches and say that perhaps Mr van Velzen - one of the shadow rapporteurs along with Mr Linkohr and Mr Clegg - summed up best what most speakers have said here, in other words, that we would like more.
I agree. The work that has been carried out here, however, has been superb and has led to the result we have now achieved.
Perhaps it is not perfect, but it is sufficient to represent a spectacular change or step forward in the electricity and gas sectors, and will boost these sectors and contribute to the internal market.
It will also address an extremely important issue, and here I am referring to what Mr Linkohr, amongst others, has pointed out, as has Mrs McNally, namely the problem of symmetry created by the current situation of partial liberalisation.
What we are trying to do here is establish a European market rather than 15 markets - 25 as of May 1 - that is more or less open to competition. What we are trying to do is create an internal market and, in this regard, I would like to say, as has already been pointed out, that we do not want uncontrolled liberalisation, but regulated liberalisation, as I said at the start.
Furthermore, Mr Herzog spoke of the problem of networks.
I am going to discuss these by referring to Mr Clegg's report.
I would like to thank the Greek Presidency once again, in particular, for the work carried out with regard to the liberalisation of gas and electricity in these two Directives and this Regulation.
I shall now address the matter of networks, which Mr Herzog quite rightly raised.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has just voted on the amendments concerning subjects relating to the financial regulation and in this regard, in this context, I would like to state on behalf of the Commission that in our report to the other institutions we too shall present the reasons justifying increased support for any individual project.
As the Commission proposed in revising the financial regulation, the possibility of such increased support should be clearly justified and should be an exception.
Why do we need to establish trans-European networks?
Mr Herzog said that there is no Community logic in the networks, which is clear in some cases, and that in order to establish this internal market in the gas and electricity sectors we do not just need regulatory standards, but also infrastructures that support this idea of an internal market, and security within this internal market that allows sufficient capacity for peak demand points; extraordinary increases or extraordinary situations.
I believe that in this regard the regulation we are adopting today represents a model for something we have been discussing for some time, which is the public service aspect of certain issues.
This is the regulation that most takes account of the public service concept in addressing the issues of protection and support for the most vulnerable customers, security with regard to the service itself - in this case security of supply - and also quality of service, by drawing up minimum basic requirements for all the Member States in order to guarantee security in practical terms, not only in terms of production, but also in terms of transport, which are essential when we are discussing energy.
With regard to these networks - Mr Clegg's report - I would like to raise two further matters.
As regards the amendment on presenting regular reports, the Commission can accept a reporting period of two years. With regard to updating projects, all important updates will continue to be the responsibility of Parliament, and I would stress this, while the Commission will simply retain the capacity to introduce technical changes into the projects.
I would also welcome the compromise achieved in this area by Parliament and the Council, which will enable us definitively to adopt trans-European networks in the energy sector, completing the entire framework.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Greek Presidency for the superb work that has been carried out and express my sincere congratulations.
In particular, I would also like to thank and congratulate Parliament, the three main rapporteurs, plus Mr Clegg and all the shadow rapporteurs who have carried out this work that has led, even if we might perhaps have wished for more, to this superb result.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0144/2003) by Mr Wilhelm Ernst Piecyk, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 on the accelerated phasing in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94 (COM(2002) 780 - C5-0629/2002 - 2002/0310(COD)).
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sinking of the Prestige oil tanker off the Galician coast on 18 November last clearly demonstrated, once again, the insufficiencies of international maritime safety legislation specifically regulating oil transport by sea.
This accident highlighted, in particular, the urgent need to adopt the measures presented by the Commission following another similar accident involving the Erika.
Some weeks after the sinking of the Prestige, therefore, the Commission sent the European Parliament and the Council a new Regulation introducing three urgent measures into current legislation.
First of all, an immediate ban on the transport of heavy oil grades in single-hull oil tankers bound for or leaving ports, offshore terminals or anchorage areas in the Member States of the European Union.
Secondly, a revision of the scheme for an accelerated phasing out of single-hull oil tankers, by reducing the maximum permitted age of vessels and bringing forward the deadlines for abolishment with regard to those originally proposed by the measures in the Erika I package, in order to increase protection of the marine environment, thereby incorporating the Commission's original proposals in the so-called Erika I package.
Thirdly, a more general application of the special inspection regime for oil tankers, in order to assess the structural integrity of single-hull vessels over fifteen years old.
All this means that the new Regulation aims to change the current situation radically, making it obligatory to transport fuels with the highest pollution risk in safer vessels.
By means of the new system, the European Union intends to apply legislation as stringent as that applied in the US since 1992 following the Exxon Valdez disaster.
Lastly, this legislation increases technical inspections of oil tankers that have not yet reached the maximum age limit.
All single-hull oil tankers, including small vessels - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would emphasise this point - that were initially exempt, will now, as of fifteen years of age, have to comply with condition assessment schemes (CAS).
Vessels that fail the strict inspection controls will be immediately held in any port of the European Union.
As you are well aware, in March the Ministers for Transport reached a unanimous policy agreement concerning these measures.
Examination by the Council made it possible to introduce a number of amendments that improved the initial proposal.
For example, the Regulation now comprises a clearer definition of what is meant by heavy oil grades, for the purposes of applying the bans contained in the proposal.
The definition is based on technical parameters that are well known to the sector and the authorities will have no difficulty in applying it.
Account is also taken of the situation of the fleet of small oil tankers operating in our ports, islands and coasts, which requires an additional adaptation period, but which should also be the subject of adaptation and improvement in terms of safety.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Greek Presidency, and in particular the Minister for the Merchant Navy, Mr Anomeritis, for its excellent work throughout this process.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the key points of our proposal.
Its final objective is, as we have repeated many times, to prevent another Erika, another Prestige, another Aegean Sea, another Amoco Cadiz, or any other disaster of this kind in our waters.
. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on this report this week, we will, I believe, have achieved in record time something that the people of Europe and the public at large have been awaiting with urgency.
It is, after all, self-evident that, after the accidents involving the Prestige and the Erika, something had to happen.
When it comes to transporting oil, we are giving old, unsafe, and dangerous ships no more chances.
At the same time, Parliament and the Council are directing that bulk shipments may now be transported from and into EU ports only in double hull tankers.
By combining these factors, which I see as the most important - heavy oil into and out of European ports from now on only in double hull tankers - and by significantly speeding up the scrapping of the old single hull tankers, we are making the sea and European waters safer to a substantial degree.
Only a few months have elapsed between the Commission's initiative and the first reading here in Parliament, and this first reading will also be the last, as that is what has been agreed by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, who have, so to speak, taken a united approach.
For that reason I would like to extend very warm thanks to the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for playing their part in this process, as well as to the Greek Presidency, which - as Commissioner De Palacio has already mentioned - has gone to a great deal of trouble, and also to the Commission, for doing such a good job of bringing the Council and Parliament together so promptly to do this.
This fast-track procedure was possible because the political will to find a consensus was there and - for we have to be honest - because the Prestige disaster made the need for action even more pressing.
Let me just make the following points about the preferred timescale for scrapping. Single hull tankers in category 1, that is, ships built before 1982, may not be operated for longer than 23 years and must be taken out of service by 2005 at the latest.
Single hull tankers in categories 2 and 3, built between 1982 and 1996, may be operated until 2010 at the latest.
In this, the Council and Parliament have gone even further than the Commission, but I think that there is justification for putting categories 2 and 3 together, as there is no difference between them apart from their tonnages.
Small tankers between 600 and 5 000 tonnes are rightly included as regards the carrying of heavy oil, and here too we have reached a compromise, as, in view of their small number and in order to maintain supplies, we have agreed on 2008, which means that, from that date onwards, only small double hull tankers will be able to be used to transport heavy oil.
In this connection I would like to emphasise the international dimension.
We know, of course, that shipping is international, and that European rules on their own cannot cover everything.
Without European rules, though, we would make no real headway through the International Maritime Organisation, which is very heavy going, and so it is a good thing that the IMO is holding a conference on this subject at the end of this year, at which the Commission and the Council will attempt to have European rules made applicable internationally, in doing which they have Parliament's full support.
It is also, of course, the case that double hull tankers on their own are not the safety factor on which everything depends.
Other safety factors include port State control, the way in which a ship is maintained, a well-trained crew, and good navigation, often also with the help of pilots in difficult waters.
The oil industry's argument, as set out in the 'Neue ZÃŒrcher Zeitung', that a well-maintained old single hull tanker with a good crew could be much safer than a sloppily-maintained double hull tanker with a sub-standard crew, may well have some truth to it, but it is hypocritical and somewhat stupid.
Nobody, after all, asserts that a fifty-year old car is worse than a brand-new Rolls-Royce whose brakes work and whose driver doesn't fall asleep.
For the oil industry to adduce such an argument is pretty dubious.
We, on the contrary, agree that it is a combination of diverse factors that makes a ship safer.
Let me address a couple more aspects. A Chinese freighter has sunk off the Swedish coast, and oil is leaking from it - 400 tonnes of it so far.
That is why we will, in future, also need rules covering how fuel and engine oil are to be made safer even on double hull tankers.
Old ships are to be taken out of service, and must be safely disposed of.
If that is to be done in an environmentally friendly way, that cannot mean scuppering them somewhere in the South Seas.
My final point is that Europe has a particular need for new and better ships, which - in view of the dumping that demonstrably goes on - must, for God's sake, not all be built in Korea.
Whilst this is not a discussion about subsidies, the Commission and the Council do need to come up with imaginative initiatives on this, for the building of better ships in European shipyards certainly makes more economic sense than what happened on the coast of Galicia.
Mr President, by and large the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy goes along with the Commission proposal and the amendments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
We had three proposed amendments.
Two of them are largely accepted in Mr Piecyk's report.
One concerned the question of ice-breaking ships carrying fuel in the Baltic.
The other was the question of the 600 to 5 000 tonne tankers which we were concerned would not be available.
We wanted a five-year waiting period to 2008.
The period will be more or less five years so we will go along with that.
We were surprised at this figure of 25.7 API that was pulled out for the definition of heavy crude oil.
The generally recognised international level between intermediate and heavy is 22 API.
We cannot understand why that, as we proposed, was not an acceptable level.
I understand the Council has also gone for this figure of 25.7, which will probably cause certain troubles, especially in the North Sea oil fields.
Be that as it may.
Having said that, this will not avoid the next spillage of oil.
Until we can get the IMO on board with these sorts of standards we will still get Prestiges leaving a non-EU port, plying past the EU to a non-EU port with a non-EU flag.
Those are the problems we have to face.
We really must get the IMO to come to terms with these standards.
Also, we must have a scheme to help with the transition from the single-hulled tankers to the double-hulled, especially in the 600 to 5 000 tonne level.
A scrapping and building assistance system must be set up.
. (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me firstly to make a very personal observation.
The week before the Prestige accident, my party and I organised a conference on maritime safety in the Bay of Finland, that is to say on precisely those issues referred to by, for example, Mr Purvis.
You can appreciate my feelings when I then suspected, and was finally able to have it confirmed, where the Prestige actually came from, and understood that the situation could have been precisely the same in the Bay of Finland as off the coast of Galicia.
At the same time, we know that we can presumably expect the amount of traffic through the Baltic to increase tenfold.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has been closely involved in this issue.
We are also trying to improve Parliament's reputation.
We perhaps had something to hide where the Erika package was concerned.
The opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy also emphasises the importance of neighbouring countries' subscribing to the same rules because, as Mr Purvis also pointed out, these tankers sail close to our coasts, even if they do not put into EU harbours.
We also support the proposal for having 2010 as the final phasing-out year, a proposal that the Council had come up with and that we are now prepared to agree upon.
We also propose that the inspection requirements be looked at.
We should have liked to have seen the inspection requirements apply irrespective of age.
We are now talking about 15 year-old vessels, but it is important for a vessel, irrespective of age, to be of a good class and standard and to be well maintained.
Our experience shows that what the EU has agreed upon is in fact translated into the rules of the IMO.
We saw this most recently in connection with the oil fund.
What worries me is why we have not at this stage been able to adopt the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that there be a paragraph stating that we must demand ice-strengthening.
I want to ask the Commissioner why the Commission has set its face against our adding a paragraph introducing ice-strengthening requirements, in addition to the requirements for single hull vessels to be phased out and double hull vessels phased in.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Loyola de Palacio for her excellent work, and my colleague, Mr Piecyk, who, in a very short space of time, has produced a well-thought out and, in my opinion, very high quality piece of work seeking to improve the text of the proposal.
I would like to focus on two points, firstly legislation.
It is true that Europe has adopted a large number of measures, but it is equally true that public opinion is currently increasingly doubtful that they are being implemented.
Over and above this report on double hulls - we must not, in any case, allow the examples it quotes by way of illustration to mislead us as to the impact, for we know very well that double hulls will not remove all maritime risks and that there is no such thing as zero risk - we believe that it is extremely important that the European Union ensures that the Erika I and Erika II packages are actually being enforced.
In this regard, I have to say to the Commissioner that I compiled a detailed account for the port of Bordeaux last year, after the Prestige disaster, that is.
Eight old tubs featuring on the European blacklist entered the port without the French maritime authorities being able to confirm that they had been properly controlled.
I suppose that what happened on a small scale in this minor port is representative of a much larger scale situation across Europe and, in my view, what our citizens now want is for Europe to make the Member States directly responsible, as directly responsible as possible, for we know that they are not all progressing at the same rate and that some are more willing to cooperate than others
My second point concerns reparation for damage linked to disasters such as that of the Prestige.
I have to tell you, Commissioner, that there is great disillusionment in France.
The IOPCF is providing no more than 15% and the Structural Funds will not contribute any more than what is provided for under the FIFG.
In my opinion, this will do a great deal of harm to the image of the European Union as a whole and to the image of the Commission, in particular.
Lastly, again with regard to reparation for damage, we would like to receive accurate information on the progress made in dealing with the wreck and on what is likely to happen in the future.
Are we facing chronic pollution, which will last for years, or is a solution emerging?
There has been no response from the authorities for some months now.
We need accurate information and we must, if possible, reassure our fellow citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission for making haste and bringing this proposal about so quickly, and also, in particular, for the soundness of the proposal on the accelerated phasing out of single hull tankers in European waters.
It is sad that the Prestige accident proved necessary for us to take action once more, and to finally convince the Council that we have to make policy together and that it was necessary to strengthen the Erika packages with the present measures.
I myself have another two amendments, which concern the Annex to this proposal.
Firstly, as a liberal, I do not like to see a discussion on State aid to the shipping sector in an important proposal such as this.
I recognise that action is badly needed, preferably through the WTO, to put an end to the dumping of ships on the world market by countries in the Far East.
I hope that the European Commission also appreciates the necessity of this.
I firmly believe in the strength of the European shipbuilding sector, however.
Short-term aid does not seem to me to be efficient.
I think that my own amendment concerning recital 7a is a good supplement to the otherwise excellent report.
My second amendment expresses the great responsibility that I feel regarding the consequences of the accelerated phasing out of single hull tankers by this EU policy.
I firmly believe that this must be accompanied by binding rules requiring all EU shipowners and all EU flag State ships to actively scrap phased-out tankers in a responsible manner.
In the case of cars we have an end-of-life vehicle directive.
I think that something like that must also apply here.
In short, see recital 5a.
Storing surplus oil tankers on the coast of Bangladesh and India causes greater disasters and has greater consequences than the Prestige disaster, and that was terrible enough.
There are already initiatives enabling the commercial scrapping, on market terms, of ships in Europe in an environmentally responsible manner.
This is waste management.
The practice of disposing of ships out at sea and the rotten scrapping of these in poor regions must be a thing of the past.
I hope, therefore, that double hull tankers will in future really be safer, partly also as a result of port State controls.
I personally endorse, as does my Group, the Commission's aim in introducing this regulatory measure, which, in any event, we support.
We have to say, however, that it has been a long time in coming, since we have already endured the Prestige disaster, which happened when the ship should no longer have been at sea according to the terms of the Commission's initial proposals.
The measure is overdue and falls well short of what is required.
The Union should adopt political and legislative measures to ban single hull ships carrying dangerous goods such as petroleum derivatives from sailing anywhere in waters under European Union economic control, and not just ban such ships from entering Community ports and using Community anchorages, as the Regulation does.
We would like, furthermore, to see 'sensitive coastal areas' defined in this Regulation, and entry to them restricted for oil tankers posing a particular risk.
In any case, we must be aware - and the blame lies with certain Member States of the European Union and with this House - that, over and above the proposals for double hulls, which we support, there are no political and legislative measures either in place or envisaged capable of preventing a fresh disaster if a new Prestige case were to occur.
We Galicians are vividly and painfully aware of this fact.
After this Regulation, and even in spite of it, a new Prestige may once again sail off the shores of Galicia and other affected countries; there is no law to prevent it.
Mr President, in its Resolution of November 2002 and following the sinking of the Prestige oil tanker off the Galician coast, Parliament called for the Council and the Member States to speed up the application of the measures adopted within the context of the Erika I and Erika II packages, such as the introduction of double hull vessels.
We therefore welcome the draft Regulation presented to us by the Commissioner, but we still feel that the gradual introduction of double hull vessels by the Union is an insufficient, if necessary, measure.
So far nobody has explained to us the percentage reduction in maritime accidents depending on whether the vessel is single or double hulled. Nor has anyone explained what percentage of vessels involved in serious maritime accidents recently had double hulls.
We believe this is a good thing and we are prepared to support the Commissioner in her personal crusade, but we do not want to fail to see the wood for the trees and we do not believe that double hulls are the solution.
If only they were, Commissioner.
Although they are not the solution, we do feel they offer advantages which, in our opinion, have not been emphasised enough. Two such advantages are that double hulls force us to assess the condition of our fleet and also force us to renew it.
Increasing maritime safety involves financial costs. That is another matter that we feel is somewhat lacking in the Commission proposal - a little more clarity with regard to funding.
We still think, however, that, although age affects the general condition of a vessel, all the experts emphasise that maintenance is a better determining factor than age.
Like so many European citizens who have approached us, therefore, we believe that double hulls will only be effective if accompanied by the corresponding investment in improving the current system of inspections and penalties, which obliges vessels' owners to invest in their maintenance and in improving the social aspect in this sector, as we sometimes have the impression that the Commission would like to tiptoe around this issue.
In this regard I would pass on to the Commissioner the question on everyone's lips: why, in disasters relating to the maritime transport of fuel, are the regions worst struck by this kind of tragedy those that are most closely linked to the sea, relying on commercial, fishing and naval construction ports?
In both Brittany and Galicia the shipyards have all but vanished, leading to industrial desertification of entire areas, and yet, the way things are, it does not seem as though these shipyards are going to benefit most from this Regulation.
Korean shipyards, which are more competitive and have no problems regarding compatibility and State aid, will benefit most.
This means that public opinion has the impression that the Commission is being inconsistent.
Yes to double hulls, therefore, but only if the requirements and quality of renovated vessels comply with European construction quality standards, environmental standards, social standards and quality standards.
I would also ask whether Korea meets these requirements, which are increasingly compulsory for our European citizens.
What is a dirty vessel?
Will we find, due to the application of this Regulation, some recently built dirty vessels with double hulls?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly and most importantly I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the efficient, proper way in which he has proceeded with this report.
When it comes to this problem of marine oil pollution, the citizens of Europe, as well as the environment and the maritime sector, expect a Europe that takes strong action.
I think that we have succeeded in this.
I think that the proposals on the table here are the most attainable.
In the longer term, I should also like to see the other proposals my group has presented return in the form of a directive.
They are as follows: redefining heavy fuel oil as waste, establishing a European coastguard service, and an obligatory percentage of ship inspections per port and not per Member State: otherwise, in 15 years' time, we shall have the same problems with the double hull tankers.
I have two further remarks.
The first of these relates to shipbuilding.
The European shipbuilding sector is doing particularly badly.
Tightening up the Erika package has the potential to breathe new life into the sector.
The Commission can present proposals on this.
Secondly, I share the concern of my fellow Member Mr Vermeer regarding the worldwide measures.
There is the danger of this leading to Europe exporting oil slick disasters.
I therefore advocate banging our fist on the table at the International Maritime Organisation to press for single hull tankers to be phased out for good worldwide, ahead of schedule.
. (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, once again for his wonderful work and also for his speed.
There is no question that we have all pooled our efforts, because we are all aware that it was urgent for us to do so.
We rather have the feeling that the Erika I and Erika II packages have unfortunately come late, and that we must try to prevent being too late for a new Erika, a new Prestige or a new disaster.
We must do everything we can to prevent this happening again.
In this regard, I would like once again to thank the rapporteur.
I must reply and make it clear that we are prepared to accept all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, though with some modifications to the wording.
Amendment No 3 requires the Council and the Member States to issue the Commission with a mandate to negotiate with the International Maritime Organisation; the honourable Members are aware that, although we do not formally have full powers within the international Maritime Organisation, we are coordinating the latest actions.
I would remind you that we have had considerable success recently, multiplying the FIPOL fund by 5.
A moment ago Mr Savary told us how clearly insufficient it was in relation to the damage caused by the Prestige accident, and it was also insufficient in relation to the damage caused by the Erika, but in the latter case Totalfina took a responsible attitude and contributed to some of the costs, something which the people responsible for or owners of the cargo are clearly not going to do in the case of the Prestige.
That is now crystal clear.
But, in the end, within the International Maritime Organisation, we have managed to increase the FIPOL funds by 5, to some EUR 950 million (more than a billion dollars at the current exchange rate) compared to 170-180 million dollars previously.
That is a good result.
We are in agreement with Amendment No 3, although there will have to be some modification of the wording.
Amendment No 6 requires the Commission to present a new proposal, in as short a time as possible, in relation to the fuel all ships carry for their own propulsion.
This requires an agreement within the International Maritime Organisation, which we are prepared to promote for newly built ships.
This amendment therefore also needs some correction of its wording.
Amendment No 7 refers to the shipbuilding industry.
Several of the honourable Members have referred to it and are well aware - and my colleague Mr Lamy is here, and it is he who is handling the negotiations - that we have the problem of the clearly unfair behaviour on the part of Korea.
We are implementing a series of measures to try to prevent the disappearance of European shipbuilders at a time when Korean shipbuilding and shipbuilding in certain other countries is growing as a result of the substantial state subsidies they receive, leading to entirely unfair competition.
This support for our shipbuilders must clearly be provided by means of the World Trade Organisation and by means of certain types of specific action, but always guaranteeing compliance with the rules on state aid laid down in the Treaty.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take up some of the issues raised here today.
Firstly, Mr Piecyk said that this is not a panacea, a point which has been repeated by Mr Purvis and other speakers.
Unfortunately, replacing single hull oil tankers with double hull oil tankers will not guarantee that we do not have another sea disaster, either in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
But it is one more measure which will allow us to increase safety.
Safety depends on a range of measures, all aspects of which must be applied coherently.
In this regard, Mr Savary was absolutely right when he said that the first thing we have to demand is that the Erika I and Erika II packages be applied.
As the honourable Members know, the Maritime Safety Agency is operational, with a provisional headquarters, but operational nonetheless, and one of its functions is to guarantee that, in all ports of the European Union, appropriate controls are carried out; that the classification societies carry out their appropriate control obligations.
These are elements which must be implemented with all the new requirements and standards we have demanded of both the port authorities and of the classification societies.
The implementation of the Erika I and II packages and the Regulation we are discussing today is simply going to guarantee us a level of safety equivalent to that of the United States. Let us not allow a situation such as the one we have been in for many years, for too many years, which I believe to be inconceivable: that the citizens of the European Union have enjoyed less safety on their coastlines than the citizens of the United States.
Following the Exxon Valdez the United States took quick decisions, while in the European Union we have been dragging our feet and not because there had not been other disasters before the Prestige or the Erika.
We had the Aegean Sea, the Amoco Cadiz and many others. So what we are doing here is creating equivalent levels of safety.
But that is not enough, and Mr Purvis and Mrs Thors were right about this.
We must negotiate with Russia, in particular, but also with our Mediterranean neighbours, and persuade them to introduce systems which are equivalent to ours.
I have faith in the crusade referred to by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, and I believe that I am not alone, but that I am accompanied by all the honourable Members and many people outside who have the same concerns as me.
We must therefore promote the participation of our neighbours, of Russia firstly, but also of all the Mediterranean countries.
The other day at the Euro-Mediterranean meeting of energy ministers the issues of the double hull, of port controls and of maritime safety were raised and there was support for this issue.
And this weekend at the European Union Summit with Russia, Russia has committed itself to supporting the case for double hulls, not only in its own territory, but also, like the Mediterranean countries, in the International Maritime Organisation, because it is of little use if the disaster is caused by a ship in transit.
Finally, the International Maritime Organisation must take steps in relation to the responsibility of the flag state, preventing flags of convenience, which unfortunately often disguise a complete lack of controls and guarantees.
We must make progress on the human factor, which is always key and essential - in shipping, in the maritime sector, as in any other sector - and this means, as Mrs MiguÃ©lez said a moment ago, and there are proposals on the table, that the issue of the qualifications and abilities of crews is essential, not only within the Community, but also within the International Maritime Organisation and the International Labour Organisation.
Eventually, legislation will have to be modified at international level, at the level of United Nations maritime law, so that the rights of coastal states and coastal populations are better safeguarded and taken into account in a more balanced fashion.
We cannot allow freedom of the seas to become simply uncontrolled freedom to sail genuine ecological time bombs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are taking a very important step forward, but it is not enough; we must continue to move forward and a key element is the application of what we have already approved.
Commissioner, you pointed out that a range of measures is required.
As we have heard in this House, ice-strengthening is also required in certain marine areas.
Is the Commission prepared to support this regulation's introducing a binding condition concerning this matter?
Or what other measures is the Commission prepared to take?
. (ES) Mr President, at the request of the Finnish delegation, account has been taken of oil tankers in areas of ice formation in the Baltic.
We have not only raised the issue of ice strengthening, in other words, specific safety measures for oil tankers in areas of ice formation, particularly, amongst others, the Baltic sea, with regard to a specific regulation in the European Union, but also within the International Maritime Organisation.
We have also raised the issue of sensitive areas within this forum, as requested by some of the ladies and gentlemen here present, as well as the issue of prohibiting the carriage of heavy oils in any single-hull ship, not simply, as is currently the case, with regard to our ports and anchorage areas, but also with regard to any other international port.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0115/2003) by Mrs Erika Mann, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on regional free trade areas and trade strategy in the European Union (2002/2044(INI)).
Mr President, a parallel process of regional integration has almost always accompanied the multilateral liberalisation of trade in the post-war period.
In particular, the 1990's witnessed an exponential increase in the number of regional trade agreements being negotiated.
Regionalism refers to the reaction by governments to liberalise or facilitate trade on a regional basis, sometimes through free trade areas or customs unions.
In a double WTO context, regional trade agreements have both a broader meaning and a more specific one.
Article 24 of GATT allows for the exceptional establishment of preferential regional trade initiatives, granted that they meet the following criteria: firstly, double WTO members should be notified of the details; secondly, duties and other trade barriers should be reduced or removed substantially on all sectors of trade in the group; and thirdly, barriers of trade to non-signatories should not be higher than they were previously.
Regional trade agreements are not uniform.
The coverage and depth of preferential treatment varies from one agreement to the other.
One may involve only a few products or sectors, while the other may extend well beyond traditional tariffs to areas such as intellectual property and standards.
In fact, a number of RTAs currently being negotiated seem to be anticipating an evolution of the multi-lateral trading system by seeking to cover subjects that have thus far been excluded from or not sufficiently discussed at a multilateral level, such as government procurement, child labour and human rights.
In recent years RTAs have developed into a more complex configuration and there is a growing number of overlapping RTA networks that span across continents at regional and sub-regional level.
Being a part of an RTA has its positive political benefits.
On a most important level, RTAs have great strategic value and play a role in maintaining geopolitical balance in regions.
RTAs are useful signals of a major power interest in the region, and maintaining strong economic and trade ties with all major powers may yet prove to be an effective means of maintaining regional stability.
FTAs should be based on the rule of reciprocity.
Having said that, one should bear in mind that trade facilitation and globalisation is highly influenced by the relative development of participating countries.
Differences in negotiating skills, technology, financing and quality of infrastructure are just a few of the impediments to the successful conclusion of an agreement involving at least one developing country.
Yet the developing world cannot be left out of multilateral trade liberalisation.
Regional integration is the backbone of the European Union.
The trade aspect has been an essential component of what has ultimately evolved into a comprehensive political union.
It has further served to maintain the EU's external relations with third countries.
The Presidency Conclusions of the Amsterdam European Council of June 1997 outline the basis of the EU's policy on FTAs.
This was supplemented by the report to the European Council on the development of trade policy and the preferential agreements of the Community, which sets out the EU's objective of reflecting the nature of the relations with the partners concerned and a broader geopolitical environment.
In the same document, the Commission goes on to state that the trade policy - particularly the FTA aspect - allows for the simultaneous development of a relevant regulatory framework in a more comprehensive manner than that currently allowed by the relevant multilateral framework and timeframe of the WTO.
The EU is slowly moving away from the establishment of traditional FTAs with its main trading partners.
It is seeking deep integration and looks for convergence on regulatory regimes.
The European Parliament and the report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy support this approach by the Commission.
The Commission puts the multilateral approach first, which is also supported by the committee.
However, despite strong economic relations, the EU does not have a single FTA in Asia.
An FTA with an Asian country will anchor the presence of the EU in that region.
Regional leaders in ASEAN have indicated that agreements such as that proposed by Singapore to the EU would not endanger regional relations.
Rather, as long as the agreement offers scope for extension within the ASEAN region, it could boost momentum.
From a strategical viewpoint, the commercial presence of the EU would also counterbalance the influence and dominance of China and the United States.
I hope that in the vote tomorrow my colleagues will support an agreement with Singapore, which I hope we could sign in the near future.
I know the Commission has some reservations on this.
However, it has already signed an extensive political agreement with the ASEAN region.
Therefore I am convinced that in the near future there will be a mutual understanding between at least the ITRE Committee, the Commission and hopefully Parliament in its vote tomorrow.
. (FR) Mr President, this own-initiative report by Mrs Mann on regional free trade areas addresses two central aspects of the Union's trade policy.
The first is the issue of trade policy being used as a strategic tool within external relations, particularly where development policy is concerned.
The second concerns the relationship between the multilateral approach and the bilateral approach.
Before addressing these specific points, I should like to thank Mrs Mann for her excellent report and for the spirit of cooperation in which she has worked, which has made it possible for us to exchange ideas and information over a considerable period of time now, something which I believe has enabled us both, Parliament and the Commission, to move forward in our thinking.
As Mrs Mann has just said, our approach continues to be based on the Amsterdam Conclusions of June 1997.
The Union's trade policy works on two complementary levels: the multilateral level first, that of the World Trade Organisation, and the bilateral level next, which is now increasingly regional.
These two levels are justified, firstly by the fact that unilateralism is not an option for the European Union, and this is something that we have known for a long time.
Secondly, since our priority is multilateralism, regionalism - or our bilateral agreements - complement this multilateral choice, the second level being as it were subordinate to the first.
Seen in this light, regionalism is not a kind of ersatz multilateralism, but complements a fundamental choice, which is that of the World Trade Organisation.
We actually believe that the globalised markets need common rules and global institutions to regulate them.
The Union's faith in the multilateral approach, which it had ten years ago, is even stronger today.
We want to manage globalisation; we want to reduce the destabilising effect of a number of factors.
That is why an approach based on a multilateral trading system is our priority, as moreover is reflected by the agenda that was adopted in Doha.
On this basis, I think that there is a very broad consensus between the position expressed by Mrs Mann and that of the Commission.
For the time being then it is the multilateral approach that is our number one priority, and that is why we have postponed any decision to launch new negotiations on free trade areas until the round that we began in Doha is completed.
In addition to this time constraint, we think that any new initiative in this field should be duly justified and meet a number of conditions.
Firstly, it must be compatible with the WTO, and Mrs Mann reminded us of the rules in this respect.
Secondly, a bilateral agreement should provide added value compared with the WTO, and when I say that I am thinking of the value of the WTO at the end of the Doha round.
Thirdly, and finally, a new initiative should not distract us from our multilateral priority.
Does this mean that we are neglecting free trade areas?
No.
The Union has been a major user of these regional negotiations.
Moreover, we are working very actively on a number of them, with Mercosur and with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and we recently concluded agreements with Chile and Egypt, amongst others.
These agreements, both the ones that we have concluded most recently and those that we are in the process of negotiating, have some characteristics that are rather new compared with the traditional concept of a free trade area.
We have as it were moved on a generation.
Moves to liberalise trade in goods and services now increasingly go hand in hand with the adoption of new bilateral rules that go beyond multilateral rules.
A second characteristic of this new generation of agreements is that the Union is increasingly seeking to develop region-to-region relations.
Examples are Mercosur and the Gulf Cooperation Council, but also the Andean Community, Central America and South-East Asia - I will come back to this in a moment - or even the regional negotiations that will shortly be getting underway in Africa.
We actually think today that it is this regional approach, bringing together several of our partners, that may bring greater economic benefits, since as it were the regional integration of our partners increases the market potential and makes the regulatory work more cost-effective.
This is what Mrs Mann a moment ago called deep integration and it is initiatives of this kind that we are in the process of launching, including with South-East Asia in the form of the very recent cross-regional EU-ASEAN initiative launched just over a month ago in Laos, in Luang Prabang.
Our intention is to start an action programme focusing on the main regulatory priorities of the two sides.
This is also the approach that we have adopted in our relations with Canada and it underpins our work with the Andean Community and Latin America.
To summarise the Commission's position on this point, I will say that the fact that President Prodi has not launched any new initiatives for free trade areas is not a sign of passivity but a deliberate choice.
This is clearly explained by the priority that we have accorded to Doha, but also by our conviction that free trade areas in the traditional sense of the word are not really the right instrument for opening up trade in the twenty-first century and that we now need to modify this format.
This, by the way, is also what guides us in our relations with developing countries, something to which Mrs Mann devotes considerable space in her report.
We think, like her, that although there are advantages to opening up trade, these advantages only become a reality if several conditions are met.
Firstly, market access is necessary for developing countries, but it is clearly not enough on its own to bring direct benefits in terms of growth and employment.
A decisive ingredient needs to be added, which is aid to strengthen trade capacities.
That is what we are providing at multilateral level.
We are also providing it in the preparations for the negotiation of regional economic partnership agreements with our ACP partners.
Are we entirely in agreement then?
Not quite.
And since we do need to identify a few areas where we differ, I have looked very hard and will mention two before concluding.
The first concerns the idea mentioned by Mrs Mann of opening negotiations with Singapore with a view to creating a free trade area.
We are not convinced at this stage that such an initiative would indeed boost momentum in the region.
For the reasons that I have just given, Mrs Mann, our preference is therefore still for a joint approach with the ASEAN countries.
We are also hesitant about the idea that you put forward in your report that the Union should undertake to fill the gap in the budgets of developing countries caused by the reduction in customs duties.
For the time being there is no proof of customs duties being lost, especially if the volume of trade were to increase as we hope it will, both in a South-South direction and in a North-South one.
We are not ruling out this idea, but in the light of the data that is currently available it does seem premature.
These are the two minor reservations that I should like to voice on behalf of the Commission.
Nevertheless, it is clear that our reaction to your report is dominated to a very large extent by areas where our views converge.
I would add that it is a great advantage for the Commission to have its strategy and positions supported by the European Parliament in international negotiations.
For all of these reasons, I see this report as confirming the high quality of our working relations and would like to thank Mrs Mann once again for her excellent report.
Mr President, first of all I would also like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her report.
We are all aware of the fact that trade relations are a factor in economic growth, but it is equally true that not all countries have been able to integrate into the world trade system and take advantage of the opportunities it offers to improve their development, which has increased inequality between rich and poor countries.
There is therefore a clear need to manage globalisation by means of multilateral standards drawn up from a policy perspective in order to make trade relations at world level a beneficial force for all, which contributes to the objective of eradicating poverty and achieving fair, sustainable development.
It is therefore important for the European Union to define a trade strategy that places the specific needs of less developed countries at the heart of trade negotiations, in order to make possible the gradual incorporation of these countries into the multilateral trade system.
In fact, the right of access - including non-reciprocal access - of poorer countries to the markets of developed countries is vastly insufficient for guaranteeing genuine development of trade flow if - as you yourself pointed out, Commissioner - we do not simultaneously strengthen their capacity for industrial and agricultural development, respect for the rules in force in the importing countries and familiarity with trade circuits, as well as their administrative capacities and their financial institutions.
For precisely this reason, the Committee on Development and Cooperation fully supports the incorporation of the development aspect into the Doha agenda and welcomes the impetus provided to this end by the European Union, and specifically yourself, Commissioner Lamy, in order to promote this development aspect.
At the same time, however, it considers that it is vital to ensure coherence between multilateralism and regionalism, between the rules established by the World Trade Organisation on the liberalisation of regional trade and the development of areas of free trade, including the proliferation of agreements between countries and regions with very different levels of development, because it believes that only this way, with this coherence, will we be able to make trade relations a genuine factor in development for all peoples and finally eradicate poverty.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the firm support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for Mrs Mann's report on regional free trade areas and trade strategy in the European Union.
Let me add a few observations. By means of this report, we are setting out the principles by which we trade and cooperate commercially with the world's regions.
Of course, it also gives direction and a specific character to the many possibilities open to us there, which we also have at regional level.
Our group works on the fundamental assumption that we are thereby able to build up free and fair global trade, and that those countries that have not so far had sufficient opportunity to engage in trade, have the chance, through the establishment of their own free trade areas, to share in this development.
I see this - not only in view of what Commissioner Lamy said - as an important guide to the timeframe within which, in the aftermath of Doha, a renaissance of regional trade agreements around the world may perhaps come about.
I get the impression the cooperation with certain countries - such as Singapore - can also be the key to regional free trade agreements with regions that are themselves not yet in a position, or not sufficiently advanced, to take partnership further.
That is why we should be using the idea of cooperation with Singapore as the prelude to greater cooperation with ASEAN.
The specific characteristics of the region present us with a broad spectrum of diverse possibilities, which must of course remain subject to the World Trade Organisation.
The development of, for example, the West African market also requires, not only that we open our own market, but that West Africa should be put in a position to do better business with Central Africa and Southern Africa, as Mrs Mann pointed out in her report on South-South trade.
Mr President, the own-initiative report by our fellow Member Mrs Mann makes a particularly interesting contribution to the fascinating debate on the relationship between regionalism and multilateralism.
I am very much in favour of the multilateral approach, but I also remain convinced that regionalism and multilateralism can strengthen and supplement each other in many respects.
I agree with the rapporteur when she says that the European Union must also continue to support and promote regional cooperation and integration in the future, therefore.
In addition, the idea of using the establishment of free trade areas as instruments of development seems to me to be a very interesting train of thought, provided that they form part of a general package of reform measures.
I should like to point out, however, that, for the benefit of the developing countries, we have to beware of ending up in an inextricable tangle of regional and multilateral initiatives.
In my view, today the multilateral approach still deserves to take priority over regional initiatives.
In other words, the top priority of the European Union must at this moment be the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda.
The discussion on regionalism and multilateralism, as important as it is, must be postponed until then.
In any case, Mrs Mann's report constitutes an interesting contribution to this, and for this I thank her.
Mr President, the motion for a resolution that is proposed to us in Mrs Mann's report includes, in paragraph 21, a call for European trade policy to be brought fully within the Community system as such, with exclusive competence for the Community, majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament.
We cannot go along with this Community fundamentalism, which is based on the idea that only supranational mechanisms are appropriate for this policy, so as to foster greater openness at global level and to sideline the nation states.
But opening up world markets, as useful as it may be, is not everything.
We also have to recognise that the Member States have societal models and fundamental interests to protect.
We therefore need to leave them the means to do so and strike a fair balance between European policy and national interests, between supervision by the European Parliament and supervision by the national parliaments.
In our opinion, Mrs Mann's report does not strike this balance.
In particular, there is a need to recognise that taking decisions by a qualified majority in the Council may not always have the desired effect.
Let us take a topical example: the Convention on the Future of Europe is reflecting on the possibility of making our entire trade policy subject to the majority rule, thus doing away with the derogations recognised by the Treaty of Nice for certain essential services, in particular cultural services, that this Treaty states continue to require unanimity.
The French Government has protested and requested that unanimity be maintained because it provides greater protection.
We approve.
But as an aside, why accept this here and not elsewhere?
At the same time, an association of large, mainly American, companies, the International Communications Round Table, is obligingly writing to the Convention and to the Commission to sing the praises of the majority rule.
This illustrates the fact that in practice this rule would make it possible to ignore opposition from individual nations in specific areas and thus bring down our defences.
That is why we are asking the Convention to look at the bigger picture and to take a more balanced view.
First, we need to increase the involvement of national parliaments.
Secondly, the majority procedure should only be used for adopting safeguard measures.
On the contrary, whenever it is a question of reducing our protection, decisions should be taken by unanimity so as not to damage anyone's interests.
. (FR) Mr President, I had not intended to respond as, until Mr Berthu's speech, all of the speakers had essentially confirmed our deep-seated agreement on the principles.
I should just like to say a few words in reply to Mr Berthu on the subject of whether trade policy should be decided by unanimity or a qualified majority.
Today, Mr Berthu - and this will probably be increasingly true in the future - we live in a world of elephants and in this world power struggles, particularly over trade matters, are largely determined by the weight of the participants.
If the Union wishes to bring its full weight to bear then unanimity is not the way to do so.
Experience has shown this.
The situation is very simple: in this field either we want to carry weight in the world in which we live and will continue to live, and in that case in a Europe of 25 we need qualified majority voting, or we do not want to - and I certainly understand that this might well be Mr Berthu's point of view; it would not surprise me in the least - in which case we should indeed maintain unanimity.
The idea that unanimity is the best guarantee of sovereignty is something that Mr Berthu has just reiterated.
I am not surprised by this and I wanted to draw your attention to it.
It is true today where cultural matters are concerned, as it is in other areas.
Mr President, just a few words to say to Mr Lamy that I am not a self-appointed advocate of unanimity in all cases.
I did say that majority voting could be useful when safeguard measures were being taken, because in such cases all of the countries have to show solidarity.
But when it is a question of reducing our protection, unanimity is, I believe, useful, because it is not right that a majority should be able to impose measures that damage the interests of a minority of Member States.
This is a fascinating debate.
I wish we had more time, but unfortunately we do not.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0192/2003) by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the implementation of macro-financial assistance to third countries.
Mr President, the nature and purpose of the instrument which is macro-financial assistance to third countries, are positive and useful.
In respect of the policy impacts, it is worth noting that macro-financial assistance from the European Community contributes to economic reforms and structural changes in recipient countries.
An instrument as worthwhile as this deserves a solid legal basis, therefore.
It does not currently have one, however.
The current legal arrangement concerning the design, preparation conditions, implementation of decisions, monitoring, transparency and accountability of Community macro-financial assistance is inefficient and ineffective, as the procedure at Council level is very lengthy.
The current arrangement is also ineffective in that disbursement of funds may take up to two years.
Finally, a solid legal basis is lacking owing to the insistence of the Council on using Article 308.
Which legal basis constitutes the required solid legal basis?
Article 181a would be the most logical option: economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries.
Here we have a difference of opinion with the Council, which does not like to see macro-financial assistance coming under 181a.
In any case, the Treaty of Nice will be replaced in due course by a new Treaty, which is currently being discussed in the Convention.
Up to now, the development of Community macro-financial assistance has resembled budgetary support rather than balance of payments assistance, in terms of the modalities of preparation, implementation of decisions, monitoring of assistance, and accountability.
Macro-financial assistance as granted by the European institutions under the terms of the Constitutional Treaty would fall under the provisions of Article 28 on economic, financial and technical cooperation measures intended to confront economic, financial or social crises.
In addition, Community macro-financial assistance should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
It is necessary, therefore, that the European Parliament have codecision powers.
Draft Article 28 provides for codecision within a normal legislative procedure, and so I do not have any further comments to make on this.
This opinion on the legal basis is widely held in the European Parliament.
I hope that the Council and the Commission share this opinion, and therefore provide this good instrument with the corresponding legal basis.
We can then reach common agreement, as institutions, on transparency, effective criteria and the implementation of these criteria.
Secondly, it is important to recognise that a solution must be found to the current ad hoc arrangement for the period until the Member States ratify the new Constitutional Treaty.
That is why the European Parliament considers it very important that the Commission submit a legislative proposal concerning the transitional period up to the ratification of the new Treaty.
This would have to have a dual legal basis and would have to meet two criteria:
a) macro-financial assistance is to be considered as assistance to third countries confronted by a crisis originating in economic, financial or social situations;
b) decision-making procedure based on codecision.
The proposal will of course contain criteria for determining whether a country is eligible for aid.
The Council's conclusions of 8 October 2002 on macro-financial assistance, the so-called Genval criteria, are useful and proper.
They can serve as criteria in the forthcoming legal instrument if a number of modifications are observed; including the 'exceptional character' criterion, with regard to which the discontinuity clause should be retained.
The 'complementarity' criterion invites three comments.
The first is that an independent quantitative assessment should be undertaken by the Commission.
Next, there should be careful coordination with other Community instruments as part of a political dialogue with the recipient country.
Thirdly, macro-financial assistance shall be supplementary to the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions.
This does not, of course, preclude the EU holding its own view.
The 'conditionality' criterion is concerned with the interdependence of the recipient country's economy with that of the EU.
In addition, measurable macro-economic criteria and reforms in the recipient country are crucial.
An indication that the European Parliament is serious about improving the instrument is the fact that Parliament will consider deferring approval of budgetary appropriations concerned with macro-financial assistance until a proper legislative proposal is submitted.
We all hope, of course, that it does not come to the European Parliament withholding its aid to this instrument.
By way of conclusion, I should like to thank my fellow Members, in particular, for their constructive cooperation.
I should like the Council and the Commissioner to indicate whether we can agree on the above-mentioned approach.
Mr President, the own-initiative report that Mr Belder has just presented is both exhaustive and forward-looking.
It will certainly give the Commission food for thought where macro-financial assistance to third countries is concerned.
We share the view that Mr Belder has just expressed that we are currently suffering from a genuine lack of flexibility and from the fact that all aspects of the decision-making process in the field of macro-financial assistance to third countries are extremely cumbersome.
He is right to stress that these cumbersome procedures and this lack of flexibility are due to there being no specific legal base or framework regulation setting out the criteria and conditions for granting macro-financial assistance to third countries and that this gap forces us to have recourse to Article 308 of the Treaty on a case-by-case basis.
Clearly this is a serious disadvantage, even if in practice the instrument itself has proved - once the decisions have been taken - to be an effective tool for supporting adjustment and reform in those countries that have benefited from this macro-financial assistance: this is confirmed by the recent Court of Auditors report on macro-financial assistance.
On several occasions we have explored the possibility of putting in place a framework regulation, as the report suggests, which would define the conditions for granting macro-financial assistance and as it were put this instrument on the same footing as other instruments for providing financial assistance to third countries.
Unfortunately, so far these attempts have failed because for this type of assistance - no doubt because it also implies having recourse to borrowing and lending - the vast majority of Member States wish to retain a decision-making process that requires unanimity on a case-by-case basis, which all sounds very familiar.
The Commission therefore shares Mr Belder's view on this issue of the legal base.
Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the Council of Ministers, which, in this case, has the last word.
That explains the current situation.
We do not think, to be perfectly frank, that it will be possible to bring about any change in the situation before the conclusion of the Convention's work and the next intergovernmental conference.
As far as voting by unanimity or by a qualified majority are concerned, our hopes are therefore in the hands of the Members of the Convention, once again.
In the meantime, we will have to continue to manage this instrument, taking into account its inherent constraints, in as flexible a way as possible.
To do so we will need Parliament's cooperation: sometimes we feel a little tempted to insist on this absolutely correct legal view and we do not wish this to be to the detriment of this instrument or to complicate it further when we have already said that it is too cumbersome.
A difference of opinion over how this macro-financial assistance is decided on - which is certainly justified - should be no reason for us to deprive the partner countries of the benefit of this tool when they need our assistance and are striving to create stability and implement reforms.
Its legal base is no good; it is too cumbersome and too complicated, but the aid reaches those for whom it is intended and we would not want these countries, bearing in mind the hopes that they put in the Union's ability to offer them this assistance, to be disappointed by these quarrels, which are admittedly justified, but which are so petty compared with their own hopes.
We are therefore counting on Parliament, in its wisdom, to share this difficulty that we both have to live with, of an instrument that can only evolve if majority voting replaces unanimity in the decision-making process.
Mr President, we on the Committee on Budgets have been drawing people's attention to how the use of the Guarantee Fund mechanism is a very cheap way for the EU to provide external financial assistance.
The guarantees allow countries in difficulties to acquire credit on the international markets more cheaply than they would at normal market rates.
As the guarantee has meant that the EU has not suffered any losses owing to defaults in recent years, it shows the criteria for assistance have been working.
The forms of financial assistance provided under the Guarantee Fund have in recent years been macro-financial assistance and blanket loan guarantees given to the European Investment Bank.
A ceiling is set for their use, the Guarantee Fund ceiling, which is provided for in the financial perspective.
The Committee on Budgets has been surprised to note that the Commission and the EIB did not take full advantage of the potential of the Guarantee Fund last year.
The resources used were wasted and poor countries were not helped.
The use of this aid instrument could be added to the guarantee clauses with small technical amendments that will not in practice cause any problems for the Union's budget.
All the institutions are prepared to reduce the provisioning rate of credit from the present level of 9% to 8%.
That way we could lower the amount that has to be covered by a corresponding Guarantee Fund transfer for each credit transaction.
We could likewise reduce the blanket guarantee given for EIB loans from 65% to 50% of the amount of the loan.
This measure would have the same impact on the use of the Guarantee Fund as reducing the provisioning rate.
These changes would mean there would be more to distribute out of the same allocation of funds defined in terms of its ceiling.
The Commission should promptly propose such measures.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Belder, and indeed the European Commission, for producing the interesting 2001 report.
Mr Belder has adopted a commendable analytical approach and is looking ahead, taking advantage of this particular moment in time when change looks more possible that it has hitherto.
The macro-financial assistance instrument - one of several - brings about reform efforts.
It is associated with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank programmes.
It is for exceptional crisis situations.
The EU is not an international financial institution but at crisis times our foreign policy objectives can be linked with what we do with macro-financial assistance.
It is conditional on the actions of the beneficiary countries.
The 2001 report is an interesting one.
It looks at countries, mainly in the Balkans, but also Tajikstan, Georgia and Armenia.
It looks in detail at why they have problems, what efforts are being made to solve them and where the problems are.
In each country there are balance of payments difficulties, but quite encouraging growth figures in all three.
I am pleased to see that analysis has taken place.
I hope that the relevant parliamentary delegations will look at the analysis.
Mr Belder is absolutely right, however, to say that the programme is currently inefficient, ineffective and certainly lacks a solid legal base.
We have heard from Commissioner Lamy that the moment is not quite right, given the attitude of the Council of Ministers, for changing the legal base, but I sense some optimism that post-Convention, in the next IGC, it may well be possible to move to a much more appropriate legal base with QMV and codecision by Parliament.
In the meantime we hope that the Commission will bring about an in-depth evaluation of the criteria that it uses for the macro-financial assistance and we must do our part.
This Parliament does not take seriously enough its monitoring duty.
This is an area in which it is essential that we do so.
In due course I look forward to legislative proposals from the Commission.
Once again I thank the rapporteur.
Mr President, it is mainly in the detail that madness - political madness in particular - becomes apparent.
Today sees the start of the Public Prosecutor's investigations.
Five years in jail is the threatened penalty, and the scrutiny is rigorous, for the case has a basis in law.
I am talking about Mannheim and the arena for World Cup football that is being built there.
It appears that, two years ago, work was started on it illicitly, thus - or so those who have brought the case are arguing - putting field hamsters at risk.
Although there is no evidence of any single field hamster having died, the machinery of a functioning state under the rule of law is in motion, in a way that you might describe as over the top.
The Lord Mayor, against whom the case has been brought, fears for his political future.
Taking up Mr Belder's interesting report, I do not have to quote all the things he lists in it.
It mentions money, although none gets spent, and we can quite soberly describe this as inefficient, ineffective, and devoid of any solid legal basis.
What is going on?
This is a blatantly typical example of how this Europe of ours does not yet fit together.
Reforms are urgently needed, or else how many more dentists, how many more Eurostats, are there going to be for the Commission to stumble over?
Mr President, I should just like to say a few quick words.
I should like to express my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for his constructive attitude.
I have another quick question: can I infer from your reasoning that you will then be presenting a legislative proposal in the foreseeable future?
Possibly!
I apologise, but I answered for him because we are short of time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0114/2003) by Yves PiÃ©trasanta, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the annual report on the MEDA 2000 programme (COM(2001) 806 - C5-0524/2002 - 2002/2235(INI)).
.
(FR) Mr President, I should first like to thank my colleagues who have worked so hard on this report, in particular Mrs De Keyser for her work on behalf of the AFET Committee and also Mrs Zrihen.
I should also like to thank the European Commission and Mrs Gonzalo, who gave us all of the information that we needed.
I would remind you that the MEDA programme is the tool through which our Mediterranean policy, as formulated in the Barcelona process in 1995, is implemented.
The first phase was carried out by the MEDA I programme (1995-1999) and the second by the current MEDA II programme, which was shaped by my and Mr Valdivielso's reports in the year 2000.
This new regulation entered into force on 15 December 2000 and we have been able to analyse how it has worked up to the end of 2002.
The conclusions on MEDA I had given rise to numerous concerns, the overall payment-to-commitment ratio between 1995 and 1999 being only 26%.
The main causes of this relative failure were identified as the length of the negotiations, the complexity of the programme's procedures, the multi-annual nature of some projects and the limited administrative capacity of the MEDA countries, together - it has to be said - with a lack of administrative resources in the committee in charge of managing this programme, obliging it to delegate work to Technical Assistance Offices, whose involvement proved to be ineffective.
MEDA II is not restricted to fostering the creation of a free trade area in the Mediterranean by 2010, but enhances the previous economic cooperation in the Mediterranean with a social, cultural and environmental strand.
For the period from 2000 to 2006 this programme has an overall budget of EUR 12.75 billion, made up of European Union funds and loans from the European Investment Bank.
In summary, having analysed the situation in the documents that we have tabled, we would draw the following conclusions.
Firstly, we note that MEDA II represents a marked improvement on MEDA I, thanks to the creation of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office in the External Relations DG.
Thus, we have moved from an overall payment-to-commitment ratio of 26% in MEDA I to 37.4% in 2000, 53% in 2001 and 92.9% in 2002, an overall ratio for MEDA II of 59%.
To achieve this, the Technical Assistance Offices have been dismantled and eight delegations have been set up (in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the West Bank), with a representation only in Gaza.
These delegations can take action more readily, as they have Commission representatives and clearly identified resource centres in each country.
Secondly, the comitology has been simplified.
A methodological guide was published in March 2002.
Thirdly, as we have recommended several times, Parliament is very mindful of the links that need to be established between the granting of aid and the respect of human rights by the various countries, and we ask for an annual report on this.
Fourthly, we want there to be regular monitoring of the observance of democratic principles when projects are chosen, not just through the bilateral negotiations between the Union and the countries concerned, but also involving civil society and NGOs in this process and ensuring that the gender criteria, in particular regarding the participation of women, are respected.
Fifthly, we stress the need to further develop South-South relations and not just bilateral relations, which even today absorb more than 85% of funds.
Sixthly, we take into account the work underway in the European Convention seeking to meet the five challenges for the MEDA countries: demography, employment and migration, globalisation, diminishing natural resources and the environment and human rights.
Seventhly, we suggest that the sixth framework programme of research should be used for carrying out research in the fields of the environment, agriculture - with the aim of ensuring food sovereignty - and in particular water management, and suggest that more emphasis be put on renewable energies.
We recall that the Mediterranean Basin has the greatest variety of agricultural specimens and seeds of all temperate areas: these must be preserved.
We want more attention to be paid to agrodiversity and to implementing projects involving farmers, tradesmen, consumers and SMEs.
Finally, we want all of the opportunities afforded by the information and communication society to be developed, in particular electronic communication.
Finally, let us note that all of this work under MEDA is currently being done against the difficult background of the post-war situation in Iraq, the resolution of difficult problems in the Middle East, the peace process, in particular between Israel and Palestine, and the new balance established by the Treaty of Nice with enlargement to 25, and here we need to continue our efforts to ensure that this is not a pretext for sidelining Mediterranean cooperation.
That is why we support the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilisations, as well as a monitoring centre for migratory flows, a Euro-Mediterranean investment bank and a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly, which would play a decisive role in formulating a properly implemented and well-integrated Euro-Mediterranean cooperation policy.
. (FR) Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr PiÃ©trasanta for the important work he has done in drafting this report, which mainly concerns the year 2000, a year of transition for the MEDA programme, as he has just pointed out himself.
Generally speaking, we agree with the remarks that he has just made on the substance of the report.
I will first make two comments on the political issues he has just mentioned before moving on to more operational considerations.
On the political points, and in particular the link between this type of programme and improving the situation in terms of political reform, we agree that we need to continue our efforts along the lines that he has just indicated, and that is why the Commission has just adopted a communication that seeks to give fresh impetus to the work being done in the field of human rights and democratisation in cooperation with our Mediterranean partners.
Moreover, this communication also constitutes a partial response to the comments made in the Arab Human Development Report - a document that UNDP was brave enough to table last year - and proposes strengthening the political dialogue on this subject and drafting action plans on human rights and democratisation with our Mediterranean partners, the initiative as a whole being supported by the MEDA programme.
We also agree with a second political point that was mentioned by Mr PiÃ©trasanta: the objective of greater participation by civil society in MEDA.
We have, for instance, extended the Tempus programme to our Mediterranean partners, encouraging exchanges in the field of higher education, and we wish to support the efforts being made by non-governmental organisations to formalise the contribution of what we call civil forums to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as a whole.
So much for the political issues.
As far as implementation is concerned, the Commission is pleased with the progress that Mr PiÃ©trasanta has just emphasised.
The MEDA programme at issue, MEDA II, has indeed greatly benefited from the reform begun by the Commission in 2000 in the external aid sector with the aim of improving the quality of our projects, their financing and the speed with which they are implemented.
Testimony to this - as Mr PiÃ©trasanta has just said - are the efforts that have been made to devolve power and dismantle the Technical Assistance Offices, in which we are aware that this Parliament has for many years taken a keen interest.
In fact the devolution process in the Mediterranean area is now almost complete, with the exception of the West Bank and Gaza, for reasons which are, alas, obvious.
In any case, in Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, work to devolve power will be complete at the end of this year.
Another notable effect is the progress that has been made on implementing the budget, be it the utilisation rate for commitment and payment appropriations - in 2002, 100% of the available funds were used - or the payment-to-commitment ratio, which increased to 75% in 2002 compared with 25% over the period from 1995 to 1999.
Finally, concerning past commitments and amounts still to be paid, they had been reduced to EUR 200 million by the end of 2001.
At the end of 2002, the amount still to be paid had been reduced by a further 50%.
Clearly then the efforts that have been made have paid off and Parliament's support, which contributed to the Commission gaining increased administrative and human resources in this sector, has not been in vain.
You have been able to see, and Mr PiÃ©trasanta quoted similar figures to mine, that the investment you have made, that the Community taxpayer has made through you, has paid off.
That is a good thing.
It is a great encouragement to the Commission to continue to pursue this policy, as it is to the departments that have worked to implement it, and we do not doubt that the European Parliament will be able to see further progress when it scrutinises the results for 2001 and 2002.
.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr PiÃ©trasanta and I worked together in perfect cooperation: you will not therefore be surprised to hear the same points stressed again in the few comments that I would like to make.
Of the various points made by the AFET Committee in its opinion, two seemed to us to be particularly important.
The first - and you have reassured us, Commissioner - was the need to ensure that the democracy clause in the association agreements is respected and the need to carry out regular and transparent checks on the impact of the MEDA programme on human rights, and this on the basis of an annual report provided by the Commission in accordance with clear criteria, a precise agenda and training in this field for European officials.
The second point was the importance of establishing an open and tolerant civil society in these Mediterranean countries, in particular by supporting the independence of small NGOs, and in this respect the AFET Committee regrets the fact that so few Mediterranean countries have been selected in the horizontal democracy programmes under the EIDHR and that, for example, neither Morocco nor Egypt, where civil society is active yet still fragile, will benefit.
This was and still is Europe's vision of a transition towards more democracy in the countries of the Mediterranean, a transition supported by MEDA funding, by various different instruments, but also by a dialogue, in the form of a forum today and perhaps a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly tomorrow.
The report was presented in March 2003.
A few days later war broke out in Iraq: it represented another vision of the democratic transition, a brutal and tragic vision that many people do not share.
The Euromed dialogue is struggling to recover from this war.
It will take more than a MEDA programme to get it back on track.
Let us hope that the adoption of the Middle East roadmap by the Quartet will be the first step towards doing so and a genuine sign of hope.
Commissioner, we would like to thank you for drawing attention to two political points.
Mr PiÃ©trasanta's report on the MEDA programme is widely supported and a joint effort: we really do have the same aims.
The two political points on which you based your speech are, firstly, the importance of the role of the Mediterranean as a European border and also as an area which is the focus of a substantial chunk of our Union's foreign policy, and, secondly, the fact that the Commission certainly made its measures very tangible and more timely in the transition from MEDA I to MEDA II.
Indeed, in our meetings with the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, we have been constantly reminded of the need for different administration timetables.
In this connection, we note that the Commission is making a considerable effort.
I will not, of course, list the points already mentioned by the rapporteur.
I would like to focus on a number of political requirements which go hand in hand with the action programme.
We certainly need to identify new social action programmes and, above all, we need to concentrate on protecting people with disabilities as well as new forms of cooperation concerning the protection of children.
In the context of the situations on which you, Commissioner, are focusing, we would point out the need, with a view precisely to foreign policy and the role of the European Union, to insist on the conclusion of the Syria/EU negotiations in order to complete the network of Euro-Mediterranean association agreements, just as we must proceed as soon as possible with the selection of the funding programme planning projects which is at present suspended in Israel and Palestine, for they could play a very important role in this part of the Mediterranean region.
I will end by stressing the need for a parliamentary assembly, for that is the political forum in which a solution could well be found to many of the processes currently in progress.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, seven years after the Barcelona Conference that launched the Euromed partnership, the European Parliament has an opportunity, through Mr PiÃ©trasanta's report, to take stock of MEDA, this policy's financing instrument.
I would like to take the opportunity to underline the excellent cooperation that we have enjoyed in the drafting of this report.
The tense international situation provides further evidence every day that the economies and societies in the Mediterranean Basin need to evolve to become more prosperous, more socially cohesive and more democratic.
This is in fact the only way, we are convinced, that we can work effectively to increase the stability of these regions and combat terrorism in the long term.
The twofold reform that has taken place, that of MEDA - now MEDA II - and the structural reform of external aid management, has been the source of many new and very promising initiatives, including the creation of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office.
Similarly, we have high expectations of the various strategic documents, multi-annual programming exercises and new shortened and simplified procedures.
Nevertheless, we would stress the importance of assessing how the resources allocated to the programmes are managed, something which should be guided by a principle that is simple and yet, it would seem, so difficult: the amounts budgeted should actually be spent and spent well.
The Barcelona process is also a project to create a vast free trade area.
The new situation gives rise to new questions.
Will the momentum behind the European Union's Mediterranean policy survive enlargement?
What is happening about South-South cooperation or interregional cooperation?
Finally, we should not forget that it is in our interests for the funds to be distributed in such a way that they target in particular priority areas, such as social cohesion, the development of democracy, human rights, support for civil society, the specific situation of women, culture, youth and sustainable development.
Over the next few years we will therefore continue to assess progress along these lines under the Commission's attentive gaze.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr PiÃ©trasanta, and the Commission itself, because of all the MEDA programmes that have been presented on this subject, of all the proposals, this is perhaps the most realistic and practical and, to a large extent, the one which demonstrates that it is dealing with reality.
In this regard, for example, I believe that for the first time we have distinguished terrorism as such, as an act that is distinct from government responses - which should also be condemned.
Terrorism has been identified as a phenomenon that should be condemned in its own right and eradicated.
It is very interesting that the road map and other measures to support Iraqi integrity have been raised.
However, I would like to say, and in this I agree with Mr PiÃ©trasanta, that our Mediterranean policy has a number of black holes or black spots and is essentially unbalanced.
I feel we need to make an effort to render it more coherent.
For example, like Mr PiÃ©trasanta, I feel there has been very little investment in capacity building and the structure of certain administrative bodies that could achieve democracy.
Given the structure of the countries, and of many of their economic administration services, amongst others, it is very difficult, because democracy does not consist of holding elections, but of building an entire system, which needs to be far more visible and systematic.
Furthermore, we need to help the Mediterranean countries with which we are going to cooperate, and which receive a great deal of aid, to understand that the aid must go hand in hand with a deep sense of responsibility, within game rules that do not allow maximum, but minimum tolerance.
I am referring, for example, to the administration of the funds received, just as other funds might often also be misused or used to finance oppression.
I believe we need to show that democracy means a consolidated, transparent State. Without this there can be no democracy, let us not delude ourselves.
I would say the same for the Assembly we are trying to create.
We must be demanding and set democratic conditions that must be fulfilled.
Otherwise we will only achieve unbalanced representation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 10.20 p.m.)
Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States
. Mr President, it is a pleasure to participate in this debate on behalf of the Commission and, above all, on behalf of Mrs Diamantopoulou, who regrets that she cannot be here today because she is attending a meeting of the Social Affairs Council in Luxembourg.
We have now reached the final stage in our joint effort to reform the European employment strategy.
All the institutions have worked together to reach a good compromise that is now fully in line with the European Council's conclusions, that takes on board most of the European Parliament's views and that is, whilst less ambitious, close to the Commission's initial proposal.
Our ambitions should reflect the scale of the challenges we face.
Firstly, full employment: to deliver full employment we need to create up to 22 million jobs if the Union of 25 Member States is to reach the 2010 Lisbon target.
As far as quality and productivity is concerned, this means ensuring not just more jobs but also better jobs.
We must take a positive approach to managing economic restructuring and we must reverse the slowdown in productivity growth.
As regards cohesion and inclusion, we must tackle increasing social inequalities and persistent regional disparities.
This, of course, will be an even more challenging ambition within an enlarged Union.
These challenges can only be met if we ensure that all relevant players are closely involved in the employment strategy and that they all work together.
What are the main elements of reform?
Firstly, stability.
Through this reform we have to respond to the short-term challenges of the slowdown in our economies, and face up to the longer-term challenges of reform.
A more stable set of guidelines covering the period up to 2010, with a mid-term review in 2006, should help us to respond to both short- and longer-term challenges.
In principle, these guidelines should remain unaltered for at least three years.
We have also been successful in presenting more focused, simpler and results-oriented guidelines that concentrate on a limited number of major priorities and set out clearly the results we are aiming for.
The focus on results rather than process means more emphasis on the use of targets and indicators to benchmark progress.
We have received considerable support from Parliament in this respect.
Whilst we could have gone further, I welcome the fact that a reasonable number of well-focused targets remain.
Emphasis on results also demands that more importance is placed on the recommendations to the Member States.
In streamlining the employment guidelines and the broad economic policy guidelines it is also important to recall the advantages of this new streamlining of the employment policy coordination and the broad economic policy guidelines.
We have to make sure that the simultaneous timetable for the two sets of guidelines fosters complementarity and creates a more coherent policy coordination at European level.
I now turn to the new priorities.
I am not going to refer to all the specific guidelines, but I would like to refer to the three main challenges they address.
Firstly, the adaptability of people and enterprises must be promoted.
Adaptability requires a good balance between flexibility and security in the labour market.
It also requires investment in entrepreneurship and in helping people and enterprises to cope better with the effects of economic restructuring.
Secondly, in order to achieve full employment, we must see how we can increase the labour supply further.
We must better exploit the potential of all groups of the population.
We must increase the participation of women and older workers on the labour market.
We must fully integrate immigrants into the labour market.
We must transform undeclared work into regular employment.
Parliament's support was extremely important in securing an agreement on this specific issue.
We now send out a clear signal that we want not just more employment but also better employment.
Thirdly, investment in human capital is increasingly at the heart of the issue of creating more and better jobs.
It is crucial for more employment, more productivity and also more inclusion.
This calls for redirecting resources in favour of investment in human capital.
Let me now address the views of this Parliament.
I regret the timetable difficulties which Parliament has had to face.
I understand your concerns and I know that both the Council and the Commission have done their utmost to take account of your views.
Despite those difficulties, the revised guidelines I am presenting today strongly reflect the views of Parliament.
Indeed, your views have provided significant added value in a number of notable areas.
First of all, a reference to reducing unemployment.
Parliament fought hard to include a reference on the need to reduce unemployment.
I agree that it is vital to illustrate to Europe's citizens that these reforms aim to tackle directly the areas of most concern to them.
I am happy to report that we now have such a reference in the opening paragraphs of the guidelines, even though Parliament's request went further in suggesting a new target relating to full employment.
The second area concerned is that of a fourth over-arching objective on equal opportunities.
As a result of Parliament's opinion we now have a stronger set of guidelines giving a higher profile to gender issues.
The revised text does not go as far as including a fourth over-arching objective, but in two important areas the guidelines have been strengthened: firstly, the introductory text makes it clear that equal opportunities and gender equality are vital for making progress towards all three objectives; secondly, we now have a more complete specific guideline addressing gender equality as such.
Concerning a higher profile for the entrepreneurship priority, the Commission very much welcomes Parliament's comments that the scope of the entrepreneurship guidelines should be widened to cover support for all SMEs, rather than just new start-ups.
This proposal has been taken on board.
As regards a more visible role for local and regional actors, the new proposals better reflect the importance of ensuring the close involvement of local and regional actors in the employment strategy.
In line with Parliament's request, we now have a specific guideline on regional disparities that recognises the crucial role played by local and regional actors in addressing those disparities.
The discussions on governance were rather difficult.
It is obvious that this is a very sensitive issue for Member States.
However, it is important to stress that the success of the new European employment strategy ultimately relies on improved delivery and better governance.
This is even more vital when we account for the needs of the new Member States, who have openly recognised the crucial importance of the issue.
This is yet another area in which we very much welcome the strong support of the Parliament.
The guidelines now clearly express the important contribution of parliamentary bodies for improving the governance of the employment strategy.
Despite the fact that this falls short of your proposal that national parliaments should adopt the national action plans, it does however reflect important progress in ensuring a better governance strategy.
I believe that in taking on board many of your expectations, these revisions now reflect the shared views of all parties.
The revised guidelines present concrete objectives, priorities and targets and strengthen the delivery and governance of the strategy as a whole.
As such, they are an excellent basis to support national employment and labour market policies for the years ahead.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
Mr President, it was gratifying to listen to Commissioner Vitorino.
Our work can have practical results, something which is needed.
We have economic stagnation and growing problems in the labour markets in the EU.
The resulting antagonisms concerning 'the right policy' are increasing, something we have noticed in this Parliament too.
It has been my great ambition throughout my work as rapporteur to try, despite the difficulties, to unite Parliament behind a common policy.
The basis for this policy was the Lisbon strategy, according to which economic and technological development should be combined with a concentration on work of good quality, cooperation between the parties, production and, especially, solidarity with weak groups.
We have therefore put forward a range of proposals.
I am able to summarise them very briefly now, because Commissioner Vitorino has already commented on some of them.
Firstly, we have proposed increased attention to unemployment.
That is important, for it is not enough just to increase levels of employment, as is done in periods of prosperity.
That is not the same as combating unemployment.
There can be access to the labour market at the same time as the long-term unemployed remain long-term unemployed.
There is therefore a need for attention to be paid to this area as an important measure of renewal.
Secondly, we have placed considerable emphasis on the fact that, in an economic situation like the present one, new jobs and new businesses are needed, something that certainly also requires political initiatives.
We are now presenting a programme for entrepreneurship and new jobs that is much more comprehensive than the one contained in the Commission's guidelines.
At the same time, we are maintaining and emphasising our demand for quality, sustainability and a perspective upon the future.
Thirdly, we focus much more intently upon the equality perspective than the Commission's proposal does.
Above all, we propose that equality be made into an overarching objective alongside the three objectives proposed by the Commission.
The Council is clearly not ready to adopt this as yet, but we should no doubt continue to exercise pressure.
It is not the last time we shall have that opportunity.
Fourthly, we have put forward clear demands for regional and local employment strategies.
I am pleased that there are clear responses to these demands, for it looked rather bad for a time when this feature had disappeared from what was the last guideline.
Now, it has been reintroduced, which is important, because there is a need to be able to mobilise people and businesses from below if we are to be able to create the 22 million jobs talked about by Mr Vitorino.
Finally, we have agreed to recommend that the Member States' parliaments adopt positions on the national action plans.
They can then be more firmly rooted and combined with national employment policies.
The problem has been that European employment policy has not been linked up with, or integrated into, the national policies.
There has therefore been a considerable lack of efficiency.
I appreciate that the Council is not ready for this, either.
Perhaps we ought to go via the Member States and ask certain Member States at some point to raise this issue in the Council.
They will then have Parliament's support.
We have also agreed about other issues, a fact I think we can be proud of.
We made no less than 16 compromises in the committee and reduced more than 160 amendments to a relatively manageable number.
I should naturally be disappointed if, after all these compromises, it emerged that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats were still not completely satisfied.
There therefore remains a certain lack of agreement, something upon which I wish to comment shortly.
Firstly, the PPE-DE Group wishes to strengthen the Commission's wording on immigration and immigrant labour and does not want this matter to be addressed in the guidelines.
Yes, this is a 'hot potato' in a number of Member States, but that cannot be helped.
Irrespective of whether they border upon the EU or are in a particularly exposed position, all European countries face a common global reality whereby we are seeing increased immigration across our borders, something we must deal with in a document on employment policy.
I am therefore opposed to Amendment No 62.
Another disagreement concerns tax policy.
There are quite a few amendments about this.
I think that tax systems are very national in character.
If we are to come up with views on this, we must express ourselves in very general terms.
It is impossible to produce practical proposals on tax policy for 25 countries.
I am therefore opposed to Amendment No 66 by the PPE-DE Group, which is very radical and demands a general reduction in tax for both individuals and businesses in all the Member States but says nothing about how the financial position is to be regarded.
In my own country, Sweden, reducing the tax burden is not at all the thing to do, but I appreciate that matters are different in Germany and other countries.
In conclusion, I just want briefly to say that the Liberals' amendments on tax issues are of a quite different character.
They are interesting, but very drastic.
It is a question of shifting the tax burden from personal taxation to environmental taxation and taxation of consumer goods.
That is something I consider to be worthwhile, but it is not something we can probably decide in this type of document.
In conclusion, I want to say that we have, in general, reached agreement.
It is very important for us to be able to agree upon a document so that we have an answer to give to the Council that is sitting and waiting and will listen to what we are to say today.
Mr President, there are too many states in the European Union in which the economy is stagnating, and many areas in which reforms have not been implemented.
The coming year's enlargement from fifteen to an expected twenty-five Member States presents us with an additional challenge.
The Lisbon strategy is an ambitious one, and its implementation must take account of these realities.
It follows that we need to set other priorities for the European employment policy guidelines.
As Commissioner Vitorino has already mentioned, this is about increasing the employment rate.
It is also about increasing the value of products and raising the level of productivity.
It is about reforms to the various systems of taxation and social security benefits - which, Mr Schmid, are in fact matters for the Member States - where a balance is to be maintained between flexibility and security.
It is about activating those who are willing to work and capable of work, and about better involvement of the local and regional stakeholders.
Finally, it is about mounting a more determined attack upon the black economy.
Mr Schmid was prepared to take on board many of my group's amendments.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I thank you for your good cooperation.
Our proposals are reflected in what are now sixteen workable compromises, including on the use of educational and training methods to create workplaces of high quality, on increasing the level of investment in enterprises, on strategies for lifelong learning in accordance with the requirements and abilities of those involved, on the abolition of subsidies to industries which have no viable future, and on job creation in regions with a high level of unemployment.
Despite this, a number of our core points are absent from the areas of the setting up of new enterprises, monetary policy and taxation.
Firstly, one of the essential aspects of the European Employment Strategy's approach is the practical support for the setting up of enterprises, which goes beyond simplified administrative procedures and involves the extension of information networks for those starting new businesses.
If these - and as a result, new jobs - are to be created, there needs to be easier access to credit on favourable terms, so we need more dependable equity capital finance - an area where the European Union differs to a marked degree from the United States.
If there is sufficient liquidity, then competitiveness is ensured.
Secondly, we cannot accept the renewed attempt at marginalising the Stability Pact, on which, in the eurozone, the confidence of economic decision-makers and consumers depends.
It cannot be put to one side, even if, in certain Member States, ministers make so bold as to negotiate exemptions for their portfolios.
The logical consequence of undermining the Stability Pact, which is so important, would be the loss of public confidence and the weakening of the euro, which is, thank God, a strong currency.
Thirdly, there must be incentives in law to make employment more attractive to workers and employers.
This should involve reducing the tax burden on work to such an extent that the creation of new jobs ends up being less costly, which will make it possible to combat more effectively the black economy, which is booming.
Overall, we should be working towards reducing the tax burdens in the Member States - for it is at that level that they are imposed - to such an extent that the public can again afford more and enterprises can at last get back to being more entrepreneurial.
I very much hope that these amendments from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which we again discussed last night, will be approved by the plenary at noon today.
Only then, Mr Schmid, will I be able to recommend to my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that they should endorse this report - only then!
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Herman Schmid for the unusually constructive cooperation that went into preparing this proposal, which I think is important.
Employment policy is important on the whole.
We now have a new framework to operate within, concerned with tighter coordination with the economic guidelines, more long-term thinking and more concentration upon the result of implementation in the Member States.
We fully agree with this strategy.
I wish to emphasise how important it is for the employment strategy to be put on the same footing as the economic guidelines so that they carry the same weight in this process.
Allow me to say something about the overarching objectives.
We have abandoned the pillar structure.
The fact that we now have full employment as an objective is particularly important.
It is also important, as Mr Herman Schmid says, to supplement the employment objective with an objective relating to unemployment.
Even if these are two aspects that run approximately in tandem, they do not do so one hundred per cent.
It may be the case that employment is increasing but that there still remains a high degree of unemployment.
Another objective is work of good quality.
In the future, Europe will not compete through cheap labour but through the quality of the products and services we are able to produce.
For this, we need a properly educated labour force. Educating the labour force to make Europe competitive is clearly linked to lifelong learning.
A third important issue is integration.
It is not only a question of integration between regions, leading to a high level of employment - or full employment - throughout Europe, but also of there at present being groups that are, to a large extent, outside the labour market, for example people with disabilities and people from other countries.
That is important.
The equality aspects have already been talked about, and it is important that we highlight them.
They had a pillar of their own in the previous strategy.
It is also important that the national parliaments be involved and that it be possible to supplement the overarching common objectives by national objectives.
Allow me briefly to say something about the disagreement.
We need to resolve this in the committee.
We have slightly different views of flexibility and security, but we shall succeed in agreeing on this point and saying that we need a balance.
When it comes to the tax issue, I do not share Mr Mann's view.
You only have to look around in the European Union. Some of those countries that have the lowest unemployment and the highest levels of people in work do in actual fact also have the heaviest tax burden.
This suggests to me that the tax issue is somewhat more complicated than appears from Mr Mann's amendment.
The level of employment is determined by a large number of factors.
It is an over-simplification to say that, generally speaking, a reduction in tax is also good for employment.
The fact is, it is not.
I wish, however, to say that I shall vote in such a way that we preserve unity in this House.
What would be worst of all is if we in Parliament were not to express our view, now that we have an opportunity to do so.
I shall be guided by that consideration in the vote.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Schmid for his hard work and for the way that he has succeeded in forging compromises across the political groups.
His report has our broad support.
That said, we have some concerns.
First, we feel that too much detail may have crept both into the main report and certain amendments before plenary.
Second, we wonder about some of the provisions on childcare and the reconciliation of work and family life.
Are they fully compatible with sound public finance?
In specifying the public sector, do they not ignore other means of delivering the same objectives as, for example, through the social partners?
On plenary amendments, we think that Amendment Nos 65 and 66 may send the wrong messages, respectively by implying a reduction in wages and by suggesting a one-size-fits-all approach.
We prefer our own Amendment No 58.
On the positive side, we applaud the references to people with disabilities and hope that a proposal for a horizontal directive will soon be forthcoming.
We endorse the objective of gender equality and recognise particularly the need for special support for women returning to work.
I add my own particular concern about the continuing gender pay gap and call for a concerted effort to close it.
Finally, we fully agree with the need for all stakeholders to be involved, including the parliaments within the Member States.
Some are, and we welcome the initiative of others, such as the European Committee of the Scottish Parliament, to become so.
But this should simply be the norm.
The drive for more and better jobs is something in which we should all be directly engaged.
Mr President, social and employment policies are affected by economic policies.
For this reason, a debate distanced from the economic guidelines is meaningless, as is unfortunately the case with the debate now taking place, despite all the rapporteur's efforts to the contrary.
The Commission's spring forecast predicts that GDP growth in 2003 will not rise above 1% in the Euro area. This will have negative effects on employment, which will fall by 0.1%, causing a rise in unemployment, which will reach an average of 8.8%.
This situation should alert us to the need to change the Community's monetarist policies, and in particular to review the Stability Pact, in order to give the highest priority to public investment and other means of promoting employment and social inclusion.
The only problem is that, instead of this, the same old solutions are being put forward yet again. This makes it difficult to draw up credible employment strategies and targets for social inclusion.
Consequently, although I still entertain the gravest doubts over the feasibility of the targets and goals proposed in this report, given the well-known positions of the Council, the Commission and the governments of most of the Member States on the possibility of changing the economic guidelines or of any revision of the Stability Pact to prioritise growth in high-quality employment giving the right to social inclusion, I would underline the positive (though inadequate) proposals which aim to improve employment strategy.

I would also emphasise the point that all Member States must define quantifiable national targets to be included in the first national employment plan that they draw up in accordance with the new guidelines; the need for these targets to be debated in national parliaments; and the need for them to contribute to achieving better results, in terms not only of creating employment, but also of reducing unemployment, of equal opportunities and social inclusion.
The present situation, however, demanded much more.
We must check the rapid growth of unemployment stemming from fundamental public sector liberalisation and privatisation, from the restructuring and relocating of multinationals, from the increasing difficulties facing micro-, small and medium-sized businesses and the lack of support they receive, from insistence on the supremacy of monetarist policies as well as restrictive ones which limit public investment and hinder the growth of workers', retired people's and pensioners' buying power, and finally from an insistence on raising the retirement age, which punishes workers and does not create more jobs for young people.
The only problem is that neither the majority in this Parliament nor the Council accept such proposals.
On the contrary, they insist for the most part on policies which worsen the current situation, as we saw in the last part-session during the debate on economic policy guidelines, and as is happening again here, whenever anyone tries to go a little further, as Herman Schmid, the rapporteur, has done.
Of course, advocating improved working conditions is a positive step, but proposing an overall reduction in the incidence rate of accidents at work of only 15% (25% in high risk sectors) throughout the Member States by 2010 does not mean a great deal, especially for a country like Portugal, which has the highest rate of accidents at work in the European Union, with an average of one death every working day.
Attaining these aims, however, requires not only political commitment but also substantial changes to economic and monetary policy, which we have unfortunately not achieved up to now.
Mr President, I wish to add my group's congratulations to the rapporteur on the great amount of work that he has done on this report in an extremely short space of time.
However, we regret the lack of proper coordination within this Parliament with the broad economic policy guidelines and hope that we can rectify that in the future.
We welcome the general thrust of the report and the Commission's proposals about the coordination with other strategies of the European Union, for example social inclusion.
However, there is still a great underestimation of the importance of the sustainability strategy within this overall package as well.
We also welcome, however, the increased emphasis on the role of women in the report, and indeed the Commission's response to that, but we regret its removal as an overarching goal.
We also welcome the increasing emphasis on the work-life balance.
However, men will not achieve that until women have truly equal treatment in the workplace, and that includes equal pay.
We have a degree of sympathy with some of the remarks made about the cost of employment in terms of the costs to employers.
However, the level of wages is also important and we are well aware that in certain Member States and some of the accession countries even the national minimum wage is effectively a poverty wage.
Employers need to be looking at that dimension and not just the costs of employment.
To return to the issue of coordination with other polices, another one which should be included is our trade policies.
We are working for a trading system which effectively drives production costs down and which encourages companies to relocate in search of competitive advantage.
Therefore, we also need to examine the goals of our trade policy and the way they work with our employment policy because we are not convinced they are travelling in the same direction at all.
Mr President, the proposed guidelines for employment policies presented by the Commission for Parliament's consideration are rich in pious generalisations: improving overall employment rates, improving employment rates among women and the elderly, improving quality and productivity of work, strengthening social cohesion and integration into the job market - all of these are generalisations which we have already heard a hundred times, which teach us nothing and which will surely teach the governments of the Member States nothing either.
Nevertheless, the coordinated employment strategy might have been useful, if it had gone into more detail, spoken of more precise problems and compared countries - if it had been pointed out, for example, that the unemployment rate in the countries of the euro area is approaching 9%, while in 'non-euro' countries it is in the region of 5%.
Are there really no conclusions to be drawn from this fact?
Even within the euro area, the disparities are very great.
Leaving Luxembourg, an exceptional case, to one side, we see Austria on 4.2% and Ireland on 4.5%, at one end of the scale, with France on 9.3% and Spain on 11.9% at the other end.
Faced with such differences, can we really extrapolate universally applicable guidelines without regressing into abstraction and even artificiality?
For my part, I would rather see more respect for the spirit of open coordination - of diversity, of the exchange of good practice - and talk in concrete terms of successful experiments, which should be passed on.
Mr President, may I start by congratulating the Commission on the opening words, with which I very much agree.
The points about the better balance between flexibility and security and the importance of entrepreneurship are very important themes in this debate and I will refer to those in my concluding remarks.
I will start by sharing a very short story about the UK, which also has relevance for this morning.
In my previous life in the manufacturing business, I remember vividly a certain major retailer that was losing market share and was starting to fall out with its advertising agency in this regard.
The advertising agency had a very simple message 'You are not spending enough money on advertising'; the message was fine, so they increased the amount of money spent on advertising.
The company continued to lose market share and the advertising agency said: 'you are still not spending enough money'.
Finally the company saw the light and fired the advertising agency.
The moral of that story is that sometimes when you have a problem you do not need more and more of the same solution, you need very different solutions.
That is a problem that we are facing within the EU and within Parliament at the moment.
We have enough employment guidelines, the Commission's report was mildly helpful but the Member States already know exactly what they have to do.
What they lack is the political will to do it.
I do not believe it will help very much if we contribute to making those guidelines more detailed and more prescriptive.
I agree with some of the comments of the rapporteur, and I very genuinely commend him for the hard work that he has put in, the thought that he has put in, and indeed the short timeframe in which he has done it.
I agree particularly on the points he makes about tax, that it is very much a national issue and long may that so remain.
However, some of the more prescriptive conclusions that he comes to and certainly the idea that, and I quote, 'there should be more comprehensive involvement of social partners that represent neither the majority of employers nor employees', do not seem to me to be a helpful step, I see them rather as a retrograde step.
Finally, on the issue of flexibility, security and entrepreneurship, I note that the Commissioner is not here today because quite rightly she is at this other very important meeting, the Employment Council.
I hope at that meeting, where amongst other issues they will be talking about the Atypical Workers Directive, the Commission will take the opportunity to show that it wants to promote a different message and not the same old messages that have been promoted in the past and that it too believes in entrepreneurship and flexibility and does not wish to remain mired in the past.
Today is a very important day, and I look forward to that meeting going the way I hope it will.
I am sorry to say to the rapporteur that much as I support some of the thinking behind what he is saying we cannot support his overall report today.
Mr President, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for the tremendous work he has done under very difficult circumstances to bring this report to us today.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for what he said and for the effort which the Commission has made to accept amendments from Parliament.
I know the Council is doing the same and is standing by waiting for us to adopt our opinion today, so that it can go ahead and adopt the employment guideline package.
That presupposes, however, that we will adopt this report today.
In that respect, I would like to make an appeal to the PPE-DE Group, because that group has a tendency to seek revenge for the rejection of the Thomas Mann report on the spring summit some two months ago.
That group has made it known that certain amendments are regarded as key amendments and if they are rejected in the House today then that group will vote to reject the whole employment guideline package.
That would be a tremendously damaging blow.
We have already dislocated the streamlined coordinated process, involving the employment and economic policy guidelines.
I hope we can get the whole exercise back on track and I hope that group will pull back from this brinkmanship.
The amendments its members regard as key amendments are causing us some difficulties.
For example, Amendment No 64 concerns the stability pact.
They are placing considerable emphasis on that point.
That is strange because not even Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs places such emphasis on this point in his report on the broad economic policy guidelines.
Amendment No 66 calls for a reduction in the overall tax burden on individuals and companies.
A number of Members have made reference to this amendment already.
This is a fundamental ideological point and is causing some difficulty for a number of my members.
The emphasis that the PPE-DE Group members are placing upon this suggests that they have a determination not to seek consensus and to look rather to create problems for the adoption of this package.
This amendment on the overall reduction in the tax burden is incompatible with the one they have tabled on the stability pact and it also concerns an area of responsibility that is reserved for the Member States themselves.
I cannot believe that if that amendment were rejected the PPE-DE Group would reject the whole package but I am assured by Mr Mann that would be the case.
I hope the group will pull back.
Reluctantly I am urging my members to abstain on Amendment No 66 in the hope that it will get through - although I disagree with it.
If I fail and they lose that amendment, I again would appeal to the PPE-DE Group to pull back and not reject this package.
It is simply not worth it.
My final point, which is very important, is on Amendment No 23 on the social economy.
Last month I mentioned in the debate on the Cooperative Statute that the social economy had disappeared from the employment guideline package.
I hope we can bring it back in as a result of this amendment.
Mr President, quite a few speakers have already today pointed out that, in many countries, unemployment has taken a turn for the worse and is rising.
That is due to the generally poor economic situation, but also to the fact that insufficient efforts are being made to promote adaptability in the labour market.
Moreover, the demands for adaptability will not lessen over the next few years.
Training has an important role to play in this process, and I should like today to call for employment policy also to be seen in the context of the initiatives launched jointly by the EU's education ministers with a view to improving the quality of training schemes through their open coordination.
This will be of great importance to our longer-term competitiveness.
A report, summarising the situation, will of course be produced by the autumn and debated at the Spring Summit in 2004.
We are all agreed that the objective is full employment and that this objective cannot be achieved without a basically sound economy, healthy public finances, a promising investment climate and keen competitiveness - all key elements when the idea is to create jobs.
There is nothing contradictory about this, as parts of this Parliament perhaps appear to believe.
I think that the Council has done a good piece of work in simplifying the employment guidelines.
There was a need for this.
Many of the guidelines were cobbled together without a thought for what they really needed to contain, which simply means that, in the case of many of the guidelines, the whole process has become less comprehensible and more perfunctory.
I should therefore like to have seen Parliament be more sparing with the welter of amendments, even though our rapporteur has made great efforts to boil matters down to something comprehensible.
The more guidelines that are crammed into employment policy, the greater the risk of their being viewed as immaterial.
We need to focus on the objective: more employment and more jobs in Europe.
Mr President, I should like to make a few short remarks in connection to what Mrs Lambert said.
The fact that Commissioner Vitorino is here rather than Commissioner Diamantopoulou is due to the fact that Commissioner Diamantopoulou is attending a meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council.
That is a good thing, too, as we are voting today, and it is very good to hear that the things which we have already decided in the Committee, and which we hope to have adopted today and here I back the appeal by Mr Hughes to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are being discussed there so that we can reach further decisions.
I should like to call for a number of things.
First of all, I think that the general mainstreaming we are calling for is very important, and that this could in fact be extended still further, because I think that the whole equality arm, as it appeared previously in the European Employment Strategy, should still be formulated as a kind of objective.
I would also call for the development of two action plans.
The first is an action plan against unemployment.
Everyone knows what the problem is: unemployment is on the increase, and the recession is growing rapidly and is also set to last a long time - and something must be done about this.
There is no balance between the long-term strategy of increasing employment participation, for example, and the short-term strategy in a number of other spheres.
The second action plan is an action plan for improving quality at work and increasing productivity.
Modernisation of work organisation, in particular, is urgently required.
By way of conclusion, I think that it is important that we take the local and regional approaches and the involvement of national parliaments very seriously.
Mr President, I confess that I have little faith in the usefulness of this kind of document and I feel that the situation which is developing with regard to the Lisbon objectives is cause for thought.
It is easy to agree on the principle of significantly reducing unemployment by 2010: I would challenge anyone to find a single European citizen - whether right-wing, left-wing or centre - who would vote against that principle.
It is easy to agree on the principle that policies should contribute to reducing poverty by 50% by 2010 - we could have said 'eliminate' poverty while we were about it.
I feel it is too easy to reach agreement on objectives of this kind.
The problem arises - and it is a problem which we are failing to address - when it comes to defining options, taking decisions or calling for specific decisions to be taken.
It has already been observed that employment increases with the growth of the economy - as is shown by a number of recommendations which I fully endorse on the quality of employment, equal rights for men and women, jobs and so forth. Since the labour market and policies relating thereto can encourage economic and employment growth in Europe, we need to introduce flexibility and liberalisation into the employment and employment agencies sector wholesale.
With regard to the tax burden, we need to take into consideration the burden of contributions for pensions systems.
Young workers - Germans, Italians and Europeans in general - are paying through unemployment for excessively large pensions to be provided for workers retiring too early.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the employment policies of the Member States should focus on clear priorities, taking into account the current economic climate, the requirements of an enlarged European Union and better implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
Lifelong learning, employment for the elderly and combating undeclared work are all priorities which must be emphasised, as the rapporteur, of course, rightly states.
Although it outlines the importance of common priorities, this report approaches certain areas less successfully. These areas are:
Firstly, the Stability Pact: applying the employment strategy is the responsibility of the Member States, who should ensure that sufficient financial resources are made available, bearing in mind the need for sound public finances in accordance with the broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability Pact.
The Stability Pact is an essential instrument for guaranteeing good public finance management on the part of the Member States and for ensuring sustainable growth and the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.
Reference to the Pact and compliance with its provisions is thus crucial to European employment strategy.
Secondly, immigration as a response to the overall job creation strategy should be strictly regulated.
Recruitment of immigrant workers should be done selectively.
Checks must be carried out to see if the conditions for entry, residence and employment prescribed by the relevant legislation have been fulfilled, in order to avoid uncontrolled immigration.
Illegal immigration into the Member States is the object of extremely uneven national legislation and has been on the increase in recent years, bolstered by the traffic in human beings and the activities of facilitators.
It should be left to the discretion of each Member State to define the type of qualifications needed, as well as the number of workers it intends to recruit, based on the needs of its labour market, its population trends and its ability to integrate immigrants.
Furthermore, the battle against undeclared work should be joined with renewed vigour, reducing labour costs and making the creation of new jobs less burdensome.
Thirdly, the definition of targets such as, for example, reducing unemployment or increasing the participation of women in the labour market, should be challenging but realistic, and the different starting points of the various Member States should be taken into account.
These aims should be thought of as progressive steps to take rather than as levels to attain.
Otherwise, we run the risk of their becoming unacceptable and badly implemented in national employment plans.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino, who expressed very well the need for a balance between security and flexibility as essential factors for competitiveness and productivity in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the Commission for its proposal for guidelines and the Commissioner for his words.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur, for I feel that he has endeavoured in a short space of time to take into account all the different viewpoints in the House, without compromising on quality objectives.
I would like to focus on a number of considerations.
If we take into account the economic climate and the experience we have gained in recent years on the European employment strategy, it would appear that the Commission has already endeavoured in its proposals to define specific objectives which I consider to be particularly important because they are in line with the recommendations made by the Commission on the basis of the evaluation of national employment plans.
I therefore believe that this strategy is becoming increasingly specific.
If the Community institutions are to foster this tendency towards specific measures, we need firmer support from many Member States.
In this regard, I would like to focus on a number of points.
The Commission, the rapporteur and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have defined precisely a number of aspects of the Commission's communication, such as the need to invest in quality and services to make female employment a reality. In all the countries, some of them in particular, this aspect of the employment situation is distressing, in that there is both a high inactivity rate and a high unemployment rate.
Matters can be improved by providing training for women and the services necessary to make the market favourable to female employment.
The amendments adopted in committee are along these lines.
Then we need a more effective partnership at Member State level involving governments, national Parliaments and local authorities in their respective roles.
I feel these are tangible goals.
This is a point on which we all agree but which is incompatible with cutting taxes across the board, for we cannot have it both ways: either we have investment resources or we reduce taxation.
Mr President, the Treaty states that there must be guidelines concerning the Member States' employment policy.
Even though I am very dubious about the value of EU guidelines, there is no point in discussing the whys and wherefores of them right now.
I shall therefore concentrate on the Commission's proposed guidelines and, above all, comment on Mr Herman Schmid's report, as it appears following the vote in committee.
There is much that is good in the Commission's proposal, although even that is too detailed.
The debate in committee has led to further detailed requirements and measures having been added.
If guidelines are to be of any value, they must be firmly established in the relevant Member State.
It does not make sense to cite, as now in this proposal, an ever-increasing quantity of measures and detailed objectives.
At present, it is a question of 15 Member States; tomorrow, of 25.
Offering at least 33% of children under three years of age childcare is, in my view, an issue that EU guidelines should have no bearing upon whatsoever.
Apart from the general defect of being too detailed, the report before us has the fault of containing points that I very much doubt could do any thing at all to help increase employment.
The rapporteur writes that responsibility for implementing a successful employment policy lies with the Member States.
That is quite true for, as long as the governments of the Member States are not themselves prepared to take the necessary measures to reform the labour market, employment will not significantly increase.
I am thinking mainly of reforms aimed at making it easier to employ staff, but also at reducing staff numbers.
It is unfortunately the case that, for a small company to venture to employ one further person, its managers must know that, if it were to become necessary, they could reduce the number of staff.
Germany is an example of what happens if a rigid labour market is not reformed.
Unemployment has increased very considerably, partly because of rigid labour law.
The fact is, too, that the longer the delay in reforming the labour markets, the more difficult the situation becomes.
It perhaps seems odd that, as a Swedish Moderate in this Chamber, I am going to refer to something said recently by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, but what he said is worth quoting.
He said that structural reforms are needed if the European economy is to be given new impetus, that more trade liberalisation is required and, above all, a liberalisation of labour markets by means of fewer regulations and healthier levels of labour protection.
There are at present 13 million people within the EU who do not have any work to go to.
Chancellor Gordon Brown thought that flexibility was not a threat to full employment but the prerequisite for increased employment.
The guidelines should therefore be more overarching and concentrate on measures that, together with the economic policy guidelines, genuinely lead to economic growth and consequently to more people employed and thus to the provision of resources for things like education and health care.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur at the outset on his tremendous work on this report.
Given the short deadline, he has made a very reasonable and consensus-based approach towards getting an opinion from this Parliament that can be presented to the Council meeting.
Of course, we have a right to be consulted under the Treaty obligations and we should always utilise such opportunities to put forward the ideas that we as representatives of the citizens of the European Union wish to see promoted.
I have difficulty with some aspects of the report, in particular regarding the introduction of issues related to the Stability and Growth Pact.
I do not believe that we need to expand further on what the Commission has already said on this matter.
Ultimately our role and our aim should be to try and create more and better jobs for people and to ensure that the guidelines as laid down are more focused; that they are flexible in the sense that they can respond to new opportunities which arise; and that they are based on competitiveness to ensure that companies are encouraged to take on more people and not to move their production abroad or outside of the European Union.
One of the key areas with regard to creating more jobs, if you look at the empirical evidence, has been sound public finances with a proper tax regime, to ensure that people are rewarded more for their work and entitled to keep more of their money in their pockets, rather than being penalised for working.
This does not just apply to workers, it also applies to companies that employ those workers.
We have to ensure that the social partnership model, which has been so successful in creating industrial harmony, is maintained and strengthened.
We must also in this year, the European Year of Disabilities, take account of people with disabilities, some 70% of whom are unemployed.
New innovative measures and research must be promoted to integrate people with disabilities into the labour market.
I commend this report to the House and also thank it for supporting my amendments to it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for his proposals, which are supported by our group as well.
In our view, there is a need to put forward ambitious objectives and pragmatic specific measures, with new and innovative approaches and more local and regional initiatives - all of which you have included in your report.
For a long time, we have been passing resolutions demanding that the national parliaments be more involved - not only Denmark's and Scotland's, but those right across the European Union.
However, the fact that the European Employment Policy allows national objectives and decision-making leeway is another indicator of how astute it is.
What I would like to tell the honourable lady Member from Sweden is that the German labour market might well be in need of reform, but there is not one Member State of the European Union in which the removal of protection against dismissal has helped to create jobs.
I want to say, though, that there are two points on which we are critical of the Christian Democrats.
One, which has already been referred to, is Amendment No 62.
The Commission has proposed the use of immigration policy to govern the way in which the potential labour becoming available through immigration is used.
I think there is a need for the Christian Democrats to face up to this fact and for this not to be taken, as it were, ad absurdum by means of special bilateral arrangements between the Member States, with conservatives remaining silent in the face of this practice.
We cannot support tax cuts across the board, and I find it regrettable that this amendment is being treated as the most important.
Europe's entrepreneurs expect something different: their expectations are for the security that makes it possible to plan for the long term, for qualified workers, the best possible infrastructure, promotion of science and research, the weeding-out of rules and regulations, and investment.
There is a need for such measures, and they cannot be brought about by tax cuts across the board.
Mr President, the adoption of the guidelines on employment is of particular importance to Parliament, especially today with the Commission presenting a revised proposal with a limited number of objectives, which constitute the pillars of the European social model in the new economy.
In this light, the adoption of the rapporteur's report by a broad majority in Plenary is not just the only way forward, but is also an obligation towards the European citizens whose interests we represent.
The initiative taken by the Commission appears to confirm the priority of quality competition, which is bound up with the quality of employment and the quality of public services.
The policy of promoting not just cheap labour but cheaper and cheaper labour, which the amendments by the PPE-DE will bring about, is a non starter because, while it brings about a gradual reduction in the standard of living, it also facilitates the survival of companies with low productivity and little growth capacity, as the rapporteur also rightly underlines.
So instead of insisting on the link with the stability pact, which restricts initiatives for interventions in the labour market and measures to modernise public services, without which they will be handed over to the private sector on a plate, we should be calling consistently for other guidelines.
Thus, we should be calling for maximum coordination with the European Charter for Small Enterprises, which places emphasis on promoting enterprises based on knowledge and innovation, and urging a rapprochement between industrial policy and the demands of the European social model.
Industrial policy to date, instead of following this direction, marginalises employment-related matters.
It would be a pity if the PPE-DE stood by its initial choices which, instead of resulting in the exploitation of the competitiveness of quality, which is the advantage of the European economy, insist on more and more exploitation of cheap labour.
Finally, I should like to congratulate the Commission, which is placing particular emphasis on very close, more active participation by the national parliaments and on the mobilisation of local societies, with corresponding, specific commitments to increase employment, an idea which I too have supported in the past.
In this way, we shall achieve not only a broadening of responsibilities on employment issues, but also the development of healthy competition between the individual regions of a country.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Schmid for his excellent work. I should also like to thank him for his effort to find common ground, even though we might not all agree on everything.
The Lisbon European Council set a strategic objective for the European Union.
The Union was to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the market. It was to be capable of sustainable economic growth and of generating more and better jobs.
Social cohesion was to increase. The European Union's commitment to jobs was consolidated and strengthened at the European Councils of Stockholm and Barcelona held in 2001 and 2002 respectively.
I therefore believe that at a time when the European economy is stagnant and enlargement imminent, it is right to reiterate the ambitions stated at Lisbon and Barcelona. These ambitions should be adjusted to suit the current economic situation.
Furthermore, the right of each and every citizen of the European Union to work is enshrined in Article 15 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Economic activity, jobs and favourable conditions for development cannot be isolated and dealt with as a self-contained area.
I would therefore like to focus on some cross cutting ideas. I am aware of the time restrictions and only intend to offer a few suggestions, given that Mrs Regina Bastos has already emphasised the need to abide by the Stability Pact, to continue combating illegal immigration and to ensure the integration of legal immigrants when appropriate.
I have in mind specific ideas, such as the commitment to more and better jobs. These should be jobs in which flexibility and stability need not threaten workers' rights.
