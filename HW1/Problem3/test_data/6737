Moreover, key objectives of the Community research programme on fusion concern the safe management of nuclear waste, the operational safety of nuclear installations and radiation protection, which covers a wider field than energy, such as medical uses.
Fusion has the potential to make a major contribution to the realisation of the sustainable and secure energy supply for the EU within a few decades.
Recent technical studies suggest that an adequately funded fast-track fusion development programme, including ITER, could lead to the operation, within thirty years, of a demonstration fusion power plant through which the commercial viability of fusion energy could be established.
In view of the scale and technical challenge of this technology, it can only be pursued at Community level, and indeed, for a major initiative such as ITER, at global level.
It is recalled that in the conclusions of the March meeting, the European Council also invited the Commission to forge ahead with ITER, to start its construction before the end of 2005.
However, it is clear that the Commission's proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme also puts strong emphasis on non-nuclear energy in general, with a significantly increased the budget compared to the Sixth Framework Programme and an emphasis on renewable energy sources in particular.
Generally, the share of Euratom in the total Framework Programme drops from 7.5 % in the Sixth Framework Programme to 5.9% in the Seventh Framework Programme.
The renewables are recognised as being key technologies for Europe in that they are indigenous sources of energy and can be adapted to different regional conditions.
Renewable energy sources for electricity generation, fuel production and for heating and cooling are all given a high profile in the Commission's proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme, within the broader portfolio approach mentioned earlier.
As a comparison, the overall level of funding for non-nuclear research is more than four times as much as for fusion.
The potential for job creation in the renewable energy sector must be fully exploited, not only through increased research and development, but also through the adoption of policy measures at European and national levels, to facilitate their penetration into the market.
Currently more than 100Â 000 jobs have been created in Europe in the wind and solar photovoltaic sectors alone.
This is a good illustration of the growth potential that can be harnessed through the combination of Community research effort and policy measures, such as feed-in tariff schemes and green certificates.
The Commission will therefore continue to provide a substantial level of support to the research and deployment efforts of renewable based energy systems.
It fully expects that they will secure a larger share of the energy mix through the resulting improved technological solutions.
Â Â  Madam President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for his response, and I am delighted with his all-out support for renewable sources of energy.
I think this marks an important U-turn.
While I think that the European Union has for far too long opted one-sidedly for nuclear energy and, above all, for nuclear fission, I am not certain whether I heard the Commissioner correctly when he said that 16% of our electricity supply would, in future, be derived from nuclear fusion.
This is how this figure came through in translation, and I am really amazed by it.
I should like to have this clarified.
What are the prospects for nuclear fusion and what is the timeframe involved?
Â Â  . The reference to 16% was in the context that nuclear fusion currently contributes 16% of the European Unionâs energy supply.
We believe that when we talk about the future, we have to talk about three major principles.
Sustainability and ensuring that we do all in our power to be environmentally friendly should be part of our philosophy.
That philosophy underlines all our research programmes in the fields of environment, energy supplies and transport.
We believe that should be our guiding principle.
Â Â  Madam President, on a point of order: since I am in the House and the Commissioner has taken such a long time over his replies, would it not be possible, as a courtesy, to allow two more questions?
Very few questions have been answered.
Â Â  Firstly, Mr Mitchell, I did not give you the floor; secondly, I had already indicated that we were running late, and thirdly, I would suggest that we should all spare a thought for our friends in the interpretersâ cabins, who have now worked long in excess of their usual hours.
That leaves me with no other option but to move to our last question, which is Question 46.
Â Â  . The question on deafness and hearing impairment is extremely important.
According to the Eurostat publication, âKey data on health 2002â, it is true that at present there are no data on the prevalence of deafness, hearing impairment, nor on tinnitus in the European Union.
However, the Commission agrees that it would be important, as a measurement of a significant aspect of health status, to have comparable and accurate data on such impairments.
It would also be useful to evaluate screening, care and treatment available and to develop preventive strategies.
In terms of research, the Commission has given the issue a great deal of attention both in the previous and current framework programmes.
As an example, under the fifth programme, the âHereditary deafnessâ project â with an EU contribution of EURÂ 2.8Â million and coordinated by the Institut Pasteur in Paris â led to the discovery of half of the genes causing hereditary deafness once mutated.
This project strongly contributed to the development of new diagnostic tools to identify these genetic defects early after birth.
More recently, a large FP6 integrated project, Eurohear â coordinated by Inserm in Paris â addressing deafness and hearing impairment just started in December 2004.
This project receives a European Union contribution of EURÂ 12.5 million.
It has the objectives of providing fundamental knowledge about the development and function of the inner ear, and identifying the molecular defects underlying hereditary hearing impairments.
Achieving these objectives will facilitate the development of therapies for alleviating hearing impairment.
Other projects of a lower scale on hearing impairment and rehabilitation were also funded.
More specifically, detection techniques of hearing impairment, notably in the new-born and children, were supported in the context of the successive Ahead projects coordinated by Professor Grandori, in Milan, based on the technique of otoacoustic emissions.
In the context of the Commissionâs proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme, the fields of advanced diagnostic techniques and handicaps are, like before, still clearly considered.
In addition â and this is new â child health is recognised as a strategic issue, to be addressed across activities of the health theme, including diagnosis and treatment approaches.
More specifically, the specificities of children will be taken into consideration in order to foster the translation of clinical research outcomes into clinical practice.
Although research topics have not yet been identified, research into deafness and hearing impairment in children could mature along these lines.
Â Â  That was an excellent, very helpful reply.
I would like to press the Commissioner a little further.
As he knows, thousands of babies are born in Europe with a permanent hearing impairment.
Some 50% of those are not diagnosed until they are 18 months old.
Some 25% are not diagnosed until they are nearly three years old.
As a result of that late diagnosis, permanent damage is caused to those young lives.
What we now know is that if you have a new-born hearing screening programme, you can give new hope to those children, real potential for them and my plea is that the Commissioner finds a slot within the seventh programme to develop that knowledge further.
Â Â  . The problem will be given serious consideration.
I agree fully with the honourable Member that this is one of the problems that commands our full attention.
Â Â  Questions 47 to 88 will be answered in writing(2).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Moraes, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies in an enlarged Europe (A6-0140/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, this report on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies in an enlarged European Union is an extremely wide report.
From the title, Members of this House could see almost immediately that we in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs were dealing with two very big areas.
Firstly we were dealing with extending and deepening the definition of what it means to be a minority in the enlarged European Union. But we were also dealing with unfinished business: we were dealing with the response to the Green Paper on anti-discrimination.
Both areas are extremely wide and probably required reports of their own, but we have tried to put these issues together in one report and I hope I have touched on the key issues, however difficult they have been.
Because this has been a difficult report, I want to thank at the very outset the shadow rapporteurs and other colleagues in the Chamber today for all their help in meeting the aims of this report.
It has been difficult and there are one or two issues still to be sorted out before the vote tomorrow.
But let me return to the substance of this report.
I care very passionately about ensuring that there is a definition of what it means to be a minority in the new enlarged European Union.
We know that the protection of minorities was part of the Copenhagen criteria for enlargement of the European Union, but equally we realise that there was no real standard for minority rights in the European Union and in Community policy.
And because of this gap, we wanted to ensure that this report took at least one step forward in attempting to make that definition.
That definition is a very wide one. It includes all the traditional definitions that we understood in the existing 15 Member States under Article 13 of the Treaty, where we talked about minorities which suffered from disabilities, the issue of age, religion, sexual orientation, race and ethnic origin.
But in the enlarged European Union we also have to understand that we are talking about traditional minorities: linguistic minorities and national minorities.
It is also important to understand the changing nature of the European Union.
A recent debate in this House on the Roma identified that minority as probably the largest in the European Union and deserving of a rapid and deep response to the problems that they face.
So this report tries to take on two areas.
I shall deal with each of them.
First, the response to the Green Paper and Article 13.
Here in my report I find that the implementation and transposition of the existing directives which the Commission brought forward and this Parliament voted through, and the strengthening of legislation in relation to discrimination on the grounds of disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, race and ethnic origin, was far too slow.
Too many Member States have failed to implement existing directives, and although the legislation is very good and some Member States have transposed it, there is insufficient will in the European Union to transpose what already exists.
I hope this report will take one step further with the Commission â and I know the Commission has been making strides on this in bringing Member States to account, but I hope that Member States will see for themselves the benefit of transposing this legislation.
Article 13 legislation, the race equality directive and the employment directive are valuable because they can apply equally to the Roma minority, as they do to second or third generation ethnic minority migrants in Britain or France or Italy.
And that is the beauty of this legislation: it is easy to transpose.
But it needs the political will of the Member States in order to implement it.
On the definition of minorities, here we have to take seriously the question of traditional, national and linguistic minorities.
We have to understand that there are many people in the European Union who want to protect their diversity, but they feel they are a minority and therefore vulnerable.
This report seeks to look at those areas, not to impose solutions on Member States, but to have a standard in the European Union that says that if you are a minority you are also a European Union citizen worthy of respect and worthy of carrying on your own cultural traditions, language or whatever it may be.
Finally I want to say that this has been a difficult report but we have to identify that the way any Member State treats its minorities is a measure of how advanced that Member State really is.
This is a very important test.
We saw it in the Copenhagen criteria and we should see it today: that a Member State can be measured by how it protects its minorities, how it protects diversity within its population.
We in the European Union already have the legislation to do this.
We must use it, and we must develop a definition of minorities which everyone can accept.
There have been difficulties in this report, but I hope that definition will be broadly acceptable to all Members across this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Moraes for his excellent report and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Employment for their invaluable contributions.
The promotion of fundamental rights and the fight against discrimination and for equal opportunities are a priority for the European Commission.
At his own initiative, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, established a group of Commissioners that is to develop the European Unionâs policy agenda in these areas.
Your report, Mr Moraes, has drawn to our attention the need for further steps to solve the problems of discrimination and the situation of minorities in the European Union.
The Commission shares a number of fears mentioned by Mr Moraes and other Members of Parliament.
Today, the European Unionâs anti-discrimination regulations are among the most advanced in the world.
Two significant directives were adopted in 2000, which ban discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin, religious belief or conviction, age, disability or sexual orientation.
These directives extended the broad range of Community regulations in the area of discrimination on the basis of gender.
As your report correctly noted, our main task will now be to ensure that these regulations work effectively throughout the whole of the enlarged Europe; in other words, that the process of implementing the regulations must be concluded at national level.
Certain Member States have, however, failed to meet the deadlines set.
The Commission takes its role as a guardian of the Treaties in this area very seriously, and has on a number of occasions taken action against Member States for failing to meet their obligations.
We must similarly ensure that people are aware of their rights, and that they are able to derive full benefit from them.
Awareness-raising is a priority for the Commission, and we therefore propose that the European Union designate 2007 as being the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
This European Year will be an important opportunity to mobilise all participants and to emphasise the benefits of European diversity for the economy as well as for society as a whole.
I hope that we shall be able to rely on the support of the European Parliament for this proposal, and on your active participation in this European year.
In 2004, the European Commission carried out a broad public consultation on the Green Paper on equality and non-discrimination in an enlarged European Union.
National bodies, organisations concerned with equality, non-governmental organisations, social partners and the general public sent more than 1Â 500 reactions.
We are very pleased that we can take into account the opinions and reactions of the European Parliament in the questions considered in the Green Paper.
With regard to the Green Paper, the Commission adopted an announcement on non-discrimination and equal rights for all.
This announcement describes a framework strategy for future activities in this area.
This strategy goes beyond merely protecting the rights of individuals, and explores how the European Union can promote positive measures to support the integration of social groups facing considerable structural obstacles to their participation in society.
The Commission will also assess the potential impact and workability of new measures to complement existing European Union regulations in the fight against discrimination.
This study will take account of the relative benefits of legislative and non-legislative measures and the costs and benefits of various alternative policies, as well as the need to take care not to open a discussion on the existing legal framework, which might weaken the current level of protection against discrimination.
The Commission is in particular worried about the unusually serious situation concerning the exclusion of and discrimination against Roma communities throughout the European Union, including in the accession and candidate countries.
The European Union is now trying to resolve these issues, for example, by using its anti-discrimination legislation and the targeted use of the European Unionâs financial resources.
This is an area in which the Union cannot act alone, however.
A joint effort of international organisations, Member Statesâ national bodies, and representatives of citizensâ groups is needed.
However, I agree that we should evaluate the most effective way of using the Unionâs policies and policy programmes to support the inclusion of the Roma.
As the President, Mr Barroso, has confirmed, a group of Commissioners dealing with fundamental rights, anti-discrimination and equal opportunities will consider this question at a future meeting.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to congratulate my honourable friend Mr Moraes for his bold approach to the question of discrimination.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would be happy if we were in a position today to speak about development, cooperation, solidarity, tolerance and a rational and fair distribution of wealth generated.
Unfortunately, however, all this looks more like a theoretical approach to reality which, in its every expression, worryingly unfolds more and more forms of discrimination.
The vision finds a strong adversary everywhere.
It is precisely economic liberalisation which is the most basic cause of the exacerbation of economic inequalities, which promotes individual activity to the detriment of social collectiveness.
It is economic liberalisation which is the most basic factor, which strengthens xenophobic tendencies, which dynamites industrial relations and creates new armies of the unemployed, which reinforces a particular form of social racism against the elderly and the disabled.
It is therefore economic liberalisation which is the most important ally of discrimination, the combating of which needs to be placed at the centre of our political practice.
It is also obvious that the recent refusal by the French and Dutch people to accept the draft Constitutional Treaty conceals causes which are closely connected with some of the existing forms of social discrimination, such as unemployment, poverty and anxiety about the future of the welfare state.
To conclude, over and above theoretical texts, we need to proceed in essence, in practice.
We need to give coming generations a society in which colour, creed, sex, origin or sexual preferences are not reasons for discriminatory treatment.
We need to fight for a social Europe which places people first, a Europe of participation which invests in education, full employment, quality of life and the elimination of poverty.
We owe it to the children of the entire world.
Â Â  . The work of the rapporteur in this case has been groundbreaking and I would like to thank him for this.
It is true that several of the reports touch on anti-discrimination, but this one has gone a step further than previous reports.
Protection of minorities means more than simply prohibiting discrimination; it takes political thinking a little closer to creating equal opportunities.
However, when the two issues are linked together, numerous problems arise, and so the report has ended up rather large; the issue is complex and so the report examines a whole raft of new connections.
The report deals first of all with protection of minorities.
Since minority rights are an integral part of human rights and the latter are among the incontrovertible fundamental values of the European region, there is no doubt that the issue on the agenda is unquestionably important and inevitable.
In an enlarging Europe, it is only fair that the problem of dual standards should arise in connection with an issue such as this.
While the Copenhagen criteria clearly set out EU expectations with regard to protection of minorities, Member States have not so far been obliged to adjust their policy on minorities accordingly.
In the new Member States, which have been bringing their policy on minorities into line with Europe prior to accession, there is a danger that a rise in nationalism might not only bring this process to a halt, but also lead to an increase in anti-minority incidents.
This is why a monitoring system is indeed needed.
The specific problems that arose in the course of preparing the report â problems relating to the varied situation of different minorities on the one hand and the universal nature of human rights on the other â were a clear indication that we need a policy like this within the Union.
I strongly endorse the section of the report that emphasises that this policy must be based on the fundamental European principles of subsidiarity and self-governance.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, one of the primary expectations of the citizens of the European Union is better protection of their rights.
Indeed, we all know that the rights to speak and write freely, to elect oneâs representatives and to live as one wishes can have no real meaning for people who, in their daily lives, do not have the necessary material means to ensure their dignity.
The inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty is a considerable step forward for European citizens.
It shows that the protection of citizensâ rights is at the heart of European integration and ArticleÂ 1 restates the prime importance of human dignity.
The Charter thus also has real legal significance.
Let us hope that this will be the case.
The report by my colleague, MrÂ Moraes, points out the importance of fundamental rights and, in particular, of the protection of minorities in an enlarged Europe.
We note that, unfortunately, ArticleÂ 13, which gives the Community the mission of combating all forms of discrimination, and European legislation in this field, have been implemented poorly or partially by the Member States.
It is therefore, above all, absolutely necessary to ensure better transposition, better application of European legislation in this field.
We also think that effectively combating discrimination goes hand in hand with a common, coherent European integration policy.
Finally, poverty and social exclusion are a form of discrimination and the eradication of poverty must form part of the policy of combating discrimination.
We must put in place mechanisms giving people suffering from exclusion and poverty appropriate access to employment and housing and ensuring that they are represented within the political bodies.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a tremendous and at times nerve-racking job that he has been doing.
He has been working on very interesting subjects.
With the enlarged European Union we are looking at completely new questions.
I have personally come to realise that where the United States might be a melting pot, the European Union is a very rich, colourful and beautiful mosaic of diversity. It is something to be proud of and to cherish.
We have taken the first steps on the path of a very important discussion.
The European Union has to respect minority rights, but we should not forget that ultimately each citizen is also an individual and each citizen is therefore entitled to the same rights; secondly, that the European Union should respect the cultural identity of minorities and, at the same time, we must ensure that does not prevent full integration and participation in the community.
With regard to the issue of non-discrimination, unfortunately after so many years it is still necessary to have this debate.
As the previous speaker said, there are still many groups, such as women, who face discrimination and who lag behind.
I should like to focus, in particular, on one paragraph that raised some concerns: the paragraph on the rights of gay people.
We should be fair to ourselves here.
Fundamental rights are for all citizens, not just for some groups.
If we are serious about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that says we should not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation, then we cannot possibly vote for the amendment tomorrow that seeks to delete a paragraph on homophobia and obstacles to freedom of movement.
This morning we talked about terrorism and the right balance with fundamental rights.
I would therefore hope that this House will wholeheartedly endorse this report tomorrow.
Â Â  . Nowadays, when the crisis of the process of European integration has become evident, I recall the following words of Yehudi Menuhin: âEither Europe will become a Europe of cultures or Europe will dieâ.
He said that in January 1999 when opening an exhibition devoted to European minorities.
All of us regularly pass the room where this exhibition took place and which now bears his name.
We are discussing today and will tomorrow vote on the report on the protection of minorities and non-discrimination policies, which is absolutely essential for the future of the Union.
This report, as adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is an excellent text showing a real ability to develop the Union as an area in which fundamental rights, including minority rights, are protected effectively.
Nevertheless this report has been supported by little more than half of the Members of the Committee.
Moreover it seems that the same split of opinions is taking place all over Parliament.
Why is this so?
Maybe the reason is that many of us have a differing or indeed no understanding of minority rights.
Surprisingly, we have a consensus when it comes to a number of resolutions telling those outside the EU how to respect human rights and develop democracy, yet we are not ready to support the text saying that these rights have to be respected inside the Union.
Why do we keep silent when the Member States ignore the spirit of the international treaties protecting human rights, for example, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities?
I believe that tomorrow the majority of Parliament will support the text as it has been accepted by the Committee and therefore will support the Europe of cultures.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank MrÂ Moraes for his fine work in preparing this text, because we have a real need in Europe to protect minorities and to generate practical initiatives against discrimination.
I imagine that at this very time all Members have been subject to real lobbying by EU citizens, even asking us to scrap some of the paragraphs in the Moraes report.
We often profess to be champions of the minorities, before then demonstrating such hypocrisy when it is a question of religious freedom or of recognising free movement and homosexual marriages.
Some subject-matters are taboo: there is news today, for instance, that even in Catania, a civilised Italian city, an Italian citizen was refused a driving licence on the grounds of being homosexual.
I believe that this fact also speaks volumes about the level of guarantees that we have to put in place against discrimination, and that it is also useful to launch an initiative aimed at ensuring that, with regard to minorities, genuine acts of citizenship, and not just tolerance, are guaranteed.
Â Â  . Mr President, I was not, at the time, in favour of including Article 13 in the EC Treaty; not because I condone discrimination â quite the contrary â but because it is not desirable that this be regulated at European level.
It is up to the Member States to enact the right sort of regulations.
It does not surprise me that Mr Moraes, in his report, concludes that the Member States are dragging their heels when it comes to implementing this policy.
Tackling this at EU level does not seem to add any value.
Religious convictions are not a personal matter; they must be professed in a community and expressed in oneâs attitude to life.
The way in which it is suggested in paragraph 22 that in the field of education, discrimination would be on grounds of religion, ignores the meaning of religious conviction for the identity of education.
Finally, I am grateful to Mrs in 't Veld for Amendment 4.
Discrimination against Christians should be fought with the same tenacity as other forms of discrimination.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I congratulate the rapporteur on his enormous efforts in drafting the report, which I believe is still incomplete, however, and certainly not very effective.
Protecting fundamental rights, which was a key element in the integration of Europe, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, declared in Nice in 2000, confirm the importance, not to mention the necessity, of a coherent integration policy aimed at protecting minorities and encouraging the integration of non-EU citizens, particularly in the light of the recent enlargement.
We are all agreed in saying that discrimination is a phenomenon that must be fought, that all men and women must enjoy equal rights and that no one must feel discriminated against on the grounds of race, ethnicity, religion or any other category.
I believe, however, that the social inclusion of immigrants, and the protection of minorities and cultural diversity â priority objectives of the European Constitution â do not always have to be achieved at any price in every case.
Allow me to express my doubts about those immigrant communities that show obvious signs of intolerance â not to say contempt â towards the host country, its customs, its history and its culture; about those who demand unwarranted autonomy and consider it their right to not respect the laws of the Member State in which they are staying, often illegally.
They are the first not to want to integrate.
Immigrants certainly need to be given legal status, allowing those whose situation is in order not to be discriminated against, on condition that they clearly demonstrate their willingness to integrate and to actively contribute to the economic and social development of their host country.
In contrast, by guaranteeing every kind of right at any cost â systematically and unconditionally â there is the danger that the only ones who feel discriminated against will be European citizens, who carry out all of their fiscal and social obligations towards the State, respecting its rules.
Finally, I must naturally declare my complete opposition to the paragraph on homophobia and gay couples, regarding âfamilyâ only in the traditional sense: a male father, a female mother and children as they are born, male or female.
The time allocated to me has unfortunately come to an end, but I would have liked to expand on such issues in this House, as I believe is necessary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to congratulate MrÂ Moraes on his excellent report, and if the nationalists and homophobes attack you, MrÂ Moraes, do not be afraid, because it will be proof that you have produced a very good report.
As chairman of the intergroup for traditional national minorities, I would like to emphasise the following points.
Firstly, the European Union has no system for the protection of national minorities.
We must draw up legal and political standards for the protection of national minorities and for a monitoring system as MrsÂ Bauer proposed in her opinion.
Secondly, we must distinguish between the traditional national minorities of MrÂ Moraesâs report and the migrant minorities of the Council of Europe.
I have proposed referring to migrant minorities as new minorities.
Fundamental rights are indivisible, but the obligations of the State are different: for traditional minorities, we need to guarantee that their identity and language are protected; for migrant minorities, we need to guarantee that they are integrated into society.
Thirdly, we in the European Union must clarify the relationship between non-discrimination and positive discrimination.
We have some non-discrimination clauses, but it is not clear.
What is the relationship between equal treatment and preferential treatment?
We cannot guarantee the rights of national minorities without preferential treatment or positive discrimination.
Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to support this excellent report in full.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the new Member States have brought new linguistic and national minorities with them into the EU, which is ever more characterised by linguistic diversity.
New demands are being made of the EU policy on minorities, which is laudably addressed by the report.
Already, 46 million inhabitants of the EU now have mother tongues other than their countriesâ main languages.
The fact that the number of MEPs per country decreases when the EU receives new Member States is a problem.
Then, linguistic and national minorities are the first to disappear from the European Parliament.
Four minorities disappeared as a result of the last enlargement, and the process will continue if measures are not taken.
The issue affects the basis of democracy, since everyone should be represented in, and recognised by, the body to whose legislation they are subject.
As the rapporteur quite correctly says, one prerequisite for an inclusive minority policy is adequate representation in political decision-making.
Given the way in which the enlargements are now planned, just about all minorities will disappear from Parliament.
That is not desirable.
The issue could be solved, for example, by the EU establishing 30 parliamentary seats earmarked for national linguistic minorities.
Obviously, it could be difficult to decide precisely how these were to be defined, but the problem must not be exaggerated.
In most cases, we are concerned with population groups that have recognised status in their countries and that are neither anonymous nor invisible.
Europeâs diversity must be made visible.
To take away from Europeâs minorities the opportunity of achieving even some fragile representation is a serious matter, affecting the ways in which stability can be secured on our continent.
Many wars in Europe have been the result of majorities oppressing smaller groups.
I hope that Parliament and the Commission will tackle this issue.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Moraes for the work that has been done on this very sophisticated report, which, as some have already said, demonstrates the growing complexity of the European Union.
At the moment we are looking at the question of whose Europe is it that we are creating; and this report, along with others tonight, is very strong on the fact that this needs to be an inclusive Europe, where people have equality of opportunity to fulfil their potential.
We need to be combating the growing movements we see which are based on hatred and exclusion, something that, for many of us, is absolutely unacceptable within this European Union.
I welcome the particular recognition given in this report to the work of local authorities and others from the grassroots up, because we are looking at something of a cultural shift which broadens the European Union.
I echo Mr Moraesâ statement on the Article 13 directives.
I would hope that the incoming presidency makes that a priority, so that at least the legislation is in place when we come to celebrate the Year of Equalities in 2007.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a gap between the EU rhetoric on equality, inclusion and diversity, and the reality of experience across the Member States.
This report rightly asserts that minority rights issues have not been high enough on the EU agenda.
The report also reflects the massive amount of work required in this area if we are to bridge the gap between rhetoric and reality.
In my limited time I shall add my voice to two specific calls that the report makes.
A critical requirement in asserting and protecting minority rights is political will.
In this regard I echo the reportâs call for speedy progress on the Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia.
Also essential is the availability of comprehensive, reliable and disaggregated data on discrimination.
The report correctly identifies this area as one meriting immediate action.
I congratulate Mr Moraes and I welcome the reportâs assertion that equal treatment is a basic right and not a privilege, that human rights are indivisible and cannot be bought or sold.
The challenge for all of us is to put in place mechanisms, and crucially resources, to realise these goals.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, while acknowledging the importance of the goals of the report by Claude Moraes and noting the personal sense of responsibility displayed by the rapporteur in seeking out the truth, at the same time it must be said that the process of creating the report has once again clearly demonstrated that, in creating a common minorities and anti-discrimination policy in Europe, it is absolutely vital and essential to take into account the special, unique, historical and political situation of each country; the importance for a country of preserving its identity and its jurisdiction in solving issues regarding minorities and discrimination against them must be respected.
As this report was being written, there were on several occasions manifest failures to observe this rule in the proposals submitted by individual Members who are ignorant or inclined to be biased, that is, in the unjust complaints about the policies on minorities implemented by Latvia and Estonia.
This is absurd, since the attitude towards minorities in Latvia is no less accommodating than attitudes in other countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, taking into account these repeated open, unjustified and uninterrupted attacks on the two states who have suffered most of all from the totalitarian Soviet regime, I call upon you to understand and acknowledge, at last, that in different cases a solution to problems must be sought which is not standard but that a minorities policy must be created which is individually tailored to the circumstances of each particular state.
Thus, for instance, our colleague Tatjana Åœdanoka began with an attempt to include in all possible wordings of the resolution the issue of non-citizens that is peculiar to Latvia: she tried to highlight it and frighten Europe with Latviaâs over 400Â 000 non-citizens, and she created the situation that in many parts of the text of the reportâs conclusion various legal terms and such fundamentally separate concepts as ethnic minorities, immigrants, refugees, stateless persons and non-citizens, which are not one and the same, are nevertheless confused.
The result is a reduction in the reportâs objectivity and quality.
It is time to remember that the repression and destruction of the indigenous nations of the Baltic peoples, and the in-flows of economic migrants are the reasons why, during the occupation of Estonia and Latvia, the ethnic composition of the inhabitants of these states changed significantly, giving rise to a comparatively large number of non-citizens with foreign ideologies.
Latvia has been very fair, and the legislature has, for its part, given special rights to the persons who were settled there during the occupation period â rights to naturalise at any time.
The fact that many have not wished to do so should be viewed as the expression of their individual wishes, and not as a complaint against these countries.
Not just the number of citizens but also their loyalty, their respect for the country, its language and its values ought to be the criteria for gaining citizenship and consolidating society.
Exaggerations should be avoided, and it should be understood that, for example, in the case of Latvia a devalued granting of citizenship under the influence of external pressure would constitute discrimination against the indigenous nation, and its identity and the stateâs existence would be at serious risk.
Â Â  â Mr President, the protection of minorities should be not only one of the basic political criteria of Copenhagen for candidate countries, but also a dynamic indicator of democratisation and the consolidation of democratic institutions.
From this point of view, the European Union needs to be the strict judge and controller of the conduct of all candidate countries and it needs to do this without the selective sensibilities and calculations which are often dictated by interests and short-term political expediencies.
The issue of minorities should not be used to promote national interests or undermine other countries.
The philosophy of the escalation strategy, which uses religious and ethnic minorities as a battering ram, is a source of tension, conflict and the cultivation of mutual distrust which ultimately turns out to be to the detriment of the minorities themselves.
Minorities in Europe can play a bridging role for the purpose of cooperation and consolidating security.
The Moraes report endeavours to give a definition of ethnic minority by referring to the definition of the Council of Europe.
I believe, however, that what needs to be added to his report, especially in paragraph 7 on the definition, is a clear reference to the international treaties which regulate questions of religious and ethnic minorities.
An international treaty is a sound basis on which to protect the rights of minorities and a secure framework for overturning policies which exploit them for other purposes.
With this comment, I should like to congratulate Mr Moraes on the excellent report which he has presented to us and I believe that we should vote in favour of it tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that how we treat our minorities reflects the strength of our democracy.
It has to be said that no Member State is free from defects when it comes to giving substance to universal human rights.
Unity in diversity is not just a slogan.
It has to be put into effect because it is essential to human progress in our Member States and, I would argue, to the very survival of the European Union.
Mr Moraes has worked hard and produced a well-balanced and very good report.
In Ireland we have still not achieved the progress that we need to achieve in relation to womenâs equality, travellersâ and gay rights.
I know too that other Member States fall far short of granting full citizenship to minorities.
I know that this is a particularly sensitive issue in Latvia and Estonia.
However, this report does not seek to be censorious; it attempts to approach these problems in a spirit of solidarity and indeed of seeking help for all states to comply with European values.
I would urge all Members and political groups of this Parliament to support this.
I believe it is an excellent report.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your debate with interest.
I should like to touch upon just a few points, if I may.
I think it is really important to support and push through the implementation of European legislation in the individual Member States.
It is apparent that there is still much to do, and I want to state clearly that the Commission takes its role as guardian of the Treaty very seriously.
I would also like to emphasise the Year of Equal Opportunities, which will give us the chance to raise awareness of these complex and sensitive issues.
I should like to conclude by saying that I am convinced that the new strategy adopted by the Commission will provide a suitable framework for future anti-discrimination measures.
It is obvious that what is needed is a combination of all available tools, including legislation, and that it is absolutely necessary to focus in particular on those groups that have unfortunately not yet had the opportunity to participate fully in society and the economy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish once again to congratulate Mr Moraes on his report.
Thank you.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Gaubert on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the links between legal and illegal migration and integration of migrants (A6-0136/2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first of all I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have worked a great deal over the last few months to draft a comprehensive and consistent report on some very sensitive topics: my report relates to legal and illegal immigration and integration policies.
Since time immemorial, humans have emigrated to escape poverty or persecution, in search of happiness, in pursuit of a better future.
Today, with globalisation and the proliferation of transport options, migratory flows have become denser and more complex.
They are the result of a new aspiration for men and women throughout the world, to go to work in other countries, to benefit from other experiences.
They are also the result of inequalities that are present across the world, the result of poverty, the curse of too many regions in the world.
In the context of national elections, in some Member States, immigration is a recurring theme in electoral campaigns.
Some countries decide to seal their borders and adopt tough measures, while others regularise thousands of illegal immigrants.
The European Union seems to be divided in relation to the issue of immigration.
It is true that each Member State has the right to decide how many immigrants it intends to accept, but Europe no longer has internal borders.
As a consequence, any national measure has significant direct repercussions on the other Member States.
It is therefore now essential for the Member States to organise themselves at European level.
The solution to many of the problems they face must be both European and national.
Certain political parties systematically make use of election periods to draw prejudicial parallels between insecurity, terrorism and immigration, fostering in our fellow citizens a fear of immigrants and foreigners.
This is, of course, unacceptable.
It is vital, firstly, to provide objective, transparent and regular information on immigration policy and, secondly, to launch information campaigns aimed at the population, in order to change peopleâs perceptions of immigrants as criminals.
In my report, I wanted to take a responsible, balanced, comprehensive approach.
Responsible, because we need to deal with these subjects with a greater sense of responsibility: we must not forget that we are dealing with men and women, not with goods!
I also wanted to take a balanced approach: the Member States must not base their policies either entirely on security considerations or entirely on a spirit of liberalism.
We therefore need to transcend national differences and take the heat out of the debate in order to develop a humane and effective European immigration policy.
Finally, I wanted a comprehensive approach to increase consistency and effectiveness.
I would like to deal with a number of aspects that I have discussed in my report.
Firstly, the need for an active policy of co-development to combat the basic causes of immigration.
Secondly, combating illegal immigration by means of stricter controls at our external borders, dismantling human trafficking networks, harsher penalties, very harsh, for businesses that use clandestine workers.
Thirdly, legal immigration: if the EU needs to open its borders to legal immigrants in response to the predicted decline in the active population, it must do so in an organised, concerted way.
Finally, policy on the integration of immigrants: admission and integration policies are inseparable.
The Member States must implement more proactive policies.
For their part, immigrants must understand and respect the fundamental values of the host country: learning the language, civic education courses and better integration into the labour market are some of the important elements of this.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think that immigration is a good thing for the country of origin, for the host country and for the immigrants themselves when it is controlled and co-managed.
That is the principle of win-win immigration, controlled and managed jointly.
Neither welcoming all comers nor setting as an objective the myth of zero immigration is a realistic or particularly responsible position.
Each State must accept immigrants depending on its integration capability, its own interests and those of the country of origin.
The subject of immigration is too sensitive, sometimes too tragic, to continue to make it the subject of political sparring matches.
One vision must prevail when we discuss it: where are people in all this?
Of course, we have to be realistic, but we must also take into consideration the undeniable human brotherhood and the solidarity that it entails.
Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament must give a strong and unified signal to the Council and to the citizens of Europe so that rapid progress can be made in immigration and integration policies.
I therefore hope that this report will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first of all I congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Gaubert, on his report, which I feel is extremely balanced and well-structured.
I believe that it makes an excellent contribution to a European immigration policy, highlighting, on the one hand, the added value of Europe, and, on the other, the importance of close cooperation with third countries.
I will express a number of opinions on the main points in the report.
Firstly, with regard to establishing an early warning system, the Commission strongly supports this idea and is drafting a proposal.
By summer, it intends to put forward a proposal for a Council decision on the development of a preliminary consultation procedure among the Member States for the adoption of measures in the area of asylum and immigration.
Secondly, with regard to the connection between immigration and development policies, the Commission intends to present a draft communication, again by this summer, in order to develop practical ideas and proposals linking European migration policy with cooperation in the area of development.
In this context, particularly sensitive subject-matter will without doubt be examined, such as the so-called âbrain drainâ, which is also an extremely delicate issue for the countries from which the flows of highly-qualified workers originate.
With regard to measures against illegal immigration, moreover, the Commission obviously agrees with the rapporteurâs approach: our action is directed against any kind of trafficking in human beings, in which illegal immigrants are clearly only victims.
We are examining proposals for common rules for the dissemination of best practice, with a view to tackling the trafficking in human beings more effectively, by possibly aiming for greater involvement from third countries and promoting closer cooperation between the third countries themselves and the Member States in order to protect maritime borders.
The European immigrant-return policy also deserves much attention.
The Hague Programme expressly stipulates the need for European common rules on this matter.
In all likelihood before September, the Commission intends to present a proposal for a directive incorporating common, transparent rules â which we will obviously examine together â on the immigrant-return policy, which will take full account of the need to respect the fundamental rights of every man and woman.
When discussing fundamental rights, I do not believe that any distinction can be made between a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant: the fundamental right of respect for human dignity applies indiscriminately to legal and illegal immigrants alike.
We now come to the important subject of legal migration for economic reasons: we are collecting a large number of proposals on the Green Paper issued by the Commission in January, with which you are all familiar.
A public hearing will take place on 14 June, and on the basis of the outcome of that extensive consultation we will prepare a proposal before the end of the year.
The proposal â as I have already had cause to confirm in this House â will precisely be the product of a large-scale European debate.
Another particularly important matter concerns the recruitment â and the facilitation of recruitment â of seasonal workers and workers employed on a temporary basis.
The importance of economic migration is widely recognised: it can be said that, thanks to a genuine European economic migration policy, immigration can represent an opportunity for Europe and its labour market.
In some sectors it is even reported that there is a need for certain professionals that cannot be fulfilled by the supply of European workers.
As the rapporteur also points out, economic migration is without doubt an extremely sensitive subject for the Member States.
I note with great satisfaction, however, that the European public debate on the Green Paper has in some way eased the reluctance of the Member States, which, in certain cases, absolutely refused in principle to tackle the issue of legal migration at European level, and which have now realised that only a policy of this type can bring about real added value.
Finally, I would like to expand on the two extremely important topics of integration and the protection of immigrants.
With regard to the first, you are all aware that the proposal that was drafted by myself and approved by the Commission gives particular prominence to integration.
In my opinion, integration is an essential part of the European immigration policy.
In the second half of 2005, I intend to present a communication on establishing a coherent European framework of integration policies.
I am well aware that integration is essentially a national issue, that is to say, that it is incumbent on the Member States to take responsibility for the actual integration policies, but I believe that Europe must not stop encouraging the Member States and intervening to assist them in their integration policies.
I believe that without integration, which requires education and access to social services, it is unlikely that we will have a genuinely effective European immigration policy.
On this point, I call for Parliamentâs vigorous support in order to overcome the difficulties that some Member States still have with the idea of tackling the issue of integration partly through European, and not exclusively national, action.
I say this because later in the year we will discuss the Commissionâs proposal regarding a European fund for supplementing, but not replacing, national policies on integration.
I have referred to the protection of immigrants because two aspects are involved.
The first is the need to obtain reliable data and statistics on immigration.
The Commission intends to present a proposal for a regulation laying down the criteria for obtaining statistical data that in many cases we do not currently have, making it extremely difficult to outline a European policy.
The protection of immigrants will have to be aimed primarily at the innocent victims of the traffic in human beings, organised by criminal gangs: I am referring in particular to women and children.
With regard to these two categories of particularly vulnerable victims of the traffic in human beings â as I have mentioned on other occasions, including in this House â the Commission will present specific protection and safeguard proposals, in order to stamp out trafficking in human beings, on the one hand, and to protect the victims, on the other.
MrÂ President, I will conclude by confirming my personal satisfaction with MrÂ Gaubertâs report, which demonstrates how important Parliamentâs contribution can be.
With regard to the subject-matter in question, Parliament has adopted a stronger and more incisive political approach than in the past.
On this matter, I believe that Parliament will be able to be of very great assistance to the policies of the Commission, which will obviously take account of the voice of Parliament.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who have put a great deal of effort into this report, because we have reached a turning point in European immigration policy.
We want to send a clear signal in favour of a fair and equitable European immigration policy.
A common European immigration policy is necessary so that people arriving in Europe can be welcomed in a dignified and organised manner.
This policy must take account of the needs and rights of the immigrants.
That is why a common immigration policy cannot be envisaged without an active integration policy.
I am delighted, in this regard, that we are finally discussing the creation of legal routes for immigration into Europe.
However, I would take the liberty of warning that we do not want to take this debate in the wrong direction.
Above all, legal immigration must make it possible to respond to the needs of everybody, primarily the immigrants.
Under no circumstances must we reduce our considerations simply to the need for workers on the European labour market
European immigration policy must be comprehensive, and not sectoral.
That is why we must take into account our relations with third countries.
However, the discussion must be based on true dialogue and exchange.
It would be unacceptable for us to reject our responsibilities with regard to managing migratory flows in third countries.
Clauses on migratory flows and readmission agreements are not necessarily included in all the association agreements that the European Union concludes.
I would like to add, finally, that immigration policy and integration policy cannot be separated.
I call on the Member States to make it possible to implement minimum criteria for integration in Europe.
These criteria should relate in particular to proper integration into the labour market, the right to training, access to education, access to social and health services and the integration of immigrants into social, political and cultural life.
Â Â  . I should like to join with those who have congratulated the rapporteur on pulling off what was not a very easy job.
Sometimes we have a rather schizophrenic attitude to immigration.
On the one hand we continuously stress the need for more economic integration, while at the same time we further tighten the rules on immigration.
The result is illegal immigration, human trafficking and abuse of asylum policies.
We have shameful scenes in Europe of misery, poverty, and even of people drowning on our shores. That is unacceptable.
We need to accept that Europe has become an immigration continent.
We should actually be welcoming immigrants, people who are trying to improve their lot.
Those people are not criminals, they are showing initiative.
People like that have built the United States.
They are dynamic and strong and we need them.
These people are trying to improve their lives and that is not a crime.
We need proper European immigration policies with real possibilities for legal immigration.
At the same time we need integration policies.
Immigrants should be fully included in the community.
They should be enabled to participate fully in social, cultural and political life, whether by actual voting rights or mechanisms for representation.
My Group is very happy to support the report as it stands.
It is balanced and will give the necessary support to the European Commission in setting up its policies.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur most warmly on behalf of my group for this outstanding report, which rightly stresses the need for a European policy on immigration, an issue that must not be left, within Europe, solely to the Member States and their occasionally counter-productive self-interest.
In the area of illegal immigration, too, the report calls for greater cooperation between the Member States, and for the sharing of models of best practice to include the sphere of integration.
Discussing mass regularisations, the report argues that regularisation should remain a one-off event.
There are, however, countries in the European Union that have never known one-off mass regularisations of this kind, my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, being one of them.
As you can see, there is still much to be done in Europe.
This report calls on Member States to give their neighbours and other EU Member States early warning, and we have tabled an amendment to paragraph 29 to make explicit reference to the need for information on the introduction of restrictive immigration measures to be exchanged and notified within the European Union, in other words not just such measures as mass regularisations, but also the opposite: if restrictive action is taken, that information should be shared within Europe.
Finally, the report expresses concern about Member Statesâ tendency to establish âpreliminary reception centresâ in non-EU states; there has been frequent enough reference in the press to Libya as an example of a countryâs inability to guarantee minimal standards for refugees.
Turning to legal migration, the report stresses that, although this remains a matter for the nation states, these are less and less able to resolve the numerous problems without help from elsewhere.
These have to do not only with the management of migration, but also with immigrantsâ right to integration, and so we have also brought in an amendment to paragraph 51, calling, among other things, for local voting rights and participation.
I also want to say how glad I am that this report makes explicit reference to honour killings, an issue that needs to be addressed.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank MrÂ Gaubert, who has worked in committee to draw up this report, which in my opinion raises three important points for tackling the issues involved.
The first point is to increase the legal immigration channels; the second point calls on us to act on the causes of immigration and not to respond with repression, criminalisation and rejection; the third point demonstrates that the economic approach may not be the only one in the area of immigration.
I believe that the Gaubert report must contribute to the drafting of the Green Paper.
I believe, moreover, that it is necessary to try to adopt the proposals put forward by our group, in particular with regard to residence permits for job seekers, the rejection of the Community priority â because there can be no difference in job seeking between citizens of the European Union and citizens of third countries â and, finally, the right to actively participate in political life and in elections.
I will conclude by expressing a concern: Parliament is carrying out interesting work on immigration whilst the Justice and Home Affairs Council has recently approved closer cooperation for managing migratory flows with Libya, which has now become a privileged partner of ours in the area of immigration even though it continues to offer no guarantees with regard to respect for human rights and safeguarding the right to asylum.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have heard a number of references this evening to a common European immigration policy.
I can assure you all that the British people do not want a common European immigration policy.
In the recent British general election, all the large pro-EU parties made impossible promises about containing immigration.
Their pledges were incompatible with EU membership.
The Commission itself said so with regard to the Conservative Partyâs asylum proposals.
But it is internal EU immigration that really demonstrates the futility of their promises.
Over 130 000 people from Eastern European countries entered the UK between May and December 2004: ten times the maximum official predictions.
We bear no ill-will to the people of the new Member States. But go to London and observe its creaking housing, transport and health systems: it cannot cope with such a large and sudden increase in population.
Now Spain intends to grant legal status to up to 700 000 illegal immigrants.
These people will then be free to move to Britain if they wish.
Spainâs selfish and irresponsible act demonstrates how Britain can have no independent immigration policy inside the European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, immigration, integration and asylum are still taboo subjects, particularly in the old EU Member States.
Everybody attempts to dodge these issues, and this is undoubtedly why there has been no real follow-up to the 1999 Tampere Programme.
One of the reasons behind the ânoâ vote in the constitutional referendum in the Netherlands was the authoritiesâ failure to take the issue of immigration seriously.
I therefore welcome this debate as an opportunity to hold a frank exchange of views, even though I disagree with a great deal of what is said in the report, and even though I fear that this debate will be anything but frank.
Politicians are too cowardly to deal properly with the issues of immigration and integration.
It annoys me when people say that the EU is in favour of legal immigration but opposed to illegal immigration.
This is entirely hypocritical.
There is in fact no such thing as legal immigration, because in practice people can only immigrate illegally.
As few as 5Â 000 of the 50Â 000Â Poles working in Brussels live and work here legally.
The figures are even more striking in the case of non-EU citizens.
It annoys me to hear people declaring war on human traffickers, when we are in fact faced with a more pressing problem in the shape ofÂ the people arriving in Europe who are grateful to these traffickers for their services, which unfortunately come at a price.
We should call a spade a spade, and adopt common European legislation on immigration.
We should state in plain terms that for the most part there is no such thing as immigration into Europe, and that we believe Christians integrate better than Muslims.
The truth hurts, but it is preferable to lies, and we should rid ourselves of feelings of colonial guilt.
We should state the facts and our opinion of them quite openly, and wherever possible, we should provide assistance to the worldâs poorer peoples in their own countries, within the framework of intergovernmental programmes.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Gaubert on his excellent work dealing with a very complex and at the same time very necessary report.
It is complex because there are many factors to this problem which, unfortunately, has become an everyday problem ââ illegal immigration ââ and also combating it by means of legal mechanisms which respond to the legitimate hopes and desires of those who are seeking a better future in our territory.
It is necessary because the Union ââ and this Parliament in particular ââ must once and for all provide a clear response, a clear demonstration of our common commitment to resolve a problem which has been knocking on our door for too long without an appropriate response.
The promotion of legal migratory channels, the application of measures in favour of the proper integration of immigrants and, above all, the fight against illegal migratory flows, are the three axes upon which I believe the Unionâs strategy must be based.
Firstly, we must promote legal immigration by means of responsible policies, and I would stress the word responsible, since the most recent experience, in my country at least, is a clear demonstration of the opposite; ordered immigration within an open society, with stable and flexible mechanisms to provide lasting solutions.
We are talking about people, ladies and gentlemen, not figures.
Secondly, we must work for the full integration of immigrants, since that is the only way we can prevent rootlessness, marginalisation and the conflicts which, to an increasing degree and with greater frequency, are arising within our societies; an integration which has a dual meaning ââ for the society of destination and for the migrants themselves ââ but which, in any event, must be an integral and fundamental part of our common policy.
Finally, we must combat illegal immigration, clandestine immigration and mafias, that is to say human suffering in general, since, as I said before, we cannot forget that we are talking about people.
For these reasons, I would appeal for a common political commitment which leaves behind all demagoguery and all unilateral and irresponsible measures which, simply for the sake of an easy vote and without considering the consequences, could jeopardise the progress we have made and are continuing to make in this field.
Â Â  I do not think that I am a coward, but it was an honour and a pleasure for me to participate in the drafting of the report and I am pleased that it has won the support both of the Commission and of most of those who have spoken.
The question of immigration and integration of migrants has been the subject of decisions within the European institutions for a long time.
Tampere and The Hague gave particular prominence to this set of issues and to compliance with the Geneva Convention, and in late 2003 this Parliament approved an epoch-making resolution in the report by Claude Moraes.
The present draft â thanks to the sensitivity demonstrated by the rapporteur on this issue â treats illegal migration primarily as a security policy issue and analyses the dual nature of the determining factors of legal migration.
People arriving from third countries need to be able to live a decent human life.
Providing this is not just a human-rights obligation for EU Member States; it is also increasingly becoming sound economic sense.
This new approach to these issues is inevitable under the relaunched Lisbon process.
It is to the credit of the rapporteur that he analyses economic migration not in a laboratory context, imprisoned by papers, but on the basis of the current economic and social situation here and now.
Europe is ageing and additional sources of labour are declining; at the same time, meanwhile, unemployment and inactivity are high.
The lessons from the French and Dutch referenda also indicate that the citizens of the old Member States perceive the presence of workers from the new Member States in their labour markets as a threat and xenophobia accompanied the debate from start to finish.
Even facts are weak in the face of emotions, however.
Data from the German research institute DIW show a dynamic increase in the development of economies that did not impose restrictions on labour supply reinforcements arriving from the new Member States.
It thus makes economic sense, too, if workers from the new Members States are no longer kept in quarantine for six years and if they are not put in some intermediate, second place between workers from the old Member States and those from third countries.
It is to the credit of the rapporteur that the report avoids the temptation of opting for easy solutions, such as introducing a quota system or a sectoral basis for accepting immigrants.
It proposes means for preventing human and economic conflict, improving foreign affairs work and providing effective information.
It calls upon Member States to use appropriate statutory means to reduce the vulnerability of people making a living from atypical employment.
For all these reasons, as someone who has been involved in working on the report, I wholeheartedly commend the report to you for adoption.
Â Â  MrÂ President, how can we fail to respect these men and women who, fleeing poverty or dictatorship or war, are prepared to sacrifice everything to reach the European Union in the legitimate hope of a better life?
Zero immigration and fortress Europe are dangerous and reprehensible utopias.
Saying this, though, does not mean that we can just do anything.
The acceptance of immigrants needs to be organised and prepared.
In this matter, the EU must play its role, including by providing funding.
I share the reportâs hostility to the setting up of detention centres and to sifting immigrants within the EU or outside its borders.
I experienced this, sadly, with the notorious camp at Sangatte.
These centres do not solve anything, quite the contrary.
They feed tensions of all kinds.
I agree with the report where it puts forward as a principal aim decisively and mercilessly attacking the people smugglers.
The same pitiless suppression must be targeted at employers who exploit immigrants completely outside the law.
On the other hand, I regret the fact that the report presents EU immigration policy as an adjustment variable for the labour market and as a way of pushing down wages.
Good immigration policy involves a real will to support the sustainable development of emerging countries and not cynically viewing them as a democratic source of cheap labour for the needs of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the report being debated is a complex text which realistically assesses the problems and which lays down the guidelines for a common European immigration policy, both for legal and illegal immigration, and proposes not only repressive but also preventive measures for preventing and repressing immigration, such as supporting countries so that poverty can be combated, education can be reinforced and future immigrants can be helped in their own country.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality helped, with the opinion drafted by my honourable friend, Mrs Kratsa, to ensure that the question of the links between illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, and the need for access to legal and social protection for the victims is emphasised in the report.
The report, irrespective of whether immigration is legal or illegal, calls for the combating of discrimination and the application of programmes to integrate equal rights for men and women.
It is positive that, even with non-economic immigration, equal participation in education, training, work and family reunion is called for.
The report also stresses the need for the Member States to address the continuation in the host country of inhumane traditions which even result in crimes of honour against women.
It is also positive that attention is paid to the temporary and illegal nature of jobs taken by immigrants, which is something which affects women in particular.
In the sixth century B.C., the ancient Greek poet Archilogos described abandoning oneâs homeland and wandering abroad as one of the most unfortunate situations in which man can find himself.
The virtue which is in greatest danger, the poet stresses, is not prosperity or health but the dignity of the immigrant and his family.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gaubert, and the Commissioner, Mr Frattini, for the humane note which they have introduced both in the report and in the intervention by the Commissioner; I think that it is positive for Europe that policies are being shaped which will help to maintain and support the dignity and integrity of immigrants.
Â Â  â Mr President, the issue of immigration, both legal and illegal, is a huge issue with many aspects.
It is linked to the combating of racism and xenophobia, to asylum policy, to the integration of immigrants, to the possibility of their obtaining legal employment in host countries and, above all, to trafficking in human beings.
The European Commission has been addressing this issue since 1986, with the new Single European Act, and has issued a large number of directives and decisions.
I repeat, therefore, what I said this morning.
There is an urgent need for all these decisions and directives to be codified.
Without codification, we are floating in a sea of documents and decisions.
It has, however, been observed that the Member States either do not implement binding decisions or they are late transposing them into their national legislation.
This, however, undermines efforts to achieve a single European policy.
It would be an oversight on my part if I failed to express my warm congratulations to Mr Gaubert on his report.
This report takes a number of steps forward.
First of all, it calls on the European Commission to strengthen solidarity and common policies at the level of information and the coordination of all structures involved in migration-flow management.
However, more important is the highlighting in the report of the need for cooperation with countries of origin and through a proper information system with a view to identifying employment opportunities for persons wishing to migrate.
Of course, this cooperation must not reach the point referred to by short-lived Commissioner Buttiglione during his hearing because, God forbid that we should create reception centres â I would say camps â in the countries left by migrants.
It would be a crime which our society cannot accept.
Â Â  Mr President, it is true that legal and illegal immigration are linked, as this report rightly shows, but we can hardly address the issue of legal immigration effectively until and unless we achieve a measure of control on illegal immigration.
There are two major issues of very grave concern here.
The first is that illegal immigrants themselves are risking their lives, and indeed hundreds are losing their lives, turning the Mediterranean sea into a graveyard and putting us all to shame.
Even if they do reach Europe, whether in Malta or Italy, their ordeal is not yet over; indeed, it is just beginning.
The second grave concern is the significant toll that this problem is taking on the countries concerned, particularly on Malta and Italy.
In the case of Malta the situation is even more precarious because of sheer numbers.
Last week 56 immigrants landed in Malta, but 56 immigrants in Malta is proportionally equivalent to more than 5 600 immigrants landing in Italy.
That is the scale of the problem that Malta is facing.
This year we have reason to be optimistic because for the first time we are seeing the European Union finally responding to our repeated calls for action.
In particular, I want to refer to last weekâs decision of the Council of Ministers to embark immediately on cooperation with Libya to stem the flow of immigrants and to prevent more deaths, not least with the setting-up of a taskforce to patrol the Mediterranean Sea.
So finally the European Union is starting to move.
Let us hope that it moves in time.
I am very grateful to Commissioner Frattini for his very genuine efforts, and on behalf of the people of Malta I would call upon him to act decisively and urgently.
We are counting on you, Commissioner, to address our very serious concerns.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would just like to express my thanks to all those who have spoken.
I can confirm that the work of the Commission will continue in the spirit that is also shared by this Parliament: a European approach that can combine firm action against the traffic in human beings and illegal immigration with strong action in the area of solidarity.
Europeâs values are values of solidarity and respect for the fundamental rights of every man and woman.
It is from balancing these two requirements that the added value of Europe can result, even in the sensitive area of migration policies.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on controls of cash entering or leaving the Community (14843/1/2004 C6-0038/2005 2002/0132(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Peillon) (A6-0167/2005).
Â Â  . First of all I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Peillon, for his clear analysis of the common position of the Council and the conclusions he draws from it.
I am very pleased to note that his report shares the view of the Commission that the Union urgently needs a common, effective and balanced approach to the monitoring of large-scale cross-border cash movements.
I also share Mr Peillonâs view that you are now being presented with a proposal which is clearer and more practical than its predecessor.
I believe that the adoption of this proposal will provide the Community with a solid measure to enable customs to control significant amounts of cash entering or leaving the Community.
Member Statesâ experience shows that cash is being used to avoid controls on transfers by the financial institutions.
Cash movements are also an easy means of moving terrorist funding.
Criminals are helped by the fact that we have varying levels of national controls to check suspect cash movements.
We therefore need these measures to complement the existing money laundering controls to remove the possibility for criminals and terrorists to use this gap in controls.
The proposal sets out a control mechanism and reporting rules, which require anyone entering or leaving the Community with more than EUR 10 000 in cash to declare the sums carried to customs.
Failure to declare or the provision of false information will require Member States to verify the bona fides of the movement and take further action as necessary.
The proposal also sets out a reporting mechanism to ensure that information obtained is handled and exchanged efficiently and with due care.
In addition, this proposal will also help the legitimate traveller by replacing the existing wide range of national approaches with a clear, simple and straightforward Community system.
I therefore believe that the proposal you have before you today will close existing loopholes and reinforce our actions to combat terrorism and organised crime.
The straightforward system proposed means that this will be done without placing an undue burden on the traveller or the national administrations concerned.
I accordingly look forward to your support for its adoption as soon as possible.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, illegal or clandestine immigration does not only involve people.
It also involves capital and cash, which is worrying for European democracy because there is a link between this money entering and leaving illegally and various types of trafficking: people trafficking, which was discussed in the previous debate, organ trafficking, drug trafficking, and also, of course, terrorism, Commissioner, not forgetting all kinds of transnational crime, which are a concern both for the European Union and for the international community.
In this context, the Councilâs common position and Parliamentâs recommendation for this second reading are moving in an essentially constructive direction.
This discussion started three years ago.
Parliament had already had the opportunity to express its opinion during the previous Parliamentary term and I think, like you, that the new proposal adopted by a qualified majority of the Council has simplified and enriched the text.
It is for that reason, moreover, that MEPs supported it and our fervent wish now is, of course, that this text should now be adopted as soon as possible.
Indeed, this is a subject for which, in the end, the major, widely shared preoccupation must be the effective implementation of the text, in addition to the text itself.
I think that the text as presented today should provide the legal instrument needed, in particular, by customs officials responsible for these inspections.
I also think that, with the elements and amendments introduced by Parliament, we now have guarantees regarding respect for human rights and the protection of personal data.
That is also why I am not especially concerned.
To conclude, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for the constructive attitude they demonstrated during our various meetings and, with the rapporteurs of the other groups with whom I worked, I hope -Â and I am optimisticÂ - that, tomorrow, Parliament will adopt this resolution unanimously.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report calls for tight controls on the reporting of cash entering or leaving the European Union Member States.
It is introduced under the convenient guise of the prevention of organised crime, terrorism and money laundering, but what is its real motivation?
An obligation to declare or disclose cash movements could easily be changed to impose an actual limit on the movement of money out of the European Union.
Yesterday in this Chamber I spoke of the certainty of the eventual failure of the European single currency.
It is obvious that the proposals in this report anticipate a future crisis of confidence in the euro.
When that happens the European Commission and European Central Bank will want to prevent the movement of money out of the eurozone.
To include Britain in these restrictive measures is to couple insult with injury.
It is yet another reason, if one were needed, for Britainâs unconditional withdrawal from the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, before I start my closing remarks I should like to respond to the remark by Mr Batten.
I should like to draw his attention to the fact that, as far as the Commission and the Council are concerned, we are absolutely certain that the European Parliament had no intention other than to control cash flows in order to combat terrorism and organised crime.
I should like to comment briefly on the three amendments proposed by the rapporteur.
The Commission fully understands the rapporteurâs desire to ensure that full and proper attention is paid to the data protection issues.
That certainly deserves underlining at a time when a range of strong enforcement measures are on the table.
The Commission considers that the three amendments proposed do not restrict or enlarge the scope of the existing data protection provisions but instead focus attention on the need to apply them appropriately when dealing with travellers carrying large sums of cash.
The Commission considers that drawing attention to this requirement is positive and would accordingly accept the three amendments tabled.
Given the Councilâs acceptance of these amendments, I consider that Mr Peillonâs report provides us with a real opportunity to bring the lengthy examination of this proposal to a successful conclusion.
I would hope that you can confirm your support during the vote on this proposal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  This regulation is just one of the many legal foundations offering a basis for an effective fight against terrorism.
Terrorism is the metastasis of modern society.
It is a phenomenon that cannot be controlled by one single measure, but demands a wide range of activities from the Member States and the EU as a whole.
Although at first glance this regulation will not bring with it any major demands or changes in terms of border controls, it is nevertheless an important piece in the mosaic of measures against terrorism.
We must be aware that the numerous security measures on the borders and within the borders of the EU can make a significant contribution to a higher level of security and protection against terrorist acts.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peillon, for his level of preparedness and cooperation, and for seeking out the best path.
I think that this report reflects a good compromise and I support it entirely.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Rosati on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/12/EEC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (A6-0138/2005).
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, today we are debating the proposal for a Council directive amending Articles 7, 8, 9 and 10 of DirectiveÂ 92/12/EEC.
I would remind the House that this Directive sets out general rules for the movement and holding of products that are subject to excise duty.
The latter include mainly alcohol and tobacco products, but also liquid fuels.
I would further note that ArticleÂ 27 of the 1992 Directive imposed upon the Commission the duty of submitting a report to the Council on the impact and implementation of Articles 7, 8, 9 and 10 for the period up to 1997.
For various reasons outlined by the Commission, the report on the implementation of these articles is only being debated today, after a delay of several years.
I would remind the House that ArticleÂ 7 relates to the movement of products subject to excise duty by businesses for commercial purposes, ArticleÂ 8 deals with the movement of products subject to excise duty by private individuals for their own use and ArticleÂ 9 identifies the threshold at which excise duty becomes chargeable, as well as providing guide levels intended to help establish whether products which have been transported and which are subject to excise duty are intended for commercial or personal use.
Finally, ArticleÂ 10 gives details of the arrangements for charging excise duty and the country in which it is chargeable, as well as outlining the duties of tax representatives and the conditions of distance sales.
A great many doubts have been expressed regarding the provisions of these articles and their practical implementation, not only by private individuals, travellers and tourists, but also by businesses whose professional activities involve trade in and the movement of excisable products.
This was the reason behind the Commissionâs decision to propose a number of amendments to these four articles, and its primary aim was to comply with two basic principles.
Firstly, the Commission wished to ensure consistency in the implementation of one of the principles of the single market.
I refer to the fact that excise duty on products moved for commercial purposes is to be paid in the country of destination, whereas excise duty on products moved by individuals who have purchased the products for their own use is to be levied in the country of origin.
The main aim of the Commissionâs proposed amendments to ArticleÂ 7 is therefore to define movement for commercial purposes.
According to the definition given, movement for commercial purposes is considered to be any movement other than that for personal use.
The other amendments to ArticleÂ 7 serve to simplify the language and to incorporate more accurate terminology.
Finally, the Commission has also proposed that ArticleÂ 7 should include a clear indication of the person from whom excise duty is due.
One of the Commissionâs amendments to ArticleÂ 8 is of crucial importance.
I refer to its proposal to remove the need for private individuals to transport products themselves in order to purchase the products in question.
Instead, it will be possible for such individuals to place distance orders for products subject to excise duty, and to have them delivered to their place of residence.
This also applies to what are known as gifts.
It amounts to the introduction of a new principle, whereby movement of products for personal use is permitted not only when the products are transported by the individual in question, but also when they are transported by someone else on his behalf and at his expense.
The Commission is also proposing an important amendment to ArticleÂ 9, namely that the quantitative limits, which to date have not been used as intended, should be abolished.
Finally, the Commission is again proposing to amend ArticleÂ 10 in such a way as to simplify the procedure.
Your rapporteur is of the opinion that any amendments to EU tax legislation should meet the following four criteria.
Firstly, such amendments should reflect the thinking behind the single market, or in other words prevent discrimination.
Secondly, they should be simple and transparent, so that they can be easily implemented.
Thirdly, they should not cause any major disruption to the tax revenues of individual countries.
Fourthly, they should also comply with health standards, provided that the individual Member States have relevant policies in place.
Your rapporteur believes that the Commissionâs proposals are a step in the right direction in that they meet these criteria, and I therefore support all of its amendments.
Parliamentâs amendments primarily involve linguistic changes and improvements to the wording of individual provisions, as well as the incorporation of more accurate terminology.
The House has also proposed that, when implementing these provisions, it should be the government authorities of the individual Member States that bear the burden of proof as to whether products are intended for commercial use.
Under the current rules, it has all too often been the case that this burden has fallen on travellers, which we believe runs counter to the principles of the common market.
Without exception, the amendments we have made serve merely to improve the text and to provide what could be regarded as additional explanations.
We support all the Commissionâs amendments.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Rosati, for his very clear and accurate analysis of the Commission proposal.
I am very pleased to note that this report strongly supports the proposal of the Commission, the aim of which is to improve the functioning of the internal market in this area, both for citizens and for trade.
The proposal concerns the so-called âduty paid movementsâ of excise products between Member States.
While it is true that this type of intra-Community movement represents only a small proportion of the total intra-Community movements of excisable products, it must nevertheless be stressed that they mainly involve the European citizens and small and medium-sized companies.
For the European citizens the proposal aims to clarify the existing rules on the movement of goods from one Member State to another.
Indeed, from the number of questions that the Commission receives daily on this issue, it clearly appears that the present rules, including the value of the âindicative limitsâ, cause some confusion.
The proposal provides clarification on this issue and also enhances the possibilities for citizens to purchase duty-paid goods in the Member States of their choice, without having to declare those goods and pay duty on them in their own Member State.
That will better align the system to the principles of a real internal market.
For goods moved for commercial purposes, the Commission proposes to maintain the basic principle that excise duty is payable in the Member State of destination, but to harmonise and simplify the procedures to be followed in that Member State.
That will especially benefit small and medium-sized companies such as small wine traders who try to commercialise their products directly in other Member States.
Today, the complex rules, which differ considerably between Member States, often deter those companies from doing business in other Member States.
Having regard to the importance of these issues for both citizens and traders, I hope that the positive tone of the report on the table today will be reflected in the vote tomorrow.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, a large majority of my group should approve MrÂ Rosatiâs report.
I will not pretend, however, that the text voted for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs does not bring up a considerable number of difficulties.
The expression of divergent interests has resulted in a rather shaky overall construction that contains certain inconsistencies, or even contradictions.
Once again, we have seen how sensitive tax matters still are in the European Union.
That is why it would be desirable for us to deal with them in strict compliance with the principles that we constantly preach.
The aim of the Commissionâs proposal is to move towards the creation of the internal market, to promote the free movement of goods subject to excise duty and, finally, to respond to consumers by enabling them to make their purchases where they see fit.
Under these conditions, I am surprised at the proposals of some of my fellow Members which would lead to a situation contrary to this logic, even returning to the situation that existed prior to 1993.
All of that is surprising and even worrying, but let us return to issues of principle.
The logic of the internal market very clearly requires the end consumer to pay excise duty in the Member State of acquisition for products intended for private consumption.
The existence of indicative limits laying down the maximum quantity of goods that can be transported from one Member State to another has become too rigid an obstacle, which has led the Commission to propose that it should be scrapped.
That is a good suggestion, which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has unfortunately only followed partially, as it agrees in principle to the abolition of the limits, but refers, in an amendment, to those same limits as if they still existed.
Another example of inconsistency is that consumers will in future no longer be obliged to transport the products themselves to benefit from the rule of paying excise duty in the country of acquisition.
This, too, represents considerable progress.
For distance sales, in contrast, it is the rule of the destination country that will continue to apply.
The problem is that the dividing line between the two cases is not always clear and that the differences in their treatment will, I am sure, lead to a number of practical difficulties.
These considerations led me to propose some amendments that aim to remove the distinction between on-site sales and distance sales, but the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go with me.
I withdrew, because I was told that people were not ready and that it would involve a revolution.
Nevertheless, it would simply be a case of sticking to the logic of the internal market.
When European integration is proving to be an extremely complicated businessÂ âÂ which is the situation we are now inÂ â we cannot continue to encourage these inconsistencies because the citizens of Europe will judge them very harshly.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the review of the current legislative framework is considered unavoidable, because we need to give European citizens and businesses clear, simplified laws.
Within the framework of this endeavour, I should like to emphasise two points which I consider could play a decisive role.
Firstly, the present proposal for a directive deletes the reference to guide levels.
These levels currently operate as single quantitative criteria for the national administrations of the Member States, when they are called on during the importation of products subject to excise to assess if products are or are not being held for commercial purposes.
The abolition of guide levels will allow the national administrations to each adopt and apply their own criteria for assessing if products are or are not being held for commercial purposes.
I consider that this is not in keeping with the principles of the internal market; on the contrary, it is a step backwards and a trend towards renationalisation.
Maintaining guide levels or, where considered expedient, making provision for a study assessing the existing levels or their replacement with new guide levels, would in my view be the proper way forward.
Secondly, in order to harmonise national legislation and complete the internal market in all sectors, the present proposal for a directive will need to be considered as a transitional stage.
The final objective will need to be appropriate preparation of national legislation and the internal market, in order to make it possible to harmonise the excise rates imposed by each Member State. This is also dictated by the freedom of the markets which governs the internal market.
I should like, however, to emphasise that the present directive does a great deal to improve the current system.
In particular, the proposed provisions for improving the definitions of problematic concepts, such as commercial purpose, for including the definition of gifts in products on which excise is paid in the Member State of destination, for distance sales and, finally, for simplifying mechanisms, help in my view to resolve the current difficulties.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rosati, on the integrated proposal which he has submitted on this matter and I think that the House should vote in favour of his report tomorrow.
Â Â  . The impression is that this perhaps technical question, which we are considering tonight, is in fact related to the problem of governmental policy.
How can we combine state control with elements of a free market so as to create optimal conditions for economic development?
Obviously, there is no simple answer; however, the experience of economic reforms implemented by us, the new members, is solid proof that the best results may be achieved when the problem is tackled in an integrated manner.
I welcome the Commissionâs proposal to repeal the indicative qualitative restrictions that are currently used by customs officers of the countries to determine the quantity of excise goods, as designated for personal use, which is permissible for importation, because such a procedure was contradictory to the essential requirements for the functioning of the common market.
Indeed, how can we speak about the common market where individuals cannot import goods for their personal use?
However, we should not forget the problems related to that matter.
First of all, the border countries, the Eastern border countries in particular, may face a rise in the flow of smuggled goods because the prices of spirits are much lower, both in Russia and Belarus, and the decision to fight against smuggling should not only focus on the strengthening of border protection.
I urge the Commission to consider the necessity to reach agreements with neighbouring Eastern states so as to invite them to cooperate in our fight against smuggling.
The other problem we will encounter is the emergence of a small layer of merchants who will carry spirits from one country to another, for example, from Estonia where the excise duty is low, to Finland where the rate of the excise duty, and, respectively, the prices, are higher.
The solution to this problem can hardly be found without an integrated approach towards the development of border regions and the creation of new jobs, so as to provide those people with an opportunity to earn their living in another way.
Thus, the economic measures that may contribute to the prevention of negative consequences are always available.
Moreover, scientists have proved that the creation of a common market offers many more advantages; that is, GDP per capita in the European Union is higher by 20 percent owing to the presence of the common market.
Hence, the advantages outweigh some problems that will emerge as the provisions of this decision are applied.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the current minimum tax level for alcoholic drinks may be as low as zero, but other countries have chosen a higher tax level, mainly for health reasons.
Through unfair tax competition, unlimited movement imposes, in principle, upon all countries the policy applied by the Member State with the lowest tax.
That would be the effect if we were to use the term âpersonal useâ without a time limitation.
Because many alcoholic drinks may be stored for a lifetime, anyone can maintain that a lorry-load of such drinks is for personal use for the next 40 years, an option that would allow smugglers to go free.
With a 120-day principle, account could be taken of, for example, birthday parties and of differences in levels of consumption between one country and another, but there would still be a legal reference to what might be regarded as reasonable in terms of personal use.
Voting down this amendment would, in practice, amount to a ban on all EU countries taking any measure whatsoever to combat tobacco and alcohol consumption for health reasons.
That can scarcely be the intention of this House, because it would be in conflict with ArticleÂ 30 of the Treaty.
Â Â  Mr President, in his English Dictionary of 1755 Samuel Johnson defined excise as âa hateful taxâ, and this tax and the way it is policed have become a hate object also for my Scottish constituents.
They call me in tears to describe having their cars dismantled and their children terrified by customs officers.
Okay, they are told, you can appeal to the courts â except that they cannot afford the courts against the customsâ bottomless pockets, and the burden of proof falls on them.
And what good do these exaggerated excise taxes do?
They victimise honest retailers who cannot compete with personal purchases abroad, and the much more serious smuggling by organised crime which these taxes promote.
They actually reduce overall tax revenue.
And then there is the cost of all those extra customs inspectors.
And health.
Do excise taxes really discourage smoking and drinking?
No!
Because the high level of personally imported and smuggled cigarettes and alcohol means that the actual cost of smoking and drinking is cheaper.
Excise is not only hateful, it is also pointless, and high rates of excise tax which are out of line with those in other countries are even more pointless.
All they do is distort shopping patterns absurdly and provide fertile ground for organised crime to flourish.
You, Mr Commissioner, are responsible for ensuring that the single European market functions properly, with free movement of goods and people; and clearly it does not function where there are large disparities in rates of excise duty.
I, we, accept the concept of tax competition.
Competition exists in income and corporate taxes, and rightly so.
Why not also with excise?
Perhaps it is time to abandon excise tax altogether and turn to value added tax as the only consumption tax.
Â Â  I agree that the amendments should include proposals to facilitate the movement of goods subject to excise duty, with a view to completing the internal market.
I also support the fact that they place the burden of proof firmly on state authorities.
I also consider it to be a step forward, that the present draft European Parliament resolution includes the quantitative guide levels for cross-border movements of goods subject to excise duty.
The Union is not only deepening, however, it is also expanding.
This means that differences in income and prices among the Member States will increase considerably for quite some time.
On the EUâs eastern borders in particular, for example in Hungaryâs neighbour Romania, it will be a long time before prices and incomes can jump to the level of those in higher-income neighbouring countries.
Or, if they go ahead and raise them anyway, by means of administratively-set pricing and determining excise duty, then the share of illegal goods in circulation will be considerable.
The obvious and catastrophic consequence of this would be movements of goods that are in fact intended for commercial purposes, but are declared as goods for private use when crossing national borders.
The outcome of this would be the organised movement of goods under the carelessly applied slogan of internal market deepening.
In Hungary, for example, not only would this mean a loss of government excise revenue; it would also harm the retail trade and producers of goods subject to excise duty in general.
My second comment relating to the report is, that it is difficult to square competition and the reduction of indirect taxation with the goal of increasing the role of indirect modes of taxation vis-Ã -vis direct taxation in the interests of enhancing our competitiveness.
In my opinion, one of the lessons to be learned from the shock of last weekâs referenda is that EU enlargement not only has long-term, beautiful, ideal effects; it also has immediate consequences for the real economy that can even be negative in the short term.
It is unfair that our immediate neighbours should be made to bear these negative consequences alone, under the pretext of the omnipotence of the internal market.
In cases where there are significant income and price differences, a transitional period should certainly be allowed, during which â even beyond 2009 as stipulated in the Accession Treaties in cases of proven necessity â more prosperous neighbouring countries can protect their internal market by keeping administratively set thresholds in place and continuing to monitor these thresholds.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to make some comments on the amendments tabled.
A number of the amendments modify or add recitals in order to emphasise the need to create an internal market for excise products also.
I can assure you that is the very purpose of the Commission proposal.
I feel that is already properly reflected in the recitals.
As to the amendment requesting that the Commission review and assess the âindicative limitsâ, I can only say that the Commission has assessed them in its report.
That was the basis for its proposal and it has come to the conclusion that they should no longer appear in EU legislation.
For this reason, and as the amendment proposed does not reinsert such indicative limits in the directive either, I do not see the need for the Commission to table another report on this issue.
Lastly, as regards the burden of proof that goods are for private use, the amendment in question seems to place that burden entirely on the administration.
The Commission approach on this is somewhat different and would seem to be more neutral.
It is for the citizen to provide any explanation or proof concerning the purpose of his transporting the goods in question. It is for the administration to decide on the basis of those elements.
As such a decision can always be contested, it should be based on firm grounds.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that this debate does no more and no less than to highlight the many things that still remain to be done if we are to see a real internal market in every area of our lives.
On the one hand, we need to liberalise, simplify, harmonise or develop minimum standards; on the other, there is of course the need for built-in safeguards, particularly where health is concerned.
We are engaged in progressively implementing both.
I say âyesâ to the internal market, and every effort made towards strengthening it is in the interests of growth and employment and benefits the consumer.
The second point is one that came across clearly in the debate: this is not a codecision procedure.
On every issue, this House must be consulted via the codecision procedure, and that includes issues of fiscal policy, and if we want to realise the internal market, we will have to give more attention to tax policy within the European Union.
I am in favour of tax competition, but every competition has its limits.
Even though excessively wide bands can result in gross distortions of competition, there is a need for action in tax policy too.
Thirdly, and in my capacity as chairman of the âsmall and medium-sized enterprisesâ intergroup, I welcome the greater clarity that this proposal affords the public, not to mention â although the Commissioner did so â the simplified procedures that make for greater clarity and make matters easier for SMEs, and hence also for traders.
Renewed efforts, though, are needed for we do not yet have an internal market, and so we have not yet heard the last of this proposal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by John Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on patient mobility and healthcare developments in the European Union (2004/2148(INI)) (A6-0129/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, it has been a delight to listen to âCommissionerâ Karas!
I am sure it is only a matter of time before we see him in that role.
Often colleagues are faced with the question on the doorstep of âwhat does Europe do for me?â.
This debate will help them to answer that question, at least in one respect: that this report and this measure are all about giving patients more rights and power over their own health and the right to go to another Member State for treatment if they face undue delay in their own country.
That gives great opportunities for patients; it also brings new headaches for the managers of health budgets.
I should like to thank my colleagues who have contributed to the debates we have had on this issue, not least in a hearing that we held in Parliament.
I should also like to thank the Commission.
I sympathise with the Commissioner who tonight is not too well, but I am sure that this measure will help to find a solution even to that and we will be able to find somewhere for him to travel to in order to find succour!
I thank him and his staff for the help they have given as we have discussed this issue.
I thank the many people outside Parliament and the Commission who have given their ideas, as we have sought them, on how we should proceed.
This measure starts from people. It does not start from the Commission, Parliament or governments.
It starts from people who look to Europe for a solution to their problem.
They took the issue to the European Court of Justice.
They challenged that court to give them mobility rights and the court did so.
It gave them the right, if they faced undue delay in their own country, to go to another country with certain criteria: that the cost was comparable to what they would have paid in their own country and that the treatment was common in their own country.
There were one or two other criteria as well.
However, the judgment was made.
A new opportunity had arisen.
There are many ways in which people who face delays in their own country can be helped.
Part of the solution has been the bilateral contracts that we have had between governments and health services. Part of it has been the Interreg system bringing together hospitals across the European Union.
I have seen this here in Strasbourg, which, as a city, is working with Lille and Luxembourg.
We have the E-111 and the new Euro-health card behind us.
However, the E-112 has not been part of the solution.
That form that was supposed to give people the opportunity to go for planned treatment abroad. That has been bureaucratic and obstructive and has to be changed.
We had the high-level reflection group, which looked at the issues, came up with some recommendations, but has gone for the long grass in terms of some of the issues.
We now need action, we need guidelines.
The patient who wants to use this opportunity needs to know whether his condition qualifies; he needs to know what forms to fill in; he needs to know where he can go; to which doctors and how he can check up on those doctors; if they are OK; can I get help with travel; can my family come and support me, particularly if there is a child involved; and what happens if something goes wrong.
Guidance for patients is fundamental and guidance is urgently needed.
Just as fundamental is guidance to doctors who will refer patients abroad, as is guidance to the health services and the insurance companies who will have unplanned expenditure and want to know how they will be reimbursed.
There are many issues that we need to look at: information to patients, the transfer of information on patients between countries, checks on doctors, the disciplinary procedures, the complaints procedures that will need to be behind all this, what happens to people who retire abroad to the sun, etc. Now we need certainty.
If we do nothing then the courts will go deciding.
The Watts case will be next.
But I believe that Parliaments, not lawyers, should decide policy.
I should like to conclude by sharing with you the words of Louis Pasteur, that I quoted in my explanatory statement: (Science recognises no borders because knowledge belongs to humanity and is the torch which illuminates the world.)
Let those words be our guide as we give clarity and confidence to our citizens who urgently need both from us.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Bowis is correct in that I have a bit of a nasty stomach problem today.
He is right: I am a mobile patient myself.
I am very interested in following the debate.
I wanted to be here personally because I consider this to be a very important issue, something that we all have to work on in the next few years.
The rapporteur is right that people are ahead of us in this respect.
Even though I am not feeling well today, I cannot think of a better place to be, with so many doctors around this evening for this discussion!
I feel confident enough in that respect.
I will listen very carefully to the debate and the comments that will be made by the honourable Members.
I am very happy that, based on the report, we are thinking along the same lines.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his work on, and the effort he has put into, this report.
I welcome it and the support it offers to the Commission for the work that we are trying to do on this issue.
There are some issues that we need to take further.
Judging by what we have included in our proposal for the new health programme, the terms of reference and the work done by the high-level group on health show that this is along the same lines as the proposal of the report.
The target has to be that a citizen can get the highest level of healthcare in his or her own country. That should be the rule.
Nevertheless, things change.
People such as myself travel because of business or because they have to wait a long time in their own country or because the specific treatment required is not offered in their country, or even more so, because they feel that they can get better care elsewhere.
That is a reality and something that we have to deal with.
It is not always possible, and that is why there is a need for legal certainty.
That is the very first requirement, with which I agree.
However, the reality is that people travel and we have to travel for health.
I heard about an interesting report today, which says that the Polish medical healthcare system has started receiving patients from Germany and the UK.
That is welcome in the sense that it will boost the budget of the healthcare system in Poland, provided that it is not at the cost of Polish patients.
That is very important.
We will work on final solutions: we take on board that message from the report, but this must always be done in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity and the principle that healthcare services are in the competence of Member States.
Four important points in the report are: the centres of reference; professional mobility, which already causes problems in some of the new Member States because of doctors or healthcare workers moving to other Member States for higher pay; patient safety; and dealing with inequalities.
We all have to work in that direction, both within the high-level group and the Commission itself.
Â Â  . Mr President, the question facing us is how we are going to manage the rights of our EU patients to go to another Member State for medical treatment and have their costs reimbursed now that our courts have handed down these rights to them in the context of our single market.
I thank Mr Bowis for his excellent report.
We expected nothing less from him.
This is a first step on that road and is a response to the impressive communication from the High Level Reflection Group, which was set up in response to the ECJ judgments.
However, I agree with our rapporteurâs view that a sense of urgency is missing from the communication in relation to policy and spending priorities.
We are also at risk of being driven by the courts rather than the statute in this most important of areas.
I would favour the minimum legal framework necessary for both providers and purchasers of cross-border healthcare, but we should not underestimate the complexity of the task.
As we know, health policy and health budgets are competences of the individual Member States: this is strictly subsidiarity.
So the financial implications of these new patient rights need structuring, not least at the level of health insurance cover, which varies greatly throughout the 25 Member States from demand control to supply control systems.
The attempt to deal with this issue in the General Services Directive is ill-advised and I welcome the Commissionâs change of mind.
That directive is about service mobility in the EU, not customer or patient mobility. It is particularly not about customers who will not be paying their own bills, customers who may need aftercare and follow-up treatments when they return home.
Our public likes the option of travelling to another EU country if treatment is not available at home: the obvious first choice.
Treatment may not be available for certain specialities, or there could be an unacceptable delay in accessing the required treatment.
Large-scale patient mobility should be unnecessary if a Member State discharges its responsibilities with a well-run, efficient health service.
In 2002 Ireland was forced to set up the National Treatment Purchase Fund to reduce its ever-lengthening waiting list.
In that year alone, almost 2Â 000 Irish patients were sent to the UK for treatment.
We are adept at exporting our patients.
Another 650 opted to go to Member States on E112 forms that same year â difficult as those forms are.
But only one patient opted to travel to Ireland for elective treatment.
By comparison, 137Â 000 opted to travel to Spain.
These figures highlight the urgent need to manage this right to access treatment throughout the EU.
Our patients, doctors and taxpayers deserve to have it managed properly.
They want and expect to be offered sound guidance on policy and procedure.
I should like to ask the Commissioner what the next move will be and when.
Does he accept that a properly structured service is urgently needed in this area?
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, of course, would like to thank Mr Bowis for his splendid report, which will enable us to counter, yet again, the widespread prejudice according to which Europe does not care about its citizensâ actual worries and needs.
While the public, without a doubt, fear unemployment, they also worry about not always getting the best possible treatment when ill and away from home.
Anywhere in Europe, anyone can have an accident, become ill and need medical help and treatment, and so it cannot be acceptable that only two thirds of Member States should have their own legislation on the protection of patients in place.
In my own country, for example, 90% of what patients are entitled to is founded upon widely-dispersed case law, none of which is summarised in a single, comprehensive and binding document.
It is past high time for current patientsâ rights and minimum standards to be brought into line across the EU.
Everyone â irrespective of whether it is in Spain, Latvia or Poland that they fall ill â must have the same rights as they do in France, Finland or the Czech Republic, for example the right to expert advice that they can understand, the right to documentation relating to treatment and the right to see their patient records.
What we also need, though, is greater transparency in the reimbursement of costs.
Even though the ECJ has shed light on which of the costs incurred abroad are reimbursed, Regulation 1408/71 is still unequally applied.
The existing legislation on reimbursement of costs needs to be approximated, and there is an urgent need for a single legal framework on patient mobility.
The Internet health portal announced by the Commission also needs to be put in place as soon as possible to carry all the important information that is needed not only by patients and their families, but also by professionals â including such things as data on the fields in which hospitals and doctors specialise, as well as data enabling doctorsâ performances to be evaluated and data on patient safety.
One might say that what we need is a Europe-wide ranking of the kind that exists here and there at national level.
If people are to make sound decisions on where and how they want to be treated, they have to be well informed, and one in every four Europeans already uses the Internet as a source of health information.
Let me conclude by pointing out that we must not limit Centres of Reference to the treatment of rare illnesses; they are also needed to deal with all the other conditions that require a particular combination of resources and expertise, such as cancer, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.
In a Europe in which patients are mobile, there will be a need for more legal certainty, transparency and even greater quality.
Subsidiarity notwithstanding, this gives us our great opportunity to enable Europe itself to do much, much more for its citizens.
Let us follow where Mr Bowisâ report leads in working towards this end.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you.
Health is of course very important to everyone and is essential to our quality of life.
This excellent report by Mr Bowis â and I have to say that the original report, that is to say the one before it was approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, was actually far better than what is before us now â is in any case a step in the right direction in promoting public health.
The report contains a lot of sensible ideas, and I dare say that it is perhaps left up to others, including myself, to say the injudicious things, because the language in the report could have been more forceful, of course.
The version after it passed the Committee contains many âwould it not be nice ifâ and âthis and that would need to be promotedâ and the conclusion is yet again that the responsibility for health and health care really lies with the Member States.
I already knew that.
That is how it is provided for in the Treaty, but the question is, of course, whether that is tenable in the long term.
How do we really help sick people, for example in the case of long waiting lists in my own country or the lack of specialist knowledge?
I should therefore like to seize the opportunity of arguing in favour of the European Union adopting a bigger role in health and health care.
If somebody is ill, they should be given the possibility of receiving medical care abroad.
Keeping the borders closed for medical care for all kinds of administrative, procedural or financial reasons is ultimately not in the interest of the consumer, and that is what we are here for, after all.
The right to see a doctor abroad has already been recognised by the Court of Justice, and, as Mr Bowis rightly suggests, why not enshrine it in European legislation?
We live in a modern society peopled by well-educated, mobile and responsible citizens, and they should be able to decide where they want to be treated and how.
Opening up borders for patients also encourages health care in our own countries to achieve better quality, cutting waiting lists and making specialist knowledge available.
Having said that, I should like to underline the EUâs positive role in health care, and the presence of the Commission at this ungodly hour is appreciated all the more.
This health care in the European Union is an exception to the rule that the European Union is often associated with the negative image of bureaucracy and drafting senseless and unnecessary rules.
We do good work here, and it goes without saying that we will be voting for Mr Bowisâ report with great enthusiasm.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank John Bowis for an excellent report.
I only regret that my main committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, did not get its act together to draw up an opinion on this subject.
As the committee responsible for Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1408/71, we have an interest in it, as do I as Parliamentâs rapporteur during the previous term.
I am rather concerned about the tone of some of the comments that I have just been hearing.
Let us be clear: patients have the right to move under certain circumstances.
It is not a free-for-all, and I do not think Parliament should be giving that impression. Not least because some colleagues who sit in Member State parliaments would be a little upset to see us moving their budgets as a matter of course because we choose to.
It is right that we need greater clarity around the rules on this, but I welcome the recognition in this report that healthcare is a service to people in need, it is not an ordinary consumer product.
Therefore, it should not be in the services directive. That is not the appropriate place either to deal with questions of reimbursement.
We will have a real mess unless we do this properly and in a considered manner, as has been proposed in this report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, it would be an oversight on my part if I too failed in turn to congratulate Mr Bowis who, through his report, has expressed his knowledge and experience on these matters.
The opinion of the European Parliament on the serious issue of patient mobility is important as a lever for exerting pressure on the European Commission to take clearer measures on this issue.
European patients have rights which must also be protected by law, so that they can have the corresponding social cover wherever they may be in the Europe of free movement.
It is important, I believe, to promote simple, daily information for patients as regards their rights and to recognise the peculiarities of groups of patients such as the elderly, the illiterate and pensioners, as Amendment 37 also emphasises.
In addition, the protection of patients' personal data is important.
Provision is made for the creation of a database of medical information on patients; however, as provided for in Amendments 48, 49, 50, 67 and 68, certain protective measures must be taken to prevent abuse.
I also consider it necessary to clarify the situation in cross-border areas.
In other words, patients must be treated in hospitals as close to their place of residence as possible.
Numerous European countries which border each other, such as France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, have developed close cooperation mechanisms, mechanisms which start with road transport and extend to health issues.
It is only natural that certain citizens resident in cross-border areas should be able to go for treatment to hospitals in neighbouring countries which are closer to home than treatment centres in their own country.
I call on you, therefore, to support Amendment 41, paragraph 8.
Finally, I should like to stress that health services cannot be compared with goods offered for sale.
I therefore consider that the question of patient mobility and of services in general should not be included in a general services directive.
Nonetheless, we do need a proposal for action on mobility, with a specific timetable, which takes account of the conclusions of the High Level Group on Health Services and Medical Care.
Â Â  .Â Â Â The protection of public health is a priority goal for any state and for any public health service.
Cooperation in this field, particularly at Member State level, should in theory increase the treatment options available, not only by making it possible to receive treatment after having moved to another EU Member State, but also by allowing patients to travel to other facilities if appropriate medical care is unavailable in their home country.
The problem of mobility poses a multitude of risks, however.
These are primarily due to the economic and political differences that exist between the old and rich EU Member States and the new Member States, whose development has been held back until today as a result of the Soviet totalitarian rule to which they were previously subjected.
Whereas citizens of the 15Â old Member States mainly move around the EU in order to avoid waiting lists or in search of cheaper treatment, the majority of citizens in the new Member States are denied medical care.
The main reason for this is the mass exodus of skilled workers, or in other words highly-educated doctors and nurses, to rich countries.
MrÂ Bowis was right to highlight this âbrain drainâ in his report, as it poses an enormous threat to the health of less wealthy citizens.
What is more, the various liberal ideas that are currently in vogue, which include viewing health care as a service and a market commodity and making it more difficult to acquire specialist qualifications, as well as the various economic programmes that advocate job cuts at the expense of health-care systems and that merely improve the economic situation of private medical centres, will not solve the growing number of problems we face in the health-care sector or create new jobs.
The end result of this will be an increase in the cost of medical care and a deterioration of public health.
Â Â  I welcome Mr Bovis's report on patient mobility and healthcare developments in the European Union.
I support the Commission's action plan for healthcare in Europe, which would genuinely guarantee people's safe freedom of movement.
Particularly at a time when Europe is much troubled by the question of 'European solidarity versus national identity', it is important to demonstrate to citizens that the European institutions are preparing simplified mechanisms and improved healthcare for their citizens.
The fact that, on the basis of the principle of Subsidiarity, Member States and their politicians are responsible for providing healthcare is one of the serious obstacles to the free movement of people.
Patients face no waiting list when it comes to paying for health insurance, which they do loyally, promptly and regularly, yet when they urgently need a service in return for their money, healthcare is denied them or delayed.
Patient mobility could help to improve the currently inadequate healthcare in some Member States.
Effectively, waiting lists cause patient's treatment to be postponed, something that may even, from a medical point of view, might be seen as a threat to their health and their lives.
Waiting lists can be for plastic surgery.
Patients having to wait for, say, a hip replacement, are ruining their health in the meantime with painkillers, long-term use of which can cause dependence, bone marrow decay and stomach ulcers.
Furthermore, some Member States are at present remedying their healthcare deficiencies to their advantage; I use the word 'advantage' to refer to purchasing the services of cheap labour in the form of doctors and nurses from Eastern Europe.
As far as Europe's future is concerned, I therefore consider patient mobility to be far preferable to health worker mobility.
When doctors and nurses leave Eastern European States, healthcare suffers there.
According to Slovak Medical Association statistics, more doctors left Slovakia than graduated from the country's three medical faculties.
It is therefore clear that, in the future, gaps will appear on the map of Europe, a state of affairs that, again, is no solution.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you.
First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on the clarity of his report and of his stance on something that is a live issue.
It is an unfortunate fact that health care is far from ideal in many countries.
What is worse, in many countries, questions are being asked about quality and accessibility at a time when waiting lists and waiting times are getting longer.
Under normal circumstances, patients benefit from care close to home, in their own countries at any rate.
In the situation of reduced quality, it becomes appealing for patients to look across the border.
Recent court judgments have encouraged patients to look elsewhere for an answer to their health problems.
I totally agree with the rapporteurâs giving first place to the improvement of quality in health care; shopping across the border does not solve anything.
It is, of course, practical to make joint arrangements about transnational treatments in border regions, and the departure of patients to other countries can be an incentive to invest more in national health care, although that is an unwieldy way of stimulating quality.
It is therefore unacceptable for patient mobility to be regulated in the Services Directive by way of afterthought, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was right to delete patient mobility from that directive.
We are faced, however, with an urgent problem.
There is a considerable difference in quality between the Member States.
The varying chances of survival for, for example, bladder cancer are shocking.
In Austria and Iceland, the chance of surviving bladder cancer is twice that in Poland.
Instead of dreaming up procedures, laws and regulations which should guide the free movement of patients, the Commission would be wiser to invest in the exchange of knowledge in the most dynamic way possible.
Patients with bladder cancer in Poland deserve high-quality treatment too.
All bladder cancer patients want to benefit from Austrian knowledge and expertise.
Let us therefore take this step forward and not invest unnecessarily in mobility that patients do not want anyway.
Nobody enjoys waking up from a general anaesthetic in a strange environment.
I would therefore speak for quality rather than mobility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly, I wish to thank MrÂ Bowis for this excellent report.
Around Europe, there are many patients and people who are in need of care who have a lot to gain from the vision we are presenting in this House of increased opportunities to move across borders.
There are, unfortunately, politicians and bureaucrats in Europe who frown upon increased mobility and freedom of choice.
They regard freedom of choice as a threat to their own ability to plan and regulate, in other words as a threat to their own power.
That is why, in so many Member States including Sweden, it may be impossible for patients even to seek care in another part of the country.
With this report, we clearly show that we are not on the side of the bureaucrats in this conflict, but on that of the patients.
I wish, however, to emphasise that I too think that health care is a national matter.
Our task is to tear down borders and ensure that patients can seek care wherever they need to.
Freedom of movement provides, firstly, competition between health care systems that drives development forward and, secondly, a more efficient use of health servicesâ scarce resources. In Sweden, patients may need to queue up for years, waiting for treatment for which there is overcapacity in other countries.
By tearing down the borders, we create the preconditions for both development and efficiency. This means an improvement in healthcare in our Member States, with more peopleâs needs being met.
I would call upon my fellow MEPs to vote in favour of AmendmentÂ 5, tabled by MrÂ Bowis, MrsÂ Oomen-Ruijten and myself on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
The amendment entails adding a new paragraph, 4a, about not stating in the resolution that we are to remove health services and medical care from the Services Directive.
If there are any service companies operating in an environment characterised by regulations and monopolies that prevent mobility and competition, it is specifically companies providing medical treatment and healthcare.
To crown it all, the removal of healthcare services from the directive is not a subject that even belongs within this debate, in which we are discussing the mobility of patients, not that of healthcare providers.
It is important to emphasise peopleâs knowledge of healthcare in different countries.
We need informed patients who are able to benefit from the opportunities we are opening up to them.
I therefore want to conclude by inviting you all to a seminar on 15Â June in Brussels where we shall, for the first time, present a proper factual comparison from the patientâs perspective of Europeâs healthcare systems.
You are all sincerely welcome to attend.
Â Â  â Mr President, we must today, I believe, make it abundantly clear to the European public that, while every jot and tittle of Mr Bowisâ excellent report cries out for Europe to take an initiative, this cannot justify the charge of over-regulation that is levelled against it.
If implemented, every single thing that the report demands and proposes would add value to the European citizenâs participation in the European Union.
Let me say, then, that, second only to growth and employment policy, it is social and health policy to which demographic change presents the greatest challenge of all, not only in view of the ballooning costs in that area, but also in terms of the realisation of our four freedoms, of the expanding internal market and of the publicâs greater mobility.
European citizenship is something that we all want.
Europeâs citizens have fundamental rights; medical care and help in an emergency are, within the European Union, among them, and they cannot be restricted to a citizenâs own country.
As a community founded upon solidarity, we have to be there for each other, above all when we need each other.
That is why I am very much in favour of the suggestions that there should be a Commission proposal specifically dealing with the issue of patient mobility.
I am very keen that patient mobility should not be subject to the Services Directive, and social and health services should be treated separately rather than now being thrown in the same pot as the Services Directive.
This is not solely about them as a commodity, but also about quality and clear definitions, about a legal framework and the clarification of who pays and who gets what.
My view is that the report has come at the right time, for these are issues that we are currently discussing at so many different levels.
We should take the report as the starting point for a wide-ranging debate on health and social provision and for a debate on how to achieve a better balance of national competence in relation to European responsibility.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for this very interesting debate.
It was also very useful for me to see how we can take this work further.
Let me begin by reassuring Mrs Doyle that I share her concern about the urgency of this whole issue.
I am really concerned about every single aspect of this complex issue which we call patient mobility, because it is not just about moving patients from one country to another.
Members have mentioned the problems with professional mobility and the burden on healthcare systems.
But we cannot do everything at once.
One complication is that most of this lies within the competence of the Member States.
The processes in the Union are rather slower than in the Member States, but when it comes to coordination or whatever method we choose, it takes even longer.
Nevertheless, I shall tell you what I plan to do in the near future.
Everything has to be done, but it is a matter of choosing priorities.
Some things are easier or more urgent.
The first one you have all mentioned: legal certainty. This has to be dealt with.
I will not take a position on the Services Directive.
I am waiting for the conclusion of the discussions.
I can assure you that if eventually it is decided not to include health in the Services Directive - I am speaking hypothetically here - we will bring forward a different proposal.
As soon as you decide what to do with the Services Directive!
It is not final yet, but let me put it like this: no time will be wasted.
That is the first priority.
We will have our health portal by the end of the year.
This is moving forward, as you know, the provision of information about access to healthcare is more an issue for the Member States, but we shall, nevertheless, include it in our health portal.
I will speed up the progress of the High Level Group, so that they can deal with the various issues they are working on.
I shall give priority to a health programme for the gathering of data information, because it seems that this might not be progressing as well as we think, but because of faults in the system we are not receiving the right information.
So it might be progressing better than we think.
So I shall give priority to gathering data information.
Centres of reference are very important and are included in the report.
In 2006 there will be at least a pilot project.
However, we also encourage them within Member States, because they is needed there as well.
Patient safety is important.
The Luxembourg presidency and the UK presidency are giving it priority.
I hope that by the end of the UK presidency we will have some more concrete conclusions on that.
The use of information technology for facilitating payments, records and so on and the use of e-Health information technology have been mentioned.
Patientsâ rights are important.
I am proud to say that the country I know best has already adopted legislation in this respect.
It is a question of subsidiarity, but we will encourage the Member States to adopt some kind of charter of patientsâ rights, which may or may not be binding depending on the legal system of each Member State.
Finally, another project which is important and which we will finance through the new health programme â provided it survives the Financial Perspectives debate â will be the financing of a new strand in health cooperation between Member States.
This will provide vital resources at European level to turn the discussions on cooperation into practical reality, including the other information and the centres of reference mentioned earlier.
In conclusion, I apologise again for taking so much time, but I wish to thank everybody for this debate.
I will keep Parliament informed on the progress of the High Level Group.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday you wondered why there were not enough people in the Chamber at the time of the debate.
This morning we had the same problem and you had to wait until people came.
It is no wonder there is not good attendance; it is because no debate is taking place.
All we do in this Chamber is hear predetermined, prepared, one or two minute speeches without actual dialogue; they are just monologues.
I think the procedure has to change if we are to have dialogue, proper debates and proper attendance.
Â Â  Mr Matsakis, that was not a point of order, but rather a statement.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements Preparation of the European Council, including the future of the Union after the referenda on the European Constitution (Brussels, 16-17 June 2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council that will begin its work on 16Â June will have to discuss two issues that will decide the future development of the European Union: the ratification process for the Constitutional Treaty and the conclusion of a political agreement on the financial perspectives.
Following intense debates, first of all the citizens of France, and then the citizens of the Netherlands, rejected the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, signed in Rome on 29Â OctoberÂ 2004.
There were many reasons for these no votes, some of them contradictory.
Many of us expressed our disappointment and our regrets at the outcome of those votes.
But a democratic debate took place and we must, of course, fully respect the democratic choice made by a clear majority of the French and Dutch electorates.
I cannot help but recall the huge vote that the European Parliament expressed on 12Â JanuaryÂ 2005 in favour of the draft European Constitution.
This vote was driven by a great hope; a conviction that the European Union, following enlargement with ten new members, could strengthen its democratic basis, operate more effectively and more transparently, anchor its future in the common values that are so close to our hearts and, in this way, finally regain the full confidence of its citizens.
