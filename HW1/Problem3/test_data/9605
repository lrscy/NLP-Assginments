I would like to reassure him: there was no tourism, only war.
The eyewitness accounts of Members of this Parliament are one contribution to opposing this war.
While we were there we saw things we would have preferred not to: we saw check points closed by the Israeli army, bursts of machine gun fire at old people and children, we saw Israeli army tanks parading in the courtyard of Ramallah hospital.
If that hospital has not suffered the same fate as all the other Palestinian public buildings, if it has escaped the damage caused by roundups, that is due in part to the peaceful protection of these Members of Parliament, to their accounts of their experiences and to their power to condemn what they have seen.
Mr President, time is running out.
With an army that has become used to occupying and a civilian population resigned to being occupied, it is difficult to imagine that a peace free of hatred can exist.
Yet the world needs unqualified peace now; above all, as Mrs Morgantini said, it needs peace without victory on either side.
Mr President, while we sit here debating, a tragedy is unfolding in Palestine: a humanitarian as well as a political tragedy.
If this policy is not stopped, it will not only destroy the present, it will also destroy the future for any political solution.
For both the Palestinians and the Israelis.
In this sense, Sharon's political actions are to be condemned.
At this stage, sitting on the fence - or going nowhere near the fence - is tantamount to complicity.
It is time for action, initiative and intervention.
Any further prevarication is pointless and destructive.
Tomorrow, Mr Solana, you will be holding discussions with Colin Powell and the others.
I trust that Mr Powell's opinion will sit with Mr Bush's opinion and Mr Rumsfeld's opinion and Mr Cheney's opinion.
You know what I mean.
With Europe having to evaluate its values and principles now, however, its first message must be that it believes in what it says and will act on it and the proposals made by the various Members should be used as active guidelines for practical purposes.
Now we are being tested, now we are showing what our policies are really made of.
Mr President, due to time restrictions, I shall make a few brief comments.
In view of the last intervention by Mr Souladakis, I would like to tell you that tomorrow will not be the first time we have spoken to Colin Powell: we speak to Mr Powell practically every day and it is certainly partly as a result of those conversations that the meeting will take place tomorrow.
I do not share the frustrating feeling that the European Union carries no weight.
Quite the opposite: as a result of these contacts, of this passion we have applied to trying to resolve the problem, tomorrow's meeting in Madrid has been called and the major players in relation to this conflict will reach a collective agreement to try to resolve it.
I would like to say that, at least for tomorrow, I believe there are three fundamental messages.
Afterwards, we will return to this House to explain the development of the issue by means of a parliamentary debate.
The first message, which is fundamental, is that the representatives of the major players who are going to meet tomorrow must make an effort to ensure that the Security Council resolutions be applied immediately, without delay.
I repeat: without delay.
I believe it is essential that for the first time a joint and public declaration of this kind should be made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States.
And I believe that we Europeans must support this proposal and this type of declaration.
Secondly, I believe we must do everything possible to ensure that the important players meeting tomorrow see to it that the Palestinian Authority is not degraded any further.
Everything possible must be done to ensure that the Palestinian Authority recovers its capacities.
It is highly contradictory - as has been stressed already - to ask the Palestinian Authority to sign a ceasefire agreement, to arrest the terrorists who are free in certain parts of Palestine, when it does not have the means to do so.
This morning, you have seen the news that Israeli forces have withdrawn from a city.
On leaving that city they have bombed and destroyed the general headquarters of the Palestinian Authority.
At the same time it is very contradictory tomorrow to ask the Palestinian Authority to lead the way in finding the solution for a ceasefire.
Therefore, and as a result of this reasoning, it seems to me fundamental that this message be sent rigorously and clearly.
It is a message that must be understood and that must be expressed clearly so that everybody understands it and so that our Israeli friends also understand it.
We all have many friends in Israel who agree on this point.
It follows from this approach that it is necessary for the international community to be willing to engage on the ground.
This is something that I am saying with conviction, for the first time.
I believe that we must begin to think seriously about it.
But this is not going to happen in 24 hours, it is not going to happen without any mandate.
When it was said that the Europeans should be deployed in a military or policing sense - or I do not know how - in the territories, it is clear that this will require some kind of mandate.
And that is what we have to work on: on ensuring that the next Security Council Resolution allows, once the necessary conditions are in place, for the possibility of an international presence on the ground.
I believe that is a reasonable measure which the European Union can support, but which it must support jointly with others, in particular the United States and the Russian Federation.
That is what we must do.
Thirdly: tomorrow we must send a clear signal - not just the Europeans, but collectively with all the major players - that there must be a political perspective.
And there is no need to invent that perspective, since one has already been invented: it consists of two states, with secure borders (one of which is the Palestinian State, whose borders must be set in accordance with the Security Council Resolutions, that is to say, those set in 1967) and able to live together.
That is the final objective.
How can that objective be achieved?
That is the difficult question that we have been working on for many months.
It is possible that the only way forward is the Tenet Plan and that, afterwards, the Mitchell Plan should be implemented, which I know very well since I drew it up jointly with Senator Mitchell.
I am beginning to rather doubt - and this causes me to be very pessimistic - that the Tenet Plan, followed by the Mitchell Plan and followed by a negotiation - and I do not know when it will take place - is going to be the ideal formula.
If we do not have a negotiator on the Palestinian side, it is going to be very difficult - as I said before - for us to achieve our aim through this process of tiny steps.
That is my worry and that is why I am pessimistic.
I am not going to suddenly come up with some miraculous solution and it would be naÃ¯ve, stupid and unworthy of you to expect it.
However, if we have to seek some solution, I have said on previous occasions that we need an 'express' Mitchell Plan, a fast Mitchell Plan, not for the times in which it was conceived, but a much faster Mitchell plan, which would lead us as quickly as possible to a final agreement.
Finally, I think it is essential that we ask that the Beirut Resolution - which has not been read properly and it should be, since some of its points are very important - should also become a United Nations Security Council Resolution; that that commitment, this gesture from the Arab world towards Israel's security should also become a Security Council Resolution.
I believe that that would be an additional element in terms of recovering the trust between the parties, a trust which unfortunately does not exist at the moment.
(Applause)
Finally, a comment of a personal nature: I know that many of you have suffered a lot.
I have seen some people who have particularly suffered, some of whom have even been expelled from the region.
I can say that I understand your feelings just as I understand the feelings of the Palestinians and the Israelis.
I have seen many Palestinians die and I have seen many Palestinians suffer and I have also seen families of old friends on the side of peace in Israel who do not take their children in the same bus to school and who separate their children into two groups for fear of dying in a terrorist attack.
We must understand all of this.
If we do not understand the two things, we will never resolve the problem.
Therefore, let us understand the problem in depth so that we can resolve it.
Lastly, as for me, Javier Solana, rest assured that I will never cease working for peace in the Middle East, as I have done up until now.
I have been working for it since the Madrid Conference, many years ago, and I expect to continue working for it while I still have the energy and the strength.
(Applause)
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
All I can say is that I, and the Presidency as a whole, support everything Mr Solana has said in response to today's debate in Parliament.
I would like to take this opportunity to make two observations.
The first is with regard to the meeting that will take place tomorrow. I believe that we can allow ourselves to feel a degree of satisfaction, insofar as it is no coincidence that this meeting is to take place in the capital of the country which currently holds the Presidency of the European Union.
This meeting is taking place on the EU's, and the Presidency's initiative, and therefore will be the most important event that has taken place until now with a view to achieving peace, and presents the only real opportunity to bring together all the major players, in one location, to break this vicious circle of violence.
We hope that all present will share the Presidency's, and, naturally, the whole Union's, determination to see this succeed, a determination that has been expressed here in Parliament, with whose support a final effort will be made at tomorrow's meeting.
The second observation I would like to make, Mr President, refers to the need, that many honourable Members and leaders of political groups have expressed, for us to review our Association Agreement with Israel, in other words, that we should use our Association Agreement with Israel as an instrument.
I would like to say emphatically that the Presidency totally agrees with this approach and this very morning the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr PiquÃ©, announced that he intends, in agreement with the Commission, to call on the Association Council to carry out a review of our relations with Israel.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have to tell you, however, that for any steps to be taken within the Association Agreement, we need unanimity from the Council.
Put simply, and as you are all aware, these measures do not only depend on the determination of the Commission or the Presidency-in-Office, but on that of every Member State of the European Union.
We are already well aware of this Parliament's determination.
I believe that this will also be reflected in the resolution that will be approved tomorrow and I hope that this will act as a wake-up call to the conscience of every EU government.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon on Wednesday.
I should like to thank the High Representative, the Council and the Commission for their participation in this debate as well as our colleagues who have contributed to it.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0095/2002) by Mr Sterckx on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC (11367/1/2001 - C5-0635/2001 - 2000/0325(COD)).
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the Erika 2 package, like the Erika 1 package before it, is part of the attempt to establish reliable safety measures and protect the marine environment, the importance of both of which is recognised by one and all. That goes without saying.

The package of measures which we are being called on to adopt today does, I think, strike the right balance and demonstrates yet again that we can only protect and improve European shipping standards by improving safety at sea and protecting both human life and the marine environment and I should like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his tireless work over a long period of time to achieve the result which we have before us today.
The Commission's initial proposal contained positive arrangements to improve safety at sea and reduce the danger of pollution from accidents.
Ships are required to use a transponder and voyage data recorders or so-called black boxes.
This has since been dealt with in the Watts report, which requires ships to comply with maritime traffic systems, improvements to be made to ship-locating systems and so on.
In turn, Parliament approved 29 amendments at first reading which, I think, improved the Commission proposal and most of which, I should point out, were subsequently adopted by the Council, which took a constructive stance.
However, a number of questions have yet to be settled and I therefore think we are right - and this is the point of the nine amendments approved in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - to insist on keeping to a specific approach to point the way both to the Commission and to the Council.
I should like to comment very briefly on three of these amendments.
Amendment No 1 basically clarifies that a Member State may, in exceptionally poor conditions, stop a ship from entering port or even from leaving port, because ships in port sometimes represent more of a threat to safety and of pollution of the port itself.
I think our Committee, the Committee on Transport, is right to assert that the decision as to whether or not the ship sails should be taken at the discretion of the captain, who must of course explain the reasons for his decision.
We have tried in Amendment No 2 to take a more realistic approach to the cost of pollution or damage which the accommodating port may sustain; obviously ports will be more willing to accommodate ships in distress if they know that they will receive fair and immediate compensation for cleaning-up costs.
Finally, Amendment No 3 basically endeavours to ensure that resources are immediately available so that the Member States can make the necessary arrangements to provide means and facilities in ports of refuge for assistance to ships, salvage and pollution response.
And Mr Sterckx's proposed 18-month deadline is essential if these proposals are to become law in all the Member States of the European Union, rather than just a 'to-do' list.
Mr President, we are taking action as a Parliament, as a European Union, to make our seas safer because of tragic events like the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise, the Scandinavian Star, The Estonia and, most recently, The Erika.
We are putting in place a series of measures to ensure events like that can never happen again.
We save lives and we protect the marine environment.
I therefore applaud the Commission and the Commissioner for her commitment to improving the safety of our seas and the Council for its willingness to codecide with Parliament.
In particular I pay tribute to the rapporteur for his determination both to strengthen and clarify an already good proposal.
The three key elements are monitoring and information, transponders on every ship and monitoring by every maritime authority, an essential component of our package of measures - the Erika package.
This will ensure that there is no hiding place for substandard ships, that all ships will be watched and monitored and that they will not escape compliance with their international obligations.
That is our message to substandard ships and the flags of convenience.
Secondly, the proposal dovetails with my own report on port State control. In particular the black box voyage-data recorder.
As the rapporteur has said, this will enable us not just to learn from lessons but prevent problems occurring in the first place.
We are giving real help to ships in distress to ensure that they are properly handled in emergency situations, closing a loophole in the safety chain.
I, like the rapporteur, want to ensure that this and other Erika measures are complied with.
This perhaps is the greatest challenge we face as a Community.
We want to ensure all this new legislation, worthy though it is, is complied with not just by the ship operators but also by the Member States themselves who, sadly, over the years, have shown a reluctance to adhere to Community law.
I hope that the Erika rapporteurs together can meet the Commissioner soon to help bring forward proposals as to how best Parliament can ensure that Member States comply with their toughened obligations.
Finally, I hope our amendments can be accepted in full in order to avoid codecision and to ensure this legislation, which will do so much to make our seas safer, comes on to the statute book at the earliest possible opportunity.
First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work. Like him I believe that we are working towards an excellent text.
Admittedly we still have a long way to go because, since the Amoco-CÃ¡diz tragedy that everyone in Europe and particularly the people of France, can recall, no progress has been made. Quite the opposite, in fact; things have deteriorated, since oil companies have decided to withdraw from transport to avoid seeing their name on the hull of a wrecked ship, and to avoid being associated with ships that have run aground and acts of pollution.
This decision had a dramatic effect, since maritime transport, oil transport had become a separate profit centre which was forced, like any other profit centre, to cut its costs, to make a profit and to survive under the pressure from those in charge, namely the oil companies. This had an undeniable effect on the quality of transport and on safety, since the average age of a ship doubled in the space of 15 years and so there is an obvious link between the average age of a ship and the number of accidents.
So, Parliament has a specific duty to intervene on these issues, not only because they concern the environment but also because they are transnational in nature and this is a good document that we are working towards. I would, however, like to stress one particular point.
Of course, the control of illegal trafficking, data registration and identification are all well and good, but it would be quite reasonable, in the same spirit of resisting economic pressure, to ensure that the decision whether the ship leaves the port when sea conditions are difficult is not simply left to the captain alone, as he may be placed under economic pressure due to his position. Instead, the port authorities could take this decision as they can decide whether or not it is safe to set sail without having to take into account financial considerations.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I believe that it is vital for the Council to take a rapid decision on what we will be approving at second reading tomorrow.
The rapporteur has been very cautious.
He has not gone too far at second reading, because we want rapid results, as, let us be honest, it is a long time since the Erika II sank.
So we need to take measures without delay and I would like to point out that transponders are not only suitable for monitoring but first and foremost also for rescue purposes.
So if a vessel really gets into trouble at sea and can no longer set off an adequate distress signal, it can be reached and rescued more quickly by using transponders.
Our requests to the Council with regard to equipping vessels with transponders and voyage data recorders are really very modest.
We can only hope that the IMO will agree an accelerated timetable in the autumn, one that we can implement without delay.
Commissioner, the vital thing here is for us to react more quickly, and Mr Sterckx has been kind enough to give you three years to sort out compensation for ports that accommodate ships in distress.
The Erika need not have sunk if it could have entered the port, and it is therefore a reflection of the situation here.
We need ports that can accommodate ships in distress, but if those ports are to allow ships to enter, we need compensation arrangements.
Commissioner, I urge you to sort out those arrangements more quickly, because ports will then be far more willing to accommodate ships in distress and a case like that of the Erika II can be avoided.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that those of us concerned about maritime safety and the protection of our seas - and, in this regard, the protection of crews is naturally the most important factor - are today witnessing the culmination of one more measure within the Erika I and Erika II packages, involving a series of measures which is providing the European Union with sufficient and appropriate instruments so that it can carry out genuine preventative action and prevent accidents at sea.
The sinking of the Erika reminded the world of the constant risk involved in the transport by sea of oil-based products, and made the need for a better understanding and monitoring of maritime traffic off the European coastline perfectly clear.
The measures the Commission has proposed have gone much further and have not been restricted to proposals solely concerned with the oil sector, but have been extended to the maritime traffic sector as a whole.
Today's proposal, which relates to the directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, is a response to this concern.
It sets up a global strategy with the intention of guaranteeing a high safety standard for this traffic along the whole of the European coastline, and its objective - I assure you - is prevention, through more precise identification and better monitoring of ships.
It also has the objective of improving the response of the coastal authorities in the event of an accident or the risk of an accident, since, as Mr Hatzidakis mentioned, port control, the establishment of ports of refuge, and assistance to boats in difficulty are absolutely key issues.
I would like to say that, throughout the whole of the analysis and discussion of this proposal, the Commission has enjoyed Parliament's active support, as it has on all previous reports, particularly through Mr Sterckx's most constructive contribution.
I believe that cooperation between both institutions has paid off and today we are very close to reaching a definitive agreement on a text that, from the outset, involved sensitive issues, such as the prohibition of setting sail in bad weather, the aforementioned ports of refuge, for example, or the obligation to carry transponders or black boxes.
In this regard, once again I would like to praise Mr Watts' tenacity, thanks to which we have been able to secure Council's agreement with regard to conciliation on the directive regarding the control of the port state.
With regard to ports of refuge, I would like to say that compensation for possible damages are an absolutely fundamental feature, and here I agree with Mr Jarzembowski, if EU States are to make ports of refuge available, and this is an absolutely key issue.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by thanking Mr Sterckx once again for his magnificent work, and also all of those responsible in the appropriate committee.
We share many of your concerns and we accept all the amendments you have tabled.
In this regard, I would highlight the follow-up of the report after three years and the true-to-life assessment of the situation, the issue of controls in places of refuge and assistance to boats.
In short, we shall accept all the amendments that have been tabled and I hope they will also be accepted by the Council, which will mean that we do not have to resort to the conciliation procedure.
We will shortly be presenting the last measure needed to complete this package, a package that will allow us to significantly improve safety in sea transport.
After Commission's approval of the measures relating to the transport of passengers, we shall present the measures relating to crews, which is the human element and always a decisive factor.
Thank you very much, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi (A5-0059/2002) on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council regulation on the Community patent (COM(2000) 412 - C5-0461/2000 - 2000/0177(CNS)).
Mr President, I would like to begin by telling you that I am satisfied with this report, which is the result of a lengthy process in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, a committee that I have had the honour to chair over much of this negotiation, in addition to being rapporteur in this particular instance.
Today we are presenting the European Parliament report on the Community patent.
I have to tell you, first of all, that in this case the European Parliament only has the competence to present a report.
This is the first - I do not really want to call it an anomaly - but, in short, the first issue that, from Parliament's point of view, I would like to draw your attention to.
We are dealing with a proposal from the European Commission that dates from August 2000 - in other words, some time ago - that was accepted by the Lisbon European Council, which stressed the importance of achieving a Community patent before the end of 2001; this importance has once again been highlighted at the Barcelona European Council, and the Council was urged to adopt a political position at the Internal Market Council on 21 May.
This characterises a debate that has not been easy, because the adoption of the Community patent is not a trivial issue.
This is our second attempt, and I hope and trust that this time we will have a Community patent.
We need a Community patent that covers the whole EU, which will complement the European patent and national patents and will be competitive worldwide.
These are the three axes that the European Commission took as a reference point and which subsequently the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market took as their starting point.
However, for us, Mr President, and above all for the reason that we only have one single report, it was crucial for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to reach a consensus.
I believe we have achieved this.
I hope that tomorrow the vote in Plenary will basically support the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's position, which is a position we reached after debating and discussing for many hours the following three fundamental issues that are the key elements of this Community patent:
Firstly, the role of the national patent authorities. Without a doubt, when we have the Community patent, the role of the national patent authorities will be greatly reduced, except that we trust that they will carry out complementary work.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's report includes the possibility for national patent authorities to participate in the first phase of the negotiation of the Community patent - the research phase - provided that they can guarantee a sufficient level of quality.
This is the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's first point on which consensus was reached.
Secondly, the legal question. The Commission proposal is ambitious and has no current legal basis in the Treaty, and it would be based on a provision of the Treaty of Nice that has still not entered into force, consisting of the creation of a centralised Community Court of First Instance.
Therefore, Mr President, after much debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has adopted exactly the same approach as the European Commission, without going so far: for there still to be a national Court of First Instance, albeit with many elements that are already communitarised, and I feel that this is a possibility that the Council should follow if we are to have the patent we need.
Thirdly, with regard to the procedural languages: the intention of the Commission proposal was to uphold the European patent system, that is to say, to have three procedural languages - English, French and German.
As rapporteur, and with reality in mind, given that English is much more than the language of one State of the European Union, that it is the lingua franca of research, I proposed the use of English alone.
Finally, given that Parliament adovocates cultural and linguistic diversity, we reached a consensus, advocating the Alicante system, that is, to have five procedural languages.
I think that in this regard also Parliament is sending an important political signal that should be considered in the Council in order that consensus can be reached.
I am saying this in full knowledge of the latest news I have on the Council's working group.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both personally and on behalf of my group, I would first like to thank the rapporteur very warmly for her report.
Because this is a complicated and important topic it inevitably took some time to prepare, but we managed to find a workable compromise acceptable to the majority of this House.
Not everyone will be happy, but that is in the nature of compromises.
Nevertheless, it is a good result.
In view of the limited time I have, I wish to address just one very important aspect of our deliberations, and that is the issue of jurisdiction.
The Commission originally proposed that in parallel, as it were, to the existing national structures, there should also be a system of purely European jurisdiction.
I have always said, and I would like to stress this once again now, that I regard this approach as totally wrong.
We should not make the mistake that the United States has already made with its court system, so that on top of state courts there are also federal courts, with the guiding principle being that federal courts rule on federal law and state courts on state law.
That is nonsensical, it cannot be explained to taxpayers, it costs a lot of money and leads to a divide in the administration of justice.
We very much believe that European courts are also national courts, and that national courts obviously have to apply not only national law but also European law.
The approach adopted in this report by Anna Palacio Vallelersundi therefore represents a great step forward. That approach is that powers at national level can continue to be exercised with regard to European law in future, and that the court of first instance will be the existing national courts.
In order to provide uniform administration of justice and avoid a lack of uniformity in Europe, the court of second instance will be a higher, European court.
I regard that as a good proposal.
Mr President, please excuse me for having to leave this sitting very shortly, but I have another commitment and have to take part in another meeting.
Please excuse me and thank you for your attention.
Mr President, like Mr Lehne, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi on the work she has carried out to produce a balanced report on this issue.
As Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi pointed out, the European Parliament's role in this particular case is of a purely consultative nature, for the issue is really in the hands of the Commission and the Council.
However, I believe that the European Parliament is currently giving some very good advice.
Firstly, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi pointed out, a Community such as ours is important in relation to the role of the National Patent Offices.
Secondly, as Mr Lehne stated, the field of jurisdiction.
The other day several lawyers from large North American companies told me that the advantage of the North American federal system is that state jurisdictions are, generally speaking, more favourable to local businesses and consumers, whilst large companies prefer to go to federal jurisdiction, which is more favourable to them.
We will probably have to consider whether the conferring of powers to a special Community jurisdiction could possibly create imbalance, or give rise to what the Americans call 'forum shopping', which consists of each lawyer or expert in legal matters bringing the matter to the jurisdiction most favourable to them.
I would like to refer to another matter, which is that we have arrived at this new European patent indirectly through adhesion to an existing international convention.
This causes problems, for example, of a linguistic nature, a matter of some importance to the European Union.
The European Community is not a federal union, but more like some kind of confederation, in which different cultures and national traditions are very important.
In specific terms, for a country like Spain and for the 500 million people who speak Spanish worldwide, submission to a language which is not their own is going to cause very serious problems when carrying out research, not only in Spain, but in all of those countries who have called on the Spanish Patents and Trade Marks Office to patent their inventions.
The European Parliament can only give a recommendation, using recital 2, with regard to Article No 5.
This recommends recourse to the Alicante system, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi pointed out, which has functioned well in the past and is currently functioning well in five languages, thus permitting inexpensive and large-scale Community-wide participation.
We notice that this system is particularly well suited to the European Union's requirements.
I believe that Parliament's proposals and the agreement we have reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market are reasonable. Therefore, our group will support all the amendments approved by this committee, although we do not think that it would be appropriate at this time to vote for any of the other amendments, since this would upset the balance we have managed to achieve in this committee.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our group, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, and I should like to focus on three issues while adopting a very practical and less political approach, as many of my fellow MEPs have already mentioned.
The first issue is that of languages, and we have tabled an amendment on this, Amendment No 31, because it is indeed of major importance for the European patent to be established on behalf of industry in Europe, which forms one big market, and we therefore regret the fact that this was postponed during the Laeken Summit to 21 May.
The discussion surrounding the language issue bears more witness to a political sentiment than to a sense of reality, as I have already stated.
We agreed in Lisbon to turn the European economy into the world's most competitive knowledge economy, and I am of the view that, when it really comes down to it, we will not act on this intention, which is evident from the many amendments on this topic.
The linguistic costs will push up the price of the patent disproportionately high, which will adversely affect the competitiveness of businesses within this European market compared to businesses in other major markets, such as the United States and Japan.
European industry has itself indicated that it will not be using the European patent if it turns out to be too costly.
Then I should like to mention the jurisdiction.
We take the view, unlike Mr Lehne, that a European patchwork quilt, where each court provides a different interpretation of the European Community patent, would not be beneficial.
We are of the opinion that one central court of law should be set up which passes judgments in first instance, and that the European Court of Justice should subsequently handle appeal cases.
Finally, I should like to touch upon the constitutional question.
As Liberals we would welcome one European patent in Europe, independently of the Convention, in other words without joining the Convention, thus ensuring that the European Parliament retains a democratic hold on the European patent and that European legislation can be adapted to the European patent.
Mr President, I thank you for this opportunity, and I thank you all for your attention.
Mr President, like everybody else here, I enormously appreciate the work which Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi did as rapporteur, partly because we appreciated so much her work as chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I agree very much with the three points she wanted us to focus on, although on one I take a different view.
We are all agreed about the importance of preserving a role for national offices.
On the second point about jurisdiction, it seems to many of us to have been a part of the genius of the development of the European Community that justice was largely decentralised and that the role of the Community courts in matters particularly of private law and commercial law was an advisory or secondary role, with the main jurisdictions being localised.
That is a vitally important principle to keep - if it can be done without destroying the patent regime.
As Mr Lehne said, there are wrong roads that we could go down that would end up with a dispersal of Community jurisdictions and parallel jurisdictions between the national systems and the Community system.
That would be a great pity.
So I hope that the jurisdictional proposals will be accepted.
Then there is the language regime, a question on which I differ, with great respect for Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, and so does my group.
We believe that sustaining the existing system inside the European Patent Office is important.
On the other hand, we also believe that people should be able to put forward a patent claim in their own language. We then believe that it should be translated into all the other languages - not the whole process but just, as it says in Amendment No 20(c), "issued in the language of submission and in the official language in which the procedure has been carried out, accompanied by translation of the patent claims and of a short abstract in the other official languages of the Community", and then paragraph (d), "translations shall be performed by the Translation Centre for the bodies of the European Union and costs borne by the European Union".
Preserving the principle of linguistic equality is an important public good of the European Union.
The Union should pay for that.
It should not become a cost to patent holders.
Therefore the objections about over-pricing the European patent would not apply.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for me the issue of which national courts are responsible for a European patent and when is not the vital question regarding this report.
As I see it, what is far more important is the purpose of this draft and exactly what a patent system of this kind is intended to achieve.
This report and other planned changes to the EU patent system are intended to make patent applications more attractive by making the protection offered by the patent directly applicable in the EU and thus extending it.
A patent suggests that the patent holder has invented everything that he or she wishes to patent.
However, as a rule the invention draws on all kinds of knowledge that people have developed beforehand, and which can only be used at no cost if this knowledge is not itself covered by a patent.
This absurdity is particularly apparent when you consider the present attempts to make more and more software patentable.
Even algorithms in computer programs would no longer be freely available.
This would deprive all developers of the building blocks they need for any new computer program.
Supporters of the patent system often put forward the argument that patents would benefit invention 'freaks' who do not work for companies but who come up with their inventions either privately or at least with limited financial resources.
A patent would protect these people from having companies use their inventions without paying any fee to the inventors and thus not paying them for their work.
The problem with this picture is quite simply that it does not match the reality of the patent world.
In Germany at least, most patents are held by companies that are constantly extending their patents.
Private individuals often cannot access the system because of the high patent fees involved.
As the term 'intellectual property' implies, patenting simply means exploiting intangible things such as ideas, inventions and even discoveries.
I am not interested here in the fact that the proponents of capitalism are shooting themselves in the foot if they really believe in their credo of innovation and competitiveness.
I say that because my aim is free access to and exchange of information and knowledge and its further development.
That is precisely what is needed for a self-determined lifestyle and an emancipatory political approach.
However, in contrast to all this, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's report is aimed at treating an ever growing proportion of worldwide knowledge as goods that can generate profits for industry.
Surprisingly, the fact that the report that is before us today is attracting a great deal of interest in my country, Flanders, has less to do with the actual topic of the Community patent than with the proposed language regime, whereby, unfortunately, a distinction is once again being drawn between first-rate and second-rate languages within the European Union.
Indeed, following on from the Council's position, the rapporteur suggests applying the procedure, the working method, of the Trademarks Bureau to the Community patent.
Let there be no doubt about this: this is unacceptable to us in Flanders.
All EU working languages should be treated equally, certainly including Dutch, my language, which is spoken by more than 21 million Europeans.
And I am quite aware that this will, of course, entail a considerable additional cost.
We should accept this as the price we have to pay if we want to retain this diversity which makes up the richness of our continent.
I have in fact noticed quite specifically that the Member States of these so-called 'major' languages would also be prepared to get the European Union to carry this considerable cost if their language were likely to be pushed aside.
In fact, the OVV, the Flemish Associations Consultation Centre, a large representative umbrella organisation for a large number of Flemish cultural-political associations in my country, is making similar demands, and has decided in this case that if the European Union fails to come up with the goods, Europe is at risk of becoming an increasingly alienated occupying force instead of a co-operative based on equality, with respect for the national identity of all Members, as is, in fact, enshrined in the basic treaties.
This serves as a serious warning issued by a large and important cultural-political association.
This voice should also be heard in the European Union.
Mr President, I, like other colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, would like to congratulate our ex-chairman Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on all her work on this dossier.
It has been a real labour of Hercules but, despite that, I fear she has not, in the view of the British Conservatives, been able satisfactorily to resolve the issues that have been so vigorously debated in the Legal Affairs Committee.
However, I should emphasise that I do not think that is any reflection on her.
Rather it seems to me that, as has already been mentioned by a number of other speakers, there has been a series of real conundrums - serious issues - at the heart of this proposal.
In particular, it indicates the more or less complete impossibility of reconciling our language policy with the needs of those who use and work with patents.
I suspect that in microcosm this may be one of a much larger series of problems that we shall be experiencing in the Union in the not-too-distant future.
In my view, there is no point in having a Community patent, which could be a very useful development in intellectual property law, if those who use and work with patents find it no help.
I am told by industry that the Commission's proposals could be helpful but what Parliament is proposing will not be.
Since this is not a codecision matter, the best thing Parliament can do is to give an opinion as required and then leave matters to the Council to see if it can succeed where we have failed.
I am the first to confess that I do not think this is a very glorious suggestion but it is a pragmatic one.
I believe it is the correct course of action in the circumstance in which we now find ourselves.
Finally, just like my colleague Mr Lehne, I have another meeting and I hope you will bestow your blessing on my leaving as you did on his.
Mr President, I too would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, for her excellent report and, more importantly, her consistent and energetic efforts to achieve a consensus on the Community patent in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market.
It is those kinds of skills that we sorely miss now that she is ex-chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Her efforts, I have to say, have sadly not been helped by the failure of the Council to achieve an outcome in this area and, indeed, an unanimous agreement.
It is clear that we need a Community patent and that it is a key element in underpinning the Lisbon agenda of encouraging EU innovation and competitiveness.
But the system, as Lord Inglewood has said, has to be attractive to industry and business otherwise it will simply be an irrelevance.
Industry has given the Member States, the Commission and Parliament a very clear message: it wants consistent judgments under Community jurisdiction and a common jurisprudence, in particular regarding enforcement.
In particular they want a cheap and user-friendly regime.
If SMEs and especially inventors are to derive any benefit from this Community patent, what they do not want is a convoluted system which will tie them up in paperwork and red tape.
I illustrate this problem with the experience of one of my constituents, John Hamson, an engineer and inventor who cannot afford to employ expensive patent agents.
He has a UK patent.
He cites to me in letters his problems in dealing with the European Patent Office and the litany of hurdles he has to go through to obtain a European patent.
I do not want to repeat them, and it is not meant as a criticism of the European Patent Office. But the fact is that he has spent a lot of money and he still has no European patent.
His comments are summed up in his last letter to me some weeks ago: "the process is clearly designed to discourage small inventors and favours large business equipped with legal and patent expertise to navigate its treacherous bureaucracy."
We owe it to industry, to small and medium-sized enterprises and individual inventors to provide a simple, affordable Community patent which in turn will help EU innovation and competitiveness.
We must be able to offer industry and SMEs a better deal to ensure that the protection of intellectual property is genuinely an opportunity to create and encourage innovation.
Like Lord Inglewood, I do not believe that the Council has the answers to these problems.
It will fall to Commissioner Bolkestein to try to find the solution.
However, we have had a rapporteur who has made a Herculean effort to try to achieve this.
It is no fault of hers that we have not got the right consensus, but I have to say that there is no compromise to be achieved on languages.
Therefore I leave it to Commissioner Bolkestein to try to find a solution that will satisfy some of my constituents back in the north-west of England.
Mr President, Mrs McCarthy stated that it is up to the Commissioner to find such a compromise.
I would take the liberty of proposing Amendment No 32, containing a simple system through which proposals can be submitted in English or another of the Community languages.
Summaries of the applications would be translated into all the Community languages.
I wish to emphasise that this amendment would mean citizens' being given a glimpse of the monopolies that restrict their opportunities.
I should also like to point out that there are other factors just as important as the Community patent when it comes to increasing the number of innovations within the Community.
I believe, for example, that the inventions of universities and the latter's opportunity to exploit these are pivotal.
In Europe, we at present have rules which are difficult to interpret and which mean that the universities cannot make the most of their opportunities.
I would urge the Commission to review this aspect which affects a relatively large number of countries, as well as the right of universities and researchers to their inventions.
We are now in the process of creating a vigorously competitive system, and it is not necessarily only European inventors who may benefit from this.
It is competing systems that are crucial when it comes to the Community patent.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we insist that the fundamental equality of all languages be retained.
This is one of our priorities.
Needless to say, we endorse a Community patent.
It is a service to the community of European citizens, and in my view, all European citizens should be able to address the Union's bodies in their own language, including in patent applications, and they should also be able to receive a reply in their own language.
Discrimination on linguistic grounds would contravene Community law and the Charter of the Fundamental Rights.
Consequently, we cannot sanction the selection of five languages as an honourable compromise.
We would request Parliament, the Council and the Commission to endorse our amendments which allow everyone who submits a patent application to do so in their own language and to receive a reply in their own language, with translations into the other official languages of the Community.
Consequently, we believe that the discussion in the three working languages within the Bureau does not contravene these principles, because it would also have a cost-saving effect and avoids all procedures being conducted in English.
Mr President, creating a Community patent at any price is not acceptable, particularly if this jeopardises the interests of the small and medium-sized countries either in terms of the language arrangements or in terms of the role of the national patent offices, quite apart from the basic issues of the existence of Community patents and the serious problem of the potential impact of patents on fundamental areas such as life, our natural heritage or medicines, amongst other things, in which unacceptable scenarios have already opened up, mainly serving the interests of the big multinationals.
Applying the existing Munich arrangements for the European patent to the Community patent is unacceptable, since the Munich system only uses three languages and this would conflict with the principle that all the official languages are equal and create unacceptable discrimination from the procedural point of view as well as problems of legal security.
However, the linguistic arrangements proposed in this report, the so-called 'Alicante arrangements' are totally unacceptable for the commercial framework since they only provide for the use of the five languages of the largest countries, which contravenes the principle of non-discrimination between undertakings, creates a directory of main languages, sets precedents for the future and threatens all the official languages.

In this context, we tabled our amendment suggesting that, at the forthcoming Diplomatic Conference on the Revision of the Convention on the Granting of European Patents, all the official languages of the European Union be used on an equal footing so as to ensure that everyone can use his or her own language throughout the process and in order to guarantee the legal security of the patent.
The second issue concerns software and the need for software to remain free of any European Community patent, as we also suggested in our proposal for an amendment.
The unimpeded development of software, specifically of what is known as 'free' software, is a prerequisite for promoting innovation and more widespread use, for guaranteeing the continuity of its creation and its use by the public and for providing added value.
It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that software remains, as it has done until now, free of any restriction imposed by any European Community patent.
Mr President, we should not allow the Community patent to pass as a wasted opportunity.
Everyone is calling for it, but no one has managed to finalise it.
There are two dates which stand out from all this to-ing and fro-ing: 1975 and 1989 and in the meantime, there have been many unsuccessful attempts to finalise this issue.
The Heads of State and Government made the Community patent a priority at Lisbon and it was due to come into being before the end of 2001.
The Feira, Stockholm and Gothenburg European Councils reiterated that there is an urgent need for it.
So what is the current situation?
The Council did not reach an agreement and Parliament, through its Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which was essentially responsible for this matter, proposed a political compromise which I welcome, Mrs de Palacio, but which I feel does not truly meet the expectations of future users, as it does not improve the existing system to any great extent.
Manufacturers and inventors are calling for the cost of the patent to be reduced, so that the patent can be competitive. They also want the respect of legal certainty to be guaranteed with the greatest fairness possible.
The European Commission's proposal is a pragmatic response to these aspirations, focusing on reducing costs.
This can be achieved, firstly, by using the language regime of three working languages of the European Patent Office, which, since it guarantees the threshold of international competitiveness, meets our specific linguistic needs.
Secondly, by recognising the important role played by the national patent offices in providing specific information and technical assistance to inventors and SMEs. And, lastly, by using a legal system that guarantees single jurisdiction by establishing a Community court for intellectual property.
These three fundamental points have attracted the support of those working in the profession.
They are the ones waiting for the patent.
We must not risk creating a Community patent that they would not use because it is too distant from their concerns.
This is the message that we must send to the Council with our vote tomorrow.
Mr President, Mrs de Palacio has demonstrated her legal and political skills and struck the right balance.
My congratulations.
A Europe of free competition, especially in today's age of knowledge and innovation, needs a Community patent if it is to thrive.
Even though we all recognise this, the way in which opposing views have been expressed in the past reveals something which we would do well to take onboard: the huge problem of reconciling straightforward national interests with straightforward Community interests which, in the final analysis, are supposed to serve the individual national interests.
The first attempt to grant a European patent was under the Munich Convention.
However, once it had been granted, it became national law subject to national provisions.
Today we are trying to communitise the European patent following the failure of the endeavour made in the Luxembourg Convention.
I should like to raise three issues. ?he first is language.
Everything has been said and a compromise has, I think, been reached.
However, it would be helpful if at least all the claims in a European patent were translated into every language.
This would reduce the cost of granting a patent considerably, compared with the cost of a European patent applicable in 15 countries.
As far as the main offices are concerned, the idea of giving the European Patent Office a central role, with some of its work delegated to the national offices, is a good idea.
This would combine the advantages of a strong European patent organisation with the de facto strengths of the national agencies by reason of their geographical proximity, knowledge of local conditions, knowledge of the local language and facility to mediate between the public and private sectors.
Close contacts with national patent authorities are of crucial importance for the purpose of information, public support and the dissemination of the information technology contained in patents.
They will also make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access centralised information.
I think that, if we can agree on this basic position, we can also agree on the type of work which could be delegated to the national offices.
Finally, jurisdiction.
The proposed solution, that is, that the patent courts in the Member States should have jurisdiction at first instance, without discrimination, with the Community intellectual property court ruling at appeal, is a happy compromise between centripetal and centrifugal tendencies and will guarantee easy access to the courts, swift justice and affordable appeals, making innovation easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and hence fitting in with European employment policy in general.


Mr President. Industrial intellectual property rights are a useful instrument for the economy and for society in general, and I believe it is only natural to want to tailor them to Community requirements in an internal market.
I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal to create a Community patent.
I should also like to extend my thanks to the rapporteur for all the work she has done.
However, I do not see eye to eye with her on one particular item, namely that of the language regime.
In my view, a Community-based approach also presupposes respect for the Community principle, including the use of language.
And the fact that the discussions on the use of languages have never been absent from the agenda in the debates says a great deal, in my view.
I have also listened very carefully to my fellow French, Italian, German and Spanish MEPs and have ascertained that everyone is calling for a scheme in which their own language is still used to the fullest extent.
Since as long ago as 1958, the citizens of the Member States have had the right to use their own official language in their communication with the European institutions, and also when they communicate before legal bodies of the Community.
In fact, we even enshrined this in a treaty in Amsterdam.
However, while the citizen is given the impression that progress is being made in their linguistic rights, these are increasingly being undermined, and that is certainly the case in the sector of intellectual property rights.
First there was the Trademarks Bureau; this was followed by the drawings and models, and now there is also the patent regulation.
Since then, we have also witnessed a - fortunately frustrated - attempt to no longer translate even generally binding standards which enhance our book-keeping into all official languages.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would therefore urge you to vote consciously tomorrow, to send out a signal to the Council and the Commission to very carefully reconsider the articles concerning the language regime.
We must really prevent a new clause from being added to the list of incidents of unjustifiable discrimination against languages when the regulation on the Community patent enters into force.
I therefore call on you to study these language amendments very carefully and to support them.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after many years of working towards an effective Community patent, we must make it clear that a number of issues still remain to be resolved: the language regime, the differences between the role of the national patent offices and the role of the European Patent Office, and the legal arrangements.
Despite repeated invitations from the Heads of States and Government and successive European Councils, most recently the Barcelona Council, the situation has not improved.
We encountered the same problems in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market over the language issue.
After lengthy debate, the committee opted for the language regime already used in the context of the Community trademark, under which applications can be filed in any of the official languages of the Community.
However, the applicant has to specify a second language as well, known as the language of proceedings, which can be one of five languages - English, French, German, Italian or Spanish - the use of which he accepts as a possible language of proceedings, particularly opposition, revocation or invalidity proceedings.
If the application is filed in a language which is not one of these five languages, the Office will arrange to have the application translated into the language indicated by the applicant.
As I see it, this is not an ideal solution.
For reasons of economy, it would have been preferable to use just one language, English.
Moreover, European industry has called for this.
However, that has not proved possible and so we look forward to the introduction of the Alicante model, which, although perhaps not the best solution, is the only solution possible.
As regards the legal arrangements, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposes that first instance jurisdiction should be at national level, such that appeals can be made to national courts with experience in patent cases as first instance courts for Community patent litigation, while second instance decisions would be the responsibility of the European Chamber for intellectual property.
This is a compromise solution.
We would have preferred one single, centralised first and second instance jurisdiction, which would have ensured greater uniformity of interpretation.
However, the opposition was extremely strong on this matter too.
Lastly, assurance is given that the national patent offices will be able to continue to play an important role in the procedures for granting the Community patent.
In other words, in our opinion, the solution adopted is not completely satisfactory, but it does mean that this complex issue is closed.
I believe that, in her heart of hearts, even the rapporteur, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi - whom I do, of course, congratulate on her work - shares these concerns.
However, Parliament has merely a consultative role in this procedure, it is not colegislator.
We therefore give the report the thumbs-up, in the hope that the Council of Ministers will be able to come to a swift agreement without hiding behind any excuses.
The Commission welcomes the report prepared by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi.
At a moment when the Council is still struggling with the Community patent, it is important that Parliament should deliver its opinion on this difficult and complex issue.
The report of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi addresses all the key issues that are relevant to the Community patent.
Several of the proposed amendments enshrine principles that the Commission is ready to consider favourably.
Firstly, there is the principle enshrined in Amendment No 8 to allow testing for the sole purpose of receiving market authorisation after the expiry of the patent - the so-called Bowler exception.
The Commission has already proposed a similar line in its revision and whilst not committing myself to the exact wording, I can inform Parliament that the Commission will carefully consider the issue, taking into account the need for the Community patent and Member States' national patents to produce identical rights.
But Amendment No 18 on the same issue goes too far and cannot be accepted.
A second example regards Amendments Nos 1, 6, 7, 21, 27 and 39.
These amendments refer to the national patent offices.
The Commission recognises the important role of those national patent offices. The Commission can also agree in principle that they should participate in the processing of Community patent applications provided that four conditions are met: first, to ensure the quality and uniformity of Community patents, national patent offices and their participation should be set in a properly defined framework.
Partnership agreements with the European Patent Office, with quality criteria and mechanisms for quality control would constitute a proper framework.
Secondly, national patent offices' participation could go as far as doing the prior search - a suggestion made earlier this evening by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi.
Thirdly, the applicant should always be free to ask that his application should be processed exclusively by the European Patent Office.
Finally, national patent offices and their participation should be restricted by clear quantitative limits.
But even with this clarification, I should like to stress that the participation of national patent offices is a matter on which the Community alone cannot decide.
It is thus not an issue for the regulation but should be negotiated in the framework of the European Patent Organisation.
A third example is Amendment No 9 on the distribution of income from renewal fees.
While the Commission can agree to the principle of distribution of part of the fee income to Member States or their patent offices to be used for innovation promotion purposes, it nevertheless considers that this issue should be dealt with in the context of the European Patent Organisation.
It remains to be discussed whether the importance of the patent office is the right distribution key.
Some of the proposed amendments are not in line with the objectives of the Community patent and cannot therefore be accepted.
Today the driving force for a Community patent is the competitiveness of European industry at a global level.
There is no point in creating an instrument unless it is affordable enough and offers a sufficient level of legal certainty for it to be used by our inventors and our industry.
The Commission continues to believe in affordable language and translation regimes.
Here two different issues are involved.
The first one is the language for the processing of patent applications and for the granting of the patent, including translations of applications.
The European Patent Office functions well with a three-language regime.
It is not necessary to modify it, whether by reducing the number of languages, as has been suggested by some, or by adding more languages.
In particular, adding two or more working languages to the European Patent Office would considerably complicate its work. It would put a heavy burden on its cost-effectiveness.
The European Patent Convention allows, in principle, EU citizens to submit the initial application in their own language and compensation is provided for those applicants who must translate their applications into one of the working languages of the European Patent Office.
I should also like to add that the language regime of the European Patent Office cannot be decided by the Community alone.
That is the first issue.
The second issue concerns translations of the patent once it has been granted.
If the amendments imply that the patent would have to be translated in its entirety into all official Community languages which soon will be either 19 or 20, depending on whether Maltese becomes an official language, this would make the patent so expensive that the Community patent system would simply not be used.
I remind Parliament that we have been here before.
There has been a Luxembourg Convention which required translations of the whole patent into all the official languages.
That convention has remained a dead letter - it has never been used.
Surely we do not want to repeat the same mistake.
Let me give some examples of the costs that would be involved: there would be EUR 17 000 for translations just in the Community of 15 Member States.
Last but not least, costs must be evaluated, taking account of enlargement.
Translations into 19 Community languages, excluding Maltese, would cost around EUR 31 500 per patent.
For all these reasons the Commission cannot accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 2, 22, 31, 32(2), 32(3), nor Amendment No 36.
The Commission would like to accept Amendment No 34.
This does not mean that the Commission would systematically oppose any translation requirements of a part of the patent or patent application or of other information.
After all, there is the patent in its entirety, a summary and the claims.
So we may be talking about different requirements for translation.
The Commission could accept such translations of parts of the patent provided that they were truly useful and that the overall Community patent system remains affordable, simple, cost-effective and legally certain.
In this respect Amendment No 25, part of Amendment No 19(1), 30 and parts of 32(1) and 32(4) merit closer evaluation.
But parts of Amendments Nos 19(1), 19(2), 19(3) and 19(4), part of Amendments Nos 20, 28 and part of Amendment No 31(4) are unacceptable.
Firstly, there is no reason to require a translation of the patent into the language in which the initial application has been submitted. That already exists.
Secondly, the Community budget should simply not be used to finance translations, nor should applicants be obliged to use the translation services of the European institutions.
Thirdly, the patent should be published by the European Patent Office in the Community Patents Bulletin and not in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Fourthly, Article 44(3), as proposed by the Commission, offers sufficient guarantees to protect third parties in good faith.
There is no reason to require further formalities from a patent holder who wishes to enforce his patents.
On the other hand, Article 11(3) cannot be deleted because it corresponds to Article 44(3); it just applies in the pre-grant phase.
Finally, the procedural languages of the courts will have to be determined in a separate context and not here.
The Commission also has difficulties with Amendments Nos 23, 24 and 38 on the relationship with the European Patent Organisation.
The Commission continues to believe in a user-friendly system where applicants can obtain a European patent and a Community patent in one go from the European Patent Office.
The accession to the European Patents Convention will enable this.
It will also enable sufficient legal and political control over the European Patent Office, taking into account that the European Patent Office is not a Community body.
As far as the judicial system, about which a number of Members have spoken, is concerned, the Commission is prepared to consider Amendments Nos 26 and 29 in principle, but in the light of the new EC Treaty provisions - namely Articles 225a and 229a - adopted by the Nice Treaty.
The Treaty introduced the possibility to set up Community judicial panels to handle cases in first instance with the possibility of appeal to the Court of First Instance of the European Communities.
The setting up of such a system would naturally be possible only once the Nice Treaty has entered into force and it requires a separate Commission proposal.
However, the Commission has major difficulties with Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 and 10 to 17.
There should be a high level of expertise and unitary case-law right from the start. That pleads for a centralised Community jurisdiction.
The system proposed in the amendments would not provide this, because some national courts would have so few cases to handle that they could not build up or maintain the necessary expertise. That could result in divergent case-law and quasi-systematic appeals to a higher court.
This would imply higher litigation costs and also that parties would have to wait longer for the final decision.
I should also like to recall that it is highly doubtful whether the articles of the EC Treaty, to which the amendments refer, would allow a system as proposed in those amendments.
As regards reporting on the application of the regulation, the Commission is ready to prepare the first report at the latest within five years of the entry into force of the regulation.
Should the Commission believe that earlier reporting is required, it will do so.
Moreover, the formulation in the Commission proposals, which focuses on the costs for obtaining and renewing the patents, should already cover all relevant cost factors.
It also goes without saying that the Commission will propose amendments whenever this is appropriate.
Therefore the Commission cannot, regrettably, endorse Amendment No 33.
Finally, the Commission considers that Amendment Nos 35 and 37 are unacceptable.
The Commission has presented a proposal for a directive on the patentability of software-related inventions, which is now before Parliament and the Council.
Therefore a debate on this question should be carried out in that context and not in this.
I would like to thank Members for their support and collaboration on this important regulation.
I hope that Europe will soon be able to improve its performance at the global level by offering its industry a competitive, unitary, affordable and legally secure Community patent.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the two following recommendations for second reading:
A5-0100/2000 by Mr Florenz on the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (11304/1/2001 - C5-0636/2001 - 2000/0158(COD));
A5-0097/2002 by Mr Florenz on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Council common position for adopting the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment ((11356/1/2001 - C5-0637/2001 - 2000/0159(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, as rapporteur I regret the fact that a relatively interesting report on the issue of how electronic scrap is to be recycled in Europe in future is being debated in the middle of the night.
When I tell people in my constituency at home that we discuss subjects like this at anything up to midnight, nobody believes me.
But the administration cannot seem to find any other solution.
I am often asked why we need a directive of this kind.
Do we need yet another European law to address the issue of electronic scrap?
The answer is relatively simple.
We have seven to eight million tonnes of scrap in the European Community every year, and every year there is an extra million tonnes.
That alone is sufficient for us to acknowledge that we are really not just talking about scrap here, but about recyclable material which future generations should not be deprived of, and which should certainly not be dumped on landfill sites.
That brings me to the European Parliament's first request.
In the course of our various deliberations and committee decisions, we have written a ban on disposable equipment into the directive, which should send a message to the European public that an electric shaver should no longer be thrown into the dustbin, but that it should be collected separately, because it is recyclable.
The EU Member States, and above all my own country, have very limited ambitions in this area and believe that it is not necessary to make such demands of the Member States and of Europe's citizens.
The Member States have an equally low level of commitment as regards what collection targets we should aim for in future.
The Member States believe that an optional collection rate of 4 kg is the right way to go.
I can only say this: why should a Parliament like ours bother with this report if the end result is not binding and is actually lower than the targets already being achieved?
Because the United Kingdom, believe it or not, is already achieving far more than we are calling for, namely a binding 6 kg collection rate.
An important point here is of course who meets the costs.
Opinions on that are divided in this House as well.
I believe that the Commission originally brought forward a very good proposal, which it unfortunately subsequently departed from again.
With regard to costs, there are two models, one for historical waste and another for new equipment.
As far as historical waste is concerned, the costs should be borne collectively, because this can no longer be achieved individually.
You know that there are a great many orphan products; there are non-branded products and it is no longer possible to allocate precisely those products.
That is why collective financing is needed here.
However, up to the point of collection, for example in the city centre, the costs are to be borne by the companies.
There are a few individual Members of this House who believe that in future even a toothbrush should be collected by the producers from the user's bathroom.
I am of course exaggerating somewhat, but I want to make it clear that enormous costs are involved here: exactly 50% of the costs are incurred between the front door and the collection point.
I am convinced that in many cases this will impose a heavy burden on medium-sized companies throughout Europe.
That is why I believe that in future the costs borne by companies should be from the collection point and not from the front door.
In the case of collective historical waste, we have proposed an alternative form of cost allocation with the voluntary visible fee for companies.
That also helps to answer the question of whether there will be any retroactive effect in this area.
Particularly in cases where costs are borne collectively, and are separately identified, this issue of retroactivity, which we debated so passionately in this House when we were discussing the end-of-life vehicle directive, might be addressed.
When it comes to the financing of new products, as I see it, and as this House in general sees it, we are looking at individual cost allocation.
There are many good reasons for doing that, and in fact that is where there is scope for innovation and motivation, because, in future, companies will have to accept that their fridges will be returned to their yard.
They will at long last have to find a way of dismantling them more easily and more cost-effectively.
It is precisely for that reason that we are proposing individual responsibility here.
We would not grant the Member States any individual scope for decision making; it should be the companies that do that on an individual basis.
As far as I am concerned, it is very important that costs should be borne up to the point of collection in this case too.
We are at present going through the implementation of the end-of-life vehicle directive, on which this House also decided that companies should pay everything, so that the companies are now saying - and I mean real blue-chip companies in my country - that if you pay everything, you should also set the price!
It is precisely that which is not consumer-friendly.
That is why I would really like to warn you against thinking that collection from people's front doors is a consumer-friendly act, Mrs van Brempt.
It is not, because the companies alone are then responsible for how high the collection and recycling costs actually are.
There is then no third-party control.
I am enough of an entrepreneur to know that it is an opportunity for companies, if you say - as the Council and unfortunately now Mrs WallstrÃ¶m too are saying - that the costs should at least be borne from the collection point.
We will then end up again with exactly the same patchwork quilt that we were trying to get rid of by means of this directive.
We have said that we want to harmonise the various different regulations in Europe in the long run, with the aim of achieving comparable rules.
That was one of my great ideals and reasons for getting involved in Europe, because I said that this enormous internal market should take advantage of its synergies. And then - because we are such good people - we go and allow for individual and even 15 separate options in this internal market.
That just cannot be right.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this directive serves those Member States which are already working hard, achieving targets and have built up systems and that we are anxious that those Member States, and I particularly have in mind countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, should be able to keep their existing systems.
I would have to be crazy if I wanted to penalise those countries and say that they have to adopt the European system now.
Of course not, they should achieve the targets, and if they comply with those targets and rates and guidelines, then they should be able to keep their financing systems over a period of about 10 years.
Over the last few days, industry has written some angry letters, because a decision in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy missed the target, namely how can we prevent free-riders in future when it comes to new products?
You all know about those special offers just before Christmas, when big companies buy 10 000 fridges in the Pacific Rim which are then marketed any old how through some kind of agent, and then, all of a sudden, once the fridges have been sold this agent and importer disappear and the SMEs who then have to foot the bill are the ones that suffer.
Industry itself has to develop guarantees to protect itself from free-riders.
Industry is clever enough to protect itself against such free-riders, or, if you will excuse the expression, these wolves.
I regard this as a very up-to-the-minute form of protection for SMEs.
There is a rather euphoric tendency, Commissioner, to overuse the word 're-use' in this area.
Re-use sounds very good at first, but is it really as good as we think?
A ten-year-old fridge is an incredible power-guzzler.
The amount of water consumed by a twenty-year-old washing machine is phenomenal.
So re-use is not necessarily the best solution - it needs to be considered with a critical eye.
I hope that you will agree with me.
I have made a very modest 10% increase in the rate of recovery, because in the foreseeable future we can expect a ban on landfill.
I have left the recycling and re-use rates, because they are entry rates and because industry, including smaller industries, needs to follow these entry rates.
It is no great feat to increase the rates by 20% - for example, for a mobile phone like this - and nor is it a political masterstroke, but the vital issue for me is what they do with the recyclable material.
We are seeking a ban on six dangerous substances as quickly as possible.
We have brought this forward from 2008 to 2006.
Commissioner, I would be pleased if you would follow these initiatives and motivate your colleagues in the Member States.
They were not particularly ambitious about the electronic scrap regulation.
Thank you very much, Mr Florenz.
I have every sympathy with your complaint about the timing of this debate.
However, and this is by no means false modesty, I must point out that it is neither the administrators nor the President of the Parliament that sets the agenda, but rather, in all their wisdom, the political group chairmen.
If the powers that be decide that we should discuss issues like NATO and defence, for which we have no responsibility, during the day, then so be it.
Many of them base their actions on the principle that detailed knowledge simply obscures their judgment, and then we end up with agendas like this.
I cannot do anything about it either!
Mr President, I fully support the idea behind this directive but there are certain tests to which we should submit the proposal and our amendments.
Firstly, would existing successful arrangements for dealing with electronic waste be allowed to continue?
I believe there is a danger that they would not.
Parliament's amendments emphasise individual producer responsibility so that none can escape the net of the directive, but this means changing existing collective responsibility systems.
The rapporteur has dealt with this by allowing for such collective responsibility agreements to continue for 10 years after the entry into force of the directive.
That will create two systems in one EU and lead to distortions of competition.
I look forward, with some trepidation, to the problems which we will encounter at conciliation on that one.
Secondly, are we legislating with open eyes about the cost of what is proposed?
No, we are not.
The cost impact assessment in the original proposal is inevitably inadequate.
The British Government has done a cost-impact assessment, learning from the fridges debacle.
It has estimated a possible annual implementation cost for this directive at EUR 500 million, with a maximum save in landfill costs of approximately EUR 15 million a year.
Do we have similar estimates from other countries?
No, we do not.
Will they legislate without counting the cost?
Yes, in all probability they will.
Thirdly, should we consider the interests of small businesses?
Clearly the rapporteur thinks not because he has deleted in Amendment No 15 the possibility of giving micro-companies five years' grace to comply with the directive and take advantage of the technical changes that bigger companies may pioneer.
I very much regret this and will not support that amendment.
Fourthly, does what we are doing help responsible companies?
Not yet.
As it stands, the directive creates the possibility that some companies may end up paying for free-riders on the system.
We look forward to hearing the Commissioner's reply on Amendment No 92.
Fifthly, are we being fair to local authorities?
No, the amendments ignore them.
Sixthly, is it wise to increase the recycling targets?
No.
It is not done on the basis of any assessment of cost or practicability.
Parliament habitually increases targets - any targets.
It is a very bad trade union habit and one that we should get away from.
Mr President, travelling across the Union can sometimes seem like travelling in a time machine.
Starting off in Britain, which still has a poor recycling record, the WEEE Directive looks like the future.
But when you visit Denmark or the Netherlands where electrical and electronic waste is routinely collected, you see that the Commission directive is really only an attempt to harmonise and build on the best practice of the present.
It is only those of us who still live in the past, Mr Bowe, who find it challenging and ambitious.
It certainly will play a major part in waste-management policy and that is for the good.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wants to encourage recycling, good product design, best-use resources and reduce pollution.
We strongly support the principle of producer responsibility.
There is a lot still to be agreed between Parliament and the Council through the conciliation process and the fact that we are going to be engaged in lengthy discussion is a tribute to the rapporteur, who has done so much to bring all the political parties in this House together so that we are united and will almost certainly secure qualified majority voting on many amendments tomorrow.
In particular I welcome his latest compromise proposal on paying for the costs of dealing with orphan waste.
I do not believe that large legitimate manufacturers should have to pay the costs created by other companies, whether they be free-riders or small organisations.
I am pleased that encouragement is now being given to re-use materials where environmentally appropriate, and I thank my colleagues across the House for the support they have given me in opposing the development of these so-called clever chips.
My words may fall on some deaf ears here but I would ask Members to consider giving their support to a couple of amendments I have tabled.
Amendment No 82 attempts to address the concern of cable manufacturers by making clear that financial responsibility for WEEE rests with the producer of the finished equipment and not with individual component manufacturers.
I thought we were all agreed on that point.
Amendment No 71 represents a plea for help for plastic recyclers.
I conclude by saying with a certain mischievous glee, as someone who has campaigned for better recycling in my own country for 30 years, that I rather hope that this directive puts a bomb under my own local authorities and recalcitrant government.
Thank you, Mr President. I too should like to add my words of praise to Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, the rapporteur.
In addition, I should like to thank the other shadow rapporteurs for their fruitful cooperation.
This is modern environmental policy. We are supporting pioneering businesses, instead of what we usually do, namely coasting along at a European mean rate, and granting the countries that are lagging behind another three years' respite.
Nearly the whole of Parliament will be voting in favour of individual producer responsibility tomorrow.
This is new.
Nine years ago we saw the adoption of the packaging directive. We Greens were on our own with our plea.
We opted for producer responsibility rather than individual responsibility in respect of recycling cars.
And now, tomorrow, the long-awaited moment will arrive.
Individual producer responsibility.
Why are both major groups now adopting the Green line?
One reason is that pioneering businesses have now started lobbying.
Electrolux in Sweden deserves credit in this respect.
A year ago, Philips was still opposed to the concept, but it is now keeping a low profile.
The well-known environmental principle is: the polluter pays, not: polluters pay.
And certainly not: consumers pay, as is the case in the Dutch system.
There is a collective system in the Netherlands. Everyone - every consumer - pays a waste disposal fee.
This system encourages laziness in producers.
Responsibility for individual products stands for innovation, which benefits the environment and, ultimately, pushes the price down for the consumer.
If a business makes a product which lasts twice as long, the recycling costs will be twice as low.
If they stop using dangerous substances, they will not need to pick up the bill for disposing of these later on.
The new regulation will enter into force in 2006 if it is up to Parliament, or in 2007 if it is up to the Council.
In my view, this would be a good time to review the Dutch system as well.
In that case, we will be able to avoid the two Europes which Mrs Jackson referred to, and we will not have to wait for the ten years on which we agreed as a compromise.
We must, however, convince the Council tomorrow, as the Council has produced shoddy work.
Countries can choose between an individual or a collective system.
That does not work.
We have one market and we thus need one system for the whole of Europe.
Mr President, our political group regards the main features of this proposal very favourably.
The problems associated with waste are among the greatest environmental problems we have to tackle, and we like the idea of finding an overall solution whose objectives are, in the end, to reduce the total quantity of waste, to increase the amount of recycling and, at the same time, to reduce discharges of hazardous substances in connection with the treatment of waste.
A cleverly thought-out directive can also give a boost to better product design on the part of the big manufacturers.
Even at the first reading we had achieved fairly broad compromises in Parliament, and I think it has been a strength that we have been able to retain most of these compromises at the second reading too.
It also means that we are in a strong position in relation to the Council of Ministers when we reach the conciliation stage.
I would thank the rapporteur for his valuable cooperation and open-minded attitude.
When it comes to the directive on hazardous substances, there is one aspect we are particularly pleased with, and that is the proposal that a ban on hazardous substances such as lead and cadmium be introduced by no later than 2006.
Nor must this present any obstacle to those countries which wish to progress more quickly and which already have more progressive legislation in quite a few of these areas.
Where the WEEE Directive is concerned, the fundamental issue for us is that of manufacturers' direct liability, which must be as clear as possible.
On the one hand, it is an issue of principle that manufacturers should pay their own costs.
On the other hand, direct and total liability on the part of manufacturers means that there would be a genuine incentive for product development and for making different products as easy to recycle as possible.
The Council's proposal can be improved in a number of further respects.
For example, small manufacturers should be included. We also wish to avoid the problem of free-riders, to which I think Amendment No 92 may be a good solution.
We also, of course, support the demands for higher recycling quotas, as well as the specific minimum levels of collection per person.
Thank you, Mr President. I should like to congratulate Mr Florenz on his report.
I support the thrust of his approach.
However, there are a few points with regard to which we must continue to keep a check on reality.
I am talking about light bulbs, television tubes and fire retardants.
Light bulbs only have a limited impact on the environment.
The separate collection of these is not environmentally effective.
It is therefore not sensible to ban lead in the glass of light bulbs.
This would result in light bulbs becoming very fragile, which would be a problem, particularly during manufacture.
For reasons of safety, I am in favour of the use of lead in television tubes.
If we were to prohibit lead in these, we could definitely expect more accidents to happen.
In actual fact, the same applies to fire retardants.
I am in favour of the ban on brominated fire retardants, which have clearly been demonstrated to be harmful.
However, I believe that to prohibit all fire retardants would be taking matters one step too far.
The disposal of gases with a considerable global-warming potential is not very effective.
The contribution which would be made to controlling the greenhouse effect is virtually zero.
Moreover, I should like to call attention to the risk of electronic waste being dumped in countries outside the European Union under the guise of re-use.
The Member States must therefore ensure that only usable electrical and electronic equipment which will actually be re-used is exported to countries outside the European Union.
Finally, I should like to ask the European Commission, namely Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, when she will be reviewing the batteries directive.
The European Commission's argument has always been that this review proposal could become a reality as soon as the proposal for a directive on electronic waste has been drafted.
I hope that this is now the last time I will have to prompt the European Commission on this matter.
Mr President, like everyone else I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for the work he has done on this proposal.
He has worked very hard on it and moved it quite fast, in parliamentary terms.
When you consider the full implications, what he has achieved has been quite phenomenal.
This is the most extensive recycling scheme we have ever seen in Europe.
Unfortunately, we live in an increasingly throw-away society where we produce more and more waste.
What I am pleased to see with this proposal is that we are finally moving in the direction when the days when we can throw fridges, televisions, toasters, mobile phones and other electrical goods into a landfill are over.
We all want to see a new era in which environmentally-friendly electric goods are fully recycled or reused.
We all need to play our part in this as consumers and become habitual recyclers.
But are these proposals going to help us?
Furthermore, are Parliament's amendments going to make things better?
In large part I can say 'yes', but not entirely.
Too rigid an application of the principle of individual responsibility will cause major problems for small- and medium-sized enterprises across Europe and prevent sensible collective schemes being implemented.
Enforced mandatory separation of electronic waste at each household, which could then, when non-compliance is found, be threatened with punishment is not a sensible way to encourage the cooperation of consumers nor is it, in every case, technically feasible.
Do we really want to include consumable spare parts and sub-assemblies in this proposal even if they add contamination and enormous technical problems to the recycling process?
Does not everyone realise that small firms throughout the European Union need some extra time and assistance to cope with their full responsibilities and do this job properly?
All this leads me to think that we need a bit more time.
After tomorrow's vote we should all pause for some thought about how we can make this directive fully environmentally friendly, cost-effective and attractive to the public.
Mr President, in the part of Helsinki where I grew up, a waste truck is doing the rounds this week.
WEEE waste can also be put into it upon payment of a special fee.
One kilo per person per year is collected in the district.
In another part of Finland, where 'Rosk'n Roll' operates, waste is collected and advice dispensed in return for a special eco-fee. Europe's fifteenth largest waste recycling company also operates here - on the principles of the market economy.
Eight kilos of WEEE waste per person is collected.
I think we have something to learn from this practical example, as we also have from the matter of oil waste at sea and the way in which it is treated.
There must be common systems in which the principles of the market economy apply.
There must be no benefit from throwing things away.
I support the rapporteur's proposal because I believe that it fulfils these requirements.
I would nonetheless observe that the proposal on brominated flame retardants does not in reality take account of the environment because it may lead to our having a great need to collect waste as long as we are not able to use plastic in some other way.
I do not in actual fact believe that the amendment concerning flame retardants is of any benefit to the environment.
Mr President, I welcome this directive and thank the rapporteur for his hard work.
This will mean that electric and electronic waste will have to be collected and recycled instead of dumped - as in my own country - with negative effects on the environment.
Producers need to be responsible for their own products to ensure that future products live up to a more environmentally responsible design.
For example, the insides of televisions can now be made completely of plastic instead of plastic and metal, making them easier to recycle.
Such producers should be rewarded for designing to reduce waste at competitive prices.
Consumers need to be involved in this process in order for the directive to be a success.
Easy access to collection systems is absolutely essential and consumers must be able to return products free of charge.
Making producers responsible for their own brand products will lead to improvements of design and have a direct effect on the costs.
The loosely-framed common position must be tightened up to discourage free-riders who do not take responsibility for their own waste.
Here I welcome the amendment on orphan waste products.
Finally, it is vital to have comparable rules implemented in all Member States. Otherwise we will simply have chaos.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, on this milestone in environmental policy.
I would like to comment on two great causes of concern. The first is that existing collection systems could be destroyed.
I do not share Mrs Jackson's viewpoint, in fact I believe that they could continue to operate.
But it would not be unreasonable if some change were necessary after ten years.
Secondly, cities and municipalities are terrified that it will be incredibly expensive for them.
However, it need not cost the municipality anything at all, because they would of course be able to recover the cost from consumers via waste charges.
I regard it as being very dangerous to take over costs from producers at least from the collection point.
In view of the late hour, I will take the liberty of becoming literary: I almost regard this as an un-European way of doing things.
One final word about Finland. I am sorry for the Finns that things are in such a mess there, but it not the only thing to go wrong in Finland.
They even want to build a new nuclear power station!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion the directive on electronic waste should first and foremost serve the environment.
We support all amendments that reinforce the environmental objective.
However, the environment does not benefit from European rules that are opposed to collective systems.
Producers must be individually responsible, that goes without saying.
Producers must be encouraged to use eco designs, I agree on that score too.
However, individual funding is not the answer.
Different makes of hairdryers, electrical toothbrushes, hand blenders, kettles, TV sets etc., hardly differ in terms of recyclability.
Individual funding will therefore hardly benefit the environment.
Collective systems, however, are less bureaucratic and more practical.
There is therefore no reason why collective systems should only be called upon in exceptional circumstances.
My second point concerns the waste disposal fee.
Why should this not be visible?
I can understand the underlying rationale, that environmental costs must be incorporated in the price, but should this be done invisibly at all costs?
Would it not be more transparent if it were mentioned?
Visibility would certainly enhance awareness on the part of the consumer, and this is of major importance, as consumer cooperation is crucial if we are to achieve the environmental objectives.
Mr President, I warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Karl-Heinz Florenz.
Under his direction Parliament has been able to have a central role in bringing together the views of consumer associations, environmental organisations and producers also.
The prevailing and uncommon mood of consensus is a resource that all parties should cherish, also bearing in mind future plans for acts.
The directive will be an important application with regard to the producer's responsibility.
I am satisfied that in many respects I have been able to strengthen and clarify it through my amendments.
Producer responsibility will have a huge impact on the volume and quality of waste electric and electronic equipment, greater than any other possible decision that Parliament might take regarding waste.
It will create incentives for more environmentally friendly design and for innovations before products have yet come on the market and so reduce the ecological burden of products throughout their lifetime.
Similarly we are now creating alternative methods for treating waste to act as an incentive, resulting in an ecological burden that is as light as possible.
The amendment I tabled with this in mind was adopted by Parliament at first reading and the Council adopted it in its common position in a formulation that was further improved.
The European Union is now making legislation that will clearly show to the rest of the world that the conflict between consideration for the environment and the economy is not unavoidable but one that can be settled through carefully considered legislation.
That is why it seems foolish that the Council wanted to allow collective financing - in practice a waste tax - not just with regard to historical but also future waste.
For one thing it would not be an incentive for ecodesign, which in practice would mean the whole directive would be watered down.
Secondly, it would allow an opportunity for 'free-rider', which would penalise honest and respectable producers.
Thirdly, it would increase the public tax burden since no proportional reduction in existing taxes can be anticipated.
The Council's common position therefore means fiscal greed to be endured by consumers, producers and the environment alike, although, fortunately, it would seem that Parliament is on their side.
I think Parliament's work in connection with this directive has succeeded so well as a process that it would be worth exploring and clarifying what courses of action we could adopt more frequently for the future.
If we were in the habit of erecting statues to legislative projects we might now build one gladly.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Florenz for the work carried out in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and for the cooperation with the Commission.
Let me briefly recall why we are tackling the specific problem of electrical and electronic waste.
It is the fastest-growing part of the waste stream, indeed it is growing three times faster than the average.
Each of us produces on average about 14 kgs per year of this waste and by the year 2010, when this directive is fully operational, electrical and electronic waste will account for over 8% of the entire municipal waste stream.
Once adopted and implemented the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment will allow us to divert this type of waste from landfills and incinerators to environmentally sound re-use and recycling.
The directive on restricting hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment will prevent the presence of unnecessary hazardous substances, posing risks for human health and the environment in various stages of the life-cycle of such equipment, including its waste management.
The work undertaken by the European Parliament substantially reinforces the original proposal, and I welcome the majority of the amendments tabled.
In particular I support the strengthening of individual financing, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, and limiting collective systems to those cases where these are necessary for practical reasons.
This can help to internalise waste management costs into the product price and give incentives for a better design for re-use and recycling.
It is a first step towards fuller integration of environmental considerations into product design and consumption patterns.
We also need to find appropriate solutions for the financing of historical waste put on the market before the entry into force of this directive.
One of the options to achieve this may also be the use of a visible fee.
This should, however, be done in line with Articles 88 and 89 of the Treaty.
I welcome the principle of increasing the collection target to 6 kgs per capita and per year, though the timetable foreseen needs to be more realistic and take into account the time needed to collect and process data.
I also support the proposal to advance the phase-out date for the substance bans in the RoHS directive to 2006, though this should be done in accordance with the principles set out in Article 95 of the Treaty.
Let me also answer some of the points raised during the debate.
I can assure you that we have carefully evaluated all aspects of this proposal, including its costs.
For the overall target of 4 kg per capita collected waste, we estimate that the costs will be in the region of EUR 500 to 900 million.
We also base our estimates and evaluation on the existing systems, of which there are not many: the Netherlands is the one example from which we can draw conclusions and learn lessons.
These figures have been confirmed by practical experience, for example in the Netherlands.
If Parliament wants to increase the collection target, this is obviously a political decision, and we agree with that.
When it comes to subsidiarity, we have tried to strike an appropriate balance between harmonising certain elements of the proposal and leaving others to subsidiarity.
This is why the way the collection systems operate is left to the Member States.
We also think it is not necessary to define at Community level who is to finance the collection point up to the moment the equipment is brought to it.
This is why we reject both Amendments Nos 69 and 83.
What about small and medium-sized enterprises?
The Committee on the Environment has voted in favour of deleting a temporary exemption for SMEs from the financing obligations of the directive.
We can accept this point as we think that practice has shown that there are no excessive costs for these companies and that such an exemption is not needed, and it might even lead to market distortions.
Mr Blokland, I hope that any day now we will be able to present the batteries proposal and I am working hard on that.
Finally, a total of 82 amendments have been tabled on the WEEE directive and 18 on the RoHS directive.
On the waste electrical and electronic equipment proposal, the Commission can accept 32 amendments in full, two in part and 20 in principle.
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 9, 11-19, 24, 27-37, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 50, 57, 65, 76 and 77.
In Amendment No 23, the Commission supports a new paragraph 1 and paragraph 1(b), last subparagraph in full and paragraph 1(b), third and fourth subparagraphs as well as paragraph 2 in principle.
In Amendment No 73, the Commission can accept the first part.
In Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, the first, third and fourth sentences can be accepted in full.
In Amendments Nos 20, 21 and 41, the first sentence can be accepted in full.
Amendments Nos 42, 48, 49, 51-55, 66, 78 and 92 can be accepted in principle.
On the RoHS proposal, the Commission can accept four amendments in full, one in part and seven in principle.
The amendments acceptable in full are Nos 3, 4, 10 and 17.
Amendment No 5 can be accepted in part - first paragraph - and in Amendments Nos 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the first paragraph can be accepted in full and Amendments Nos 13 and 15 in principle.
I thank all Members for this important debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0090/2002) by Mrs Ries on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the 24th time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (pentabromodiphenyl ether) (12332/1/2001 - C5-0638/2001 - 2001/0018(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 27 October 2000, the Council of Ministers adopted its common position on this draft directive on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances, specifically pentabromodiphenyl ether, a flame retardant used - I would reiterate - almost exclusively in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam.
PentaBDE builds up and remains in the environment, it escapes from the foam and enters our blood stream and nervous system via the atmosphere.
I therefore welcome the fact that the common position - as, in fact, was suggested by Parliament at the vote at first reading - is placing a ban on pentaBDE in all its forms, including when it is the residue from the manufacture of a related chemical product, namely octabromodiphenyl ether.
This ban is due to come into force in July 2003.
As far as the rest of the text is concerned, however, I would say that we still have a great deal of work to do.
The Council, which is supporting the opinion of the Commission on this issue, has rejected Parliament's proposal to extend the scope of the directive to cover all the polybromodiphenyl ethers on the market, namely octaBDE and decaBDE.
We must make it clear there are two arguments for justifying this refusal, which a majority of the Member States opposes. The first is that we must wait for the final results of the risk assessments in progress; the second is that we must ensure, before any ban is placed on a flame retardant, that equally effective substitute products are available.
I would like to reiterate that this is precisely the reasoning that Parliament followed at first reading, and also that used by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy during its vote on 21 March, with regard to decabromodiphenyl ether in both cases.
In other words, by calling for a deferred ban on this substance to come into force no later than 1 January 2006, depending on the final results of the risk assessment, Parliament is taking into account the latest available scientific information forwarded by the United Kingdom, which is the Member State acting as rapporteur on the environmental aspects of the risk assessment.
The British experts concluded with a proposal to the authorities responsible to consider the need to apply the precautionary principle to both octaBDE and to decaBDE.
The European Parliament is also responding to the Council and Commission's desire to respect the rules laid down by the 1993 regulation on the assessment and control of existing substances, on the existence of substitutes and on the difficult balance that needed to be found between the obvious advantages in terms of safety in the event of fire, on the one hand, and the harmful effects of these products on the environment and health, on the other.
In this respect, I would point out that decaBDE, which constitutes 80% of bromine fire protection products, is a particularly resistant and effective flame retardant.
In the United Kingdom in 2000 alone, 155 lives were saved and thousands of cases of severe burns were avoided thanks to these substances.
That is why the Committee on the Environment wanted to phase in the precautionary principle rather than apply it rigidly, as I said.
This is the purpose of Amendment No 4, which was unanimously adopted, and it is also why I am opposed, as I was at first reading and during the vote in committee, to Amendments Nos 9 and 10 tabled by Mrs SchÃ¶rling and Mr SjÃ¶stedt.
I am, however, in favour of Amendment No 7, tabled by these Members, which is much clearer in its wording in that it explicitly refers to decaBDE in the recitals.
As regards octaBDE and its imminent ban, which I believe is justified, there is no further information to reassure us on this substance and Parliament is therefore unable to change its position adopted on 6 September 2001.
The results of the risk assessments currently in progress forwarded by the French Government remain applicable; they are preliminary results revealing that octaBDE is harmful to human health and the environment.
There is a further reason for our request to limit the marketing of this flame retardant which justifies the reintroduction of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3, and that is that octaBDE is used in a fairly small number of products and can be replaced in many cases by decabromodyphenl ether, and this is why my fellow Members and myself call for the precautionary principle to prevail over all other considerations.
To sum up, I have some brief comments to put to the Commissioner.
The Commission is developing programmes, greatly increasing the number of initiatives in order to ensure even greater levels of protection for human health and the environment.
The new strategy on chemical products launched by your services is the best example of this.
It would be a strong, reassuring signal if you made a commitment to implementing a risk reduction policy for all polybromodiphenyl ethers without delay.
I have, of course, noted the progress that the Commission has made in this area with its declaration attached to the minutes of the common position, where it undertakes to consider as a matter of urgency the need for a new proposal to restrict the marketing and use of octaBDE and decaBDE, but the conditions applied - namely, that it is still necessary to wait for the results of the risk assessments - mean, in this case, that the timetable for introducing urgent measures is at risk of being further overloaded.
Where scientific doubt persists, it is necessary to make a political choice.
That is why I think that we do not need to wait for a never-ending story to unfold to analyse the risks but to unite and promote a balanced solution. The most important thing is to reconcile the immediate safety of our citizens from fire risks with the longer-term benefits for public health and the environment.
Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, and the cooperation she has had with other rapporteurs has been very helpful.
This is an interesting issue.
These substances are dangerous, they are toxic.
But they also have an extremely useful and important role in that they save lives in their role as fire-retardants.
There is absolutely no question about that fact.
We have to very carefully consider how we deal with these substances.
It is quite clear that penta and probably octa are really not necessary and that the risks they pose to the environment and human health do not justify their continued use as flame-retardants.
But I urge Parliament to pause for a moment and think seriously about what alternatives there are to these very useful flame retardants.
Can we still use deca in a sensible and serious way?
Will the risk assessments finally rule out its use?
We simply do not know because we have not had the risk assessments.
The Commission has to press Member States to come forward with them as quickly as possible.
We want this issue resolved.
We want to know exactly what to do with these substances.
For the moment it is an open question.
I hope that we use our intelligence in this question and realise the importance of these substances in protecting human life as flame-retardants.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think it is acceptable for most environmental matters to be debated as late as this in the evening.
Environmental policy and legislation really need a bit of 'prime time' here in Parliament.
It is a big responsibility to take decisions about public health and the environment that are to apply for a long time into the future.
This directive and the report on brominated flame retardants are good examples of this responsibility's being exercised.
After the first reading in September 2001, there was a reappraisal of the EU's risk assessments in relation to oktaBDE and dekaBDE. That took place in November of last year.
The European Chemicals Bureau believes that, when it comes to oktaBDE and dekaBDE, the risk assessment and situation are now the same as they were for pentaBDE, when the result was a total ban.
These substances are persistent and bioaccumulative.
The scientific proofs in relation to oktaBDE and dekaBDE are now so alarming in terms of public health and the environment that the Bureau has recommended the Member States to take a political decision, that is to say to use the precautionary principle.
In the European Parliament, we must also accept our responsibility as co-legislators.
Following the reappraisal and the new risk assessment, we must also arrange for the precautionary principle to prevail.
Those of us from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists are therefore re-tabling Amendments Nos 7 to 10, according to which dekaBDE too must no longer be used.
There is no reason to wait any longer.
There are substitutes.
In 80 per cent of cases, the use of brominated flame retardants involves the use of dekaBDE.
In view of the new knowledge we have acquired, we cannot continue to gamble with the environment and public health.
We therefore hope that the political groups will vote in favour of the amendments and that Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m too will confirm that the precautionary principle is to be applied.
Mr President, the rapporteur's proposal and the proposals adopted by the committee entail a tougher attitude than the Council's common position, and that, I think, is good.
Just like Mrs SchÃ¶rling, I nonetheless believe that we now have arguments for being able to go still further. Now, we have arguments for banning not only pentaBDE and oktaBDE but also dekaBDE.
If we are to wait for the risk assessments, we are in danger of having to wait too long.
Moreover, we are in possession of the arguments right now, and we know that these substances, which are hazardous, accumulate in the human body and are increasingly present in our living environment.
We really have all the arguments needed for taking a decision right now.
There are also alternatives to these brominated flame retardants, which are otherwise in danger of becoming a major health problem in the future.
Just like Mr Bowe, I think we must take an intelligent decision which, in this case, means daring to take the lead and ban what we know to be hazardous.
Mr President, brominated flame retardants constitute a serious threat to public health and the environment.
After decades of industrial use, we find them everywhere, including in fish, birds' eggs, polar bears, agricultural products and mother's milk.
It might be imagined that this information had been taken from a paper written by fundamentalist environmental organisations, but that is not the case.
One of the signatories of the paper is the Director-General of the Swedish emergency services authority, comprised of experts on, for example, fire protection, and that authority too is prepared to say that flame retardants have had their day.

I think that this view should be listened to, for the major argument in the debate against a ban on oktaBDE and dekaBDE is that we cannot expose people to the danger involved in not using adequate flame retardants in buildings, furniture etc. At the same time, we know, however, that there are substitutes, that there is the possibility of using other materials and that there is the ability to produce in different ways than we do today.
In a way, it is almost absurd that we are compelled to use chemicals to combat those chemicals we use in our buildings today.
The reason our products burn as well as they do is that we already use chemicals in them.
The Commission should have a proper think and try, for all that, to make a serious effort also to ban oktaBDE and dekaBDE.
The issue is one of how long we have to wait, following the assessment, before a ban or a restriction on the use of oktaBDE and dekaBDE is introduced.
The Commission has nonetheless said that it is prepared to act quickly.
So how quickly is it prepared to act?
Mr President, I wish firstly to thank the MEPs for their interest in this proposal, and I naturally want to convey special thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, for her constructive work.
This is certainly an important directive, involving a ban on the use of the substance pentabromodiphenyl, or pentaBDE, which a risk assessment has revealed constitutes an environmental risk.
The substance accumulates in nature and, as has already been pointed out, it has been found in mother's milk.
The directive is far-reaching, covering all uses of pentaBDE and all types of goods containing this substance.
The directive is based on the precautionary principle.
The proposed directive does not entail the risk of fires starting or an increase in risks to the environment, because there are already suitable alternatives available.
I can understand and share the anxiety felt by MEPs regarding other, closely related substances not included in the original area of application of the proposed directive, and I wish to comment on this, as well as on the issue of timing.
The Commission is actively investigating the risks presented by the two closely related substances, oktaBDE and dekaBDE, as well as the risks which might arise due to fire if these substances were to be banned from the market.
The Commission's attitude is that we must minimise the overall risks.
We shall soon have finished this risk assessment in relation to oktaBDE and dekaBDE, and we expect to have information before the end of the year about the consequences of banning these substances in terms both of a reduction in the chemical risk and a possible increase in the risks due to fires.
On the basis of the results of this work, the Commission will table a new proposal at the beginning of next year, that is to say at the beginning of 2003.
The Commission will also give clear instructions to all the parties concerned to hurry up and complete the assessments, if possible before the end of the year.
Against this background, it is not now possible for the Commission to approve those of Parliament's amendments designed to extend the scope of the proposed directive to include a total and immediate ban on oktaBDE and dekaBDE as well.
The amendments concerned are numbers 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
Nor is the Commission able to approve the amendment according to which there would be a total ban on dekaBDE as from 1 January 2006 if the risk assessment were to show that there are risks associated with the substance.
That is because it would be possible for suitable measures to enter into force much sooner than 2006 if these should prove necessary.
I assure MEPs that, at the first possible opportunity, the Commission will take action in relation to these substances so that the precautionary principle is complied with.
I also hope that MEPs are aware of the fact that the Commission has proposed a ban on these three substances - penta-, okta- and dekadiphenyls - in our proposal for a directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.
We are concerned here with Mr Florenz's report, which has also been debated during this sitting.
Let me emphasise that the Commission will ensure that the proposal we shall table early next year concerning oktaBDE and dekaBDE will be compatible with our proposal to restrict hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.
Because the risk assessment in relation to oktaBDE and dekaBDE is far advanced, it will be possible, if need be, for the Commission to take measures much earlier than in 2006.
Once the risk assessments have been concluded and an investigation made into the availability of replacement products, it should be possible to establish in which cases there are risks associated with use of the substances.
Suitable measures can then be taken immediately.
Because the assessments will be ready shortly, it will be possible for the measures decided upon to begin to be applied well before 2006.
On the basis of the assurances I have now given on behalf of the Commission, I look forward to this very urgent draft law's being adopted as soon as possible.
I should like to thank MEPs for this debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Before I close the debate, I would like to point out to the Sittings Service that the formula for octabromodiphenyl ether is wrong in Amendment No 4, where it says C12H2Br10O.
The two hydrogens need to be deleted.
(The sitting was closed at 11.37 p.m.)
Situation in Chechnya
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Chechnya.
Mr de Miguel, the Minister speaking on behalf of the Council, has the floor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Russian military operations in the Russian Federal Republic of Chechnya resumed in September 1999, the situation there has been treated as a priority by the European Union.
Both the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, back in December 1999, and the actions of the presidencies which have followed it, are testimony to this.
Contrary to what some people predicted, this position has not altered following the attacks of 11 September.
The Spanish Presidency has been acting and will continue to act throughout this six-month period in a way that is fully coherent with this issue of concern to the Union.
The Presidency's work plan for the development of a common strategy for Russia included a paragraph which indicated our will to 'continue to express the Union's desire for an early peaceful solution in Chechnya within the framework of the principle territorial integrity, the Rule of Law and respect for human rights, to promote an improvement of the conditions for the safer and more effective distribution of humanitarian aid?.
In the months since January, these intentions have been turned into various concrete actions.
The Presidency has included the Chechen issue on the agenda of all political talks between the European Union and Russia at various levels, with both political representatives, such as the European Union-Russia Ministerial troika, the European Union-Russia political directors' troika and the PSC-Russia troika, and in meetings of experts, the so-called COEST troika.
On the occasion of the recent ministerial-level troika with the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, on 2 April, the issue was once again raised by the Presidency.
Furthermore, at the beginning of March, the troika of Union Heads of Mission in Moscow made a representation to the Russian Federation's Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Gusarov, to express the Union's concern at the human rights situation in the region.
We must add to all these actions, which have served to communicate the Union's position on the development of the Caucasus Republic to the Russian authorities, the request for, and subsequent support from Russia for, the trip which the troika of Heads of Mission intends to make to the region during April, which will allow us to obtain information on the development of events.
For this same purpose of compiling information, the troika of Heads of Mission maintains frequent contacts with representatives of NGOs and competent authorities such as Mr Kalamanov, the Kremlin's special representative for human rights in Chechnya, or Mr Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman.
While explaining these specific measures, which are not restricted in this case to those being developed by the Spanish Presidency in particular, I must point out that the Union's concern has been translated into a significant financial commitment.
The European Union is currently the greatest donor of humanitarian aid to the region. The sums allocated to it amount to EUR 65 million for the period between the resumption of military operations in 1999 and the current time.
Of these sums, EUR 40 million has been earmarked for 2001.
With regard to the current situation in Chechnya, I would like to stress certain aspects.
In the field of human rights, all the reports from the OSCE support group, from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and from the various NGOs continue to give cause for concern.
Lord Judd stated in the report communicated to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, that the progress observed in this field over the last year had been scant.
The report of the support group of the OSCE for the early months of this year with regard to military operations carried out during this period spoke of civilian disappearances, lootings, the indiscriminate use of force and other violations of the human rights of civilians, all of this in contravention of what had been previously agreed.
The representative of the public prosecutor's office was not present during all operations.
We must acknowledge the steps taken by the Russian authorities to improve the situation.
President Putin - we must recognise - has expressed his commitment that the people guilty of human rights violations, including the military, will be tried and punished.
These statements have also been repeated by other official representatives.
The Office of the Kremlin's Special Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya has carried out its work, condemning alleged violations of human rights.
The Russian authorities are cooperating with the organisations active in this area.
With regard to the intergovernmental organisations, in addition to cooperation with the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights, the mandate of the OSCE support group in Chechnya has been renewed until 31 December 2002; three representatives of the Council of Europe are continuing to participate in the same office and the work of the mixed working group consisting of members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Duma are continuing their work.
With regard to the NGOs, last January the creation of the Council for the protection of human rights in Chechnya was agreed, which would be made up of representatives of these non-governmental organisations, the public prosecutor's office, the security forces and local authorities, and which would meet on a monthly basis.
Furthermore, within this repertoire of positive measures, the Chechen police are present at control posts on the Republic's transport routes.
However, in view of the analysis of the current situation, these measures are insufficient.
With regard to the humanitarian situation, there is still the ongoing tragedy of the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, who are mainly dissuaded from returning to Chechnya by the continuing situation of insecurity and there are also certain difficulties to be faced by the humanitarian organisations in carrying out their work.
We also have to recognise that the Russian authorities have adopted different measures in the region: as well as the creation of the aforementioned working groups with the NGOs, which will provide a forum in which to deal with these issues, the Russian authorities have applied various measures to normalise life.
These measures are not restricted to socio-economic development plans, the reopening of educational establishments or the reestablishment of the public pensions system, but they also extend to the drawing up of a draft constitution which will have to be put to a referendum.
This will lead to the holding of new elections in which the population of the region will be able to elect their representatives.
In view of the persistence of the problems I have just described, the European Union has exploited - and will continue to exploit - all channels of dialogue in order to communicate its position to the Russian authorities, and that position is based on the following points: firstly, the European Union recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation as well as its right and responsibility to protect its population from terrorist attacks, which the Union condemns unreservedly.
This recognition is accompanied by a double consideration: firstly, the Union expresses its firm conviction that that responsibility to protect the population must be fulfilled within the framework of the Rule of Law and strict compliance with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, which are enshrined in numerous treaties to which the Russian Federation is party.
The European Union requests that the Russian authorities try and punish the people responsible for human rights violations, thereby eliminating any risk of impunity, which unfortunately some people have enjoyed in the past.
Those authorities are furthermore urged to provide federal officials with appropriate training in the field of human rights, which would prevent these events from reoccurring in the future.
I would like to acknowledge the contribution made in this area by the Council of Europe and the Office of the United Nations' High Commission for Human Rights, and take this opportunity to express the European Union's support for the work of these organisations and the OSCE in Chechnya.
The Union also wants the Russian authorities to continue to cooperate with the international bodies and NGOs in order to eliminate the obstacles that are still hindering their work.
Specifically, these organisations must be allowed access to detention centres and they must be provided with the means for radio communication.
An improvement in the human rights situation will undoubtedly encourage the return of displaced persons.
The removal of the restrictions which currently make access to the area for the media difficult will also contribute to increasing trust, both within the civil population and within the international community.
The second major point of the Union's position is that terrorist acts carried out by Chechen armed factions are without doubt part of the problem but they are by no means the whole problem.
A lasting solution to this problem therefore depends on the normalisation of civilian life by means of the restoration of democratic mechanisms and structures in the Chechen Republic.
That result must be achieved through dialogue with the various sectors of Chechen society.
In this regard, the European Union is urging the Russian authorities to renew the contacts initiated last November.
Thirdly, the European Union believes that its position on this issue is level-headed, since, on the one hand, it has no hesitation in acknowledging the progress made and, on the other, it must continue to indicate those areas in which there are still serious shortcomings.
The Union is thereby acting fully in accordance with the values that underpin both its very existence and its relations with third countries, including the strategic relationship between the European Union and Russia.
The core of these values shared by the Union and Russia is the respect for the Rule of Law and the safeguard of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
This attitude of equanimity and coherence will also guide the European Union's actions with regard to the treatment of Chechnya at the 58th sitting of the Humans Rights Commission.
The Union has informed the Russian authorities of its full willingness to negotiate a Presidency declaration that incorporates both progress and shortcomings in similar terms to those which I have expressed in this House.
Also, we have told those authorities that if this willingness on the part of the Union is not reflected by Russia, the European Union will not hesitate in adopting a resolution, as was necessary during the 2001 session.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it only remains for me to insist on the firmness and coherence of the Union's position, which will continue to treat the Chechen situation as a priority in terms of its relations with Russia, and it will continue to direct all its attention and efforts towards it as events require, and I would also like to say that this issue will form a significant part of the dialogue that will take place on 28 May at the summit between Russia and the European Union.

Mr President, the Commission shares Parliament's concern about the deterioration of the situation on the ground in Chechnya, as shown by a number of recent solid reports of serious violations of human rights over the past few months.
In view of these reports, including from the Council of Europe, the European Union has continued to express its concerns on the matter to the Russian authorities through the appropriate diplomatic channels.
As you are aware, the EU-Russia political dialogue offers an intensive calendar of high-level meetings, including last week's Ministerial Troika with Foreign Minister Ivanov in Madrid.
The position of the European Union on this issue is quite simple, and quite firm.
The EU supports Russia wholeheartedly in its legitimate fight against terrorism, in Chechnya and elsewhere.
There should be no doubt about this.
Our calls for a political solution which, without prejudice to the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, satisfies the majority of the Chechen people, do not in any way undermine such support.
Equally, there should be no doubt about the EU commitment to uphold human rights in the fight against terrorism world-wide, including in Chechnya.
In this regard, I am confident that the European Parliament fully shares the view that the fight against international terrorism cannot serve as justification or excuse for the violation of the most basic individual human rights, be it in the West Bank, in Afghanistan or in Chechnya.
This should not change - and has indeed not changed - due to the horrible terrorist attacks of 11 September last year.
Against the background of our joint efforts with Russia to establish closer political and economic relations, the European Union has repeatedly made clear to Russia that it expects her to act in full accordance with the values that Russia undertook to respect when it entered the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
These basic principles of full respect of fundamental human rights and the rule of law, including international law, constitute an integral part of the strategic partnership that we are trying to build together.
As you are aware, the Human Rights Commission is currently meeting in session in Geneva, and Chechnya remains an important item on the agenda.
The European Commission is fully participating in the internal deliberations of the EU in this forum.
While the European Union is prepared to engage in good-faith negotiations with Russia, in order to acknowledge all positive efforts undertaken by Russia during last year, there are still too many very serious issues that have yet to be addressed in Chechnya.
On the positive side, we have acknowledged some positive Russian steps towards a political solution that could guarantee long-term peace and stability in Chechnya.
We welcome these steps and are prepared to support them in any way necessary.
In the same vein, we must also acknowledge that there has been progress on a number of issues during the last year, including on physical reconstruction, setting the conditions for economic development, supporting the reestablishment of the Chechen judiciary to restore the rule of law, and so on. Clearly, a lot more has to be done in all of these fields, but there has been progress and credit should be given where credit is due.
Also, we have noted that the number of reported violations of human rights that have been followed up by prosecutors has increased.
However, we must still regret the excessively low number of follow-up convictions that these reports have resulted in.
It is clear that, by dispelling any notion of impunity, the punishment of those guilty of human rights violations is crucial to avoid further violations in the future.
More must be done here.
Another area where progress is warranted is in the provision of and access to humanitarian assistance.
As you are aware, the European Union, through the European Commission Humanitarian Office ECHO, is by far the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Northern Caucasus.
Since October 1999, we have provided some EUR 65 million in aid to the victims of the Chechnya conflict and last year alone more than EUR 40 million.
Our funding is crucial for the presence of international humanitarian NGOs in the area, as well as being crucial also for the work and presence of UN organisations, notably the UNHCR.
In our view it is essential that representatives of the international humanitarian community are present in Chechnya.
We remain concerned about the persistent difficult operating conditions for humanitarian organisations in the Northern Caucasus, notably the opaque and time-consuming system of access and work permits for Chechnya, and also the denial to humanitarian NGOs of the right to use VHF radio communication which is very important for their safety.
We have been constructively raising the issue of operating conditions with Russian authorities at various levels for more than two years, with only very minor improvements so far.
We have tried all possible channels; this is a discordant element in the ongoing discussion with the Russian authorities, but we will not stop pressing these issues.
Security conditions in the Northern Caucasus remain difficult; indeed, one must expect a certain level of operational problems.
But we expect more cooperation to be forthcoming from the relevant Russian authorities.
In this regard, we will continue to advocate concrete improvements, so as to facilitate the conduct of humanitarian operations according to the basic established normal international standards of safety, efficiency and independent monitoring and evaluation.
In parallel, we will keep insisting that any repatriation of Chechen displaced persons, from within neighbouring Ingushetia and Daghestan, and refugees from Georgia, must take place on a voluntary and unconditional basis only.
This is becoming a more and more serious issue.
A massive return movement seems rather unlikely at present, given the persisting instability and violence in Chechnya and the very limited progress in the implementation of the Russian Government's long-announced rehabilitation and reconstruction programme.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we had a very solemn debate here in Parliament about the situation in the Middle East, and I think that the debate on Chechnya deserves the same degree of solemnity.
There is an open wound in Europe: in Chechnya, in the Russian Federation.
As members of the European People's Party, as European Democrats, we say that security in Europe, on our continent, in the twenty-first century will depend on our having a democratic ...
... European Union, which is capable of taking action and committed to upholding human rights, and on our having a democratic Russia, which is capable of taking action and committed to upholding human rights, and on both - the European Union and Russia - working together as partners.
We want to have a strategic partnership of this kind because it is important for the future of our continent.
We must not remain silent, however, when human rights are violated, and of all people, we in the European Parliament must not remain silent.
Some observers are saying that more people are dying in Chechnya than in the Middle East.
Our group believes that a Chechen life is of equal value to the life of a citizen of the United States or a citizen of the European Union ...
(Applause)
? and that the life of a Muslim in Chechnya is of equal value to the life of a Christian, a Jew, a Palestinian, a Hindu, a Buddhist or a person of no belief.
(Applause)
Human rights - and it is particularly because we are Europeans that this matters to us - are indivisible the world over.
(Applause)
The President of the Russian Federation is currently visiting a Member State of the European Union.
Last night I heard his statement on Chechnya on German television.
The Russian Ambassador to the European Union, Mr Likhachev, and the President of the Committee for Foreign Affairs in the Duma, Dimitri Rogozin, called to see me last week in Brussels to inform me about the situation.
I am pleased that our debate on Chechnya has also provided an opportunity for them to contact our group.
Clearly we have to fight terrorism, but we must not do so in such a way that this has a disproportionate impact on the human rights and lives of the people in Chechnya, of civilians who want to live in peace.
(Applause)
If a study from the US State Department dated 4 March, statements from MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃšres - an organisation which we esteem greatly because of its commitment - and the organisation Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York, all say that the Russian soldiers have hardly any respect for human life, then this has to set the alarm bells ringing.
If the Duma representative for Chechnya, Aslambek Aslakhanov, says - and this shows that Russia is also on the road to democracy, and we do of course recognise this - that 80% of the aid which Russia provides for Chechnya is not even reaching the people, then this has to set the alarm bells ringing.
