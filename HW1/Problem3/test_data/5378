Our duty, in fact, is to maximise the value added to national budgets by European intervention and to give Europe the means it requires to implement a project designed to bring progress in which all Member States can share.
We must remember that, in the long run, expenditure at European level is a source of savings for national governments, particularly because European expenditure permits economies of scale and often enables Member States to make innovations and pursue policies that they could not have done independently.
With a budget corresponding to 1.07% of GDP in payment appropriations, we shall have the resources to ensure that policies can be implemented in future. There has also been a need to break certain taboos.
I am thinking here of the funding of the common agricultural policy, which will have to be reviewed if necessary in order to establish a fairer expenditure structure.
I am also thinking of the British rebate, which must be challenged if we are to have a fairer own resources mechanism.
I am thinking of the Cohesion Fund too, where we must create a transitional mechanism to avoid penalising those Member States that would no longer be eligible for support.
In addition, all the institutions are called upon to intensify their efforts to achieve economy and efficiency.
My last point on the payment appropriations is that the two elements of the present proposal are inseparable, namely the 1.7% in payment appropriations and the 24.2Â billion for the flexibility instruments that are imperative if we are to develop the policies essential to growth and solidarity in the Union and the world.
I should also like to emphasise two aspects of the present situation.
The first concerns our disappointment at having been unable to finance NaturaÂ 2000 entirely outside the budget for rural development, to which we attached such great importance.
The second concerns the demand we Socialists made for the allocation of resources to the European Development Fund, which is an indispensable instrument for the improvement of decentralised cooperation.
Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that Europe is experiencing difficulties at the present time, which I shall not spell out in detail.
It has emerged clearly from these recent events that our citizens want a real Europe, a Europe that relates to them and communicates with them.
This is precisely why it is very important to avail ourselves of this new heading.
We are undoubtedly struggling today to find a political programme for Europe.
We have objectives but not enough major projects and too few resources.
It is essential to respond to peopleâs expectations, and I address these words directly to the Council.
It is high time the Council was able to fulfil the hopes of the European peoples.
There is an urgent need for it to face up to its responsibilities.
We all need this budgetary framework in order to breathe fresh life into the economy and to regain public trust.
We must overcome national self-interest and rediscover a mature approach to the European political project.
There is nothing excessive about our demand, and that is why we are asking the Council to advance towards our position.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too must greatly commend and warmly thank our rapporteur, MrÂ BÃ¶ge, for his thorough and proficient efforts, firstly in analysing the Commissionâs proposal and then in formulating Parliamentâs position on the financial perspectives.
My group supports this report.
This proposed basis for the negotiations with the Council is economically responsible.
We have found ways of reprioritising under the Commissionâs proposal and of making savings in relation to the latter.
Those of us in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are particularly pleased that the proposal concentrates on research, training and investments in transport and energy.
It is, of course, precisely in these areas that we must invest significantly more of the EUâs budgetary means.
It is in such efforts that the future lies, and they can give the EU a position of strength.
That is why it is all the sadder that it is specifically in these areas that the EUâs Heads of State or Government are considering wielding the axe in order to make cuts.
They want ruthlessly to cut back on our ambitious research efforts, and this is quite incomprehensible and out of step with the many fine statements from the Council about common research.
It is precisely from these areas, where common efforts really could strengthen the EUâs competitiveness, that they are withdrawing and are saving amounts that, seen in a larger context, are exceedingly modest.
As Commissioner Barroso did of course tell us, such savings will genuinely affect ambitions in this area.
Those of us in the ALDE Group are particularly pleased about the greater resources Parliament is setting aside for asylum and legal policy and for the common foreign policy.
Legal policy is a rapidly growing area, and it is important for a large enough framework to be set aside for us to be able to respond to new needs over the next eight years.
A lot can happen in eight years.
Foreign policy too is an area in which new needs constantly arise.
This is shown by experiences in recent years, when we suddenly had to find money for Kosovo, Afghanistan, Serbia and Iraq and, most recently, for the victims of the tsunami.
The financial framework will have to take account of such sudden needs so that we do not go and cut back on aid to other poor countries.
We have attached particular importance to there being adequate resources for supporting the enlarged EUâs new neighbours.
The developments in Ukraine are, of course, the latest example of the EU being able to support democratic developments in countries that are its close neighbours.
Agricultural policy and support for poor regions in the old Member States will continue to account for a lot of the budget.
It is therefore necessary for the overall framework to be set high enough for it to be possible to finance new needs too.
The EU budget still amounts to only approximately one per cent of gross national income, and it cannot be claimed that the amounts we are now debating are going to be the source of a budget crisis in any Member State.
I wish, therefore, earnestly to call upon the European Council to find a reasonable solution at the forthcoming summit, to break the deadlock and to show that results can be delivered.
I agree with MrÂ BÃ¶ge when he says that we also want Parliament to provide a solution, but not at any price.
I want to say, however, that Parliament has come up with a constructive and realistic proposal.
We are obliged to find a solution so that the structural fund programmes designed to develop the economies of the new Member States can be got under way on 1Â January 2007.
Not to achieve a result and not to display a willingness to negotiate would simply be contemptible.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have spent the past weeks doing a lot of campaigning on the future of Europe, and, while it is very unfortunate that the referendum in the Netherlands has ended in a ânoâ, this is not, of course, unexpected.
If year in, year out, the only thing a country gets to hear about Europe is that it costs too much, and that it is a disgrace how much the Netherlands is paying to Brussels, then you can hardly expect people to jump up for joy, shout âyes!â, and resolve to accept this Europe with open arms.
Dutch accountants have sown the euro scepticism that was reaped on 1 June.
What has the Dutch Government made of it all?
It claims that the Dutch ânoâ is a ânoâ to our being a net contributor.
Well, that is, of course, turning the facts upside down.
To my great horror, this has now suddenly become the position of the Dutch Social Democrats as well, and that is depressing but, of course, a very easy option.
My group has interpreted the ânoâ in a very different way.
Many people did not vote against Europe, but want a better Europe, not a Europe of multinationals, but one of people.
The Group of the Greens has therefore tabled an alternative resolution, because we want to invest heavily in education, in poverty-reduction projects and in exchange programmes, also for students.
We want more development cooperation; we want to invest in the Millennium objectives.
We also want to protect our vulnerable environment by actually freeing up funds; everyone in this Chamber is agreed that these should be made available, but they are not.
We do not want this reality to prejudice the rural economy.
We want to spend the money more effectively, not on prestigious but inefficient national showpieces, such as the bridge over the Straits of Messina Street, but, for example, on the railway connection that links up Berlin with Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn or Vienna or Venice with Ljubljana, Bratislava, Prague and Budapest.
With empty promises alone and no money to back them up, you will only alienate the voter even more.
You will need to make it clear in what way you want to make your dreams come true.
That is why we have tabled a resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have had the opportunity to observe at close quarters the enormous amount of work MrÂ BÃ¶ge has put into this report.
It is not his fault that our group will not adopt this report by a provisional committee, but has allied itself to the minority opinion and is, instead, proposing its own resolution.
Parliamentâs power relations are such that the committeeâs report does not correspond to our groupâs opinion of future economic frameworks.
We would have liked there to be greater focus on economic, social and environmental issues, the prevention of unemployment and the fight against poverty, and solidarity with the developing countries.
We would have liked to see less neoliberalism, less militarisation of the EU, and less harmonisation of laws.
On the one hand it is justifiable to have the decision on future economic guidelines fit in with the Commissionâs and Parliamentâs terms of office.
On the other hand, structural and cohesion funds and agricultural programmes should not be subordinated to mere budgetary frameworks and procedures.
While, moreover, the notion of temporal coordination was justified with the provisions of the draft EU constitution, there are no longer any grounds for it.
The French and Dutch nations have rendered that neoliberalist and Euro-nationalist project comatose, and now we only need to switch off the life-support machine.
Parliament had no inclination to reach a consensus on how future budgets should be financed.
Our group endorses the system of national contributions, and, above all, contributions based on GNP, and we have no sympathy for euro taxation.
We want contributions to be charged fairly.
That is not how things are at present.
Others pay almost EUR 5 billion to cover the United Kingdomâs contributions, and that countryâs rebate is unjustified.
The grand total for future expenditure is crucial.
On the one side there is the 1% proposed in the letter drafted by six Member States, and, on the other, Member States worried about structural and cohesion funds are demanding that Unionâs internal cohesion and convergence are safeguarded.
Our group does not share the committeeâs view that the grand total for expenditure should be the Commissionâs original proposal of something between 1% and 1.14%.
We consider the Commissionâs proposal to be the bare minimum.
There is a lot of sympathy in our group for those countries that decry the deflationary pressures of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Many members of our group are furthermore worried about the impact EU enlargement will have on the budget.
It is feared that enlargement will be paid for by the old cohesion countries.
Regarding agriculture, not everyone understands why we should be making room in the EU budget for other expenditure with joint financing of agricultural expenditure.
MrÂ BÃ¶ge, I am sorry, but just as I was about to speak about the reportâs good aspects, my time ran out.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, although I have every respect for the work carried out by MrÂ BÃ¶ge, I have no choice but to say that the draft Financial Perspective is as worthless as the draft Constitutional Treaty, and deserves the same fate.
This House should reject the draft Financial Perspective, in so doing proving that it understands and shares the views of the majority of EU citizens.
It would also prove that it respects democratic principles, and that as a mouthpiece for the public, it represents and protects the interests of the latter.
What is wrong with the draft Financial Perspective?
It provides for the use of inauspicious economic indicators and mechanisms, and, in particular, it restricts Member Statesâ contributions to around 1%.
Secondly, it stipulates that a high percentage of the budget will be spent on agriculture.
Thirdly, it provides for modest increases in expenditure on the Structural and Cohesion Funds.
Fourthly, around 75% of funding for research and development is set aside for highly-developed countries.
Fifthly, administrative costs have risen sharply and, sixthly, it does not go far enough in liberalising the market in services.
What will happen if such inadequate solutions are adopted?
Firstly, economic problems will multiply rather than being solved, growth will not be boosted or competitiveness increased, and the development gap between Member States will widen instead of narrowing.
Secondly, social problems will be exacerbated due to the lack of pro-family policies, since the latter boost employment and earnings, and hence promote natural growth.
There is also a lack of approximation, or rather a growing disparity between the incomes of a small number of rich people and a larger number of poor people.
Thirdly, the draft Financial Perspective heightens political tensions within the EU rather than lessening them, because it fails to earmark enough funding for new transport and communications infrastructure.
Fourthly, not enough money has been set aside for external policies and for aid to countries such as Ukraine and Belarus.
At the same time, we will be unable to deliver on the binding promises made to Turkey regarding EU accession, and this will further complicate our relations with the Islamic world.
To sum up, we would be acting at odds with the economic and social objectives proclaimed by the EU if we were to adopt the draft Financial Perspective.
By doing so, we would merely confirm that the EU is run by bureaucrats and technocrats, and we would make no progress towards our goal of global competitiveness.
The members of the Independence and Democracy Group will vote against this draft.
It is high time that a debate was held on the need for a new strategy for economic cooperation between the EU Member States.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the Financial Perspective the rapporteur has presented is close to the limits of what we can achieve at this point in time.
We are currently in an extremely difficult situation.
Not only has the Council been unable to reach a common position on the ceiling for commitments and payments, but a majority of voters in France and the Netherlands have rejected the Constitutional Treaty.
The moment of truth has therefore arrived for the incomprehensible Treaty, which fails to make a distinction between legislation and what are sometimes foolish hopes and dreams.
A variety of grudges against the EU have been heard from certain quarters.
According to some of the old Member States, the EU is not doing enough to protect their jobs.
Others say that it is depriving them of their sovereignty and giving them nothing back in return.
Certain Member States believe that the EU is over-regulating the economy and that it costs too much.
Others do not wish to give up the privileges they were granted earlier.
It is the proverbial Polish plumber, whose work is reliable and cheap, who is blamed for the failure of these various approaches.
Instead of making serious attempts to carry out economic reforms, certain people prefer to use the Polish plumber as a bogeyman to scare children and young people looking for work.
In reality, what is happening is that some net contributors to the EU budget are applying the old utopian principle of âgive what you can and take what you needâ.
The result is that there is never enough EU money to go round.
We are thus debating the Financial Perspective without knowing whether the Council will reach an agreement or whether the largest Member States will take up even less flexible positions.
Be that as it may, we still have to take some kind of decision.
We are proposing to vote in favour of the BÃ¶ge report, albeit in a slightly amended version.
Firstly, we are opposed to any link between the level of payments and the reform of the own resources system, as the latter shows every sign of turning into an attempt to move even further away from a correlation of Member Statesâ payments with their revenue.
Secondly, we do not agree that agriculture should be cofinanced, as this would be the first step along the path towards renationalising agricultural policy.
Thirdly, it is our belief that it would be more reasonable to continue with current plans for a Financial Perspective covering the period from 2007 to 2013, as this tallies better with the multiannual programmes and the common agricultural policy.
The EU has functioned and will continue to function without the thousands of Byzantine provisions in the late Constitution.
In a large number of countries, the public is losing faith in the EU.
We must ask ourselves whether this does not stem from the fact that the political elite has ignored the very illusions it created.
After all, is it not an illusion to repeat endlessly the catchphrase of subsidiarity while the welfare state, which is often unnecessarily over-bloated, is close to bankruptcy?
Is it not absurd that the very countries that wish to integrate rapidly are attempting to reduce their contributions to the EU?
Is the Lisbon strategy not an illusion, and one that is currently being eclipsed by a rabble-rousing war against the free market?
Should the blame be placed on the peoples of those countries that have carried out the necessary reforms and, as a result, begun to develop more rapidly and become more competitive?
Parliament will do its duty by voting in favour of the BÃ¶ge report.
It is now the Councilâs turn to adopt a more constructive stance.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, the report that we are discussing today addresses budgetary matters, but also â and I would like to emphasise this â political challenges.
It is these challenges that I should like to focus on.
I am sure that you are aware that the financial outlook for the coming years depends, among other factors, on whether the European Constitution is approved or not.
The citizens of two Member States recently rejected the Constitution; other countries have postponed ratification.
We should now be taking this message on board, rather than making plans for the years to come.
What the citizens have said to us, loudly and clearly, is that they see the European Union completely differently to what some politicians dreamt up at the negotiating table.
From the perspective of the financial calculations, Mr BÃ¶geâs report is a sensible compromise.
It clearly expresses the fact that there cannot be more Europe for less money.
We must, however, respect above all the will of the citizens.
It is not now a matter of what seems to us here in the Chamber to be reasonable; it is a matter of what is truly democratic.
I believe that the rejections of the Constitution cannot be arrogantly ignored.
I therefore consider that the greatest political challenge is for politicians to have the courage to step forward humbly before the citizens and openly admit that a general consensus on the level of political integration within the European Union simply does not exist at present.
Accordingly, I ask whether we now even have the right to vote on a report that seeks to create a framework for the political and economic life of the European Union for several years to come, and my answer is a definite ânoâ.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Commissionâs proposal represented a commitment to enlargement and, at the same time, to its aspirations to turn our economy into a centre of growth and development, to overcome the technological gap with the United States, to increase our presence on the world stage and to confront the new challenges of terrorism and organised crime.
And this is despite the fact that the proposed distribution of the costs of enlargement is neither fair nor balanced, as demonstrated during the parliamentary debate, and that is why we have presented an amendment that I hope will be supported by a majority of the House tomorrow.
While I applaud the efforts being made by the Luxembourg Presidency, I must express my concern about the direction of some of its proposals, which tend to please the Member States whose attitude is the least flexible to the detriment of others.
The Council would do well to take account of the clear signals being sent by the European Parliament, particularly with regard to cohesion policy.
We want sufficient funds, we want the reuse of funds left over from the convergence objective by the countries with the greatest capacity for absorption, and I hope that tomorrow we will approve an amendment calling for political compensation for those countries and regions suffering a sudden loss of funds.
Mr Schmitâs fine words, for which we are certainly grateful, must be translated into a clear commitment to cohesion.
Thinking realistically, I believe that we all agree that the Union currently lacks political leadership, but what will be put to the test on the 17th is the ability of the Heads of State or Government to do their duty.
And it would be profoundly irresponsible on the part of the Council not to reach an agreement at this time.
Â Â  Mr President, as is customary in this House, I shall begin by congratulating Mr BÃ¶ge on the work he has done on his important report on policy challenges and budgetary means of the Union 2007-2013.
I shall firstly make a few general comments.
The financial perspectives that the report refers to unquestionably come within an adverse context, from political, economic and social points of view, in several Member States, and I can only lament the fact that this context has ââ if you will allow me to use the expression ââ poisoned the debate in committee from the outset, focusing this debate on trying to find an agreement on percentages between the Commission and the Council.
At times there have been squabbles over percentages, net contributors and net incomes.
I believe that this is a false debate, from an economic point of view, because it is partial; and politically it is even more partial, because there is much more to the European Union than simply its budget.
The citizens want much more than a mere accounting exercise, because the Union should be a complete political project, a vision for its citizens and a future for twenty-five countries, which means more than merely being contributors.
I regret that the current political situation has not allowed Parliament to be more audacious, and this is the first time that Parliamentâs proposal has aimed lower than the Commissionâs proposal.
Nevertheless, having said that, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will support the BÃ¶ge report, since, in the majority of cases, its fundamental demands are taken up.
Firstly, it confirms the cohesion policy as an indispensable instrument for promoting territorial, economic and social cohesion and reducing the disparities between the regions of the Union â a policy of solidarity par excellence â and sees a proper funding of 0.41% of GDP as condition.
Secondly, it makes the political and social agenda a priority and recognises that sufficient funding of it is crucial, and consequently it calls for an increase of EUR 200 million in order to achieve its objectives.
Thirdly, it insists on the need for a sufficient level of funding for external measures, with a view to making the Union a genuine global interlocutor.
And finally, it takes up the European Parliament's long-standing demand that the European Development Fund be integrated into the general budget.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports this balanced and realistic resolution, because we are aware that a unified majority position puts Parliament in a strong position when dealing with the Council.
The ball is in the Councilâs court, and it must also bear in mind that the Socialist Group sees the report as a to guarantee sufficient resources for European policies for the Europe of twenty-five.
Â Â  Mr President, like many other Members, I should like to congratulate our honourable colleague Reimer BÃ¶ge for the work that has been done and for his coordination of all this work.
I also believe it is fair to say, Mr BÃ¶ge, that many other Members of this House have shown responsibility and diligence in arriving at the two-thirds majority to which you referred before.
I therefore invite you, ladies and gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, to listen very carefully to this appeal from our Parliament, because it contains positions that are judicious in two main respects.
Firstly, they are financially judicious, because, as has been partially explained in the course of this debate, they reflect an entirely satisfactory compromise on both the expenditure and the revenue side.
On the expenditure side, we have managed to make proposals with the potential to curb expenditure in a number of areas, while on the resources side, as a previous speaker indicated â I think it was a Council representative â there will be increases ranging from about 8 to 15% in the final analysis, depending on the items, if I recall the figure that was quoted a short time ago.
These, I repeat, are financially judicious positions.
Secondly, our positions are politically judicious too, on the one hand because the wishes expressed in this Financial Perspective are consistent with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives and on the other hand because those of our fellow citizens who want to take the trouble to fathom out the content of this Financial Perspective will find in it, I believe, a manifestation of our will to enhance our regions while improving our ability to master the challenges of the future.
This is why I am pleased with the positions adopted by Parliament on the BÃ¶ge report and why I call on the Commission and the Council to take heed of it.
In addition, it is my fervent wish that we should be listened to by the Council on 17 and 18 June and that our views receive a favourable hearing.
It is absolutely essential that the Councilâs conclusion on this matter should not be seen as a patched-up decision but rather as a giant step forward towards our vision of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, there can be few subjects closer to a Scotsmanâs heart than money and, as the only Scots representative on the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives, I have watched the often Kafkaesque debates with much interest â even when the real debate appears to be happening elsewhere.
However, the time for debate, in this House at least, is almost over.
It is the duty of this House to unite around this compromise so ably drafted by our rapporteur, because within the Council, where the real debate is taking place, the âone per cent clubâ, so ably led by the United Kingdom Government, continues to hold the whip hand.
It is not the perfect compromise â what compromise is?
However, we must send it to the Council with as strong a voice as possible.
I echo Mrs Krehl, my colleague on the Committee on Regional Development, when she says that regional policy is the most successful and most visible aspect of the Unionâs work to the citizens in whose name we carry out all our activities.
The view of the Temporary Committee protects regional policy, and a strong European regional policy which must be promoted and protected.
It grieves me that the United Kingdom shows every sign of continuing its mean-spirited, shortsighted stance within the Council.
It is incumbent upon us in this House to send a clear message to the âone per cent clubâ today that we will not tolerate anything less than this compromise.
We have heard high hopes from the Council that a deal remains hoped for.
I myself would not put any money on it any time soon.
It is for us to unite around the best deal possible.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my respect for the rapporteur and for his thoroughly ambitious effort that we are debating in this House today.
Although the report contains many good individual measures, I am unable to vote in favour of it.
The reason why my group has tabled its own motion for a resolution is that we wanted to take a different political course in the period from 2007 to 2013.
The principal reason for my negative response to the BÃ¶ge report is that the European Union is not equal to the enormous challenges it must face with the next Financial Perspective.
If we are to consider what needs to be done in society, the economy and the environment â particularly dealing with the demands made by regional cohesion, the high unemployment figures, poverty and income inequality â then we need to do so in a macro-economic context.
There is no trace of that in this report.
Generally speaking, we do not think that the upper limits proposed by the Commission for the Budget go far enough.
Its plan for giving the European Union more and more powers and responsibilities without, at the same time, allocating to it the financial resources it will need to realise them is quite simply not workable.
We regard the prioritisation of competitiveness, security and defence at the expense of cohesion, of the social and environmental dimension and of cooperation with developing countries as unacceptable.
This Financial Perspective reflects the attempt at implementing the Lisbon strategy, and we expressed our opposition to the present form of the latter when it was debated.
It is full employment and sustainable economic development that should instead be the strategic goals, and that means allocating additional financial resources to innovation, social needs and education in particular.
A reduced contribution of 0.41% of Europeâs gross domestic product will not make a strong European regional policy happen.
I hope that the Council will now not delay in reaching a decision, for, if it fails to do so, we can already reckon with the impossibility of proper allocation of new assistance funds at the beginning of 2007, and this would be politically irresponsible.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we now again face proposals to increase EU expenditure and, thus, income.
The argument is that the EU is growing and so must cost more.
The EU is growing both in terms of its number of Members and due to the fact that different tasks are constantly being taken over from the Member States.
Is this a sensible development?
The obvious answer is no.
The European countries that fulfil the membership requirements must of course be welcomed.
There are, however, neither rational reasons nor popular support for moving further political tasks from the Member States to Brussels.
On the contrary, the principle of subsidiarity, to which general homage is paid but which is never respected, requires a great many powers to be moved back from the EU institutions to the national parliaments.
The fact that this is the will of our peoples is evident from the referenda in France and the Netherlands and from what we know about public opinion in many other Member States.
Right now, we are seeing the end of an era in the EUâs history, the end of the era in which the political elite could move further ahead with its ambitions and plans without concerning itself with the will of the people.
That this was previously possible has to do with the fact that the structure of the parties in Western Europe reflects the issues of political controversy in the 20th century, arranged on a scale from right to left.
With few exceptions, the established parties are entirely in favour of a continuous shift of political power from the parliaments of the Member States to Brussels.
Thus, people cannot, in general elections to their parliaments, state that they are opposed to this development.
In referenda on EU issues and sometimes in elections to the European Parliament, the opportunity arises for the peoples of Europe explicitly to adopt positions on the role the EU should play.
They then take the opportunity to say no to the shift in power.
It is important for us to bear this in mind now that we are debating the EU budget for 2007-2013.
There is no popular support for increased expenditure in an EU in which just over 70% of the budget goes on agricultural policy and the regional funds.
We register a reservation against the temporary committeeâs proposal for the financial perspectives, amounting to 1.07% of gross domestic income in payment appropriations and 1.18% in commitments.
We believe that, in accordance with the G6 countriesâ proposal, the total payment appropriations should fall within one per cent of the EU countriesâ total gross domestic income.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate MrÂ BÃ¶ge on his ability to create a synthesis from the various trends that emerged, and, therefore, for the fine work carried out.
I would also like to make a brief observation on the trilogy of Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
The first two advocate keeping the commitment appropriations at the current level or slightly less (1.18% and 1.24%).
In contrast, the Council defends the prerogatives of the Member States, which are worried â and are even more so after the votes of France and the Netherlands on the Constitution â about the unrest gripping the Union like a vice; they delude themselves that, by reducing the funds, they can protect their respective positions, which are exposed to the dangers represented by China, India, the United States, global revolution, competitiveness and innovation.
Ours is a composite society, which lives beyond its means and which is increasingly at risk as a result of inflexible institutions, a government with limited sovereignty and a soulless Central Bank.
Reducing the interventions now instead of increasing them, as in my opinion is necessary ...
Â Â  Mr President, the Soviet Union had a total of 10 economic plans.
The European Union, for its part, has already had four budgetary plans: the Delors I and Delors II packages, the Santer plan and now the Barroso plan for the period from 2007 to 2013.
The Soviet plans, however, were designed to build up the economy, whereas the European budgetary plans are balancing mechanisms in which fliesâ eggs are weighed on spidersâ webs.
Our debate illustrates this: the 311-page BÃ¶ge report is essentially all about whether 450 million Europeans will commit appropriations amounting to 1.24%, 1.06% or 1.7% of GDP, in other words whether we shall spend EURÂ 1Â 024 billion, 870Â billion or 825Â billion over the next seven years while the United States spends USD 20Â 000 billion, some 20 times as much as the EU, over the same period.
To put it another way, our divergences of some EUR 60 billion between Juncker and Barroso or between Chirac and BÃ¶ge are equivalent to 0.3% of the US public expenditure estimates for the same period.
When we have more than 20 million unemployed and 50 million people living in poverty, it is obvious, and has been common knowledge since the time of Pericles, that the big issue is that of large loans for major investments, such as investments in our railways.
If Brussels had actually been building railway stations, for example, instead of constitutional castles in the air, the European Union would not have been shunted into the sidings.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the way things stand it would be naÃ¯ve to expect the new Financial Perspective to be based on the same principle as the EUâs previous spending plans.
The latter had nothing in common with the old Soviet five-year plans, as their guiding principle was that we should have a growing budget to meet our growing needs.
One could be forgiven for expecting the same to apply today, given that relatively poor countries have joined the EU.
There has also been a sharp increase in the number of farmers eligible for direct payments, even though such payments were not their idea.
Finally, our tasks have multiplied, which also has a measurable impact on the budget.
If this principle were indeed expected to apply again, it would undoubtedly act as another driving force behind the far-reaching political reforms currently under way in Central and Eastern Europe.
I am quite sure that the political classes of the âoldâ EU Member States would be hard pushed to carry out even some of these reforms.
At the same time, however, we must face the facts, which are as follows.
The proposed compromise bequeathed to us by the Prodi Commission is indefensible.
MrÂ BÃ¶ge has put an enormous amount of effort and good will into a proposal amending this compromise, and the relative weight it accords to the various budget headings is appropriate.
NoÂ one would dispute the fact that we should use public funds to promote research and development and a knowledge-based economy, but there is not yet any evidence that this is an effective way of spending money.
It follows that such funding should not be provided at the expense of regional and cohesion policy, which is both visible and of proven benefit, and which does not pit the old and the new cohesion countries against each other.
This House must make it abundantly clear tomorrow that we are expecting agreement to be reached at government level.
Europe needs evidence that it still functions.
The European summit will be an opportunity to furnish such evidence in the form of a sensible compromise.
Â Â  Mr President, may I begin by saying that Reimer BÃ¶ge has done a really good job with this report.
He has managed to reflect the position of the committee faithfully.
Not everyone will agree with the full contents of the report, but overall it is very good and he is to be congratulated.
Different views are represented in this House, whether it be on agriculture, structural funds or whatever.
You cannot please all of the people all of the time, but that is not such a bad thing.
You have not pleased us, because, as you would expect, the main point of departure for the British Labour delegation is the implied reference to the United Kingdom rebate.
In this part of the debate I seem to be a voice in the wilderness, but I will carry on.
I refer to recital N, which I totally disagree with, and also to paragraph 8 and the fifth indent of paragraphÂ 51.
I have always made it clear in the temporary committee that own resources and the Financial Perspective are two separate issues, and never before has there been an attempt to link them under any of the previous IIAs.
That is why the British Labour delegation is hesitant about supporting the report.
The report will certainly give Parliament a good starting point for negotiations with the Council, which I welcome.
Of course, until we know Council's agreed position, if there is one, it is difficult to say how those negotiations will go.
I suppose it is still possible in theory that the Council will agree with Parliament's figures, or even go higher.
Some of us live in hope.
However, from the beginning when Members raised the issue of linking the Financial Perspective with a new system of own resources, I have used the phrase "get real" on at least three occasions.
We have to âget realâ about what the Council will do.
This is not going to happen.
In the remaining three weeks of the Luxembourg presidency, for all its skilful diplomacy I would be surprised if this were to be part of any package, if indeed the Council has a position.
I personally believe that the present own resources system is opaque and we need something more transparent, so that taxpayers can understand how the EU is financed.
That discussion and decision will take place in a different House at a different time.
I know that will not please colleagues in my Group, but we have to live in the real world and recognise the limits of our competencies.
If the British delegation abstains on this report, it is for the reason that I have outlined.
As for the future, I wish you well when you start the conciliation negotiations.
Â Â  Thank you Mr Wynn.
I will pass on your warm remarks to Mrs Thatcher.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, one of the comments MrÂ BÃ¶ge made during the presentation of his first-rate report was that it was about a forward-looking Europe.
In my opinion, this is a splendid phrase.
It serves as a common ground for Parliament and the Commission, and highlights the distance between these two institutions and the Council, which at present is incapable of transcending national interests and finding the answer that Europe needs.
The European project is currently at crisis point.
The only response to this crisis has to be the good news that Europe is capable of looking to the future with hope, and that Europe itself can be the source of such hope.
The BÃ¶ge report indicates, and rightly so, that there is no contradiction between the European Unionâs policies of cohesion and solidarity and Europeâs economic competitiveness.
This is an important point, and I believe that it is equally important for the Financial Perspective to be a driving force behind European integration, rather than a factor widening the gap between the new and the old Member States, or between Eastern and Western Europe.
The countries that have rejoined Europe are particularly vulnerable, and this is something people need to understand.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr BÃ¶ge for his high-quality work in the Committee.
Although we have already heard praise from many quarters for the balance of the work he has done, we â and I â take the view that the failure to put sufficient emphasis on some areas is precisely the problem.
I want to pick up right now on what Mr Geremek said.
Is the policy that we are now engaged in devising really sufficiently focussed on the future?
What are we in fact doing for the European public, and what can they then do for Europe?
I feel at a deep level that, after the two failed referenda, we have to consider how, as a matter of policy, we can communicate better with the people of Europe.
I believe that our educational programmes, despite the boost that they have already given us, have not taken us as far as we have to go in terms of the Lisbon strategy; over the coming years, by means of the Financial Perspective, we must do everything possible to ensure that every schoolboy, every schoolgirl and every student can gain an education and study in another European country.
They will relate emotionally to Europe, to its diversity and to its opportunities, in a quite different way, and it is thus that we develop convinced Europeans from the ground upwards.
Those are the sort of networks we need.
The situation is exactly the same as regards cultural policy.
We are so proud of the fact that the Wall is no longer there and that we are a continent of diverse cultures.
The Budget estimate still falls short of what we spend on subsidising tobacco.
We need to be visibly proactive here, enabling town-twinning schemes to flourish, enabling artists to meet each other and enabling people to have a real experience of Europeâs cultural riches.
That is why the estimates contained in Mr BÃ¶geâs proposal do not go far enough.
Let us, together, be bold in trying to get the message across to people, not only to their minds, but also to their hearts.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr BÃ¶geâs report setting out Parliamentâs position on the Communityâs financial framework for 2007-2013 is in fact less favourable than the Commissionâs proposal, which was in itself woefully inadequate in terms of financial resources and was out of step with the actual needs of the enlarged Union.
Both proposals, at their core, are tantamount to surrendering to the strategy pursued by the wealthy countries, such as Germany, which seeks to reduce the Community budget as far as possible.
This, let me stress, did not happen in the case of previous enlargements.
These proposals neither protect nor safeguard the interests of cohesion countries such as Portugal, which may once again be penalised by the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, despite warnings that it would be the country that stood to suffer the most from the enlargement.
Given that what we actually need to do is to strengthen economic and social cohesion, we have tabled practical proposals.
These proposals include complete compensation for regions, such as the Algarve, affected by the so-called statistical effect, a specific programme targeted at Portugal and Greece to adjust their economies in light of the impact of the enlargement, an end to the pegging of the cohesion fund to the Stability and Growth Pact, the rejection of renationalising the costs of cofinancing the common agricultural policy, the promotion of a fairer model for distributing agricultural aid, the guarantee of a seven-year financial framework and the creation of a Community programme for the textiles and clothing sector, especially for the least-favoured regions that depend on that sector.
These proposals were, to our dismay, rejected by Parliamentâs Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective.
Â Â  â After the fall of the Iron Curtain, we in the Czech Republic had to wait a disproportionately long 14 years before our citizens could decide in a referendum whether we wanted to join the European Union.
They said âyesâ.
At that time, we agreed to humiliating conditions attached to accession, in which our highly efficient farming sector was granted only a quarter of the subsidies compared with our competitors in the old European Union countries, as well as conditions conflicting with the founding principles of the European Union â protection regulations preventing the free employment of our citizens in many of the old countries of the Union.
We also find that services may not be directly provided in the old Member States, and we recently discovered how tricky it will be for businesses that logically wish to relocate â still within the EU â to our country with its highly qualified and industrious workforce, which works 40 hours per week rather than 35 and which does not demand exorbitant wages.
Indeed, it has only taken a year for us to be disabused of many naÃ¯ve ideas.
We want to believe at least in the basic promises that led our citizens to say âyesâ in the accession referendum.
The promises were about financial resources, which, they said, would provide funds for the development of the Czech Republic as they had done before in Portugal, Ireland and elsewhere.
It is therefore logical that we support the Commissionâs proposal to maintain the 1.24%.
Let me make clear that we are not against cuts.
We are, alas, well aware that the cuts will only come at the expense of funds.
Nevertheless, the administration of the Union will not become any cheaper: on the contrary, the dream of a European foreign minister, the dream of embassies, the more than 3000 opaque regulatory and advisory bodies, and the all-penetrating regulations set out in twenty languages will make operating the Union more expensive.
We all know where there are huge amounts of money from which savings can be made.
The common agricultural policy, for example, pointlessly fritters away more than 40% of the budget, but is well known to be a politically untouchable entity, which Parliament, absurdly, is not even allowed to discuss.
Only the funds remain to be cut.
During the year, we have already learnt that the most frequently used magic word is âsustainableâ, which is used without thinking to label all concepts.
If we really wish to create a sustainable budget, one that does not lead to further disillusion ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as a convinced pro-European, but equally as an Italian Member who is also here to represent and defend the interests of her nation, I find the Juncker proposal, setting the paltry sum of 1.05% of GDP for the contributions of the Member States to the European budget, to be unacceptable.
In the case of Italy alone, which is a net contributor to the European Union, that means an annual cut of around EUR 8 billion, reducing the funds allocated to employment and justice to the bare bones, and cancelling almost half of the funds for research, innovation and trans-European networks, not to mention the Lisbon Strategy.
There are too many cuts and too many contradictions.
The so-called UK rebate also needs to be reviewed.
In actual fact, this exception, the privilege that sees Great Britain obtain a rebate of a substantial proportion of the contributions it makes, must be scrapped.
It is a provision sought by MrsÂ Thatcher â in 1984, if I am not mistaken â that was unfortunately, and inexplicably, reconfirmed during MrÂ Prodiâs presidency: a rebate that is mostly paid for by France and by Italy.
To conclude, the Juncker proposal is the umpteenth demonstration of the profound distance that exists between European bureaucracy and the real needs of the European people.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this context too, I am happy to reiterate that it is not appropriate to top up financial resources at a time when globalisation is, from Europeâs point of view, turning into a trap rather than a dream.
This 1% will be a solution, and we will manage with it, for we are far from exhausting the possibilities for budgetary rigour, and we should press for the progressive introduction of as many administrative branches as possible having their efficiency and economy evaluated by independent and international consultancy firms, thereby highlighting areas where improvement is needed.
That was the gist of my Amendment 357.
The rapporteur was against it, and it is not in the report; not even that is to be permitted.
You cannot be surprised that most of the people out there are saying ânoâ to this EU and to this wastefulness, even if â as I do â they say âyesâ to Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I would like to thank our colleague, Rainer BÃ¶ge, for the work that he has done on this report.
I greatly appreciate it and I do not believe that anyone else would have done a better job and produced such an excellent and impartial report.
Tomorrow Parliament must send a strong and positive message to the citizens of Europe.
We need to have as large a majority as possible back this report.
If Parliament stands united on this issue, we will also be sending a strong message to the Council.
Unity in the matter of financial frameworks is still achievable during Luxembourgâs presidential term, if there is the political will and leadership.
I would like to raise two matters which I think are important: the future of agriculture, and the Baltic Sea.
Agricultural policy has inevitably got to the stage where agricultural subsidies to the old 15 Member States will be reduced with future enlargements.
We have to prepare ourselves properly for this.
I support the amendment tabled by my group which proposes that, if the Council decides to reduce overall funding of compulsory expenditure, the 2002 Brussels agreement notwithstanding, the Member States will have to compensate for this reduction financially.
In this connection it nevertheless needs to be said that switching to joint financing of agriculture will be a realistic move, if not for this financial perspective, then at least for those to follow.
I also wish to turn your attention to the amendment that concerns the Baltic Sea strategy.
At present, the Union has a Mediterranean Sea strategy, and in parallel with that we want now to establish a Baltic Sea strategy.
This strategy will be especially important for nature conservation.
Today the Baltic Sea has immense problems.
When conditions are at their worst you cannot bathe or fish in the sea, and we need effective measures to restore the Baltic to its natural state.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Perspective outlines the scope of the EUâs activities over coming years, as well as providing a framework for such activities and determining how effective they will be.
There are major tasks ahead of us.
We want to ensure that enlargement is successfully completed, to lay the foundations for rapid growth and job creation and to achieve the new goals established during the debates held while the European Constitution was being drafted.
The Financial Perspective must meet these expectations.
We all want more Europe, because we believe that the creation of a common Europe is the right answer to the challenges we face today.
Two opposing approaches and ways of thinking emerged during work on the Financial Perspective.
The first, advocated by the Commission, provides for an ambitious but balanced increase in expenditure, which would keep pace with growing expectations.
The second, backed by a group of Member States, consists in cuts to the budget as a percentage of GDP.
We are fully aware that although the EUâs remit has expanded, it must deliver on this remit at a time of severe budgetary restrictions and weak economic growth.
Under no circumstances, however, should these restrictions make us blind to the unquestionable benefits that may be gained from measures funded from the common EU budget.
It follows that a compromise is necessary, and an eminently sensible one is set out in Parliamentâs proposal.
If I may, I should like to take this opportunity to thank MrÂ BÃ¶ge for the effort he has put into drafting this report.
Ladies and gentlemen, the unsuccessful referenda in France and the Netherlands mean Europe now needs clear confirmation that integration is and will continue to be our common future.
I would therefore call on the Council to reach a compromise, to abandon selfish and conservative attitudes and to go beyond the narrow confines of purely national interests.
The reason I call for a compromise is that the European Union is in urgent need of a clear vision of the future and the financial capacity to take action.
We should work together to demonstrate that Europe is capable of acting in a spirit of solidarity, and that its political leaders are able to rise above short-term political interests and reach agreements for the common good.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to reiterate our thanks to Mr BÃ¶ge, and I think it appropriate that his report mentions not only the EUâs expenses but also, in a number of paragraphs, the need for the revision of the own-resources decision; unlike some other speakers, I take the view that it is completely undeserved that one country should be entitled to a correction mechanism every year, while that is not the case for other countries that are in the same situation.
There are a few key points I should like to mention.
I am in favour of cofinancing agricultural expenses for the reasons mentioned in the report.
I am opposed to renationalisation.
We must have the same rules across Europe, but Mr BÃ¶geâs proposals are acceptable.
Flexibility is also a useful tool in the budget, not only in the items themselves but also with regard to cofinancing percentages of structural aid.
It may well be the case that richer countries have a higher cofinancing percentage than poor countries.
The role of the European Investment Bank should be enhanced in structural expenses and so should that of the European Investment Fund.
We can draw on good examples from the past.
Finally, there is one more point I should like to make about common foreign and security policy.
I take the view that those expenses should also fall completely within Parliamentâs competence.
It should not be simply up to the Council; Parliament must approve them as well.
Â Â  Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶ge, has done a good job.
When introducing this report, he pointed out that the Budget leaves certain areas of policy and the economy chronically underfunded.
Rural development is threatening to become one of them.
In consequence of a Council decision, funding is tied up until 2013 in the first pillar, where, however, resources are inadequate for funding Romania and Bulgaria.
It is for this reason that the report proposes the introduction of cofinancing in the first pillar.
While our group wishes to support this cofinancing, our aim in doing so is to achieve better funding for matters covered by the second pillar.
The funds from Natura 2000 must be mobilised.
In the second pillar, rural development must be funded on an equal basis, that is to say with 75% from the European Union, and the proper economic development of rural areas must be guaranteed.
Far from this being a financial act of mercy, the overall health of our economic development is dependent on rural areas not being left behind.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the voice of the citizens for a more social and more democratic Europe is growing, unfortunately the Council and the Junker Presidency are going backwards, with six countries holding a gun to the others' head.
They are calling, at any cost, for a compromise to the lowest common denominator.
They are abandoning the ambitious targets for the future of European unification.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the philosophy of an agreement 'at any cost' which also permeates the BÃ¶ge report, because it results in less Europe and greater inequalities and has as its victims the weaker countries and the weaker social groups.
Europe and the Council should, at long last, understand that there cannot be more and a bigger European Union with less money. The European United Left considers the Commission proposal to be a totally inadequate starting point for financing the objectives of cohesion and the social agenda following enlargement.
Any thought, therefore, of further reduction is incomprehensible as far as we are concerned. In the name of the European United Left, I call for a fair division of the costs of enlargement.
Not for the poorer countries and regions to pay most. For the unacceptable scandal of the British exemption to end.
We are all equal. For the injustice against the 16 regions which are victim of the so-called statistical effect to be addressed fully and positively and for stronger support to be safeguarded during the transitional period of the regions which have not yet completed the convergence process themselves.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr BÃ¶ge on his report and especially his highlighting of the importance of investment in research and development with a view to meeting the Lisbon Agenda objectives.
The report also recognises, and rightly so, that education and training should be prioritised in the funding proposed and I believe that the allocation of resources to the development of human capital is vital for long-term investment in the Unionâs future.
I do not share the rapporteurâs recommendations relating to the common agricultural policy and I cannot support his suggestion to introduce co-financing of the CAP.
This, as I have said on numerous occasions, is something that has never been, is not and never will be acceptable to those of us who are committed to defending farmers with small- and medium-sized farms and our rural communities.
We should be under no illusion that in time co-financing of the CAP will inevitably lead to its renationalisation.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, in practice Parliamentâs line on the EU budget shows no evidence of solidarity with the Commission, and this is a great shame.
We spend a lot of time in this House talking about a strong EU that would compete with the USA or Asia, yet a strong EU with a small budget is inconceivable, not to say absurd.
It needs to be stated in plain terms that the Temporary Committeeâs proposal would leave us worse off than that put forward by the Barroso Commission.
It is, however, a vast improvement on the Luxembourg Presidencyâs so-called compromise, which was doomed to failure.
If the richest EU Member States insist on imposing their opinion on everyone else, the end result will be that the vision of a common Europe, based on solidarity, is shattered.
If our aim is to build a Europe of selfish and personal interests, we should go ahead and support a small EU budget.
The other possibility, of course, is that the real proposal being put to the new EU Member States is for the enlarged EU to be a Europe of solidarity only in terms of duties.
The opposite would apply as far as privileges are concerned, especially those of the financial variety.
I should like to make one final point.
It is better for financial perspectives to be agreed over a seven-year period, as has been the case to date, rather than a five-year period.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what do our discussions about the next financial framework boil down to?
They are in essence about the tasks that we have to perform at European level.
When the Commissionâs proposal is along the lines of doing what it does already, and then some new things on top, then it is making matters too easy for itself.
What our rapporteur deserves a great deal of credit for is the way he has gone into the details, taking a look at the tasks â including those connected with the Budget â that we in the EU will have to get to grips with in the 21st century, at where more resources are needed âÂ in foreign and security policy â and at where the Commissionâs proposals are excessive and we can make cutbacks.
What we have here, as a result, is an excellent proposal, and one that will serve as a basis for very serious negotiations with the Council.
A European Union that defines itself solely in terms of the redistribution of as much money as possible is not the European Union I want to see; there are other tasks that we have to perform together.
If we require the Member States to consolidate their budgets in order to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact, we cannot at the same time go around dispensing largesse the length and breadth of Europe.
This is a task we have to face up to together.
If you say â as Mrs TrÃŒpel, being a Green, does â that 70 cents for culture cannot be excessive if you set it against the expenditure on the Millennium Goals and all the other goals, then your payments end up amounting to 1.19%.
What the Greens are proposing, then, is to commit 1.29%.
If that is what you want, then I suggest that you tell the people that there is no money left at the national level, but Europe is spending more, and see where that gets you.
Our credibility depends on our concentrating not only on the political tasks in hand â and that is how we respond to the referenda â but also on the Budget.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is success in the European Union, it is in community, in cooperation, in a common interest in the ongoing development of the kind that is before us.
We have to consider how we are going to deal with what we face in the years to come, and the public are watching us closely as we do so.
What do our actions do for our credibility?
We know that there are tasks awaiting us that will call for courage and a pro-active approach, that will require that we spell out the fact that this European Union is an economic community with an interest in success.
While the consequence of this is that we have to invest in the future by stepping up research and improving education and training, we also have to take care that, in this economic community geared to economic success, people and regions are not left behind, and so there is also a need for assistance for those who may, in the course of these changes and developments, have got into difficulties or are already living under problematic circumstances.
It is there in this report.
It is because the report that Mr BÃ¶ge has presented specifically aims to set out guidelines for this and to make available the resources that we need that we are prepared to support it, but the public also expect their representatives â for such is what we are â to think not only about how to spend money where necessary, but also about the supply side; in other words, they want to know where the money is going to come from.
It is, after all, the public who have to foot the bill for all this.
It must therefore be acceptable to ask at European level whether the burden of these tasks is equally shared.
It is quite clear that nothing now justifies the British rebate.
We all have to go out and show the people of Europe, in all our countries, that we are ready and willing to make the necessary funding available.
At the same time, we are ready and able to ensure that the resulting burdens are shared out fairly and in a spirit of solidarity.
Solidarity means not just joining together in sharing out resources; it also means making sure that individuals are not overburdened while others stand aside and bid them manage as best they can.
We want to ensure together that Europe changes for the better.
Â Â  Mr President, Rainer BÃ¶geâs report before us concerns the future financing of the EU.
I wish to say a special thank you to him for his exceptional expertise and hard work.
At the same time I wish to thank all the committee members for their constructive cooperation.
The financial frameworks create a basis for the EUâs future policy areas.
Particular areas of focus this time are regional, structural and cohesion policy and improved levels of employment and competitiveness.
The intention is to increase structural policy financing and rural development funds, to guarantee that there is balanced development.
The needs of the new Member States are understood and accepted, but the report quite rightly points out that the more susceptible regions of the old Member States should not be made to pay for the new cohesion policy.
To improve employment levels and boost economic growth, the purpose within the financial frameworks is to invest particularly in research and development, and education and training.
This money would be increased to three times the sum in seven years.
The priority is absolutely the right one.
Economising on these is economising on our own future, and this I wish to warn others against, especially the country holding the presidency.
The aim is to use additional funds to strengthen the European dimension in research and development.
I would like to make a strong appeal to the Member States to lose no time in adopting the new financial perspective and the interinstitutional Agreement as proposed by Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to concentrate on regional policy, which is a particular concern of mine.
I would like to reiterate that one of the great advances achieved by this report consists in the 0.41% allocation to something that is visible in even the smallest European village and makes Europe visible to those who live there.
The European Unionâs instrument of solidarity is economic and social cohesion.
As we know, the Council is at present proposing a mere 0.37% as a basis for negotiation.
I, for one, am prepared to go along with a 4% per Member State limit and with the retention â contrary to what was contained in the original draft â of the N+2 rule for the Cohesion Fund.
I wish again to stress that I do not endorse our groupâs proposal, as I do not believe that we need to impose an five-year limit, which is, in terms of regional policy, unacceptable under the present difficult conditions.
Â Â  The European Union does not have at its disposal the ideal mechanisms for either generating or allocating resources.
Nor has it adopted a 10- to 20-year perspective on specific economic and other policies.
One has only to remember the long-term lack of effective supervision of agriculture.
Despite the huge efforts it made, which I appreciate, the temporary committee could not, at this stage, have achieved any more than it did, MrÂ BÃ¶ge, and there is a chance that Parliament will vote in favour of this compromise.
Whereas Parliament considers that resources should be set at 1.08% of gross national product, the Council considers, in contrast, that the figure should be between 1.03% and 1.05% of gross domestic product.
This shows that the future will be less about indices than about the correct mechanisms for distributing resources, and many pitfalls still lie in wait on the path to final agreement in the area of the financial perspective.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I will put aside the thoughts I had gathered for today in order to consider a number of interventions and again explore what they are about.
The Commission has come up with a proposal, and Parliament â by means of the BÃ¶ge report and of tomorrowâs decision â has shown itself capable of acting and negotiating.
At present, the Council â lacking any agreement whatever on a basis for negotiation â is capable of doing neither of those things.
Our proposal is a compromise.
I call upon the Heads of State or Government, along with their ministers of finance, to read it through for themselves and to see whether it might make it possible to broker an agreement in the Council without our weakening the European Union.
I am addressing the Members of the Council when I say that the proposal they have already put on the table amounts to 40% less for the EUâs competitiveness, 10% less for cohesion and growth and employment, 6% less for rural development and agriculture, 50% less for internal policies and 40% less for the European Unionâs role as a global partner.
You may thereby get agreement in the Council, but you will not get any agreement from us, not least for the second reason, which is that you are making cuts across the board.
If we stick to the status quo, without setting any new priorities, we will need EURÂ 890 billion.
Your proposal envisages EURÂ 871 billion.
If we do not come to an agreement, we will have EURÂ 931 billion.
Your Budget is tighter than the one we have already and more limited than a lack of agreement would make it, and that is why you have to understand that our offer is made with negotiations in mind.
If the figure goes below EURÂ 931 billion, there will not be any!
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to acknowledge Mr BÃ¶geâs determination to carry out this exercise in financial engineering and balancing on the first occasion in the history of the financial perspectives that the European Parliament has voluntarily set its direct ambitions even lower than the Commissionâs proposal, which was already minimal.
Only the opportunity to facilitate a quick, balanced and fair agreement, which clears up any doubts and anxieties at this time, could justify this.
That is how we wish to interpret the Commission's conciliatory words and we would urge the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to do so.
Nevertheless, I am not pleased that Parliament should be demonstrating a minimalist tendency which began with the last Agenda 2000 and which has not helped to increase confidence amongst the European citizens.
I am referring to the risk of the budget returning to a renationalising tendency and of basing the Unionâs objectives upon insufficient resources.
We regret the pressure represented by the initial proposal of six Member States, some of which were perfectly understandable given the current situation, but others are guilty of not sufficiently explaining the added value of each euro spent and the high economic and commercial return resulting from the Union's development.
We regret that the 1% has replaced the ideas by percentage, but, on the other hand, it has also relaunched the debate on the urgency of fundamentally reviewing the system of own resources.
What we do not agree with is the fact that the rapporteur applies it exclusively to the funding of the CAP, which is still trying to digest the last Brussels reform; let us not throw our farmers out with the bathwater.
We welcome the effort to maintain the share for the cohesion policy, and also the strengthening of the Union's social policies, growth and employment policies and also justice and foreign policies.
We would call on the rapporteur to extend the logical phasing out mechanism, which already acknowledges the regions affected by the amplifying effect of enlargement, and to apply it to the Cohesion Fund.
The European Parliament defended it in Agenda 2000 and we do not understand why, when the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is applying it, Parliament is not now doing so.
We also call on the rapporteur to accept Amendment 1, which combats the discrimination that would result from applying the competition and excellence policy in an exclusive manner.
Â Â  The report presented to the Parliament by Mr BÃ¶ge is an excellent example of the common work of an enlarged [European Union] of 25 Member States.
I do regret that we take no pleasure in that.
Finding a decision concerning the Community funds that would be acceptable and apprehensible for all was a very complicated task; however, this successful decision proves that the enlarged European Union is viable and has a long-term vision of economic development.
Naturally, we could have come to that decision sooner and better had there been no attempts to oppose national and co-European interests, had there been no deviations in the technical particulars.
At times I got the impression that we had convened as a group of accountants instead of societyâs leaders.
We have to understand that we need to develop a common European vision prior to commencing any financial planning, and this common European vision is being missed by both the citizens and the representatives of the society.
Therefore, any discussions about financial plans, annual plans that will specify this perspective, should commence with a discussion about that economic vision, which we all have to develop; only thereafter should we define the spheres, the type of financing and the means required.
That is what I miss in the work of the European Commission, and I do regret that todayâs speech by the Commission President has been a complaint of a very tired person to Parliament about the problems of negotiations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I fear that this very important debate on the Financial Perspective will breed frustration, because the Council is proposing something of a shoestring budget which does not match Europeâs ambitions.
Nevertheless, my thanks go to the rapporteur, MrÂ BÃ¶ge, whose task was a difficult one and who managed to accommodate Membersâ demands.
To come to the Financial Perspective, it continues to give a great deal of cause for concern and is unacceptable in some points.
Following the events of these past few weeks, there is a need to be able to respond to public expectations and not to let a chasm open up between political promises and the action that would serve to achieve the objectives of competitiveness, full employment, research and training and, above all, solidarity.
Yes, we are in favour of cohesion policy, provided it does not rule out support to the regions of the old 15-member Union that remain disadvantaged.
Allow me to explain my concern with regard to the Council.
The Member States must not be timid about Europe.
What can I say about the proposals regarding the common agricultural policy, the CAP, which is poised to become a national agricultural policy or NAP, an appropriate name, with the Council closing its eyes to the needs of farmers as renationalisation looms and a political symbol of Europe is set to disappear?
The same concern surrounds regional policy, which our regions need so much, and our major trans-European projects.
We shall also be very vigilant with regard to the funding of NaturaÂ 2000.
If we are to finance our priorities, there will surely be a need to review the rules governing the calculation of the Unionâs resources and to renegotiate the benefits granted during the last century, particularly the British rebate.
MrÂ Barroso has told us that he can count on the European Parliament.
Together, we shall perhaps succeed in persuading the Council that it really must make an effort to ensure that the EU budget is not the shoestring budget I dread.
Â Â  Mr President, my government says that the British budget rebate is defensible, and it is!
On the same basis, net contributors like Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, should also have a rebate.
But over the next few years the British rebate will increase markedly in size and the poorest Member States will have to contribute towards it.
That is not defensible.
My government says that the rebate is non-negotiable.
This is nonsense.
The European Union is a giant machine for negotiating agreements between 25 countries and everything relevant should be considered negotiable if positive benefits can be secured in return.
The rebate was introduced because of imbalances in the workings of the common agricultural policy.
The price that Britain should demand for negotiating the rebate is the reopening of the agreement on agricultural spending, an agreement to which it acquiesced.
We should support rural development; we should compensate farmers to ensure that environmental concerns are addressed.
However, we should no more subsidise the very existence of farms than we should subsidise factories, quarries or coal mines.
The CAP discriminates against farmers in developing nations and penalises our own consumers.
A phased but significant programme of cuts in Pillar 1 expenditure should be introduced.
That is the price Britain should demand. But to continue arguing that the rebate is simply non-negotiable is neither good for Europe nor best for Britain.
Â Â  â Mr President, although I congratulate Mr BÃ¶ge on the work he has done, I should like to add my voice to the voices of all my fellow Members who expressed the wish for decisions on the financial perspectives to be taken now because, apart from anything else, the impression should not be given that the institutional crisis in the European Union is deepening.
However, they must not, of course, be taken at the cost of the prospects of the European Union itself.
The decisions need to be taken at a satisfactory level for all the Member States.
In saying this, I cannot but add that I am sorry that the proposals by the Luxembourg Presidency operate, unfortunately, to a very large degree to the detriment of cohesion policies with the proposed reduction from 0.41% of Community GDP to 0.37%.
In all events, I should like to say that it is important that the Presidency at least try to limit the adverse repercussions of its proposals.
How?
Firstly, with compensation mechanisms for the countries and regions which are disproportionately affected by the mechanism for distributing appropriations proposed by the Commission.
Secondly, by reallocating the appropriations lost due to the Î+2 rule.
Similarly, I should like to say that we are, of course, opposed to the renationalisation and cofinancing of the common agricultural policy and, finally, to add, as there is talk on many sides of the savings which need to be made and of the fact that we cannot hand out additional appropriations, that the European Union budget corresponds in total to 2.5% of public spending in all the Member States.
At some point, words and deeds with respect to the European Union will need to coincide.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Union should now demonstrate its ability to act by adopting an ambitious Financial Perspective.
The fact is that the Presidencyâs proposals, although they do break the 1% barrier, remain timid.
That the Union should only be allowed to spend another EUR 40 billion in absolute terms over a seven-year period is disappointing.
Let us imagine for a moment that all of this money were to be invested in research.
At the present time, the Americans spend one hundred billion euros more than Europeans on research every year. An amount of 40 billion, spread over seven years, would not even correspond to half of the present annual shortfall, although much of this gap will obviously have to be filled by the private sector.
Europe has run aground.
The political gnomes who govern us are allowing demagogues from the extreme Right and Left, including National Socialists and other separatists, to demolish the European dream.
Our Union needs more solidarity and therefore more of its own resources in order to overthrow the niggardly accounting system based on net balances and rebates.
I have proposed a European levy of one cent on every litre of petrol, diesel and kerosene sold in the Union.
No consumer or economic operator would buckle under the weight of such a tax, which would net more than EUR 40 billion over seven years.
Let us dare to break the mould of national self-interest; let us dare to adopt a more European approach.
It is impossible to identify precisely where benefits accrue and costs are incurred within a single market.
The countries with the most developed economies evidently benefit most from any additional common growth.
Â Â  The BÃ¶ge report is good not only because it is a splendid piece of work, but also because it lends itself to being used as a pillar for negotiations, while at the same time being a practicable compromise in itself.
It enables the plans of the Union to be put into effect, but without placing an intolerable burden on the contributors.
It boldly proposes new solutions for new situations.
One such solution, that is often mentioned, is national top-ups, which, incidentally, has already been tried out on us, the new Member States.
It is in the interests of Hungary and of all the cohesion countries, that 0.41% of EU income is channelled into supporting convergence.
With this, we will be able to develop research and a knowledge-based society and promote road-network construction and job creation.
All of this will help to breathe life into the Lisbon dream.
But will anything actually come of it at all?
The question for the moment is not so much how to reach agreement on concrete figures with the Council, but whether there will be a Council position at all, in other words, whether the European Council will reach agreement with itself?
If the Heads of Government spend their time next week merely bemoaning the outcome of the referenda on the Constitution and fail to decide on the basic principles of the financial framework aimed at serving the interests of the citizens of Europe, then, to the delight of the eurosceptics, the Union really will face a crisis.
Reaching a common position geared towards the interests of the new Europe of 450 million citizens will be a good thing for every Member State.
Aloofness and selfishness never lead anywhere.
The solution is not to turn away from the Union, but to embrace Europe even more.
Following the failure of the referenda, can we allow matters to be made worse by the failure of the financial plans for the period after 2007?
Fellow Members of this House, let us support the BÃ¶ge report, let there be at least one piece of solid ground in this situation in which collapse seems imminent and let the citizens of Europe see which institution represents their real interests.
Â Â  MrÂ President, members of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome of the referendum has had such a powerful impact on the political debate and on peopleâs psychology that some commentators have been forced to even wonder whether there is still a need for the European institutions now that the remarkable peace mission carried out by Europe is complete.
We are well aware that Europe is not only useful, but also necessary.
In order for Europe to be useful, unified and competitive, however, and therefore perceived as necessary by the people, it must be able to develop its policies and be endowed with the resources to do so.
Within this syllogism, which may seem obvious, lies the full significance of the battle that Parliament is waging on the financial perspectives.
Therein lies the significance of everything that this Houseâs rapporteur, Reiner BÃ¶ge, has been able to instil in a text that I consider satisfactory and pragmatic, without being defeatist.
Without doubt, the question that we are all asking is: âWill we succeed in reaching an agreement with the Council?â
A lot depends on the scale of our vote, ladies and gentlemen, and even more on the ability of Heads of Government to resist becoming overwhelmed by the logic of money and their devotion to their own national interests.
This afternoon MrÂ Barroso delivered a clear and determined address, which we welcome.
MrÂ Juncker should apply his remarkable negotiating skills to the pursuit of a dignified agreement and avoid being dragged into a never-ending bilateral mediation which, , risks unjustly and unjustifiably penalising certain parties.
My fellow Members, I call on us to defend, with a broad-based and united vote, the right and duty of the Union to exist and to carry out its work.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to point out that one of the fundamental merits of the work of the rapporteur, MrÂ BÃ¶ge, is that of regarding the process of European integration as an ongoing political dynamic, with high-profile objectives and ambitions.
Confidence, prospects and momentum: these are what the public needs today in order to avoid falling victim to scepticism and resignation.
I would above all, therefore, like to give credit to MrÂ BÃ¶ge for having, with great wisdom and balance, produced a sensitive report that required complex analysis and has resulted in effective political proposals.
It is an even more worthy outcome considering the difficult climate, due particularly to narrow-minded, intransigent pressure groups, in which his work began and has continued up to now.
The resolution points out the priorities for the revival of Europe: the untouchable status of the cohesion policy, the importance of promoting the competitiveness and development of the Union, the need for an increasingly effective common policy in the area of justice and home affairs, the need to give impetus to external relations and to the dynamics of integration of the single market, in addition to enhancing the concept of flexibility in order to make the European financial framework agile and effective.
We cannot hide the fact, however, that from the way in which it is outlined in MrÂ BÃ¶geâs report, the European Parliamentâs position differs significantly from the working document presented by the Luxembourg Presidency on 2 June.
We fear that the European Council may approve a compromise with extremely disappointing political and financial content.
In the knowledge that we will be faced with a compromise, which will be the outcome of painful mediation, we will never let our readiness to find balanced solutions dwindle.
We will do everything possible to avert the possibility of an institutional battle.
It must be clear, however, that the Council will not be able to call on our sense of responsibility, in order to involve the European Parliament in an exercise that has the effect of killing off the integration process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EU has just celebrated the 60th anniversary of a shared peace at a time when two of the founding countries have just expressed their doubts at the ballot box.
Faced with the social effects of globalisation, the moral crisis linked to unemployment and inequality is adding to the democratic crisis, not to mention the budgetary crisis.
The final decision on the financial perspectives will be crucial to the credibility and legitimacy of the EU and of its institutions.
Two political events are much anticipated.
The first is the success of enlargement.
It is our duty to reach this stage, in the interests of equality between our countries and our citizens.
The contribution recommended by our rapporteur for territorial and social cohesion is necessary, though not adequate: specifically, it lacks increased funding for transport networks.
I also support the creation of the growth adjustment fund to help us achieve this objective.
The second event is the future: our old industrial continent is in the process of changing and we must level out the territorial, economic and cultural inequalities.
It will only be possible to create new products and new services to combine productivity and solidarity if research and innovation are adequately funded.
The doubling of the research budget and the objective of 3% of the EUâs GNI by 2010 absolutely must be respected.
On these two political conditions, and on the assumption that our ambitions will be funded by their own new resources, I am supporting the reasonable choice of our rapporteur, so that our Parliament can exercise its full authority in the coming negotiations and bring the Council round to its way of thinking.
Â Â  â Mr President, the EUâs identity is built on a sense of belonging that comes from a common desire to share.
Cohesion policy has been a very positive instrument and has had considerable success in fostering this sense of belonging.
Consequently, the weakening of cohesion policy has led to financial difficulties or to some projects being postponed.
Worse still, by moving in this direction, the Unionâs sense of belonging will fade and weaken, and may suffer irreversible damage.
Reducing the financial resources of cohesion policy is tantamount to dealing a hammer blow to the European spirit.
The winner is selfish interest and the loser is solidarity, and without the latter there cannot be a sense of belonging and a notion of a European entity.
On the subject of the cohesion policy, it would appear to make perfect sense to discuss an aspect that, being fresh in our minds, should help to formulate a cohesion policy that matches our new reality.
This new element concerns the need to assess the impact, in the different areas of European territory, of the phenomenon of the invasion of Asian products.
In discussions on the Financial Perspective in recent months, attempts have been made to discover who is and who is not a net contributor, by examining the budget with a fine-tooth comb.
This kind of negotiation is unpleasant for all involved.
I believe that the main reason why this happens is that the EUâs current funding model has been exhausted.
I therefore address my last words to the Council.
I feel it is clear that the reform of EU financing cannot be put off, and failure to heed such advice is evidence of political blinkeredness.
I shall finish by congratulating Mr BÃ¶ge on the excellent report that he has submitted to this House.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is a matter of political credibility for the European Union, following enlargement, to safeguard the financial resources for the implementation of development, employment, regional convergence and social cohesion policies.
This need appears to be all the more urgent following the recent results for the European Constitution in France and the Netherlands.
I truly wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶ge, for his work, but I believe that it is disappointing for 1.07% in payment appropriations, compared with the 1.14% initially proposed by the European Commission, to be proposed as the position of the European Parliament.
This limited financial framework lays down from the outset a European political programme of low expectations, which certainly does not respond to the new and major requirements of our times and of the peoples of Europe.
As for the specific issues, I do not believe that the philosophy of cofinancing the common agricultural policy is acceptable.
Any such development would lead to farmers running at different speeds, to greater inequalities between the regions, and would have serious consequences on the financial aspect of the cohesion countries.
Similarly, I agree with everyone who said that the adequacy of resources for the Structural Funds and for the Cohesion Fund needs to be safeguarded.
Certainly the new countries need to be supported but, at the same time, the regions in the old cohesion countries, which are suffering the consequences of enlargement due to the statistical effect, must be given fundamental support.
If European integration is to reacquire momentum and win the trust of the citizens, it cannot be encaged in administrative and accounting perceptions.
Unfortunately, the proposal by the Luxembourg Presidency moves in this restricted direction at a huge cost for the cohesion policies.
In the European Council next week, the Heads of State or Government will have to rise to the occasion and take bold decisions about European priority policies and the need to finance them.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that, at a time when, following the referenda, Europe is indeed in crisis, it is essential that the institutions should prove that the European Union continues, and indeed, can continue, to function.
This is where a decision about the multi-annual plan will be an important credibility test, and hence the great significance of us in this House being able to take a stand tomorrow, which we are in a position to do probably thanks to the remarkable work of our rapporteur, in respect of which we have given the necessary means to be able to realise the enlargement but also â and we owe this again to the rapporteurâs proposals â make the new policy in the Union possible.
We hope that, under Luxembourg leadership and with the help of the Commission, the Council will then work out a proposal which forms a real basis of negotiation with Parliament in order to reach agreement.
I would like to emphasise today that it is already apparent that, with a view to the future, it will be impossible to work with the EUâs means as they are defined today.
If we are to get the European Union to function properly, 1% is too little and so, in all likelihood, is 1.7%.
The British rebate mortgages all of our own resources, but the fundamental decision must be that if the European Union cannot have its genuine own resources at its disposal, the EU will, sooner or later, run aground.
The Union must be able to define its own policy with its genuine own means.
Only then will we be able to realise our ambitions.
Discussions on this at the next multi-annual plan must also form part of the agreement we will be concluding with the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning the European Parliament will vote on its position regarding the forthcoming Financial Perspective for 2007â2013.
This will be one of the most important and significant votes in this session of Parliament.
The European Parliament has basically supported the European Commissionâs proposal, but has changed the structure of the Financial Perspective a little.
The European Development Fund has been removed from the framework of the Financial Perspective and a reserve of 24 billion euros has been created.
As a result, the amount of expenditure proposed by the European Parliament is apparently smaller â 1.07% of European Union gross national income â but, if the European Development Fund and the reserve are included, we would be close to the European Commissionâs proposal.
In the European Parliamentâs proposal the main decrease in expenditure relates to sub-programme 1.a, âCompetitiveness for growth and employmentâ, and also to administrative expenditure by the EU institutions, channelling extra resources towards the European Parliamentâs traditional priorities.
The European Parliament has acknowledged that the amount of expenditure allocated in the Commissionâs proposal to sub-programme 1.b, âCohesion for growth and employmentâ, is justified.
The total amount of resources channelled into the EU funds is 0.41% of European Union GNI.
Not only is the amount of resources channelled into the EU funds important, but also the principles for the distribution of these resources.
Various important questions are dealt with in the European Parliamentâs position.
The first relates to the Commissionâs proposal to set a ceiling of 4% of a Member Stateâs GNI on the amount of resources which may be received from European Union funds.
The European Parliament considers that the setting of a 4% ceiling is based on the experience of the past and that a flexible approach to the setting of ceilings is now needed.
It should be remembered that a set of small and economically relatively less developed states have joined the EU.
Secondly, the European Parliament considers that there should be a differentiation in the level of cofinancing from EU funds, depending on a Member Stateâs level of economic development.
This means that a higher percentage of cofinancing from EU funds could be allocated to less developed EU Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the second-largest entry in the Financial Perspective is for expenditure on economic and social cohesion.
Being concerned with regional policy, I am at one with the rapporteur â whom I congratulate on this excellent report â in believing that the EUâs ability to cope with the past and forthcoming enlargements and to reduce regional disparities is absolutely dependent on a strong and well-funded European regional policy being in place.
On the other hand, though, EU structural policy must be equipped with sufficient resources to make it possible, in future, for adequate support to be offered to less developed regions and to those with particular socio-economic problems, including those in the old EU Member States.
While it is of course the Commission proposal that best complies with the guidelines for the EUâs regional policy in the forthcoming planning period, which aim at the reduction of disparities between one region and another, we regard Mr BÃ¶geâs proposal as an acceptable compromise in comparison with both it and the quite unacceptable demand made by the six net contributors.
Under no circumstances must cuts in the Budget fall hardest upon regional policy.
The allocation proposed in the Commissionâs draft regulations for cohesion funds for the individual targets is acceptable only if there is an increase of 1.14% in total resources.
If cuts are made along the lines envisaged by the BÃ¶ge report or, indeed, the Council regulation, resources must be more concentrated on resolving the grave problems in the regions most deserving of support.
There must be no across-the-board cuts, that is to say cuts made without affecting the relative allocations, for these would unilaterally impose burdens on the convergence regions in the EUâs old Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like, as others have done, to congratulate the rapporteur Mr BÃ¶ge on his work.
He has done an excellent job in very difficult circumstances.
I would also like to align myself with Mr Wynnâs rather than Mr Daviesâ remarks about the British rebate, hardly surprisingly.
As one speaker has said, we are all equal but some are more equal than others.
But the idea in paragraph 51, indent 5 might give a sensible idea of how to proceed, bringing in national parliaments to make our own resources system more transparent.
I wish to raise one specific point which is of great importance.
The European Union is going through turbulent times.
We have no idea what our policies are going to be by 2013.
We have no idea now what our external policies will be, particularly in relation to enlargement.
We need a pause for reflection on the length of our commitment to this financial perspective.
It is best to go for a five-year period, which is the same as the mandates of the Commission and of the European Parliament, because looking too far in the future would be an abuse of the democratic process.
Of course, legislative proposals can be for a longer period, but five years would allow us to sort out our policies on expenditure and own resources.
Of course we need to go for an agreement.
I agree with Mr Dehaene that we should give the presidencies as much as encouragement as possible to find one.
But this Parliament should not sign up to any agreement at all.
As we heard very clearly from our rapporteur, we need one that will be in our interests and the interests of our electorate and that is what we hope will come out of the Council in a few daysâ time.
Â Â  I thank the rapporteur for his enormous hard work and, in particular, for supporting my amendment on the democracy programme, which now forms the last paragraph of the report.
I commend it to the Council and the Commission.
Â Â  Madam President, I too would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶ge, because he has been able to send a crystal clear message to the Commission and the Council indicating what this Parliament wants.
How much money are we prepared to spend on the European project?
What financial effort are we prepared to dedicate to the process of European integration at a time when Europe is facing difficulties, when it is at a crossroads?
The rapporteur proposes less than the Commission, but more than the Council has proposed this afternoon.
The President-in-Office of the Council says that we must create balances.
I would stress what Mr Elles has said: balances are required, but we should remind the Council that with less money we will not create more Europe, we will create less Europe at a time when we need to re-affirm this project.
The referenda that have been held in recent days, as many speakers have mentioned, have reminded us of the need to focus on the real needs of our citizens, and they want us to grow more quickly.
In order to do that, we must create more jobs, we must be more productive, we must spend more money on investment, research and development.
In short, we must implement the Lisbon reforms.
And in order to do that, we need money.
Our citizens have also reminded us that they believe in a social model in which both cohesion and the efficiency of the market are priorities.
Without a policy of correcting territorial imbalances, the economic project represented by the European Union could probably survive.
What would not survive would be the political project that is at stake here.
We must convince our citizens that together we can deal with our future challenges: the challenges of globalisation, of competition from emerging countries, of relocation of companies and the ageing of the population.
And in order to do that we need more money.
As an additional and final point, I would like to express my strong opposition to the beginning of co-funding of the agricultural policy, since that will also mean breaking the social cohesion rules on which the model we believe in has been based.
Â Â  Madam President, what we are concerned with here is prioritising EU expenditure.
It is necessary to be able not only to prioritise what is important but also to give lower priority to what is less important.
In setting priorities, we must also be able to distinguish between the common, and most important, tasks of the EU and the important tasks of the Member States.
We have not reached the point of doing that in this work on the financial perspectives.
If the Commissionâs proposal had been implemented, it would have meant an increase of almost a third in the Swedish membership contribution.
It would have reduced the scope for the investments in growth and new jobs that must be made in Sweden, and it would have created major budget problems.
If we want Europe to become the worldâs most competitive knowledge-based economy, it does not make sense for us to give priority to the rich Member Statesâ contributions at the expense of developing a common infrastructure in our weakest regions.
Not enough priority has yet been given to this area.
Nor is it sensible of us to give priority to marketing efforts in the developing countries on behalf of European agriculture, at the same time as reducing our most important investments in Europeâs knowledge and research community.
If, in your negotiations, you â the Council and the Commission â do not manage to ensure that we are able to achieve the objective of devoting 3% of the European economy to aiding knowledge and research so that European research can take the lead in Europeâs knowledge-based society, then you will fail in setting one of the most important priorities needed by Europe.
The rapporteur has done a fantastic job, involving clear priorities.
The Commission did not, and the Council now appears to be reducing the investment that should be made in research.
I urge it not to do this.
Europe needs aid for research.
Â Â  Madam President, this is an important debate with major consequences for the future of the Union, and I also want to pay tribute to the rapporteur for the impressive way in which he has carried out what is undoubtedly a very onerous task in producing his report.
There are, however, one or two areas where I have difficulty with his conclusions.
First of all, I think it obviously is crucial that EU spending be kept under tight control and that expenditure should be used as efficiently as possible.
No national government, I would suggest, could contemplate some of the spending increases that have been suggested for the 2007-2013 period.
Taxpayers across the EU have a right to expect politicians to spend wisely and given the recent referendum results, it is clear that many in Europe and not just in Britain share concerns that vast quantities of their money are being spent on major projects of which they do not seem to know enough.
In terms of the overall budget, I can support the current position of the British Government, as well as a number of other governments, and believe that it should be capped at 1% of the total national income of the Union.
On the question of the United Kingdom rebate, I believe that it is justified and certainly I am going to look carefully at the position taken up by our Prime Minister, Mr Blair, at the European Council next week.
My one plea, without going back over old ground, is that I hope that the issue of the United Kingdom rebate does not find itself becoming part of a separate set of negotiations about the future of Europe following the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands this week.
It is a serious matter and it needs to be dealt with in a serious way and I am sure there are views on both sides on this, but to tie it into a general set of negotiations and discussions, when critical issues have to be decided for the future of our continent, would seem to me totally inappropriate.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, you have had a rich, constructive, but at times contradictory debate on an excellent report that will certainly help us to reach a compromise.
However, as your debateÂ âÂ which was certainly not lacking in contradictionsÂ âÂ has shown, the Presidency has to manage these contradictions, which sometimes become even greater when they are presented by the Heads of Government or by the ministers of the various governments.
From the starting point of these contradictions, we must try to reach a balance between all these elements so that we can finally resolve the matter and reach a compromise.
You will therefore understand that this task is not a particularly easy one.
Similarly, your rapporteurâs task was not an easy one at all.
I note that, on certain points, it has been said that action must be taken on the UKâs rebate.
The Presidency completely agrees with this; it has put forward proposals in this vein.
Others say the opposite, and bring agricultural issues into the equation.
Does this mean that we must reduce the EUâs agricultural policy, with all the consequences that would entail?
Do we want the countryside of Europe to become a desert?
That is a specific and precise question that needs to be answered.
I think that, in any case, Europe needs to have priorities and must have a clearer idea of where it wants to go.
The Presidency, or rather Luxembourg, could have signed the Commissionâs proposals very happily.
It has problems, however, with the wording of these proposals.
Having said that, I certainly do not dispute that they form a very solid base from which to prepare for the future of Europe.
Unfortunately, on the basis of these proposals alone, we will not reach a compromise next week.
We therefore need to look again for this compromise, to see how and to what extent we can reduce the figures proposed without, in future, depriving the Community budget of its impact, its influence and its ability to guide policy.
Certain speakers say that we have cut 40% here, 30% there.
Nevertheless, I myself have noted that there is real growth under all the headings.
In some cases, this growth may be inadequate, but in others it is quite significant and takes account of the priorities that you as MEPs regard as particularly important.
I wonder where we would end up if there were no agreement, if we stuck with a sort of status quo?
According to my information, we would probably end up with a budget or financial perspectives of about EUR 835Â billion from 2006.
The Presidency proposes more.
It is more ambitious; it may not be ambitious enough, but it is more so than the Member States, or at least than a number of Member States are prepared to be.
I agree with the idea that Europe needs to find new momentum.
We need to fight, first of all, against demagoguery, against those who claim that too much European money is being squandered.
I think that we must not under any circumstances tolerate these claims, which damage not only the effectiveness of Europe, but also, ultimately, our entire project.
I think that those debates must not take place; they must be thwarted.
Europe needs solidarity.
I completely agree with the idea that it needs greater solidarity.
The Europe of 25, the Europe of 27, but also the Europe of 15.
But we must strike the right balance in this approach based on solidarity, and that is what we have tried to do; we need to distinguish between rich regions, poor regions in rich countries, and poor regions in poor countries, because they are not quite the same thing.
That is why I think it is important to find the right balance that will enable everyone to find his or her way.
Europe must also spend its money more effectively.
That is a message that we must convey.
Perhaps we should define better the added value of European policies, work more to improve the quality of Community expenditure, concentrate our expenditure more, improve coordination between Community expenditure, European expenditure and national expenditure.
All of this will certainly enable Lisbon to progress further.
I would, in all sincerity, ask the following question: with regard, for example, to life-long learning, do we really need to pass funds via Brussels to support projects in our Member States?
Would it not perhaps be preferable to create a framework, to set out rules and to improve cooperation in defining policies?
It is sometimes necessary to be selective, in order to focus our resources where they can really produce the best results.
We all agree with the idea that we need to increase investment in research.
We also know that the Community budget cannot, on its own, achieve the objectives we have set ourselves.
We need better coordination between Community expenditure, national expenditure and contributions, private funding.
I think that this may be a field in which the US could provide an example, if we observe how they succeed in managing their spending better, not only quantitatively, but maybe qualitatively too.
I cannot promise you that the Presidency will reach a compromise.
I cannot guarantee that this compromise will be as ambitious as you would like.
But I can say one thing: if we do not reach a compromise, the situation could not be worse.
It will be worse in the sense that we will not be able to define programmes.
Thus, the whole of Europe, everyone who is waiting for something from Europe, everyone who is waiting for money to finance programmes that aim to improve competitivity and cohesion, will all be left hanging, and that is not something that will improve the image of Europe just at a time when it needs to be improved and to be strengthened in the eyes of our citizens.
Â Â  . Madam President, MrÂ Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to your remarks and comments this afternoon.
I am struck by how similar your priorities are to those of the Commission, in particular boosting economic growth, job creation, solidarity with the poorest people, those who most need true solidarity in our approach, and also meeting commitments we have made, in other words bringing our commitments, and our finances, into line with our political priorities.
In this debate, you have demonstrated the usefulness of the European budget; you have shown that, very often, spending at European level enables savings at national level and that there is an added value to such spending.
Spending at European level very often makes it possible to realise projects that would not otherwise have been achieved.
On these two points, the priorities and the usefulness of the budgetary instrument for our Europe, for Europeâs ambitions and for solidarity within Europe, there is therefore considerable convergence between the points of view of the Commission and of the European Parliament.
We have now reachedÂ âÂ as we are all awareÂ âÂ a crucial moment, and I think that we could summarise the spirit of todayâs debate by saying that weÂ âÂ or in any case most of us, I thinkÂ âÂ really do want an agreement, and we want a good agreement.
We want an ambitious agreement, an ambition for Europe, a Europe that is not a Europe of rebates, and, at the same time, we want a Europe that shows solidarity.
That is the conclusion that I, at least, take from this debate.
To reach such an agreement, however, we must be prepared to make compromises and, on this subject, I would like to address the Presidency.
I am well aware that the Presidency is making extraordinary efforts.
I am constantly aware of it.
I am in constant contact with the President of the Council, MrÂ Juncker, and I think that we need to express our gratitude to him, to the Luxembourg Government and to Luxembourgâs diplomats.
It is true that the Presidency mainly works with the Member States, but I remember what MrÂ Schmit has just said.
He said that he, personally, could certainly subscribe to the Commissionâs initial proposal.
I think the same thing with regard to the BÃ¶ge report, which, I hope, will be voted for tomorrow.
Pass your resolution!
I would now call on the Presidency to introduce into this crucial phase of negotiations the message that Parliament will send tomorrow.
It is true that contradictions and different points of view have been expressed in this House, but I think that our vote tomorrow will nevertheless express Parliamentâs will.
As we all agreed during these negotiations, they are not limited to just the Member StatesÂ âÂ even though their role is decisive, the negotiations are taking place between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
As a result, what we now ask the PresidencyÂ âÂ whilst congratulating it on its determination and whilst telling it that we want a compromise and that we are here to help it reach that compromiseÂ âÂ is to reach a compromise that is closer to what Parliament will, I hope, vote for tomorrow, and also closer to the Commissionâs proposal than to that from certain Member States, even though we recognise that they do have real difficulties that we must not underestimate.
That is my appeal.
That is my appeal to the Presidency.
It is also my appeal to all MEPs so that we can look forward to this final phaseÂ âÂ I hope it is the final oneÂ âÂ of negotiations in a spirit of compromise and so that the message that comes out of the next European Council is again a positive one.
Once again, Europe will surprise its enemies by showing that, in difficult situations, and particularly in difficult situations, we are capable not only of finding a solution, but of finding a credible solution, in other words a solution that brings together our ambitions and the instruments that we give to the European institutions to achieve those ambitions.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to close this debate with two short remarks.
There is one point on which I am in complete agreement with the Council Presidency, and that is that no headway will be made, either in the Council or in Parliament, if there are those who see their role as being to speak up for special interests, while others see themselves as responsible for brokering compromises.
It is for that reason that what this House needs to do tomorrow is to set out a quite definite negotiating position, and to do so by as large a majority as possible.
One thing, though â and this I have to say to Mr Schmit â that one thing I too do not accept is the celebrated chaos theory, according to which all is lost if there is no mutual understanding.
Following the vote in plenary tomorrow, we will need to employ the time left to us before the European Council meets in talks and negotiations.
Whilst I recognise that the problem lies perhaps in the Council itself rather than in the Presidency, the Council must not get the idea that everything will be sorted out once it reaches a compromise.
It is far more important that we should first define our negotiating position, that the Council should set out its position in relation to that, and that Parliament should eventually have to agree.
What matters, then, is that we use the next 10 days in working very hard to hammer out a workable compromise.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0246/2005), and we will be taking a number of questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . In reply to the honourable Member, the Commission has already pointed out several times, and in particular in its reply to Oral Question H-0159/05 by the honourable Member, that, in accordance with Council Regulation No 1/58 (Article 1) âthe first one in the history of EU secondary legislation â all official languages are at the same time working languages and can therefore be used on the same legal terms and on the same basis within the institutions.
So it is not correct to say that the current working languages within the European institutions have been reduced to three, namely English, French and German.
As for internal procedures within the Commission, the documents submitted to it are drafted in these three languages at least.
It is a rule that has purely internal effects and aims to guarantee that the Commission itself is in a position to understand documents of general interest.
The Commission has found no evidence of any discrimination against other working languages as a result of this rule, which was drawn up on the instructions of both the current and former presidents of the Commission.
Moreover, it is normal that, for operational reasons, certain languages are used more than others by Commission staff in their daily business.
No senior management official has the power or the right to require his staff to use one working language rather than another.
But sometimes it is the linguistic preferences or knowledge of Commissioners themselves which may require the use of a particular language.
It goes without saying that it is mandatory to maintain internal communication among the Commission departments and inside the other institutions.
All these practices are followed with due respect for the equality of languages as official and working languages.
The Commission reiterates that it has no intention whatsoever of introducing a specific system involving the privileged use of one or several languages in its services.
On the other hand, if the work of its services goes beyond internal business and involves contacts with outsiders, the Commission is committed to making use of as many official languages as possible, taking into account the limitations on available translation resources under the guidelines set out in its Document 638/6.
Secondly, the Commission actively promotes multilingualism within the European Union, as indicated in its communication 'Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity: an Action Plan 2004-2006'.
Under the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, specific actions and other actions for student and teacher exchanges can be used for the promotion of Italian, as for all other Community languages.
Thus, the Lingua Action under the Socrates Programme financed eight different projects to promote the Italian language between 2000 and 2004.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, two pieces of information have followed one after the other in recent months.
The first concerned dropping the Italian language from Commission press conferences, which was followed by the publication of the Eurydice report â funded by the European Community â in which it emerged that Italian is one of the least studied languages in the world.
These two facts would suggest, to a certain extent, that there is an intention to relegate the Italian language in importance.
I would like to discuss a number of points, Commissioner.
The fact is, we believe that considering only three languages to be official EU languages is inadequate, partly because six languages are spoken by at least 9% of the European population.
Commissioner, I call on you to examine the possibility of introducing at least six working languages, that is to say, the languages that are spoken by at least 9-10% of the European population, namely English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Polish.
Â Â  . In procedural terms, we use only some languages in the college, but at the official and working levels, all languages are equal.
One of the changes or important phenomena, which one can see in the press conferences on Wednesdays, is that there is the possibility of using all the official languages.
With this attitude and with the promotion of language learning, with multilingualism as a policy, not just an administrative part of our daily work, we will achieve significant progress and improvement, within the limits of our possibilities.
The situation for languages from the time of enlargement shows that the Union is functioning â it did not collapse.
All languages can be used by communicators within the Union.
Speaking as Commissioner for Education, I must say that all our mobility programmes, our activities in the field of education, culture and vocational training strongly promote a language component.
I am sure that, with that awareness and positive philosophy or policy we are on the right track.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, it strikes me that the problematic thing about the advertisements for jobs with the Commission is that they often specify a mother tongue.
Surely, if we are to have equality of opportunity in Europe, the least we can do is to require a certain standard of competence in a language rather than use of it from the cradle.
Consideration should be given to whether the present practice might be changed in future.
Â Â  . I would like to support that idea.
Next month we want to introduce the communication on the new language competence indicator, which is now an important part of the growing question of competence and recognition of qualifications.
We have agreed with Member States to promote language learning as early as possible.
In a broader context, the 1 + 2 formula is no longer a luxury, but a necessity for the younger generation and for all citizens, who need to learn not only their mother tongue, but also two other European languages, one of which should preferably be that of a neighbour.
That is the policy and basic philosophy supported by the Commission and, if this policy is promoted properly in Member States, multilingualism and language competence will increase markedly in the future European Union.
I fully share the interest and support of the distinguished Member of Parliament.
Â Â  . The European Union does not have competence in the issue covered in question 32, because it is purely and simply a bilateral issue between a Member State and a third party, namely NATO, which is an international organisation.
It is not for the Commission to pass comment on this matter, which lies outside of its remit.
That being said, the Commission hopes that both parties can reach a workable solution, which would undoubtedly contribute towards further increasing cooperation and strengthening relations between the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his reply, which was clear; the point of my question was simply that the common European foreign and defence policy needs to be safeguarded to the maximum possible degree in the bio-strategic country of Cyprus and the reply was perfectly clear.
Â Â  â Madam President, very briefly, the Commissioner's reply about this being nothing to do with the Commission is unsatisfactory.
The European Commission approves the financing of the common European foreign and defence policy and participates in the work of shaping the European Union's foreign policy.
Apart from this, we also need to say that my honourable friend's question touches on the foreign relations of the European Union and, as we all know, the dividing lines between classic foreign relations and classic foreign policy are not fixed either in the Treaty or when they are exercised.
Â Â  Thank you very much for addressing further aspects of this issue.
I am convinced that it has been going on for some time and that it is more likely to reach a successful conclusion.
Given the situation over the last decade, developments are rather encouraging.
In the sphere of the second pillar, the European Commission really does not have direct power with regard to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, but supports the endeavours of Member States not only on joint policy but also on definitive common action with regard to relations with other organisations and with particular regard to security policies.
I am therefore convinced that, in the hands of the Member States supported by the Union as a whole or, as the case may be, the Commission, this topic can gradually be brought to a successful conclusion.
At this time, it is not, however, within our powers to do more than the Commission is endeavouring to do.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs proposal to amend Council Regulation 1683 provides common security standards for visas and the storage of two biometric identifiers on a storage medium with a sufficient capacity.
However, tests have shown that technical problems occur when a chip is introduced in each visa sticker.
The Council has therefore decided to anticipate the storage of biometric identifiers in the central part of the visa information system and to consider, at a later stage, whether the additional storage of biometric identifiers and the visa sticker or an additional separate smart card would be necessary.
The Council invited the Commission on 24 February 2005 to make every effort to enable the storage of biometric identifiers in the central part of the visa information system from 2006 onwards.
The decision on the additional storage of biometric identifiers on the visa sticker will largely depend on pilot testing, which is currently being carried out.
The results of this project can be expected shortly.
In the meantime, the Commission is cooperating closely with the Member States which are responsible for the conversion of VIS into the national structure.
The Commission is currently preparing, in close cooperation with Member States, an interface control document which ensures interoperability.
The call for tender which the Member States may publish for the national part of the VIS will be based to a large extent on this interface control document.
The Commission is confident that all Member States will be ready to connect their national systems to the central part of the VIS as explained until end 2006.
As far as consular posts are concerned a roll-out plan for the entire project development period becoming operational at the end of 2006 and further development between 2007-2013 should be prepared in cooperation with Member States.
Finally, the Commission considers that the Commissionâs proposal to amend Council Regulation 1683 respects all data protection issues.
In accordance with the data protection directive 95/46, the Article 29 working party has been consulted and had given its opinion on 11 August 2004.
This opinion will of course be taken into full account in the further legislation process if the additional storage of biometric identifiers on the visa sticker or an additional, separate smart card is necessary.
As regards the access of law enforcement authorities to the VIS, the Commissionâs services are working on the third pillar legislative proposal in the field of data protection.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I recently visited the Australian Parliament, for access to which biometric data are already required, and these make it very likely that checks will be carried out efficiently.
Do you think we could test these biometric data out in the European institutions in order to see whether such a system would actually be a practical proposition?
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, I am obviously unable to give you a tangible answer today.
Without doubt, the two requirements that we have to take into consideration are, firstly, the reliability of the technical criteria that have been adopted by the Australian Parliament, and, secondly, interoperability and thus the ability to make these data actually function for a system that has to extend to the 25 Member States.
As I have already said, extremely complex technical trials are underway.
We will of course take into consideration the experiences of other countries at technical level, but I obviously cannot anticipate a final solution today.
Â Â  Commissioner, I recently had the opportunity to view the biometric system that has been introduced at Amsterdam airport to eliminate passport controls between Schengen and non-Schengen areas, which seem to me to work extremely well.
Has the Commissioner had the chance to examine that system?
If so, does he believe that it could be spread, on a voluntary basis at the moment, to a network of European airports?
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, as I have already said, we will of course also take into account trials already successfully completed in some European countries, particularly within airport systems.
I am unable to tell you whether that particular system is considered, as one might say, exportable, that is, reproducible on a large scale for a European Union of 25.
I can assure you that that system will also be taken into consideration in the pilot experiments that will be carried out at a technical level.
Â Â  Madam President, I am obliged to the Commissioner.
I am also rather curious in view of the efforts currently being made by the German Interior Minister to move the project forward as fast as possible.
Have the United States excluded the possibility of deferring the deadline once and for all?
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, if you mean to refer to the review of the so-called Passenger Name Record (PNR), we have put back by a few weeks the technical meeting between European and US officials, which will take place in July.
We will obviously inform Parliament of developments, as I in any case promised.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, the importance of public service broadcasting and the competence of the Member States to define, organise and provide funding mechanisms for this public service are guaranteed by ArticleÂ 86(2) of the Treaty and by the Amsterdam protocol.
As indicated in the Commission communication of 2001 on State aid, however, the role of private operators must not be neglected, as they contribute to ensuring pluralism, to enriching the political and cultural debate and to broadening the choice of programmes.
We therefore very clearly recognise the dual system, which characterises the European audiovisual industry and which has a beneficial effect on the media as a whole.
With regard to the public sector at present, it is up to the Member States to organise the funding of this sector.
This funding may come entirely from public funds, in whatever form, and, if appropriate, in the form of a licence fee, as in the example put forward by the honourable Member.
This funding may also be mixed and consist partly of revenue from the sale of advertising space.
There is no objection to the choice of one or other of these systems.
However, the Commission must ensure that the rules of the Treaty are complied with, particularly those on State aid as interpreted in the communication of 2001.
Public funding must therefore only be used to achieve the public-service mission and must not exceed what is necessary in this regard: that is the rule of proportionality.
Public-service missions must be defined clearly and precisely and there must be a separation of accounts when public-sector operators become involved in commercial activities: that is the rule of transparency.
It is therefore not up to the Commission to lay down other rules that would limit the Member Statesâ room for manoeuvre in this eminently cultural field.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for that response.
I understand that the Irish Government has recently responded to a letter from the Commission requesting clarification on the role and financing of public service broadcasting in Ireland.
Could you tell us what that response was and what was your initial reaction to the letter?
Â Â  . Madam President, I have not yet seen the letter from the Irish authorities.
I assume that it relates to a normal request from the Commission regarding the completely acceptable State aid allocated to public sector broadcasting.
This State aid needs to be notified and there needs to be an exchange of questions and answers between the Commission and the Member State concerned.
In the light of the responses given by the Member State, the Commission assesses whether the situation in the Member States complies with the Treaty, the Amsterdam protocol and the Commission communication of 2001.
If it does, the green light is given; if it does not, there are discussions between the Member State and the Commission.
This is a normal procedure that occurs regularly.
Usually, there are no problems and the Member States are given the green light fairly rapidly.
Problems have arisen in some cases, in particular with the German authorities.
With regard to public sector broadcasting, however, the exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission takes place without difficulty.
Â Â  . The honourable Member has raised a number of questions regarding the funding of television channels and of independent production companies by the Media Programme.
I would like to underline that the Media Plus Programme does not include television channels as direct beneficiaries under any of its schemes.
In the television sector, independent production companies, which are often SMEs, are supported in the production of audio-visual work for television.
The aim is to encourage these companies to produce works â any works: fiction, documentaries, animated films â involving no fewer than two broadcasters, preferably more.
So it is really the European added value which is at stake.
They also have to belong to different language zones, so it is multilingualism which is at stake â a question that was raised before.
The Media programmes recognise the precarious existence of independent production companies in a fragmented European market, companies whose economic livelihood often depends on a single project; and a number of the mechanisms therefore target these important creative activities.
The television distribution funding mechanism was one of the Media Plus Programme actions which was examined in the mid-term evaluation which took place last year.
This evaluation confirmed the key role played by the various actions for independent producers, as well as that of measures such as eye-to-eye audio-visual and the development action encompassing new talent, single projects and State funding.
Finally, the second interim evaluation, as requested by the European Parliament in the context of the prolongation of the Media programmes, will be launched very shortly, and will be submitted to Parliament.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply which, I admit, was comprehensive and covered many issues.
I was commenting basically on the monopoly of numerous means of communication, but I shall move on.
In order for independent producers to be in a position to retain their producer's rights and in order to be able to secure more easily for them the safeguarding of intellectual property rights and thereby strengthen the possibility of attracting investment from private investors, do you agree that the Commission and the Council should take the relevant steps?
As far as I know, no such thing has happened to date and Community directives offer no such guarantee.
Do you at least have some sort of plan in this direction?
Â Â  . The honourable Member has raised the issue of independent producers.
It is clear that, in the framework of audiovisual media productions, we need these independent producers.
They are the ones who create the most important audiovisual works, and they do so as part of the cultural and linguistic diversity that forms the true wealth of our continent.
That is why the conditions for access to subsidies under the MEDIA programme are very clear: it is only open to independent producers.
Subsidiaries of television stations, for example, cannot receive subsidies.
I would like to say that MEDIA+ defines very clear obligations, to return to the producers.
After seven years at the very most, all the systems will be reviewed so that we can provide even better support to independent producers.
Therefore, thanks to the revision of MEDIA, we are going to strengthen measures that aim to support this very important dimension of the European cultural industry.
Â Â  . Last week, the Commission presented its communication âi2010: a European Information Society for growth and employmentâ.
In this communication, the Commission states that, by the end of 2005, it will propose a revision of the âTelevision Without Frontiersâ directive to modernise the rules on audiovisual media services, and that is what the honourable Member is referring to.
Thanks to the minimal coordination provisions it contains, this text strengthens the competitiveness of the European audiovisual media industry.
Nevertheless, the directive contains no specific rights or obligations for public service broadcasters and there are no plans, at least for the moment, to introduce, as part of the revision process, measures dealing with the use of communication methods and technology by public service broadcasters.
As in the case of the question that I have just answered, I would remind you that it is very important for Member States to be responsible for defining the purpose of their public services and to determine how those services have to be funded so that they can fulfil their mission, as this field still comes under the subsidiarity principle in accordance with the Commission communication of 2001 on State aid and with the rules of the Treaty, including the Amsterdam protocol.
However, we also state in that communicationÂ âÂ this is also an important pointÂ âÂ that the public service may include services that are not programmes in the traditional sense of the word: for example, online information services, insofar, of course, as these services aim to meet the same democratic, social and cultural needs as programmes as such.
Â Â  Madam President, I would thank Commissioner Reding for her answer.
I really do not know, however, whether I should feel reassured or disturbed.
There is a conflict here between the rules governing the internal market and public serviceâs ability to function.
I really want to call upon the Commission to state more clearly than it did just now that public service really is fully able to shape its own activities without this being regarded as restricting the internal market.
It is extremely important that the Commission take the opportunity to be clear on this issue to the outside world too.
There is great anxiety because our people are very much in favour of public service.
Nowadays especially, it is very important to show that we do not believe that the market should take over everything, but that culture and public service should be allowed to continue to play their role.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, I can only repeat what I have already stressed: the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
Consequently, it has used the articles of the Treaties and the Amsterdam protocol as a basis to authorise exceptions with regard to State aid for public service broadcasting.
It is therefore the Member States that define, firstly, the purpose and obligations of their public services and, secondly, the way in which these obligations are funded, by licence fees or by advertising.
The Commission simply checks whether what the Member States have laid down is carried out in practice.
In 2001, Commissioner Monti and I therefore publishedÂ -Â with the aim of answering any questions that could be raised regarding the interpretation of these articles of the Treaty and of the Amsterdam protocol -Â a communication, which the European Parliament knows well, specifying all these rules. I can therefore reassure the honourable Member, because both the Commission and Parliament are committed to the dual system and the public broadcasters are absolutely protected, both by the Treaties and by the rules based on them.
Â Â  . The March 2005 European Council, in adopting the European Pact for Youth, stressed that integrating young people into society and working life and making better use of their potential is essential for growth in Europe.
The pact aims to improve the education, training, mobility, vocational integration and social inclusion of young Europeans, whilst facilitating the reconciliation of family life and working life.
The Commission has responded to the pact without delay.
It has analysed the possibilities that the pact offers and has made proposals for action.
We adopted a communication on 30 May this year, which has been transmitted to Parliament.
At national level the pact, which is an integral part of the Lisbon Partnership for Growth and Jobs, will be implemented through the integrated guidelines proposed by the Commission and to be adopted by the Council in June.
The guidelines call, , for action to reduce youth unemployment and to increase access to education and training.
The communication outlines how Member States can implement the pact when preparing their national Lisbon reform programmes with reference to the guidelines.
The communication draws attention to the demographic changes facing Europe.
It emphasises the need to foster societies that are child- and youth-friendly and the need for solidarity in creating an inclusive Europe, building on solidarity between the generations.
It indicates that Member States should follow the integrated guidelines in taking action for achieving a better family and work balance, for example providing facilities for childcare and care for other dependants as part of tackling demographic ageing and a low birth rate.
The communication identifies actions at European level to support the pact: the use of the Social Inclusion Strategy to improve the situation of vulnerable young people; European Social Fund support for projects targeting young people in areas of employment, training and social inclusion; the development of a specific tool for recognition of youth work with a view to including a âYouthpassâ in Europass next year; and proposals for a European qualifications framework, hopefully also next year.
As stressed by the European Council, the success of the pact depends on the involvement of all actors, especially youth organisations.
The communication invites Member States to consult young people in developing measures for the pact and following it up.
It announces the consultation that the Commission will undertake on youth policy, culminating in the Youth at the end of December 2005, to involve Members of the European Parliament and the Parliament itself, as well as young people, Commissioners and other policy makers.
Â Â  â I thank the Commissioner for his reply, which was complete and very informative.
My only question as regards the long list which he gave, which satisfied me completely because it really did cover all the issues, is how all the Commission's plans are to be financed.
Â Â  . That is a very reasonable supplementary question.
I had a very special occasion, the day immediately after the approval date.
The following day we held the first online press conference with youth in Brussels, but also in Member States.
It was well organised and it is also a contribution to better communication, and to the engagement of young people as we call for future EU policies.
Part of the answer on support is that we would like to use many opportunities in different strands or areas of EU policies â in social policy or strategy, in rural development, in research and of course in education programmes and training and mobility.
There is a list of programmes which are connected and there should be an even more coherent way of supporting action vis-Ã -vis youth, with youth, and for youth.
We also have a special programme for youth and I hope it will be further strengthened for the next seven years.
Again it is about the financial perspective.
So the most important thing, I would say, is the financially unmeasurable part, which means a more coherent, more supported approach towards youth as a part of Lisbon, as a part of integrated guidelines in all the different areas, supported also by financial resources.
If the attitude of Parliament is the same in this direction - and I would also like to welcome the last report by Mr BÃ¶ge, which will be voted on tomorrow, the report on the financial perspective - that is a signal in the right direction as regards your question, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou.
Â Â  . Article 151 of the European Community Treaty, which is the base for our cultural cooperation, states that the Community should encourage cultural cooperation between Member States, including in the area of safeguarding cultural heritage and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their action in a certain number of areas.
This objective is pursued by the Culture 2000 Framework Programme in support of cultural cooperation in Europe.
Implemented in order to encourage artistic and cultural cooperation in Europe and to drive forward the creation of a common cultural area, the Culture 2000 programme supports projects jointly produced and financed by at least three operators from at least three countries taking part in the programme.
However, this programme is not specifically aimed at developing cross-border cultural cooperation.
Secondly, while the programme does not establish specific measures for the conservation of the common cultural heritage of border regions, it nevertheless contributes to disseminating know-how and promoting good practices in the field of conservation and preservation of this common cultural heritage.
Moreover, the European Union also actively supports the conservation of Europeâs cultural heritage through the structural funds and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development.
Thirdly, in the Interreg IIIA programmes, including those mentioned by Mr Posselt, culture is mainly promoted by supporting networks for creating or intensifying cross-border cultural contacts.
Under the entrepreneurship measures, many programmes also cover the promotion of cultural tourism.
According to the guidance given in the Commission Communication of 28 April 2000, renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy, can also be promoted.
This strategy, of course, excludes housing.
Â Â  Mr President, there are two things I would like to mention, one of them being the reference to historic urban centres.
That was very interesting, and I also wish to thank the Commissioner for the excellent reply.
There is in the Czech Republic a castle, now wholly dilapidated, which was the childhood home of the originator of the European ideal, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, and in it a European centre for meetings and activities is to be set up.
This could be an important project.
Secondly, it is my belief that a great congress or conference should be mounted to serve as a sort of fair or contacts forum for all those engaged in cross-border work.
A very large number of initiatives are underway in this field, all of them unaware of each otherâs existence.
One possible venue for this might be the capital of your own country, Commissioner, the only capital city to be situated on a border.
I therefore propose that a meeting of these cross-border initiatives be organised in Bratislava, the former Pressburg.
Â Â  After enlargement, there are many more opportunities to show that this new enlarged Community has much in common in terms of history and culture.
In future, by promoting specific actions, cooperation on all levels and building networks, I am sure that Central Europe will be discovered anew after enlargement, because it has a much potential to offer people to feel like members of one broader European family.
Thank you for the idea and for all you are doing in this area of promoting cross-border cooperation and togetherness.
Â Â  Questions 39 to 44 will be answered in writing.
During a debate on 25 January 2005, Prof. Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, Chairman of the Consultative Committee for the Fusion Programme, said that nuclear fusion could be generating power commercially in 40 years' time, provided that a heavily subsidised programme was adopted.
The 7th Framework Programme allocates more funding to nuclear energy (fission and fusion) than to renewable energy.
Yet the European Council considers that by 2020 greenhouse gas emissions must fall by 15-20% in relation to the 1990 level.
Moreover, the Commission predicts a worldwide rise in employment in the renewable energy sector, which should be providing several million jobs by 2020.
Is it desirable, as part of climate and employment policy, to change the emphasis of the research and development budgets from nuclear energy towards renewable energy, and does the Commission have specific plans for this?
Â Â  . The EU leads the world in the fight against climate change.
It has taken a leading role in the implementation of the Kyoto agreement and is equally instrumental in addressing the global debate on post-2012.
However, it must be stressed that the EU cannot solve the worldâs energy and climate problems alone, a fact recognised in the conclusions of the Council of 22-23 March, also referred to by the honourable Member, which set out the objectives for all the developed countries and not just the EU.
The objective of reducing greenhouse emissions must be set in the context of sharply increasing global energy demand, which is predicted to rise by 60% by 2030, and increasing concerns over energy dependency in the geopolitically unstable regions of the world.
European energy research thus has to face the threefold challenge of ensuring security of energy supply over the short, medium and long term, enhancing competitiveness and winning the battle against climate change.
No single technology can provide the solution; a broad technology portfolio approach is required, embracing actions with a relatively short term perspective and others with a much longer term view.
To achieve the goal of a more sustainable energy system, energy research has to strike a balance between increasing the efficiency, affordability, acceptability and security of existing technologies and sources of energy, whilst simultaneously aiming at a longer-term paradigm shift in the way Europe generates and consumes energy.
In this equation, nuclear technologies will continue to play a role, along with the increased uptake of renewable energy sources and other clean energy technologies such as hydrogen and fuel cells and CO2 capture and storage.
