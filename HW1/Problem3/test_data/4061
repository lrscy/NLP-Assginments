From tomorrow, any progress will require 62 out of 87 votes in the Council, and the Court of Justice and the countries in favour of transparency will not be able to help us obtain clear rules in the Regulation.
It would be in the greater interests of transparency if we were to defer the decision today and see how the Council and the Commission are to interpret the new rules.
The various forms of progress have, of course, been decided upon ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many of us have recently had difficult personal experiences of how hard it is to obtain certain documents.
That needs to be stressed here today.
However, I shall be pleased if this regulation means we can ensure that not just Members of the European Parliament, but all citizens of the European Union are given real access to all documents.
I hope at least that we as Members will derive some benefit from this.
If the transparency called for in this regulation actually becomes a principle of the institutions of the European Union, then we will have taken a great step forward.
If there are now to be some exceptions to this, then I regard that as positive.
It is positive that there are only a few exceptions, but it is also positive that these few exceptions exist.
I say that because the few exceptions exist for reasons of security and in order to protect the right to privacy.
That is important in this context, because it means we have achieved something - we have managed to strike a balance between total openness and transparency on the one hand and the security interests of the Union and its citizens and protection of the right to privacy on the other.
Anyone who is against secrecy being observed in these few exceptional cases has to be against the security interests of the European Union and also against protection of the right to privacy.
So we should maintain this balance here and certainly not abandon it.
As I see it, what has not yet been decided is how the register will subsequently be designed and how the actual process of access will be arranged.
One wise fellow Member mentioned in today's debate that there are two ways of treating people as stupid - one is to withhold information from them, which, thank goodness, has now been overcome, and the other is to flood them with unstructured information.
Both of these are bad and we do not want either.
That is why we are calling for the setting up of a structured register which is easy to understand and which also takes into account the need for genuine transparency.
In conclusion, I hope that this regulation will actually lead to a new approach in the institutions of the European Union, so that it is not just a question of committing words to paper without overcoming the existing difficulties that we are all aware of.
There must be a genuine guarantee that there will be a review after a relatively short time.
We need a review in 2004 to highlight any shortcomings in what appears to be a very positive system, and, should it be necessary, to take further steps to ensure that the principle to which we are pledging ourselves - the transparency of the institutions of the European Union - really is thoroughly implemented.
I would like to congratulate everyone who has worked on this report and been involved in this outcome.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to know what is going on, please.
You talk about a crowning achievement, a historical decision, a milestone.
It reminds me of Faust - Gretchen would have liked to record this day.
State Watch, which is what this is about, the European Federation of Journalists, and so on say that rather than enshrining the rights of citizens, it undermines what we have been discussing today and will be voting on. It says that the current code enshrines the rights of Member States, albeit in different form.
If I interpret this, it reminds me of Goethe, of Faust, again: "I hear the message well, but I have little faith."
Maybe an attempt is being made to find a compromise position, perhaps today is not such a historical day.
But receiving the EU's proposal here is rather like getting to see a new car.
"Now you can have a look!" they tell us.
We certainly will.
It is not long since the European transparency initiative was launched, an initiative taken so as to provide as many of Europe's citizens as possible with access to as many documents as possible, including those relating to Council meetings.
Will we now get to see what documents really exist and which ones are sensitive?
What does sensitivity mean?
We are all very sensitive.
How will you interpret sensitivity?
Will you tell us that we can look at the car, but the motor is sensitive, the seat is sensitive and the steering wheel is sensitive?
Or will we get there and see the whole car?
I believe that there is room for optimism when you look at the example of the United States.
It took decades until the Freedom of Information Act was passed, and even they started off by just having a first look at the car.
But I hope that the Presidency and their successors will not come to us in future and complain about money, and say that it is too expensive if we ask for detailed information.
There is money available for that.
In the USA, the Freedom of Information Act costs USD 40 million every year.
The bill for the American Government's public relations is USD 1.5 billion.
I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Cashman, who is to be congratulated.
He says that this is something that will develop by itself.
We are relying on it developing by itself up to 2004.
I believe that we should not be holier-than-thou about this, but that we should make a start here in this House when it comes to transparency.
Mr President, when the present Commission took office in the autumn of 1999, all the Commissioners promised that it would be a case of turning over a new leaf.
In future, the work would be driven by transparency and public scrutiny, and the mistakes of the Santer Commission would not be repeated.
A very great deal of the general debate in 1999 was about transparency and public scrutiny.
Quite a few of us voted for making the EU more open.
Openness and public access to official records are necessary elements of a democratic and efficient administration, and if people can follow the decision-making process in the EU' s machinery, then there will also be an increase in confidence.
We also know that there is a crystal-clear connection between a high level of transparency and a low level of corruption in an administration.
The Regulation we are voting on tomorrow is a compromise between Parliament and countries in the Council of Ministers which are sympathetic towards transparency.
It is a step forwards in many ways.
It provides the people of Europe with unifying legislation concerning the way in which they are to obtain access to documents.
It lays down important principles, a fact which quite a few of my fellow MEPs have touched upon.
However, we Liberals are also sorry to see that it is deficient in a great many ways.
It contains a rather ambiguous clause concerning what are called sensitive documents that are to be dealt with under a separate system.
This is an unfortunate rule which may be interpreted arbitrarily.
What is more, there is a certain lack of clarity as to how the Regulation would apply in relation to national law if conflicts were to arise.
In some Member States, including Sweden and the Netherlands, there are more far-reaching rules governing access to documents.
In Sweden, the tradition of transparency goes back to my fellow Liberal Party member, Anders Chydenius in 1766.
What happens if a document is secret in Brussels but in the public domain in Stockholm?
The Government and Swedish Prime Minister have said that, in a case like that, Swedish law applies, but can that be relied upon?
The Presidency bears considerable responsibility, namely to ensure both that Dutch legislation and, above all, the Swedish Constitution are not undermined and that no self-censorship is practised by Swedish authorities either.
There is, of course, an obvious fear in the Commission and certain Member States that people will be given too much information.
Those of us who believe in transparency must constantly fight to demonstrate that the opposite is the case.
Public scrutiny is not dangerous. Rather, it is democratic and efficient.
The Liberal Group views this Regulation as a compromise involving a certain amount of progress but also containing certain shortcomings.
We shall vote in favour of it tomorrow as a first step on the long journey ahead of us in terms of opening the institutions of the EU up to the people.
Further efforts are required in this regard, and we shall test the limits of the legislation.
We shall also take the lead in establishing still better rules in a couple of years' time for, in spite of everything, transparency has the future on its side.
Mr President, when the tsars were in power in Russia the country had a common legal system.
The monarchy did not govern the country by laws, however, but by exceptions to them.
The principle which prevailed in tsarist Russia now holds true for the system of public access to European Union documents.
The documents are publicly available, but their secrecy is assured by derogations.
The documents pertaining to the common foreign and security policy are better kept secrets in the EU than Freemasons' rituals, and the Worshipful Master of the EU Lodge is NATO.
It has a monopoly over EU documents but has no connection with democracy.
A culture of secrecy has been built into the EU, one that Parliament also helps to support.
Last summer, a majority in Parliament approved a framework agreement with the Commission on the subject of public access to documents, one that places the various Members of the European Parliament in unequal positions.
As a result, more than twenty Members brought an action against Parliament and the Commission for infringement of basic provisions in the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
I wish to express my regrets to my Swedish fellow Members, but this wretched compromise has to be rejected.
Mr President, we have managed to complete a compromise text on which the Council, Commission and negotiators of Parliament agreed just within the time limit.
It is encouraging to see that Parliament is managing to leave its mark on an increasing number of negotiation procedures of this kind.
But I am not thrilled with the end result.
The procedures are not particularly wonderful.
I do not welcome the secret negotiations, as a result of which the small groups and interest groupings have hardly been able to play a role at all.
We are now being confronted with a text whose adagio is in fact "like it or lump it" .
We are having to 'like' a great deal in terms of content, especially the classification of confidential documents represents quite a big step backwards for Parliament.
Many phrases are so vague that they could be interpreted in any which way in practice.
For example, the claim by the rapporteurs that the national disclosure regulations have been safeguarded springs to mind.
If that is the case, why has a section dedicated solely to this subject been deleted from the text of the Regulation?
On the other hand, it was too much to expect that a regulation on access to documents, with which only a few Member States were familiar, could be made applicable in its entirety to the whole Union.
The southern Member States do not have such regulations, so we cannot blame them for showing signs of cold feet.
It is utopian to believe that we will always reach the ideal policy at European level.
The range of opinions on the desired transparency is unfortunately too wide for that to happen.
At European level too, we increasingly notice that certain limits are reached in the Member States.
The most achievable result is then a compromise which, in fact, satisfies nobody.
This is a reality which we must accept.
In the European Union, we must accept the Member States' own backgrounds and cultures, even if this does not always suit us.
Firstly, I offer my congratulations to the rapporteur Michael Cashman, his co-rapporteurs, the whole of the Civil Liberties Committee and the Swedish Presidency, who have been so vital in getting us to where we are today.
Let me be clear.
This report does not go as far as I would like.
For that matter, it does not go as far as some of the pioneers in this area, in some of the NGOs, would like, like Tony Bunyan of Statewatch.
It does not go as far as I hoped, but it does go further than I expected, as Parliament and the Swedish Presidency dragged the Commission and Council far closer to our position than they ever expected to be.
To accept what is offered here is to take a window of opportunity that is not guaranteed to remain open indefinitely.
We recognise that some documents should and must remain confidential and classified, but what must not happen is that legitimate reasons of security, public safety and public protection are used to hide the merely embarrassing and misjudged.
We welcome in particular the annual report that will detail the number of documents not listed from each institution, which will hopefully stop institutional creep from taking place, as year after year they add further and further categories of documents that will remain secret.
We welcome the assumption of access and hope it proves just that.
These processes will increase transparency, improve accountability and give citizens rights to access documents.
It does not give us freedom of information, but merely freer information.
The latter, however, is a goal well worth achieving.
The annual reports and the promised follow-up report in January 2004 may well prove that this report, this agreement, is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning.
As my friend Hans-Peter Martin said, it took decades for the Freedom of Information Act to become law.
Nevertheless, it is a political pleasure to be here.
Mr President, Minister, when all is said and done, it is a question of the meaning of words and of our really intending what is stated in Article 4 of the Regulation, namely that access to a document currently being dealt with will only be refused if such access would significantly undermine certain interests.
The aim is, in fact, to achieve transparency, and we are striving to make this transparency as fully effective as possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is about our believing in the words we write. I would call upon everyone who has contributed to the decision to ensure that the words are given their intended meaning.
Otherwise, people will become even more mistrustful.
We have achieved a compromise and made certain gains.
I am extremely pleased that we have succeeded in introducing more good administrative procedures for the handling of documents than I had believed we would.
It is also important that the exceptions are more limited than those proposed by the Commission.
It is interesting to see what was dispensed with.
What was also interesting was today' s statement from Commissioner Barnier to the effect that the infringement proceedings must be public, which means that we are entering a new era in the European Union.
Citizens will be able to monitor the Commission' s activity in a completely new way.
Many images have been used today.
I agree with Mr Watson - without whom we should not have come so far - that we have obtained a powerful searchlight to use on documents, instead of the pocket torch we had previously.
We have acquired a powerful tool.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will use that tool in the way cited by my colleagues and, in this, we are counting upon the help of the ombudsman.
There are shortcomings, but they are not as serious as our opponents maintain.
We must respect the meaning of the words.
We must also make sure that the Commission stops misusing the protection of personal data, something which has recently happened again.
It is now a question of going further, beyond what emerges from the reports about what has happened. It is about freedom of expression for employees and about ensuring that future discussion of the EU deals with transparency in a broader perspective, for transparency must apply to all the institutions and involve more than making documents publicly available.
Mr President, Parliament is taking an important step today on the road towards the greater transparency which we have been talking about for so many years.
The new rules are a stage in the cultural revolution that is needed if the EU is to develop into a modern, efficient and democratic form of cooperation which citizens in fact have confidence in.
What we have here are marked improvements.
As a starting point, all documents, including internal documents, are included, and they must be registered.
The exceptions to this rule are few but well-founded, and the rules governing the lodging of complaints have been tightened up on.
Many here today have criticised the present compromise, and in the case of a compromise there will always be something to criticise. This must not, however, overshadow the fact that this is a good compromise in which the EU is setting a standard for transparency unknown in many of the EU' s Member States.
Transparency does not come about through legislation alone, however.
It also depends upon a culture of transparency.
Transparency ought not to be perceived as an inconvenience for the administration.
Transparency is an advantage, not only for democracy but also for the authorities to which it extends.
Today, I want to call upon the Commission to take the spirit of this proposal seriously, not only the wording of the Regulation but also the recitals.
The Commission should forget the lack of public access that characterised its first proposal and straightforwardly adopt the new proposal and the new spirit.
The Commission has a big responsibility for ensuring that those who at present maintain that the new rules are no better than the existing rules are proved wrong.
In three years' time, practical experience must constitute a sufficient argument, and this is what we shall spend the next three years acquiring.
We must see how the new rules work.
We must make sure that countries which are sceptical come to see for themselves that transparency is beneficial to democracy.
Mr President, first of all, I want to congratulate Mr Cashman, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Watson. When a conciliation is entered into, not everything that may be wished for is obtained.
Such is life. The proposed compromise is assessed and a judgement arrived at as to whether, despite its shortcomings, it is better than nothing.
A decision for or against is then made. That is because there are no other possibilities when no further progress can be made at the negotiating table.
The compromise reached in the negotiations concerning public access to EU documents is in no way what I would have wished for at the start of the negotiations, and it contains weaknesses, as has already been pointed out.
For example, there are too many exceptions and too much uncertainty concerning the exceptions that are to apply.
However, it is the first step in the right direction, and it means that, in a few years' time, we can take the next step. Above all, it reflects the EU' s desire for greater transparency.
I can well understand why the compromise has been called a victory for the willingness to negotiate.
The Commission' s proposal was far from what we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party had looked forward to and far from what we in the Nordic countries might have wished for.
We in the Nordic countries have good traditions of administrative transparency and, naturally enough, we took these as our point of departure.
Over and against us, there was a long list of countries which do not have the same traditions, countries in which public access to official documents is scarcely known, countries in which there is no legislation in this area at all.
In other words, our points of view were worlds apart.
We Danes have a special love-hate relationship with our Swedish neighbours.
We often find them self-satisfied and overly correct, but as a rule we are, of course, just envious.
When it comes to administrative transparency, every country, including Denmark, has a lot to learn from the Swedes.
We therefore have fewer reservations about voting in favour of the compromise when we see that Swedish colleagues in our group, together with the Swedish Presidency, are able to recommend a vote in favour.
We shall carefully monitor the implementation of the result that has now been achieved.
Mr President, as I had half a minute left over from my previous speaking time, which I usually do not use up, I would like to use that time to make a few observations.
Mrs Kessler might want to do the same at the end.
I must say that I was greatly perturbed by Mrs Frahm' s intervention, because she claimed that the proposals represent quite a step backwards, and that is simply not true.
Maybe we need to have a one-to-one on this, but I think that you cannot make a claim about this proposal which simply bears no relation to reality.
I do believe that we must be extremely careful that the small delegations do not feel excluded.
All rapporteurs were from the largest and larger delegations, and we might need to consider how we could also involve the smaller delegations in those activities more in future.
Finally, I must say that, in my opinion, Mrs Hautala' s example of those Russian dolls was not all that appropriate.
If there is one country which is currently showing how to ruin disclosure, then it is surely Russia with the media campaigns which are taking place there at the moment.
Mr President, my last observation relates to the fact that the debates show up the cultural differences.
Hardly any representatives from southern European countries have spoken.
You are southern European, and Mr Barnier is French, but that was it.
Let us hope that this debate also strikes home with our southern European MEPs, for those countries might need public transparency more than anyone else.
The President is not authorised to reply to the allusion as to whether or not there are Members from the South present.
I rise because a damaging accusation was made that somehow we have violated the treaties by excluding smaller groups from discussions and negotiations and it is extremely important to correct this.
The debate and vote on the first draft report was held on 16 November 2000.
The rapporteurs were given a clear mandate by Parliament for discussion with the Council.
The European Parliament's Conference of Presidents also gave their clear political support.
The mandate given under Rule 69 of the Rules of Procedure was, and I quote, "to table amendments seeking to reach a compromise", in order to adopt the Regulation in a single reading and within the date set in the Treaty to implement Article 255.
The series of trialogue meetings, discussions between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, took place from January to March 2001.
All, and I repeat all, the various versions of the compromise amendments were discussed in the LIBE Committee and following the trialogue meetings.
The process has been considerably more transparent than the conciliation process and these compromise amendments were agreed on 25 April in the LIBE Committee.
At no time has any group, or any individual, been prevented from putting down amendments to put their influence into the procedure.
Things move on.
This Union has moved on.
Post Nice, we have a security policy.
It is right that we operate properly and responsibly.
Thank you very much, Mr Cashman.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Welcome
On the occasion of the debate that is about to take place, it is my honour to welcome the presence in the diplomatic gallery of an important delegation from the National Assembly of the FYROM, made up of Mr Tomislav Stojanovski and Mr Iljaz Halimi, Vice-Presidents of the National Assembly, Mr Slobodan Kosev, President of the inter-parliamentary delegation with our Parliament and Mr Nano Ruzin, member of the National Assembly.
Allow me to remind you that Mr Stojan Andov, President of the National Assembly, travelled to Strasbourg during our March part-session in order to inform the Conference of Presidents about the situation in Macedonia, and that in Strasbourg we are going to receive Mr Boris Trajkovski, President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in Parliament on Wednesday 13 June 2001.
EU/FYROM Agreement
The next item is the debate on the recommendation (A5-0132/2001) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, particularly those of you from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, tomorrow's decision on the first Stabilisation and Association Agreement with a Balkan country is also a big step for the European Parliament towards integrating the Balkan region into the European Union, especially as regards Macedonia's membership.
It is not by chance that Macedonia is the first country we are signing an agreement of this kind with.
Ever since it was created, this country has been extremely cooperative and constructive towards its neighbours and consequently also towards the European Union.
All governments have endeavoured to give minorities, especially the large Albanian minority, a share of social and political power.
This has certainly not happened without various debates and problems.
Furthermore, the international community, including this Parliament, have helped to meet some of the compelling needs of the Albanian population, particularly in the area of higher education, not least by establishing the University of Tetovo.
However, I can understand that the Albanian population in Macedonia does not think that this sequence of events is enough.
But what I cannot understand and will not accept - and what none of us should accept - is that extremists and terrorists should use those aspirations that have not yet been met as an excuse for attacks and for murder.
We must resolutely condemn these methods of achieving political objectives, which are totally inappropriate in a democracy.
In a democracy, no one should bring bombs and murder to the negotiating table.
Violence and terror tactics should not be rewarded.
It is, of course, necessary to build on what those in positions of political power, and not least the current government and President, have achieved since Macedonia's independence in terms of integrating minorities, by taking further steps so as not to jeopardise the internal stability of this country.
The Albanian minority is certainly a special case because of its size, but this should not result in further discrimination against smaller minorities.
Greater recognition of the Albanian language and a gradual but qualitatively justifiable and comprehensible increase in the share of teachers, judges, police officers and administrative officials is certainly called for.
Some of the provisions of the constitution have also been called into doubt.
I do not want to give any advice here as to whether and how the constitution should be amended.
But after all the positive and negative experience with emphasising the ethnic question, the inalienable individual and personal rights of every person, that is of every single citizen of Macedonia, should be the top priority, with special arrangements for ethnic reasons being accorded a lower priority.
As I see it, we in the European Union should not be promoting or supporting any division of this society along ethnic lines.
A newly shaped and improved relationship between the Slavic Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority is dependent on a greater desire for tolerance and acceptance on both sides, and also on integration and solidarity.
I say this because segregation and mere cool coexistence under a very shaky roof are not the ideal conditions for developing a joint state.
Alongside the need for regional cooperation and free movement across borders it is also important to shape the joint state of Macedonia.
During my many visits to the Balkans, generally together with Doris Pack, I have scarcely met anyone who dreams of a Greater Albania.
However, the Albanian population of Macedonia, who belong to a people which is represented in several different states, needs to be particularly sensitive in how it takes account of doubts and fears about this idea.
What is more, the political leaders of this society should not cave in under threats from extremists and terrorists.
Furthermore, I believe that all Macedonian politicians should work - and work together - on solving the country's urgent economic and social problems, because unemployment, poverty and poor prospects, particularly amongst the young, always make young people easy victims of the lure of extremism.
The agreement that we are to decide upon tomorrow will particularly help to solve the economic and social problems of this country.
Extremists will not bring Macedonia closer to Europe - just the opposite.
That would not help anyone except the extremists themselves.
In view of the most recent events I would like to say, however, that the same applies to the counter-violence that is already becoming apparent, and which also benefits no one but extremists.
I would like to call upon all responsible politicians in Macedonia to summon up sufficient courage to implement the necessary reforms.
But I would also particularly like to thank the representatives of the European Union, Javier Solana, Chris Patten, and the Commission representative in Skopje for their commitment.
Macedonia can solve its current problems by working with the European Union and in return we can certainly find better solutions to the problems of this region by working with Macedonia.
On that note, I wish every success not only to the agreement but also to Macedonia itself in tackling this difficult task.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could actually say that Johannes Swoboda has said it all.
I could say exactly that.
However, perhaps I can highlight some slightly different points.
The speed with which we are acting is also due to the fact that we simply want to show that Parliament is backing this country, Macedonia, and we also want to help it to overcome the current crisis as quickly as possible.
Of course we are also pleased that in Macedonia this House has totally subscribed to the European ideal and given its assent to this agreement.
This demonstrates whom Parliament has decided in favour of.
However, we must also make it clear in Macedonia that this Union is a Union of values.
We do not always observe them all, but these values include a high level of tolerance, a high level of respect for others and a great commitment to protecting minorities.
That is why I believe that in Macedonia it is necessary to work together, across party political lines, taking account of this tolerance threshold.
We need to fight together against criminality.
I deeply regret, in particular, the death of four Macedonian soldiers in the last few days.
So we need to fight together against criminals and agitators.
Everyone should distance themselves from these actions and condemn them, work towards a climate of tolerance, and do everything to promote it, in all the media as well as in the Macedonian Parliament and in Macedonian society.
Albanian terrorism must be condemned, but Slav-Macedonian nationalism is not an appropriate response to it.
I think Johannes Swoboda said that too, but perhaps he did not say it as emphatically as I have done.
Reason must make its entry on the Macedonian stage and that is why I believe it is the duty of all politicians to sweep aside any grounds for such actions, be they perceived or genuine.
It is true that the Albanian population is nowhere near having had appropriate access to public office and has not had a public presence which would enable it, with justification, to reject any attack on the fragile inter-ethnic balance.
This is partly a legacy of the communist past, but it is also partly attributable to the fact that in recent years insufficient efforts have been made to enhance this inter-ethnic balance.
In my conversations with former President Kligorov he repeatedly told me that he recognised this and was seeking to take action.
I must also say, however, that the former government did not necessarily pay sufficient heed to these appeals.
So it is all the more incomprehensible that after the admirable way the Kosovo crisis was handled, when the entire Macedonian people, both Slavic Macedonians and Albanians, genuinely accepted the refugees in a truly commendable way, that just at this moment when Albanians are occupying key ministerial posts, when the law on higher education has been passed, when the fate of the University of Tetovo has been resolved with assistance from us and with the help of other states through additional funding, and the academic year can actually start, that just at this moment an explosive situation should arise.
I believe that this is happening not so much for genuine political and rational reasons, but rather to keep a real trouble spot alive so that terrorists can strengthen their hand.
I very much hope that all reasonable politicians in Macedonia will, in view of the new European window of opportunity opened up by this agreement, jointly launch yet more initiatives to achieve a functioning Macedonian society.
But I would also like to appeal to the international community, to UNMIK and to KFOR, to do everything possible to help Macedonia by pursuing a better and more consistent policy in Kosovo, because the dissatisfaction there is releasing ever more terrorist potential.
There are many areas of policy in Macedonia where assistance is needed.
We should help them in the field of criminal jurisdiction, with their problems of corruption and also of trafficking in human beings, which is also a major problem throughout the region.
I particularly welcome the fact that the border agreement with Yugoslavia was the first to be concluded in the region.
I would also, amongst other things, like to see media representatives being trained so that they are worthy of that name and do not unnecessarily pour oil on the fire.
I would also like to see the politicians who are here today and their colleagues doing everything in their power to ensure that their youth can in future stay in their country, because it is their future.
But they need jobs and they need prospects.
That is why we very much welcome the fact that the five regional Enterprise Promotion Centres have been set up, and I hope they will be a success.
The most important thing, however, is political stability, because only if that exists will companies move there.
Under our new agreement, it will be possible for the European Union to provide them with the necessary support.
I am sure that in conjunction with the Commission we will do everything to achieve this.
Mr President, today we endorse Mr Swoboda's recommendation which, like all his work, is excellent.
The situation is somewhat ironic, since today is 2 May and the Commission's agreement was signed on 24 November.
It may be that, had we adopted it earlier, we would have been able to avoid some of the consequences as well.
I will restrict myself to pointing out that, this afternoon, the guerrillas have fired on the Albanian Embassy, shops and flats belonging to Albanians have been destroyed in Bitola, which had never known any disorder before, and yesterday a bomb was defused at Skopje airport.
I therefore call upon you, ladies and gentlemen to do whatever you can to stop this escalation of violence while it is still possible, while there is still a chance of success and you still have the strength.
Macedonia has been a nightmare for the West for years.
The Council and Commission resolutions mention Macedonia chiefly in relation to Albania, but then there is Kosovo to be taken into consideration.
And there is clearly more than that: Macedonia appears to be the centre of the mess in the Balkans.
It is a nation with an irrational streak, with some citizens who are pro-Bulgarian, others who are pro-Serbian, with a large section that identifies itself with the Republic of Macedonia established by Tito, and with a large Albanian minority.
Well then, it cannot do without dialogue or the country will fall to pieces.
Today, Europe is doing something more to help: the greater the European interest in Macedonia, the greater the stability of Europe. However, you must do your part.
Mr President, I had the pleasure of taking a delegation of Members from my group, firstly on a visit last month to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and then last week to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo.
We, the vast majority of my group at least, have returned with an even greater conviction that the European Union cannot exist without south-eastern Europe.
In our view, the European Union must therefore provide itself with the economic, political and institutional resources necessary to implement a strategy that would allow us to include these peoples and nations, if they so wish.
We believe that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement concluded between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia plays a part, albeit a modest one, in achieving this.
It was signed on 9 April 2001 and was ratified by Parliament just three weeks later, and in my view, this agreement represents a step forward for Macedonia, the region and the European Union.
It is a step forward for Macedonia, since, in addition to the considerable funding provided by financial aid worth EUR 62 million since the beginning of this year and the opportunity to export its products to the fifteen countries of the EU, free from customs duties, the political significance of this agreement is a decisive factor.
It symbolises a commitment given by the major Macedonian political forces, both Slav- and Albanian-speaking, to encourage political dialogue, without any acts of violence being committed between the various ethnic communities.
This agreement encourages taking steps towards establishing equal rights and equal opportunities for all citizens and opens up the prospect of unification for a society that is threatened by instability, signs of which can be seen on a daily basis.
This is a step forward for the region, which we should no longer call 'the Balkans' , since this is a term widely rejected for its painful connotations.
For the region, the fact that Macedonia was the first country to sign this type of agreement is an incentive to take inspiration from this model of inter-ethnic cooperation, which is imperfect, but nevertheless groundbreaking.
We should remember that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for the Economy, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Labour and Social Policy, the Minister for Local Self-Government and many deputy ministers in Macedonia are Albanian.
Finally, it is a step forward for the European Union itself, which has experienced so much difficulty in making a success of its common foreign policy, and the fact that the EU is able to play a truly constructive role in this important country should be seen as an encouraging sign.
So, we must continue to make good progress.
Other similar agreements must be signed in the same spirit with Croatia, Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and the next step should be to accept their candidature for joining the European Union.
Even if each country understands that the path leading from their application to actually joining is part of a process, the conditions for an active partnership already exist.
My group, in any case, has decided to make a determined effort to achieve this.
Mr President, establishing relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on a new, innovative basis and offering that country the prospect, albeit in the long term, of joining the European Union' s structures through the measures provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Process would, I think, be a major contribution to the stability of the Balkan region.
The agreement which we are discussing today, which was signed by the contracting parties six months ago, covers the inclusion of protocols establishing political dialogue with FYROM, contains measures for closer regional cooperation, opens the way for the establishment of a free trade area with the European Union and lays down measures for the free movement of workers, freedom of establishment, the provision of services and the movement of capital. It also gives a commitment to harmonising the legislation of that country with that of the EU, particularly in certain fundamental areas of the internal market, and, lastly, it also promotes measures on cooperation in a wide range of fields, particularly justice and home affairs.
This, Mr President, is the agreement that has been reached.
Now that the agreement has been concluded, we hope that its clauses will represent a great step towards peace and stability in the region, whose peoples have already demonstrated that their aspirations to become part of our area of freedom and development are legitimate.
This is also why the agreement can and must set an example for the other countries in the Balkans.
With the recent acts of aggression that have been committed at the border and perpetrated against that country' s civilian population and armed forces, the important thing now is to support the efforts of the Macedonian government and people to maintain the stability of the country and to encourage the government and the moderate Albanian parties to avoid destructive and confrontational positions.
Their action must focus on maintaining peace and democracy in a multi-ethnic society, which is, incidentally, a crucial factor for the implementation of this agreement. We must therefore encourage the Macedonian government to pursue its policy in order to guarantee fundamental rights and tolerance between all ethnic groups so that impetus can be given to the country' s economic development.
To sum up, I think that the agreement must enter into force as quickly as possible and I hope that with Parliament' s vote, our message to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be understood, so that the violence can be dealt with effectively and that this example is followed by the neighbouring peoples and countries.
Mr President, Representative of the Commission - who is not here - representative of the Council, I would like to start by making a preliminary statement about democracy and to stress - and here I am addressing our esteemed fellow parliamentarians from the Republic of Macedonia - that the issue of democracy, the problems of democracy, do not concern your country alone.
In a country in which I was elected, Italy, at this moment, one of our fellow Members, Emma Bonino, is reaching her 113th hour of a hunger strike, and this is over a matter of democracy, because in Italy, a country of the European Union, the conditions of democracy, of democratic participation in elections are not guaranteed.
In Italy, we are witnessing a squabble between the 'Pole' and the 'Olive Tree' over non-existent issues, over questions of deference of one or the other to the Vatican, and squabbles over serious matters as well, such as that of the conflict of interests concerning the centre-right candidate, an extremely serious matter yet one which has not been tackled by the centre-left in the five years of the legislature which is coming to an end.
What I am trying to say is that democracy is a serious issue, an issue that concerns us, and something as serious as what is happening in Italy now and concerns the debate and the capacity ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Dupuis, I wish to make a suggestion, which is that you restrict yourself to the issue under discussion and leave matters of Italian domestic politics for another occasion.
I would suggest that you comply with the Rules of Procedure and that you make a speech on the issue we are discussing and not on Italian domestic politics, which is not on the agenda.
Mr President, I was just about to say that the issue of information is also fundamental.
I will now turn to the issue which is more central to our debate, the issue ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Dupuis, you have spoken for two minutes and thirty seconds and are only now getting to the point.
You must admit that this is going too far.
Mr President, until it is proved otherwise, we are still free to say what we want, we are still a democracy.
You may have a different view of democracy, but everyone can say what they feel needs to be said.
I was just getting to the point, Mr President. Thanks to Mr Swoboda and his initiative and the cooperation of some of the Members, we have, at last, recouped the time lost, and I am extremely grateful to Mr Swoboda for that.
At last, we have an agreement.
We are all aware - every now and again I agree with Mr Wurtz - that what is needed is to start to think about the real issue, which is that of accession, for we cannot continue to have different categories for candidate countries and countries which cannot be candidates.
With regard to the issue of Macedonia, a few weeks ago, when the High Representative, Mr Solana, returned, I think we all had some hope of seeing an improvement in the situation.
The recent events mentioned by Mr Volcic are, however, evidence that the situation is anything but under control: indeed, what has happened - the fact that eight soldiers were killed a few days ago and the anti-Albanian demonstrations - shows that this is not the case.
In my opinion, the situation is extremely serious; it is true that we were a minority to say so months and months ago, but I feel that the situation is extremely serious. Certainly, Parliament can no longer see this agreement as the solution to the crises in Macedonia.
A great deal more will be needed, and here I am addressing our fellow parliamentarians from Macedonia: the conditions have to be restored for genuine dialogue, there must be proper non-manipulative analysis of the real issues concerning, in particular, the Albanian minority, the cumulative frustrations suffered by this minority but also by other Albanian communities.
I would point out that, until the Kosovo issue is resolved, it will be difficult to find a solution to the problem of Macedonia.
Therefore, we must persuade the Commission and the Council to tackle these issues comprehensively at last and to discuss, at last, the matter of Kosovo's final status, to resolve, at last, the issue of Kosovar prisoners, and then to help our Macedonian friends deal with their genuine problems.
These frustrations are far-reaching.
Macedonia's current economic situation certainly does nothing to further the resolution of any of these issues, but there is no doubt that there are currently economic and other disparities between the treatment of the Albanian minority and that of the Macedonian majority.
When the Albanian minority of a town such as that of Tetovo sees coach loads of workers, 'ethnic Macedonian' workers, arriving from Skopje, the only possible conclusion is that they are being treated differently.
So federalism cannot provide a solution?
In my opinion, Mrs Pack, quite the contrary: we must consider federalism.
Federalism does not necessarily bring division.
There are federalistic solutions - and I refer to the case of Belgium, for example, which invented the concept of community federalism, in which, for matters more directly related to the relationship between the citizens and their institution, which may include culture, education and even health, it would be possible to conceive of a federalism which would not bring about territorial division in Macedonia but which would provide the substantial Albanian minority with institutions to represent it too and, therefore, with autonomous control at least over the areas which concern it most directly.
I believe that our fellow parliamentarians from Macedonia should be able to view these proposals for a solution without fear or suspicion, for they are the channels through which a climate can be established in which the two great communities that make up Macedonia today can coexist peacefully.
Mr President, Saturday' s bloody border incident is a serious setback for those forces in Macedonian society which advocate peaceful, ethnic coexistence within a Macedonian state.
The ethnic disturbances in the city of Bitola are further proof of this.
At the same time, this violent clash between Albanian guerrilla fighters and a Macedonian elite patrol raises fresh questions concerning the effectiveness of the international military presence on both sides of the Kosovar-Macedonian border.
First of all, where were the KFOR units at the time of Saturday' s confrontation, which was very intense indeed.
I would appreciate it if both the Council and Commission could shed some light on this.
In the final analysis, rapporteur Swoboda has not for nothing highlighted the KFOR' s essential contribution to the pacification in the border region between Kosovo and Macedonia.
I have a second question for the Council and Commission: there is an apparent lack of communication between KFOR contingents which are based on Kosovar and Macedonian border territory.
I am not expecting a direct reply, but I do hope that both European institutions will address this elementary pacification condition with the seriousness it deserves.
Finally, it is recommended, in sound consultation and close cooperation with the Macedonian and Serbian authorities, for the KFOR to deploy extremely tight border control with neighbouring Kosovo.
It is precisely this assistance, as rapporteur Swoboda pointed out with good reason, which benefits the stabilisation and association process in the entire region of the western Balkans.
Mr President, more than a year ago, in a report on the same subject Mr Swoboda remarked that Macedonia is, in fact, a stabilising factor within the Balkans.
He spoke those words with the backing of the entire Parliament because, of course, we remember the time before the Yugoslav wars, when Macedonia, in particular, played an extremely intelligent and constructive role by drafting compromises to make the warring parties change course.
That is something which we will not forget in a hurry.
Secondly, we remember the reception in Macedonia of refugees from Kosovo: that too was an enormous effort which caused the necessary tension within Macedonia.
It was not an easy task and we will not forget this.
The western world, and the European Union too, on the other hand, have not always behaved impeccably towards Macedonia.
A boycott was introduced, the effects of which Macedonia had to shoulder.
Macedonia was fobbed off with humanitarian aid and was not really given any opportunities for its own industry.
It is extremely important for the European Union to take an emphatic and positive step forward now with this Stabilisation and Association Agreement, by means of which fresh opportunities will be created for Macedonian industry.
Needless to say, we were also critical of Macedonia, and still are, because it was slow in establishing interethnic relations.
But all hell is breaking loose precisely at a time when the University of Tetovo is turning over a new leaf by offering opportunities to Albanian-speaking groupings in Macedonia, as a result of which the official apparatus will probably be less one-sided.
It is extremely unfortunate that the Copenhagen criteria, which apply across the board to all candidate countries, are at now risk there.
I would therefore call on the Macedonian politicians to make a special effort to act as advocates for the constitutional state, because in this way they will be welcome to join the union of constitutional states of which we are all part.
Mr President, my group backs the rapporteur' s conclusions, and that is why I can congratulate Macedonia on the fact that this former Yugoslav Republic is the first to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
An agreement will enable us to set up intensive relations in a very concrete manner.
An agreement is an important instrument for the region' s further stabilisation and adds, as such, to the Stability Pact in a meaningful way.
But there is more.
A Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first step towards EU membership.
It is the culmination of the pledge which the European Union undertook, namely that a successful implementation of all elements of the Stability Pact will open up the way to membership of the EU.
It underlines the focus on Europe and on European values.
We hope that the Macedonian model will be copied promptly by the others.
There are already negotiations under way with Croatia.
With regard to Albania, preparations to that effect are being made.
Hopefully, initial talks will soon be held in Belgrade too, provided that the Montenegro issue does not put a spanner in the works.
And we should not overlook Bosnia, of course.
The strength of this agreement lies not only in the provisions it contains, which enables cooperation in many areas.
The close ties with the European Union which are based on this agreement, as well as the prospect of membership tied in with that, could have a moderating effect on the internal relations in these countries.
That is a form of conflict prevention.
We have actually noticed these effects in the candidate countries.
The active role which the High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have managed to play during the recent disturbances in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a shining example of this positive effect.
The only conclusion we could draw therefore is that more of these agreements are needed in the region in the short term.
Mr President, this agreement opens a door which we should have opened years ago in an area which, thanks to our stupid policy, has become the black hole of Europe.
This agreement is the right move in the right direction.
However, it is a fragile agreement.
Eight policemen and soldiers were killed the other day.
Provocation.
The response from a few irresponsible people in Bitola, a bomb at the airport.
Mr Swoboda has never heard talk of Great Albania, I hear it every day living and working as I do in the area.
It is a fragile agreement, a delicate situation, for another reason: it is quite unclear, there is no certainty whatsoever as to what policy we as the European Union wish to apply here.
Without a policy which guarantees integrity and sovereignty, there can be no trust, no prospects, no dialogue and no democratic reform.
Only then can there be political stability.
Otherwise we shall come back in a few years' time to count up our mistakes.
Mr President, following the fall of the Milosevic regime on 1 October 2000 and the ensuing democratic changes which took place in Belgrade, the European Union has radically changed its policy towards Serbia.
In the Union's message to the Serbian people last September the foreign minister said that the Union promised that a vote for democracy in Serbia would be a vote for Serbia in Europe.
After the democratic transition in Serbia, the Union lifted its sanctions to repeal the oil embargo against Serbia and the Union lifted flight bans.
The Union has also extended funding via the European Reconstruction Agency in Serbia to Montenegro as well as to propose an extension to the recently announced trade preferences of the Balkans and the whole of Yugoslavia.
It is very important that the European Union and Yugoslavia normalise diplomatic relations.
The European Union is right to be active in contributing to the institutional and economic rebuilding that is presently taking place within the former Republic of Yugoslavia.
We must all work together to put behind us the tragic events that have taken place in the Balkans since the 1990s.
The arrest of Mr Milosevic is the first important step in bringing him to justice and the authorities in Belgrade must be congratulated for their determination in this regard.
It is only right and proper that he answers to the Serbian people for crimes he has committed against them and in their name.
We now have before us the best prospects for a generation of building lasting peace and prosperity across the whole of south-east Europe and the European Union is prepared to play an active role in this regard.
The overall financial assistance from the Union to the states which comprise the former Republic of Yugoslavia now amounts to EUR 475 million.
This assistance includes help for educational programmes, reconciliation schemes, the provision of shelters for refugees, constructing border crossing-points as well as supporting infrastructure projects such as the building of roads and the clearing of the Danube river of pollutants.
I also believe it is important that Kosovo leaders speak out clearly against the violence that is taking place in the former Republic of Yugoslavia.
These leaders should remember that it is very hard to justify to European taxpayers the very substantial levels of financial assistance Kosovo is receiving from the Union if its leaders fail to condemn the violence which is taking place in the region at this time.
The violence, murder, human suffering and instability in the Balkan regions, which have been taking place over the last 10 years, must now be put behind us.
Mr President, allow me to extend a particularly warm, friendly and affectionate welcome to our colleagues and neighbours from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to welcome the real burgeoning democracy which will bring it closer to the European Union.
I am sure that our colleagues expect a Greek MEP to say something about the dispute over the name.
Perhaps this dispute should never have arisen, perhaps it should have been settled a long time ago; in any event, negotiations are under way, friendly negotiations, and I trust that this problem will soon be resolved.
For the rest, Greece wholeheartedly supports its neighbouring state.
Everything we have heard here about what the European Union should be doing, in the form of action rather than high-flying words, Greece is already doing.
In other words, Greece is already providing economic support in the form of investments - it is one of the biggest, if not the biggest investor in our neighbouring country - and through trade.
It is providing political support by steadfastly backing the policy of reconciliation being applied by the government in our neighbouring country to the extremely difficult, the terribly difficult internal problems which it faces and it is providing international support in that it has officially called on NATO to prevent the anarchy which other areas in the region are endeavouring to import via our neighbouring country.
We should not be lulled by the calm here in Parliament into underestimating just how terrible the problems being created are.
Extremists are using age-old, familiar tactics to kill, plunder and create incidents in order to set two groups in the same country - and in the final analysis from the same nation, because they are Europeans just like us - at each others' throats.
It is a familiar tactic.
Unfortunately, it has proven effective and we must oppose it.
Unfortunately we, the European Union, have added grist to the mill of mutual destruction with our mistakes.
We must stand firm in our opposition and prove that we can bring about reconciliation and facilitate collaboration between nations; this is the only way of forging a link in the chain of peace rather than creating a hotbed of discontent.
Mr President, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will not be voting in favour of this agreement with the FYROM, because it proves yet again that the European Union is endeavouring to get a tighter grip on this country.
Economic concessions and promises of accession to the European Union, naturally once it has complied fully with social demands, are a means of ensuring greater penetration of European capital.
The report, which cites the decisions taken at Stockholm, basically agrees to treat Albanian extremists posing as negotiators who, as we have seen, have not let up in their criminal activities, and the government of the FYROM on an equal footing.
Everyone knows that the famous National Liberation Army, which aspires to be the official negotiator of the Albanian minority, is in fact an offshoot of the KLA.
Having set the wolf to guard the lambs, it is up to the High Representative to monitor compliance with the agreement.
That is why, in our view, this policy, as set out in the present report, merely adds fuel to the fire raging in the Balkans and offers encouragement to the grand unification plans of the Albanian nationalists.
We need to safeguard the right of the people in the area to decide their own future and, if we want to help, it is precisely this sort of intervention and activity which we should refuse to support.
Before I turn to the question of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, let me place on record our condemnation of the attack on the Kosovo foreign border at the weekend in which eight Fyrom soldiers were killed.
As Commission Patten said at the weekend, this was an attack against democracy, an attack designed to derail the interparty dialogue that has recently begun in Fyrom on interethnic relations, a dialogue which the European Union has strongly supported.
We continue to stand four square for the values of tolerance and moderation and in support of those who seek to resolve differences through dialogue instead of the bomb and the bullet.
That is why the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Fyrom which took place in Luxembourg on 9 April was such an important event.
It is the first such agreement we have signed with a country in the region and it symbolises the strong ties that exist between the Union and Fyrom.
It was signed in the presence of the European Union's Foreign Ministers and representatives of nearly all the parties: opposition government, Albanian, Macedonian, Slav, which are represented in the Parliament in Skopje.
The message was one of unity, unity in the face of the threats to democracy that Fyrom has recently faced and continues to face today. Unity in a shared belief in Fyrom's future as a key member of the European family.
The negotiations were launched by the Commission on 5 March 2000.
Thanks to excellent cooperation with the Macedonian authorities, the negotiations were concluded within nine months and the agreement was initialled in the margins of the Zagreb Summit on 24 November.
The main elements of the agreement are the establishment of a free trade area between the Community and Fyrom within a ten-year period after the entry into force of the agreement, the establishment of a political dialogue, provisions on regional cooperation provisions on the freedom of movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, a commitment by the Fyrom authorities to approximate legislation to that of the European Community especially in the internal market, cooperation in areas such as justice and home affairs, establishment of a stabilisation and association council that supervises the implementation of the agreement.
The agreement makes clear that Fyrom is a potential candidate for membership of the European Union once it has implemented the agreement and subject to the Copenhagen criteria.
The interim agreement also signed on 9 April provides for the trade-related provisions of the agreement to enter into force from 1 June 2001, without having to wait for the formal ratification of the agreement by national parliaments.
The Commission invites the European Parliament to give its assent to the agreement and we hope that national parliaments will ratify the agreement as quickly as possible.
As honourable Members are aware, this is a critical period in Fyrom's history.
This agreement and Parliament's support for it underline the European Union's commitment to Fyrom's wellbeing and the confidence in our people.
That is the context in which the Presidency, Commissioner Patten and the High Representative have been working hard in recent weeks to facilitate the dialogue between democratically elected political parties in Fyrom, initiated by President Trajkovski and which is designed to address legitimate grievances.
That hard work will continue, but as with the agreement, while the European Union will wish to be as supportive as possible, ultimately the main effort must be made by the people of Fyrom and their political leaders.
It is they who carry responsibility for their countries future which is why it is so important to press ahead now with the political dialogue.
Thank you all for your contributions and thank you also to Mr Swoboda.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Nuclear safety fifteen years after Chernobyl
The next item is the Commission statement on nuclear safety fifteen years after the Chernobyl accident and its health consequences.
Mr President, honourable Members, the Chernobyl accident in 1986 was a tragedy on a global scale and we continue to feel strongly for the victims this tragedy has caused, both among those involved in the clean-up and plant workers, and among people not directly involved, including innocent children.
We also recognise the huge economic burden this accident has put on Belarus, Russia and Ukraine and other countries and the problems for the population in contaminated regions to restore normal living conditions.
The consequences of the accident on EU territory were comparatively minor but nevertheless important efforts continue to be made for monitoring levels of radioactivity in the environment and in foodstuffs: controls on the import of foodstuffs were even recently strengthened.
The commemoration of this event provides us with an opportunity to reflect upon nuclear safety in the region.
On 15 December 2000, Ukraine shut down definitively the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
The Commission welcomed this decision as a major contribution to the improvement of nuclear safety in Europe.
We also appreciate that by deciding to close the Chernobyl plant before the end of 2000, Ukraine lived up to the commitment it made under the international agreement signed with the governments of the of the G7 countries and with the European Commission.
The European Union has provided considerable support to Ukraine over the last few years in addressing and overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, which had such devastating effects on the population and the environment.
Over EUR 340 million have been granted in assistance today, not taking into account technical assistance provided for other nuclear installations in the Ukraine.
For Chernobyl, important EU support is related to turning the sarcophagus into an environmentally acceptable system and addressing social needs.
The Commission will soon adopt the formal proposal for a Council decision on a second contribution to the Chernobyl shelter fund at the EBRD which will then be submitted to the Council and to Parliament for decision.
Nuclear safety is a priority for the European Union.
Since the beginning of the political and economic reforms that took place in the former Soviet Union, the European Union has actively assisted the countries of the region in improving the safety of their nuclear installations.
The strategy followed by the EU was in line with the G7 multilateral programme of action.
This included support for short-term measures for nuclear safety improvements as well as longer-term measures to replace unsafe reactors by alternative energy sources.
In the particular case of the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, the PHARE Programme has helped and continues to help improve nuclear safety there as well as to develop economically and environmentally sound energy strategies for the replacement of the less safe nuclear reactors.
As requested by the Council, the Commission has given a high priority to nuclear safety in the accession partnerships and in using pre-accession funds to pursue these priorities.
Important landmarks are: the agreement to close non-upgradeable units in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria; the support that the programme has given to the nuclear regulators; the short-term urgent safety improvements made to some reactors; the design and operational improvements in upgradeable reactors and also considerable assistance to tackle the problems related to radioactive waste and spent fuel.
The case of the Russian Federation is particularly important.
Russia is the only state of the former Soviet Union involved in all aspects of nuclear power, from uranium mining to plant design, power generation and spent fuel reprocessing.
Some 15% of electricity in Russia is generated by nuclear power.
Russia's civil nuclear industry is also a major source of employment accounting for approximately 300 000 people in direct jobs.
Given the limited size of the available EU budget, the large number of operating reactors and the special economic conditions in Russia, it would be impossible for the European Union to offer Russia financial assistance equivalent to that made available to the candidate countries and to Ukraine.
Nonetheless the basic policy orientation is the same: to use the technical and financial resources available to the European Union to help the Russian Federation improve safety levels.
With regard to Russia, we also pursue an active cooperation in spent fuel and radio active waste management in north-west Russia.
An enormous quantity of spent fuel from nuclear submarines is stored under very poor conditions.
This poses a major threat to the Barents Sea and the Arctic environment.
The Community is not party to the Arctic monitoring and assessment programme, but is nevertheless closely involved in the work related to environmental radioactivity in the Arctic.
We are at present involved in active negotiations on a specified multilateral agreement, the MNEPR, which should allow us to set up and implement a large international effort.
To conclude, the Commission has undertaken an active policy in assisting our partner states in their efforts to increase nuclear safety.
We are committed to continue this policy and hope very much that together we can ensure a secure and safe energy supply consistent with sustainable development and respect for the environment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we think back today in Parliament to the accident in Chernobyl, what we remember is the cynical attitude taken by a dictatorship towards man' s safety and his environment.
I stress this point because we have, of course, acted in the debate on many occasions as if Chernobyl were everywhere.
It is not.
Twelve years ago a dictatorship crumbled, a dictatorship which from the outset did not have the standard of technical safety which we have in the rest of the world or, more to the point, in Europe.
For the rest, we should clarify that, in a democracy, discussion takes place in public. That alone contributes to safety.
A democracy has independent supervisory agencies. That too contributes to safety.
And it has independent courts, which again contribute to safety. In other words, a democratic system operating under the rule of law is, per se, such an important safety factor that any parallels need to be made clear at this point.
The consequences of the cynical attitude of a dictatorship, which had a nuclear power station which was unsafe from the outset and four reactors which were shut down in December in response to international pressure, have had to be borne mainly by the people in the countries affected.
I note that, even twelve years after the fall of the Soviet Union, many leading politicians have yet to depart from this cynical attitude towards the people, as the truly abysmal treatment of the people after the sinking of the Kursk proved.
Public discussion is still not a routine matter there and we would do well to bear that in mind.
We are right to say in our resolution that there is widespread concern.
But I also notice that many people are wrongly feeding this concern in order to achieve a completely different objective, namely to lump unsafe nuclear power stations together with the safe nuclear power stations which are currently being built around the world, including soon in the Union and America, and this is unacceptable.
This does not apply in other technical areas: if something goes wrong with a car, we do not ban all cars, and if an aeroplane crashes, it is terrible, but we do not ban all aeroplanes.
We want help for the Ukraine.
But we must also tell the Ukraine and ourselves that we cannot rest easily just by giving money; we must put conditions in place there so that money in a functioning economic system can fulfil the same purpose as it does in a democracy, which is why we expect - as the resolution makes clear - all manner of changes and adjustments to the energy system in the Ukraine.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, if we are talking about learning lessons, then that applies in particular to the candidate countries.
We have nine new nuclear power stations there with 27 reactors.
Of which we know that three power stations with eight reactors are to be shut down.
But we know equally well that other parts of nuclear power stations can be upgraded and that brings me to my sixty-four thousand dollar question to you, Commissioner: the Commission is conducting accession negotiations, including on the "standard energy safety" chapter on behalf of the European Union.
Parliament is still waiting for you to tell us and the public exactly which nuclear power station safety standard the negotiations are based on.
To my knowledge you have promised Parliament as much on several occasions, but the matter is still pending.
The Commission has a debt to discharge here.
I only hope that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy will receive a clear answer from you as soon as possible as to what safety standard negotiations with candidate countries are based on.
It is a question of the utmost interest to all of us and all of our citizens.
Mr President, the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant has, of course, been widely applauded by Members in political groups in this House, but it could have happened earlier and the reasons why it did not are instructive.
The Ukraine does not wish to increase its dependence of supplies from Russia and therefore it wished to complete the reactors at Khmelnitski and Rovno and in their eyes we have been rather slow in operating the memorandum of understanding that was concluded in 1995.
However, the decision to make the Euratom loan available to complete those reactors marks a very important step towards improving EU/Ukraine relations because the loan agreement marks the willingness of Ukraine to operate its nuclear plant to safety standards equivalent to those in the European Union.
It is one thing talking about the operational standards of safety, the other important aspect is the regulation of the industry.
I am pleased that the Commissioner made such reference to the support that we give to regulators throughout eastern Europe, because this is the area that gives us the greatest concern.
It is not in any way to challenge the competence of the regulator or his staff in Ukraine.
It is a question of the power of the regulatory body to authorise start-up procedures to ensure stoppage for maintenance and to be the final arbiter for loading and restarting.
There is still an outstanding need to satisfy the West that the status of the regulator in Ukraine, and in some other eastern European countries, is equivalent to western practice: it certainly should be established before K2 is finally commissioned.
Paragraph 12 of the joint resolution calls for closer cooperation and dialogue between Ukraine and the European Parliament on energy-related matters.
This is crucial to building up the Ukraine economy, because structural and technical improvements are also needed in the gas, oil and coal sectors and while the commitment of Ukraine to improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources is welcome, the dominant factors for the foreseeable future will be fossil fuel and nuclear power.
It is essential that this Parliament, its committees and its delegation to the Ukraine are linked into the work of the subcommittee of the political cooperation agreement which handles energy and environment issues.
Parliament should also be kept fully informed of progress in the shelter construction, the decommissioning of the site and the completion of the two reactors.
These are the pressing practical matters which must follow from the voting of this resolution.
Mr President, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased that we have, at any event, succeeded in agreeing upon a resolution, even though we should, of course, have liked it to be stronger on certain points.
Fifteen years after Chernobyl, the safety of nuclear power and its effects upon health are the subject of this resolution.
Chernobyl is a constant reminder to us that we cannot continue to ignore the risks of nuclear power, and it constitutes the clearest warning of all about the threat posed by nuclear power to our whole existence.
I would say to the previous speaker that nuclear accidents were not the invention of Communism. Rather, accidents have also occurred in the United States and Japan.
Is that at least not something we should be able to agree about?
The UN' s Department for Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 9 million people have been affected directly or indirectly by the disaster in Chernobyl.
In Belarus, 18 per cent of the total population live in a heavily polluted environment.
These figures are extremely high, considering what they mean for individual people.
Just as Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m pointed out, children are the most vulnerable.
The World Health Organisation reports that the annual rate of thyroid gland cancer among children in the Gomel area of Belarus and the most affected areas in Ukraine exceeds the normal values by almost a hundred times.
The question is whether we have learned anything since then.
Is the precautionary principle being applied today?
EU funds are still being handed out for the purpose of completing the nuclear reactors in Ukraine, and Euratom still spreads the gospel of nuclear power, praising its splendid qualities.
It is, of course, commendable that the EU should contribute to nuclear safety, but should we not also at some point provide funds for closing down nuclear power stations?
I want to ask Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m if the Commission has any plans to require the applicant States to close down nuclear power stations before they can become members of the European Union. I would also add my name to the question asked earlier about what safety standard the EU has.
What answer do we give to the applicant States when they ask about this?
Mr President, the Chernobyl disaster was not an exception, and, as such, not something which was typical of one type of nuclear power station which was produced and used in the former Soviet Union.
Even before 1986, there was the disaster in Harrisburg in the US, where an overheated and melting nuclear reactor threatened to sink into the ground.
The fact is that since the 1950s, there has been too much optimism worldwide about the characteristics of nuclear energy.
It was expected to be a non-exhaustive source of cheap and clean energy, but instead it turned out to be a risky business which, even after production was stopped, continued seriously to pollute the environment.
Fifteen years after the disaster, a large area in Belarus and Ukraine is still not inhabitable for people who do not want to get cancer.
Those who stay have become dependent on government aid, and those who should be able to help those most affected avoid or leave the area.
Food from the polluted area remains unsuitable for consumption.
To solve this situation, we do not need a new type of nuclear power station, but rather a recovery plan for the affected area, alternative ways of generating energy, as well as energy-saving measures.
Only a financial contribution is in the interest of all Europeans; anything else will just lead to wasted energy and to future disasters.
Mr President, according to a statement by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the number of cases of thyroid cancer has risen sharply.
That is the finding in a report by the Otto-Hug-Institut at Munich University.
According to WHO forecasts, in the district of Gomel in Belarus alone, which is the main area affected, a third of the children who were under four years of age when the accident occurred will contract cancer of the thyroid during their lifetime.
The repercussions could become apparent in seven million people over the next 50 to 70 years.
In Belarus alone, there is a shortfall in the funds needed to treat radiation victims of EUR 800 million a year.
Because there is no money, people over the age of 45 are no longer being treated.
Meaning that they will die.
Compare this amount with the EUR 1.2 billion spent by the Commission on nuclear research under the sixth EU nuclear research programme and draw your own tragic conclusions.
We call on the European Union to issue strict, uniform nuclear safety standards.
A repeat of Chernobyl must be prevented, which is why bogus environmental impact tests, such as those in Temelin, should not be carried out.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Chernobyl disaster would have been thought impossible before it happened, even under a dictatorship.
Of course, I believe that this sort of thing could never happen in a British, French or German nuclear power station.
But we are surrounded by nuclear power stations using obsolete Russian technology.
I need only think of Bohunice, Kozlodoui or Ignalina.
These power stations cannot be upgraded, even with the very best western technology.
In Austria no one - not one party - is in favour of using nuclear energy.
We have learned to accept that we cannot force others to follow our example.
But what we can do is warn them about dangerous nuclear power stations, about nuclear power stations which would be unable to obtain an operating licence anywhere in the European Union.
When someone builds a house, the neighbours are asked if the tree in the garden is too tall and is blocking out too much light.
When someone builds a nuclear power station which would not be able to obtain a license anywhere in the European Union, suddenly it is a question of national sovereignty and everyone is insulted if you question safety standards or ask for information.
In Austria - and I think that I really can speak for everyone - we have taken great pains for a long time to call for uniform standards which apply in all the European countries.
Commissioner, the same thing has been put to you twice today already.
I know full well that we cannot compare French technology, for example, with British technology and that the French industry may wish to guard its secrets.
But we must have a minimum consensus.
We must be able to say if an old or a new nuclear power station built in a candidate country - and I am thinking quite specifically of Temelin here - is safe.
I have to say that, if a nuclear power station would be unable to obtain an operating licence anywhere in the European Union, then I am against it, I do not want any nuclear power stations in any candidate country which do not meet our standards, irrespective of which country has issued them.
We harmonise so much in the European Union - our common values, thank God.
We shall soon have a common currency - wonderful.
We also hear talk of standard shapes for cucumbers.
So why no minimum consensus here?
I have tried to achieve a minimum consensus in my group.
I believe that Mr Mombaur or Mr Chichester will be tabling an oral amendment tomorrow.
I call on you, if you are still here and can hear me, to vote in favour of this oral amendment.
Commissioner, it is precisely because we are surrounded by dangerous nuclear power stations that I say to you: there is no border at which the danger stops - and I am thinking here of the candidate countries, I am thinking of nuclear power stations which cannot be upgraded and I am thinking of new nuclear power stations which may be built.
It must be possible for us to say that we demand British, French or German standards.
If we cannot, then what I want to know is why we bother about the shape of cucumbers.
Mr President, Belarus commemorates the Chernobyl disaster on 25 April of each year, and tens of thousands of people take part in those commemorations.
In the West, it is a little known fact why that is, for the nuclear power station was located in Ukraine.
But upon closer inspection of the effects of the disaster, it becomes clear that Belarus, where more than 70% of the nuclear fall-out ended up, was at least as badly affected as Ukraine.
In the latter country, nearly two and a half million people were exposed to radioactivity.
Over the past ten years, the Ukrainian government has spent USD six billion to combat the effects, and this spending is set to continue for the time being.
To quote a few examples: funding is needed to repair the housing built around the exploded reactor as it is deemed unsafe.
A great deal of materials polluted by the explosion need to be stored and processed.
Ukraine' s main river, the Dnepr, is still at risk of becoming contaminated.
The European Union has addressed a number of these problems in good time and has given a great deal of aid to Ukraine - something which the Commissioner already referred to - although the effectiveness of that aid is sometimes called into question.
The situation in Belarus is possibly worse still.
About two and a half million people are still living in the contaminated areas where they often eat contaminated food.
The health situation is alarming, especially for the children.
The socio-economic situation in that country is bad anyway, which makes the people more vulnerable to disease and adverse effects than in normal circumstances.
The government in Minsk may spend a huge proportion of the government budget on the effects, but it refuses to deal with the problem openly.
Its policy is often counterproductive and screens the problem from the outside world.
The international community is involved, albeit on a small scale.
NGOs carry out their work under difficult conditions.
My admiration goes especially to the European organisations which bring thousands of children to western Europe annually for a holiday in order to enable them to recover to some extent from the effects of radiation.
But that, of course, is not enough by a long chalk.
Relations between the European Union and the undemocratic government in Belarus are strained.
We can understand that.
At the same time, it is difficult to accept that not more of an effort is being made, precisely in the interest of the people affected, who are not at all involved in government politics.
It has been said before, but I would once again like to make an urgent appeal to the Commission to free up more specific aid for Belarus.
I am not convinced by the argument that neither TACIS nor ECHO allow this.
We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who are still in need and still require direct aid.
Let us for once overstep our own political and bureaucratic boundaries.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you have explained, the issue of Chernobyl is by no means done and dusted.
After 14 years, the European Union has a responsibility to take a different course of action, as, in response to this human tragedy, the measures taken still focus largely on the energy technology aspects.
The European Commission gave in to blackmail by the Ukrainian authorities by approving the construction of two new nuclear power plants in exchange for closing down Chernobyl.
This self-seeking collusion between the political elite and the nuclear lobby rides roughshod over the total disapproval of Ukraine' s citizens and the potential that Ukraine has for renewable energy sources and energy savings.
With regard to Belarus, 23% of the territory is affected by radiation and needs to be evacuated immediately.
It is essential, therefore, that the second part of the TACIS programme be implemented in Belarus to provide medical and health support, in Belarus and within our own Member States, to the civilian population still living in the contaminated areas and particularly to children.
This moral and humanitarian duty must be accomplished with adequate resources and funding which are in line with the extent of the ecological disaster.
The autocratic and repressive regime in Belarus, which wants to play down this public health crisis as far as possible and to silence scientists such as Mr Nesterenko and Mr Bandazhevsky, can no longer be used as an alibi by the European Union and pro-nuclear lobbies to hide the reality of Chernobyl and abandon the long-suffering communities of these contaminated regions, to their fate.
It is also the responsibility of the WHO, a direct accomplice in this tragedy through an incestuous agreement concluded in 1957 with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which takes, of course, a pro-nuclear stance, and which has since become its legal censor in nuclear matters.
It is also the European Union' s responsibility to free the WHO from the control of the IAEA.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is fifteen years since the epic disaster at Chernobyl but the consequences are still being measured today.
Victims, human lives are being lost to cancer.
And this disaster did not just affect the neighbouring countries, Ukraine and Belarus, it affected countries thousands of miles away, including my own.
The question is, and I agree with previous speakers here: have we learnt our lesson from this accident, have we finally understood that human error is always there, lying in ambush waiting to strike?
Where human error combines with a nuclear reactor which is unsafe and does not meet proper safety standards, as in the present case, then of course the dangers are immense.
I say this, Commissioner, because similar reactors are still operating in Europe.
They are operating in Russia, they are operating in Lithuania, they are operating in Slovakia and four reactors are operating in our neck of the woods, close to Greece, in Kozlodoui.
I, for one, disagree with the Commission' s timetable for shutting down these reactors which, as the Commission itself says, cannot be upgraded at reasonable expense to the safety standards which a nuclear reactor should meet.
For example, what has been said about Kozlodoui?
That two reactors should be shut down in 2002, while we have yet to agree that the other two should be shut down in 2006.
Surely this is a very long time to leave dangerous reactors in operation.
And why?
Because there are financial considerations.
Well, let us deal with the financial considerations.
Financial considerations cannot take precedence over the environment and human health in general and the health of European citizens in particular.
Consequently, I say to you, as you are here, that you should be forceful, not only because some of the candidate countries do not want to keep to these dates, but also because various arguments as to how their service life can be extended are already being bandied about.
For example, I read in the papers two days ago that the official press in Kozlodoui said that it could stay in operation until 2010.
The reactors may even be sold to private individuals.
For the love of God, how can they say such things?
I therefore think that, fifteen years after Chernobyl and with what we have to do so that Chernobyl is safe and sound under its sarcophagus, we need to be sure, over and above these efforts, that we intend to put an end to these dangerous reactors in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania and Russia.
I think that, if money needs to be spent, Commissioner, we should spend it.
The financial problem is secondary.
The most important considerations are the environment and health, the public health of the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, we will probably never know the real ecological, biological, psychological and economic magnitude of the Chernobyl disaster.
As well as the deaths and the terrible illnesses in the region, 15 years on there is still a frightening legacy of radioactive contamination.
An area about the size of Britain is permanently contaminated and uninhabitable.
Much less tragic, but serious even so, in my constituency in Wales, following contamination from Chernobyl, 359 farms are still under restrictions today and thousands of sheep are restricted from movement to ensure that no animal contaminated with radioactivity enters the food chain.
There has been continuous monitoring for 15 years and the restrictions will last for another 10-15 years.
We must have sustainable energy policies.
Nuclear power is no solution.
It is not clean and it is not cheap.
In over 40 years of operation the nuclear industry has not even solved the problem of radioactive waste and, above all, it poses massive threats to human health and the environment.
Nothing illustrates that better than Chernobyl and we have to learn from it.
We may never know the full impact of the disaster but we must make every effort, as outlined in this resolution, to find out all we can and provide effective assistance to help the worst-affected areas.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for the debate.
I believe it is important that we remember the event in Chernobyl 15 years ago, and you have yourselves provided testimony to the ways in which this affects us even today and in our Member States too.
We should like to be able to debate energy policy, but I believe we should avoid that today and instead concentrate on the subjects of how we can improve nuclear safety in the applicant States and, of course, of how we are to continue to cooperate with Ukraine and Russia.
These issues also illustrate the nature and character of the environmental problems.
They acknowledge no national borders, but follow a river or prevailing wind, something for which we are still paying a high price today.
I have received a number of questions, which I shall try to answer, but I should perhaps say first of all that I hope that Parliament can take the time to deal with the communication on which the Commission decided in September of last year and which concerns the Commission' s support for improved nuclear safety in the applicant States.
In this, the Commission explains its view of how these issues must be worked with, that is to say that both short- and long-term approaches are required.
In the short term, it has been a question of getting a number of applicant States to close down the old-fashioned Chernobyl-style reactors they use.
We have tried to encourage the applicant States to submit concrete timetables for doing that.
These must then be followed up in order to ensure that they are really being implemented.
Naturally, Members of Parliament know as well as we do that we do not have competence in this area to force either the Member States or the applicant States to do anything.
We must try to work with them through a variety of agreements, through sound cooperation and also by means of support in many different forms.
We are concerned here with everything from education to financial support for upgrading safety.
I have been asked what standards are applied.
As you know, we have no special European standards, but we say that European Union Practices must be complied with.
What does that mean?
Over the years, the EU' s Member States have developed a safety standard which we should also like to see the applicant States being able to comply with.
There is now also a working party in the Council which compares those standards that exist in the applicant States with those that exist in the EU countries, identifying those shortcomings and differences that exist so that it will be possible to overcome these and upgrade security in the applicant States.
The IAEA' s standards form the basis, of course, but these are so general that they require 'practical application' .
We do, Mrs SchÃ¶rling, in fact also have agreements to close the most dangerous nuclear power stations of all - Kozloduy, Ignalina and Bohunice - and to ensure that the safety of the remaining reactors is upgraded so that we obtain an acceptable standard.
I believe that we have explained fairly well in this communication from the Commission how we view these issues, but we can perfectly well use this day and this opportunity to reflect upon the vulnerability of even the very most modern nuclear technology and nuclear power used.
We are still vulnerable, and we still have a problem with waste.
You probably know where I stand when it comes to the use of nuclear power but, even though I am critical of this, I believe that the research into safety issues must continue.
That is incredibly important, I believe.
In this area, we cannot decide over the heads of the Member States or against their will.
We must cooperate with the Member States on these issues and do all we can, because we share the same environment and are all exposed to risks if we live with unacceptable safety levels.
Above all, I agree with what one MEP pointed out, to the effect that we must remember the children and make sure we do everything in order also to help and support those children who still have to pay the price for the dreadful tragedy of Chernobyl.
Thank you for the debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for a resolution.
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.28 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Protection of euro against counterfeiting
The next item is the report (A5-0120/2001) by Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs:
I. on the Initiative by the Government of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council Decision on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting [5551/2001 - C5-0054/2001 - 2001/0804(CNS)]
II. on the Council position on a draft Council Regulation laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting [6281/2001 - C5-0084/2001 - 2000/0208(CNS)]
III. on the Council position on a draft Council Regulation extending the effects of Regulation (EC) No. .../01 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting to those Member States which have not adopted the euro as their single currency [6281/2001 - C5-0084/2001 - 2000/0208(CNS)].
Mr President, we all know that euro notes and coins are to be brought into circulation on 1 January of next year.
Twelve of the national currencies of the Member States are to disappear and be successively replaced by the new common currency.
The names of Mr Kohl and Mr Delors ought to be mentioned in this context.
It is odd that not all Member States have yet realised that the internal market cannot be fully efficient in the long term if it is fragmented in terms of a number of different national currencies.
We are all familiar with the advantages of the single currency, that is to say economic and monetary cooperation.
The Europe-wide use of the euro has already brought economic stability and a variety of other advantages. It has encouraged economic growth, increased consumption and investment and led to the creation of new jobs.
I believe that the single currency will stimulate increased mobility to the extent of leading to a completely new Europe in ten years' time.
With the euro, European integration is taking a giant step forward.
The euro will become one of the most significant and most important currencies in international trade.
In a few years' time, 300 million people will have this new national currency which will be used outside the EU as commonly as the dollar is today and with which it will be possible to make payments directly, with no need for currency conversion.
The euro is already an international reserve and transaction currency and will in future be so to a much greater extent.
The importance and significance which the euro will acquire as an international currency will, unfortunately, also mean that it will become attractive to organised counterfeiting organisations.
There is evermore sophisticated equipment available for such activity, which means that counterfeiting is nowadays much less complex than it used to be.
Against that background, it is important to have comprehensive and effective protection against counterfeiting in place in good time before the euro comes into circulation.
There will be huge scope for disseminating the euro, extending beyond all frontiers, both within the European Union and between the EU and the outside world.
Hence, the arrangements for protecting the euro against counterfeiting must take this new dimension into account and also be equipped with a legal framework involving all the EU Member States, institutions and bodies and also relevant international organisations.
The three legislative proposals for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting with which this report is concerned are mutually complementary.
Unfortunately, they have their legal bases in two different pillars, the first and the third.
In the long run, it would be desirable if measures based upon Article 29 of the EU Treaty could be included in Title IV of the EC Treaty so that appropriate decisions for the settlement of issues for which other kinds of measures are unsuitable could be adopted in a unitary fashion.
The first proposal is an Initiative by the Government of the French Republic and is based on Title VI of the EC Treaty.
It is concerned, then, with protection under criminal law and with Europol units having to receive the information and intelligence they need in order to perform their tasks.
The amendments are largely aimed at incorporating wordings that have been forgotten about and left out, as well as at correcting a number of unclear terminological and other points.
The second legislative proposal, which in a way is more interesting, contains the Council' s guidelines on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and is based on Article 123(4) of the EC Treaty.
This legal basis enables the scope of the Regulation to be extended only to those Member States which have adopted the euro as a single currency.
The proposal is based on the establishment of a system for the exchange of information and for cooperation and mutual assistance.
My most important amendments are about the necessity of having a Counterfeiting Analysis Centre at EU level and a national centre in each Member State.
The advisability of setting up a permanent European Technical and Scientific Centre for the analysis and the classification of counterfeit coins is also referred to and, especially, the need for entities engaged in the daily handling of notes and coins for their clients to carry out suitable checks on the authenticity of these.
Otherwise, it is citizens who are affected, and the latter are completely unprotected when they receive counterfeit coins and notes. There is no way in which they can offset such a loss anywhere else.
How can citizens be expected to carry detection equipment the same size as a large PC around with them?
Even if someone is prepared to pay for the equipment - which does not cost a great amount, but costs approximately the same as a PC - it is not practically possible.
I therefore think it is much more appropriate for notes and coins to be analysed before they leave the exchange entity.
This is a position which Parliament definitely ought to adopt in order to protect people.
The third legislative proposal is based on Article 308 of the EC Treaty and is aimed at taking care of those Member States which have not adopted the single currency, namely Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden.
In fact, they too must of course be covered by the security regulation we are now developing. Otherwise, this will not work.
I am convinced that people in these countries realise that they too must participate in these decisions.
They must also realise, however, that, if they are not members of the club, they cannot participate in the decisions on the same conditions as the members.
However, those who adopt the euro can be party to decisions on the same conditions as other members.
Those who do not adopt the euro do not, unfortunately, have the same influence.
The decision as to whether or not to adopt the euro is one requiring strength, and on this point I would call upon my own country, Sweden, to try to summon up the strength to take this decision as quickly as possible.
It is about nothing other than political leadership.
For example, we can draw a comparison with France which, at the time of approving the Maastricht Treaty, approved the latter with a smaller majority than Sweden.
In spite of this, France nonetheless managed to take the decision it did.
The fact that Sweden, in contrast, did not is something I deeply regret.
I want to conclude by stating that the proposals in the Council' s guidelines are aimed at guaranteeing effective protection of the euro, and I therefore welcome the proposal in its entirety.
Thank you, Mr President.
The reason that I am speaking is purely to support and highlight, if possible, essential elements expressed by the rapporteur of this report, our colleague Charlotte CederschiÃ¶ld, whom I congratulate for her rigorous and excellent work.
I would like to start by pointing out what a revolution it is going to be when the euro appears on 1 January of next year.
The euro is going to be the ultimate symbol of European identity, and along with the yen and the dollar it will be one of the guiding currencies that will be used not only in Europe but also, as our colleague said, on a global scale.
It will be the cornerstone on which to build a political union.
Despite all this, as the euro takes the form of a note or coin, there is obviously the very real risk that there will be attempts to counterfeit it, and as a result, prevention policies are essential.
With this objective in mind, we need to work thoroughly on the need to train those who will be working daily with the currency, through courses and other measures, especially banks and bureaux de change, so that they are familiarised with the euro.
They are going to be the key players in detecting counterfeit currency.
Therefore, and given that the legislative proposals that we are examining today aim to regulate this matter, it is essential both that we have an effective system of police and customs cooperation and that we establish a global information system that includes identifying counterfeit notes, collecting them and sending them to centres that study the method of counterfeiting, the paper used, the ink, the amount counterfeited, etc.
Finally, I would also like to emphasise the importance of effective criminal protection in order to remove any trace of counterfeiting.
As I do not wish to dwell on fundamental issues that have already been discussed by Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, such as the inconvenience and confusion caused by having legal instruments that are dependent on different pillars in order to defend the same objective, which is combating the counterfeiting of the euro- I am going to focus on two or three matters that I feel are important.
One is the reference made by Amendment No 23, unlike the Regulation, which does not allude to it at all, to a counterfeit currency database.
I think that this is something that would increase the efficiency and accuracy of the battle against counterfeiting.
With regard to the status of the European Technical and Scientific Centre, which as established in Article 5 of the proposal for a regulation, will channel the fight against the counterfeiting of coins, I would like to stress the need to protect its independence from the Paris Mint from the start, as set out in Amendments Nos 20 and 26.
The functional link of this body should be solely with the European institutions and under no circumstances with a national institution.
Finally, Amendment No 27 adds to the original text of the Regulation the idea that I expressed at the start of my speech, which is the key role that those who work with money should play in the battle against counterfeiting of the euro.
It is important that they be obliged not only to withdraw from circulation any notes and coins whose authenticity is questionable, but also to check for authenticity themselves.
We are, of course, aware of the suspicions that this requirement could give rise to, as it would require considerable investment in tools, machines and items to ensure that the money is legal, but it is essential from the point of view of protecting citizens.
It is also a guarantee that the money distributed by these bodies will be authentic.
I would like to start by congratulating Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld on her excellent report and the recommendations contained therein.
Of course the circulation of the euro will have both positive and negative impacts.
The positive is that it will be a physical recognition of the Union moving together closely when it actually benefits individual Member States.
The negative aspect of course is that a new currency is open to abuse and to undermining by the expert counterfeiters that we have already heard of.
The euro is of enormous importance in the world markets, and therefore it is vital that we move to take protective measures to prevent counterfeiting.
I am pleased that Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld makes such recommendations in her report and I personally and my group support these.
It is worth noting, on the obligation to make checks at banks and bureaux de change, that she encourages close cooperation between Member States, the European Central Bank, national central banks, Europol and, when established, Eurojust.
Also, she makes important reference to previous decisions on increasing criminal penalties, and calls for the harmonising of criminal charges and penalties.
It is absolutely essential that we leave no hiding-place for criminals, who can move very quickly with their information and their expertise from one Member State to another.
It is also essential to pool and centralise information, and expert analysis when such counterfeiting comes to light.
Technical assistance to facilitate the coordination of investigations is also needed if we are to track down these criminals across the Member States.
Equally, I applaud her recommendations to improve and facilitate cooperation between investigative and prosecuting bodies of the Member States, and that every Member State should recognise the principle of previous convictions.
Whether in the EURO zone or not, I maintain that every citizen within the European Union has much to gain from a stable currency and a currency that can withstand the threats from the counterfeiters.
Therefore I am extremely pleased to congratulate Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld on her report and the recommendations contained therein.
Mr President, in order to protect the euro against counterfeiting, we are looking this evening at a series of technical measures which, however interesting they may be, will not solve the problem.
In fact, they even dispose of a crucial problem, which is of a political nature, and which the European Parliament does not seem willing to resolve.
I shall therefore take it upon myself to do so.
Once the euro has actually been introduced into circulation, there will be a high risk of counterfeiting, particularly because of the decision that was taken to launch from scratch an entirely new currency which will cause all citizens to lose their points of reference.
It may have been designed to do exactly that.
Once citizens have lost their points of reference, there is a high risk that they will accept counterfeit euros, believing that they are the real thing.
The consequences of this confusion will be made worse by the high face value of some notes, of EUR 100, 200 and 500.
Yet, who is going to pay the price for this huge risk?
The most vulnerable, the most fragile, those who are least well-informed, small businesses, micro-businesses who may find themselves bearing the cost of worthless, forged notes that they have accepted by mistake.
This situation is unacceptable - all the more so because it is the same people who are being asked to bear the often very substantial costs of changing over to the euro and who will receive absolutely no financial compensation.
It is, therefore, unacceptable that we today continue to pretend that these costs do not exist and to implicitly accept that they are to be borne by the most vulnerable people.
We are asking the national and European authorities not to shirk their responsibilities.
We are asking them to give citizens a guarantee that they will be reimbursed if they accept a forged note by mistake, at least during a transitional period.
Otherwise, then, we should provide small businesses with free detectors for forged banknotes.
Some will say to me that we do not have the money to do that.
I shall reply that we should have thought of this before.
We must now shoulder the responsibility, in other words, to postpone the changeover to coins and notes until next January - would it matter after everything we have been through? This would, in any case, be desirable for several other reasons.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over a year ago, on 16 February, the European Parliament considered the problem of counterfeiting of the euro, at the time within the context of a common penal framework.
It was our fellow Member, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, with her skill and rigour, who drafted the report then and opened our debate on the matter.
She said that we cannot allow counterfeiting to undermine our single currency.
This statement is still valid one year later and sums up the fundamental issue: the security of our currency.
We have all spoken here of the euro' s importance for our Union, of its economic importance as a complement to the establishment of a genuine economic area without internal borders, of its importance as a mechanism that has contributed to budgetary discipline and to the transparency of the Member States' public accounts and also of its political value as a symbol of the European integration that we are developing, taking forwards and consolidating on a daily basis.
Therefore, for all of these reasons, the security of our currency is extremely important.
In addition, we know that the currency' s security is also tied up with its stability and its exchange rate, but the approach we are considering today is that of protection against counterfeiting.
If things do not go well, however, with the other approach, there is all the more reason now not to neglect this fight and to increase our precautions.
In her report, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld quite rightly emphasises the worldwide importance of the new currency and the undeniable fact that it whets criminal appetites. She states that "the euro will be in open competition with the dollar for the title of the world' s most counterfeited currency" .
I am sure that Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld will agree with me when I say that this is not the competition against the dollar that we wish to win.
We are aware that the system will be particularly vulnerable during the transitional period, in which the new European currency and the old currencies will be coexisting.
Lack of understanding, unfamiliarity and the obligation on the banks to promote currency exchange will encourage the counterfeiting of both the euro and national currencies.
We must also fight against swindling and confidence tricks. We must provide more and better information, especially in my country, Portugal, where surveys show disturbingly high percentages of people not understanding the euro.
We have seen examples of the educational contribution made by Catholic priests, particularly in the regions: the contribution of the Church and of the local and regional press must be encouraged and supported.
I also agree with the approach adopted by the Commission in its communication, and with the four aspects that have been identified: training, an information system - cooperation, specifically with Europol, OLAF and the European Central Bank - and protection under criminal law.
In conclusion, I shall say once again that I do not share the reservations about the coins having national faces. I think that the increased risk will be compensated for by a greater sense of belonging and of identification, and will also provide a political response to those who are always quick to criticise excessive standardisation.
Congratulations, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld!
I apologise to Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld for mistiming my arrival and arriving after much of the debate.
We had an opportunity in the committee for me to have an exchange of views with Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld about her report.
I would like to congratulate her on the overall thrust of the report.
My concerns are twofold, however.
First, I am concerned about the size of the larger notes, particularly the five hundred euro note that is going to be issued, which is far larger than the largest note in common use in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in Japan.
It obviously makes it attractive for counterfeiters, if they are going to counterfeit notes, to counterfeit large denomination notes, rather than smaller denomination notes and I am slightly concerned that this very large note will, if you want, make the euro the counterfeiter's currency of choice.
Secondly, at the same time, of course, it will enable those people engaged in money laundering - I know this is not a report on money laundering, but it is a connected issue - to also move their ill-gotten gains around fairly easily and fairly simply.
The amount of money that can be put into a small suitcase will be roughly ten times larger than it would have been if we had restricted the currency to smaller notes.
There is a threat and an opportunity with the introduction of the euro.
Firstly the threat is the counterfeiting and clearly, if that happens, it will drive people away from the euro, will have dire consequences for its use around the world if people are badly stung by that, but secondly, we have an opportunity at this period of time to actually catch people engaged in money laundering, as they make the change.
We do not have, or we do not apparently have in place, any mechanism across the European Union to try and take advantage of that opportunity, or to try and deter at the point of introduction of the euro the threat of counterfeiting.
It is all very well having something up and running later, but if I was organised crime, the time which I would be trying to engage in counterfeiting on a large scale would be around the period of introduction of the euro when you are going to have four hundred million people in the European Union and billions of people around the world who have never been familiar with the notes themselves.
So I think that there is a threat there and I hope that the Commission and the European Central Bank, although it is probably too late to consider whether to issue a five hundred euro note, will actually consider whether they should issue it at the beginning of the process when there are so many dangers attached to it.
Mr President, honourable Members, rapporteur, 1 January 2002 will indeed be an historic date, marking as it does the physical introduction of the euro for 300 million citizens in the European Union.
Obviously, numerous preparations still need to be made and it has been mentioned, not for the first time, that the European Parliament is tackling this.
The European Parliament has dealt with the preparations and the necessary steps right from the start.
This report deals with the Commission initiative and the French initiative on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.
I should like, on the Commission' s behalf, to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work and to report that the Commission will be happy to include any addenda proposed by the European Parliament.
I should also like to stress that the regulation is the pivotal and central point of a comprehensive procedure to protect the euro against counterfeiting.
I should like to remind you that the Commission has submitted various proposals since its communication in July 1998.
The regulation before us stipulates in particular - I do not intend to go through the whole thing, I just want to mention a few points - that exchanges of information on any counterfeit euro notes and coins discovered will be centralised and regulated.
Collaboration and mutual assistance between the various players involved at Member State level and the institutions and bodies at European and international level is clearly regulated, as are collaboration with third countries and the obligations incumbent upon credit institutions.
I should like at this point to highlight once again the importance of Article 6 of the regulation, namely the obligation to withdraw from circulation any banknotes which have been identified as counterfeit or which need to be tested and to pass them to the appropriate agencies.
It is, of course, particularly important, in the light of the time frame which we are discussing, that the regulation be adopted as quickly as possible and I hope that it will be adopted before the end of the Swedish Presidency, because preparations need to be made as quickly as possible.
This is the credo which the Commission is passing on to small- and medium-sized enterprises and consumers.
Any preparations which can be completed today will mean less worry and stress tomorrow and will make the whole project that much safer.
The Commission intends to take an active part in the subsequent implementation of the regulation.
This applies in particular to Article 7 dealing with collaboration between the Member States, the Commission and the European Central Bank and with Interpol.
An advisory committee has been set up to help the Commission here.
I should like to remind you that this regulation is not the only important measure to protect the euro against counterfeiting.
Various additional instruments have already been adopted or are currently being prepared.
For example, a framework resolution relating to criminal law was adopted on 29 May.
I should also like to mention another measure which is currently being prepared and which the Commission will adopt in a few weeks' time, namely a multiannual programme to provide training, technical assistance and exchanges for officials in order to protect the euro against counterfeiting.
The delightfully named PERIKLES programme will also be of considerable importance.
The euro is indeed an historic milestone on the path towards integration and it offers huge potential for further economic development.
Of course we always highlight the opportunities here but we do not underestimate the risks attached to the date set for the physical introduction of the euro.
We are not underestimating the problems, we are tackling them.
I should like to thank the European Parliament for its support; it just goes to show that we are all working to make this project a huge success.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Illegal substances - Synthetic drugs
Mr President, we are now to deal with the issue of synthetic drugs.
Europe is a world leader in the manufacture of synthetic drugs.
That is not a fact to be too proud of.
Large quantities of LSD, amphetamines, ecstasy and other synthetic drugs are produced every day in Europe, either for domestic consumption or for export to third countries.
This large-scale and often organised production is a blot on Europe' s copybook and undermines our credibility in the international struggle against organised crime.
This initiative against synthetic drugs ought therefore to be warmly welcomed.
The proposal is based upon a highly developed method of analysis applied by certain laboratories.
Synthetic drugs have certain features in common because of the process and methods by which they are produced. Links can therefore be made between synthetic drugs confiscated on different occasions in different places.
Such information enables the police more easily to identify illegal centres or networks manufacturing drugs.
The method provides the police and judiciary with an excellent tool for isolating narcotics factories.
The first decision is about setting up the system of special forensic profiling analysis.
The Member States are obliged to send samples of certain drugs that have been confiscated to particular laboratories.
At present, such laboratories unfortunately exist only in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands.
The idea is that, as soon as a laboratory in a Member State has the required competence, this laboratory will become part of the network.
In that way, the relevant skills will be extended throughout the European Union.
The second decision concerns the actual transmission of samples of controlled narcotic substances.
The Member States are obliged to allow these to pass through their territory.
They must be sent in a way that guarantees the greatest possible security so as to ensure that the transported samples are not misused.
It should also be emphasised that we are talking in terms of milligrams, that is to say extremely small quantities which can scarcely be misused because they are so incredibly small.
It must be emphasised that the initiative affects only the fight against the large-scale organised production of synthetic drugs, something that is prohibited throughout the EU. It therefore has nothing at all to do with the sensitive debate about what should be readily available on the street, for personal use etc.
The present debate has nothing at all to do with that. Instead, we are concerned here with the organised production of synthetic drugs.
It must also be underlined that the system proposed is not definitive.
It is not perfect in every respect. I know that.
It would be preferable if every country had its own laboratory for forensic profiling analysis but, because the technique has so far only been developed in a small number of countries, that is not the case as matters stand.
At the same time, it would nonetheless be a great pity not to make use of the opportunity of getting our hands on those production units that exist within the European Union.
Regarding the actual transmission system, I take the point also touched upon by certain countries such as France and, especially, Spain, to the effect that it would be good if these samples could be transmitted electronically.
I completely share that view.
The report also states that the method of transport must be continually reviewed.
In my opinion, it would be completely wrong, however, to use such arguments to prevent the system from being introduced right now.
This Parliament will certainly have an extremely important role to play when it comes to pushing the issue of electronic transmission, but I really do hope that Spain will not use this as an argument for stopping the transmissions.
That would be deeply regrettable.
Fortunately, the committee realised this and adopted the report unanimously.
I am sorry that there are some countries in the Council which have not realised that it is just as well to get started now, for they are in fact slowing down the fight against crime.
As I see it, it is downright irresponsible to weaken the fight against organised crime, just because we do not have the perfect system.
It is the same argument we heard just now when we discussed transparency and public access to documents and when Sweden offered Europe a compromise.
There is now every reason for us to join together in offering just such a compromise.
I hope that both Parliament and the Council will support this initiative, and I want to thank young Nils HÃ€nninger at the Ministry of Justice in Sweden who has driven this idea forward.
I also want to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on this decision, which may well be the first binding decision in the area of drugs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen still present, looking at the Chamber, one might well imagine that drugs pose no problem to Europe and no problem whatsoever to its young people.
But, unfortunately, they are a problem, and not just any problem; the truth is they are the problem.
The huge increase in the use of drugs is threatening to destroy part of today' s generation and hence part of our society, while organised crime is threatening to undermine it.
Drugs help a mere handful of people make a great deal of money in the organised crime sector; but they destroy countless lives and existences.
I can back up what I have just said with a few figures provided by Europol and the Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon.
It is estimated that some 8,000 tonnes of cannabis and derivatives, 350 tonnes of cocaine, 60 tonnes of heroin and at least 50 million ecstasy tablets reach the European market every year.
These are the latest figures available.
And all of these drugs are taken, by more and more youngsters.
If I tell you that investigations have proven that some 20% of young people have already used cannabis at least once and that an estimated 5 million young people take synthetic drugs, it should be enough to start alarm bells ringing.
The producers and traffickers who deal in these drugs are part of organised crime.
They ply their trade at the expense of young people, which is why we must do everything we can to combat this crime - which, as I said, is part of organised crime - in the Union and internationally with representatives from other countries in the world which are equally affected.
I therefore welcome the Swedish initiative because it takes a step forward here.
It is another piece in the puzzle of instruments which we need if we are to be able to make any headway.
The first initiative on the transmission of drugs for the purpose of analysis and testing is designed to avoid abuse as the result of larger consignments and is a perfect instrument in the fight against drugs.
Secondly, I think it is most important that analyses be used to check the origin of synthetic drugs.
Both instruments are essential in the fight against drugs and organised crime.
What we need to do is to extend the network of suitably standardised, quality laboratories.
However, this alone would still be too little; we must have cooperation with Europol, which is working on the same agenda and keeps a list of synthetic drugs and similar products used for ecstasy and other amphetamines which are available on the market.
This means that there will be no loose cannon or parallel work and that work will be carried out in cooperation with Europol.
The third point which I think is extremely important is that, although the European Union is now an export market for synthetic drugs and candidate countries are buying from it, having become transit countries and countries of destination, we need to make all the instruments at our disposal immediately available to the candidate countries so that we can create a larger area of security, which is our goal.
The objective, and I know that it is an ambitious objective, is to achieve a drugs-free society.
It will be no easy task but these measures certainly take us a step closer to this objective.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first point is that drugs only harm people who abuse them and that drugs taken in moderation, such as alcohol and tobacco, can also be seen as a source of enjoyment.
Drugs cause harm when they are abused.
However, I see this rather as a social problem, with drugs acting more as a catalyst, which is why I think that fighting the drugs is not really doing anyone a service.
That is why the best solution is to allow people to decide the quantity of drugs which they want or do not want to take for themselves.
I therefore think that this initiative will not be much help.
In the final analysis, it is just more repression, more powers for Europol, which does very little to help us live our lives as we so choose.
There is an alternative to this proposal in the form of drug checking.
Various highly successful drug checking projects have been carried out in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Vienna and Germany.
The European Drugs Monitoring Centre in Portugal has given drug checking a very good report and it continues to be active in this area.
That is why I think that we should not agree to this repressive measure.
In all events, we the Greens shall not do so; instead we shall back the right of the people who wish to consume these substances to decide for themselves.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the fight against the trade in illegal substances and the drugs trade, in particular, an efficient system would not go amiss which would enable us to analyse the trade in the products within the Union in a coordinated manner and to chart the networks.
But that is exactly where the problem lies.
Setting up laboratories presupposes that the criteria are sufficiently clear and the procedures transparent.
However, it appears that there are many unanswered questions surrounding the method, the results of which are said to lead to different validations in different countries.
The Swedish proposals seem to want to hide the fact that Sweden itself needs a few years yet in order to fully develop its own capacities, but it wants to get the ball rolling at this stage nevertheless.
At the moment, we are still waiting for the recommendation of the experts from most central laboratories, but we will not receive it before the end of the Swedish Presidency.
Not everyone in my group will agree with me that this is potentially a sound proposal and that, in time, such a set of instruments could be really useful, whichever way the drugs issue is addressed in future.
However, it is extremely regrettable that the diligence which Sweden has displayed in this matter is particularly ahead of its time.
Mr President, Members of Parliament, the Commission welcomes Parliament's proposed resolution and supports the objectives of these two Swedish initiatives establishing a system of special forensic profiling analysis of synthetic drugs and on the transmission of samples of illegal narcotic substances.
The Commission has been working in this area for some time.
In particular it has supported research into the development of a harmonised method for the profiling of amphetamines.
This research project is due to be completed in February 2002 and we hope that its results will be taken into account in future work in this area.
The objective of the Swedish initiatives is in line with point 4.1.1.4 of the European Union action plan on drugs 2000-2004 which was endorsed at the Feira European Council of June 2000 and so represents a priority for the European Union in the fight against drugs.
The Commission is also working actively on the implementation of the EU action plan on drugs.
In the coming weeks, we intend to publish two important texts: first, the Commission will present a communication to Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the action plan, and secondly the Commission will bring forward proposals for a framework decision establishing minimum rules on drug trafficking.
The issue of synthetic drugs, as mentioned by several Members, is of particular importance at the moment, both for the European Union and internationally.
The Commission intends to launch this year a review of the joint action on new synthetic drugs of June 1997, which allows new synthetic drugs to be controlled throughout the European Union and to be made subject to criminal penalties.
The Commission recently brought forward proposals to monitor informally the non-controlled chemical precursors of synthetic drugs and this is currently being considered by the Council and Parliament.
We have also presented a resolution to the Commission on narcotic drugs in March 2001 addressing the problem of the diversion of precursors for synthetic drugs and this proposal attracted wide support.
We have also been active in a meeting in December 2000 on synthetic drugs organised by Japan within the G8 framework.
All these elements show how important this debate is at world scale.
Therefore, I would like to congratulate Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld for her excellent report and join her in my appeal to pass over what I consider minor difficulties in order to have a quick approval of these two Swedish initiatives by the Council.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0118/2001), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [14780/1/2000 - C5-0048/2001 - 1998/0323(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Roth-Behrendt).
We have two reports concerning the treatment and transport of animals: that will be a very familiar subject for the Commissioner.
I would like to say at the outset - and I am sure that the Chairman of the Committee will say the same - how much we regret the absence of Dagmar Roth-Behrendt tonight.
She is one of the most energetic, enterprising and intelligent members of the committee.
She is the coordinator for our group on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection Committee and, in her general enthusiasm, she is like a one-woman Congress of Berlin.
She is in Berlin tonight and is to have an operation in the morning.
I am sure the whole House, even at this late hour, would join with me in wishing Dagmar well, and believing that she will recover with her customary vigour in the very near future.
Dagmar Roth-Behrendt intended to move one of the two amendments tonight.
I would like to say briefly why I and my group now believe that it would be for the better passage of this directive if it goes through unamended.
That would mean, therefore, that we would wish to vote against both Amendments No 1 and No 2: Amendment No 1 for the very simple reason that it smacks of a desire to scuttle back into a form of neo-protectionism, but certainly over-regulation, of animal imports, which is a desirable but unnecessary consequence of the many scares we have had in recent years.
In my country we are particularly aware of that, but we believe that the OIE code covers trade in live animals and will protect countries which do not have BSE from introduction of the disease.
Additional measures against imports are not justifiable on health grounds and I expect that the Commission will say the same thing.
Even more briefly, on Amendment No 2, which did indeed come in my name: at that stage, we tabled this because we believed that if there was to be a vote through this Parliament for tests at twenty-four months in all the Member States quasi-imposed upon them by the Commission, this needed to be amended with a provision that those Member States which already have other forms of testing - or in the case of the United Kingdom, the over thirty-month cow - should not have to go through that procedure.
Given that the principal amendment fell, it seems to me now that the second amendment should fall also.
So, from the point of view of my group, we are not supporting any amendments.
My apologies for the inability of the shadow rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, to be with us this evening.
At short notice, I have agreed to try and say a few words on his behalf in relation to this most important topic.
First of all, I would like to commend all those involved to date from the Commission up through the Council and indeed, back to us, but particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for the personal commitment she has given to this most important issue.
A year ago, I spoke in Parliament in relation to this particular matter and my views were clearly laid out.
I think it was 16 May last year, the time of the first reading.
Not a lot has happened since in one sense.
In another sense, both politically and scientifically, a huge amount has happened in the whole area of TSE, more particularly if you like, in relation to BSE.
A year ago, it was the UK, Ireland and one or two other isolated outbreaks of BSE that was concentrating the minds, particularly the epidemic that had been experienced by the UK for some time.
Since then, as you know, we have had Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Italy and Austria.
But we must look at the numbers involved relative to the cattle population in each country to make sense, rather than just to panic the consumer.
It has been very hard to have a reasonable rational debate on the impact of an outbreak of BSE, be it 3, 4 or several hundred cases at a time.
It must be taken relative to the cattle population in each country.
Only this week we hear of reports of outbreaks among the elk in the Colorado regions of the US and of new variant CJD outbreak among young men, young hunters - not the normal age group associated with CJD as we have over the years understood it to be.
There has also been increased rigour in the reporting of BSE and increased surveillance generally with new testing regimes.
This is not an indication that the disease is spreading, because we are get increased numbers.
It means we are being more effective and more efficient in terms of looking for the disease in the various countries.
That must be spelled out also so that we do not panic the consumer into thinking that the disease is continuing to spread.
It is not.
BSE is a disease of older cows, primarily older dairy cows.
It has a much higher incidence among the dairy herds, than the suckler herds, probably because the dairy men could afford more concentrates traditionally over the years.
In most countries the milk gave a higher economic return than, for example, breeding beef - certainly that was the experience in Ireland and the UK.
But at the moment the high risk is with the dairy herd, the six and seven year-old cows and that is why, since I spoke last year, we have had the destruct scheme that was announced on 13 December 2000, if I recall correctly, that will be in place until the end of this year.
My one big criticism of the destruct scheme is that it did not particularly insist that Member States with a problem targeted the older cow, where the real risk cohort still remained.
In fact, this scheme was used to underpin the market and the price of cattle, rather than primarily to take out the disease in the older cow.
I do not mind underpinning the market.
That could be part of it.
But it should be secondary to removing the disease and that was not the case and I criticise that particular scheme in that respect.
We have also learned a lot in the last year in relation to new variant CJD and that patients with a distinct genetic makeup are prone to it, not the entire population.
We need to say more about that so the public understands the relative impact that it may or may not have.
It is genetic, its infectious, its degenerative, but there are very, very few cases, given, for example, the number of BSE cases in the UK in the cattle herd.
We have been eating scrapie-infected sheep for over two hundred years, with no ill effect, and that is because the structure of the shape of the prion, the non-infectious protein, in the sheep, is not compatible to that in the human brain, unlike the rendered cattle or beef prion, that replaces the protein necessary in our brains.
Again, we have not been telling the story as it is.
Yes, I agree with an awful lot has been done and we need what is proposed before us here today, but I would rather we use the OIE or WTO standard, so that all countries could agree on the classification, so that what we do in Europe would not be considered a trade barrier by the rest of the world with whom we must trade our meat products and live animals.
That is my one criticism still that, in this respect, we want to go it alone in Europe, rather than operate a worldwide basis in relation to this.
Congratulations to all concerned.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Roth-Behrendt has done an extremely good job over a long period when it comes to combating BSE, or TSE.
We have now finally reached the point at which we have perhaps obtained some control over, and put an end to, the chains of infection which we know exist in this connection.
I should like to take this opportunity to ask us to think in the longer term.
Unfortunately, human beings still do not know why, where and when the prion becomes 'mad' or when this prion-caused disease occurs and for what reason.
The situation requires a certain humility on our part.
Right now, another discussion concerning animal by-products is being conducted, and it now looks as though a new round of the debate will be getting under way.
We tried to make cows, which are vegetarian, into omnivores, and that gave us BSE.
Right now, we are at a point at which I suspect that, out of fear, panic or for other reasons - political populism, perhaps - we shall try to make the pig into a vegetarian.
It would also be a good idea if we were to give a little consideration to our own history.
Our forefathers knew perfectly well that animals that had died of natural causes should not be eaten.
It is in modern times that we have left nature so far behind that we have begun to embark upon such experiments.
I should like us calmly and quietly to show a bit of humility in the face of the food disasters which have hit us.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we should do, this evening especially, is to enable the remarkable report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to be implemented as quickly as possible, in other words, to enable the measures to take effect from July.
On the basis of scientific knowledge, which is increasing every day, I do believe that the two amendments that have been proposed to us are ambiguous and are more likely to slow down the implementation of these measures than to have a positive impact.
My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, could conceivably support the first amendment, because classifying countries according to the number of suspected cases is a good approach and because the most crucial task is, above all, to monitor the infectious disease.
