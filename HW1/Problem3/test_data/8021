What is going on in Poland is a departure from the observance of the Copenhagen criteria and from the core principles of this European Union, and so we have to make it clear at European level that this is unacceptable and that changes must be made without delay.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to draw the attention of the House to recent and repeated manifestations of intolerance in my home country, Poland, which frequently take the form of incitements to violence against people on the basis of their sexual orientation.
I should also like to alert the House to the state authoritiesâ failure to respond appropriately to these and other displays of homophobia.
Examples include the banning of Equality Marches in Warsaw and PoznaÅ, and the fact that the measures provided for in Polish law have not been taken against groups inciting others to intolerance and to violence against people who promote equal rights for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation.
We are faced with the authoritiesâ acceptance of what amounts to political thuggery directed at the gay, lesbian and bisexual communities.
On 13Â JanuaryÂ 2006, a court in ElblÄg opened proceedings against RobertÂ BiedroÅ, the head of the Campaign against Homophobia.
The public prosecutorâs office has charged MrÂ BiedroÅ with insulting Catholics, even though he has stressed that he never intended to insult Catholicism or to put it on a par with fascism.
It is worth emphasising that the same public prosecutorâs office refused to institute proceedings following the insulting references to homosexuals contained in an article in the publication , in which it was stated that âhomosexuality is a disease and a threat to the family.
Â Â  Mr President, homophobia is not only a big problem in some Member States, but also in the rest of Europe too.
I am therefore pleased that my proposal for the monitoring of hate crimes against homosexuals and lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals, has been included in the joint resolution against homophobia in Europe.
This is new and I am pleased that Parliament wishes to support this fresh initiative.
I should now like to hear from the Commissioner how the Commission intends to carry out this monitoring in practice.
We gain our knowledge through measuring, and this is certainly also true of the extent of violence and hostility on the basis of sexual orientation or in respect of transsexuals.
I think that too little attention is being paid to transsexuals.
Unfortunately, transsexuals still face exclusion, violence and lack of understanding in all EU Member States on a regular basis.
The European Union still does far too little to protect the human rights of homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals.
The European Union has the opportunity of flexing its muscle, and it is therefore high time it did.
You either protect human rights or you do not.
The time has come to translate this fine theory into practice and use the means which the EU has at its disposal, such as suspending a Member Stateâs right to vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I just wish to add a few brief words at this point in the debate, the length and depth of which has shown that, regrettably, homophobia is still a serious and current problem throughout Europe.
Your words, therefore, Commissioner Frattini, have not been very convincing, given their coldness and their lack of a full and proactive commitment to combating this scourge.
We need much more vigorous action on the part of the Commission and on the part of the Member States, the latter led by the Commission.
Homophobia is there, in customs and traditions, in language, everywhere.
Not just in the countries in which the incidents that have led to this debate have taken place, such as Poland, but also in countries such as my own, Spain, where much progress has been made on this issue, but in whose society, authorities and certain professions this homophobic attitude still exists, and we must continue actively to fight it.
I agree with the words of many fellow Members, in particular the very moving words of Michael Cashman.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as Martin Luther King said when launching the campaign for African-Americansâ rights, either we achieve freedom together or not at all.
What he meant was that there are no black peopleâs rights or white peopleâs rights: there are just human rights.
Fighting homophobia does not mean showing understanding towards a specific group in the population: first and foremost, it means upholding human rights.
I am frightened by the arrogance of those who deny homosexuals the chance to give blood; I am frightened by the discriminatory campaigns of those who are unable to talk about high-risk behaviour yet still allude to high-risk individuals in the fight against AIDS; or those who ban people from driving just because they are gay.
I cannot silently accept the attitude of a Commission that behaves like Pontius Pilate, in that it does not try to enforce a directive that already exists against discrimination; a Commission that ought to start infringement proceedings against countries that do not respect peopleâs freedom to choose their sexual orientation â that happens in Italy, Poland and a number of other countries.
This is not an issue that just affects a particular group of people, but one that involves the dignity of the whole European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all those who have spoken.
However, I feel obliged to repeat certain information in greater detail, because some speakers have clearly shown â and I say this with the same frankness that you have shown towards me â that they are not familiar with what the Commission is doing.
I must emphasise â and I do not believe there can be any doubt about it â that we are talking about homophobia, which is a violation of human rights, and that is the only point on which I agree with MrÂ Agnoletto.
Homophobia is not about protecting certain categories of people, but it is essentially an issue about absolute rights, which can never be interpreted otherwise.
I should, however, like to clarify a few points.
Some of you â MrsÂ Bozkurt was the last â asked whether or not we would guarantee that the status of homosexual protection and the fight against homophobia in the Member States would be monitored.
I can assure you, MrsÂ Bozkurt, not only that such monitoring will be guaranteed but that it has already been done!
You should be aware of the report drawn up a few weeks ago by an independent specialist group â which I have of course made available to Parliament â which illustrates what kind of behaviour in each country runs counter to our common desire to fight discrimination.
That report has been officially passed on to Parliament, and it is obvious that the only reason why I â and no one else â decided to have it prepared on a country-by-country basis was to provide you and us with the information we need to be able to form a judgment.
That monitoring, MrsÂ Bozkurt, will continue: any actions that run counter to this guiding spirit will be exposed in public.
Governments too, which are required to take the first step and to report what their national, and not just European, rules are on freedom of assembly, for instance, may draw all the necessary conclusions if they read the relevant documents.
Transparent information is indeed a priority.
Other speakers mentioned a promise by President Barroso to adopt a horizontal directive â that was the term used â on the strengthening of and respect for rights in the area of non-discrimination.
That too has been done, ladies and gentlemen!
In 2005 the Commission adopted a formal communication entitled âNon-discrimination and equal opportunities for allâ, which clearly indicates what is expected as regards guarantees of greater protection of equal rights.
In that communication to the European Parliament, however, we were duty-bound to point out what everyone knows, which is that when the Commission puts forward a proposal based on Article 13, that proposal must, by law â according to the Treaties and not according to our interpretation â be adopted unanimously by the Council.
There is, however, no unanimity within the Council as yet, although I hope there will be.
In any case, the 2005 communication very clearly states our intention to harmonise the field of legal protection against all kinds of discrimination, including that based on sexual orientation, which is what some of you claim we have not yet done, ladies and gentlemen.
I shall now turn to another subject, which concerns the powers of the European Commission.
I am quite sure that the Commission does not currently have the necessary powers to take action against violations of a right that affects people so deeply, as you rightly said, MrÂ Cashman.
It is precisely to strengthen Europeâs powers, however, that this Commission and I myself have once again proposed that a European agency for the protection of fundamental rights should be set up.
The agency would be endowed with the powers that you propose, since it is the European Parliamentâs duty to give its opinion on the subject and perhaps increase its powers of intervention.
If you accept that proposal and if there is agreement in June, the agency will be a tool aimed precisely at tackling discriminatory behaviour.
This proposal is already on the table: it just needs examining, and I have said before and I repeat that we shall listen to any request by Parliament to improve it.
That, however, is just one of the tools available.
There are, of course, the usual instruments, such as Article 226 of the Treaty, infringement proceedings, and also a good deal of Court of Justice case law, according to which the Commission is unfortunately not empowered to intervene if the actions lie within the competence of the Member States.
I hope that the agency will be active soon, because it will perhaps be the first instrument to meet the demand for such powers.
MrsÂ Bachelot-Narquin, you mention a right to diversity, and I once again reply that we are already working on it.
You should, I believe, be aware of the information campaign programme named precisely âFor diversityâ.
Our aim in this programme, which began in late 2003 and is still ongoing, was to put together positive information to explain that diversity is a value for Europe.
All the major European gay rights groups are involved in this programme.
I believe you are keeping abreast of all these activities, and it is our intention to continue to work hard in this field.
I must therefore reject the accusations that the Commission has done nothing.
We intend to carry on with our work in this area and to do so in a spirit of mutual openness.
I felt that I should provide you with some facts, and not merely ideas, about initiatives that are already in place and which will improve our determined fight against all kinds of homophobia.
Â Â  â I have received five motions for resolutions(1) under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The June List believes that the EU is a union of values that must operate on the principle that everyone has equal value and equal rights.
This principle is fundamental to all activities and has also been laid down in the UNâs General Declaration on Human Rights.
The EU Member States have ratified a number of legally binding international agreements based on this principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination.
The right not to be exposed to irrelevant special treatment on the grounds of sexual orientation is, then, a fundamental human right.
In the debate, this right is sometimes regarded as a negotiable benefit.
It is important for us always to have the UNâs declarations on human rights in mind when we debate legislative proposals in this Chamber.
It is only in more recent years that the EU Member States have seriously begun to deal with the issue of homophobia.
According to Swedish statistics, the average citizen has a 4% to 6% risk of being exposed to what is referred to as unprovoked violence.
Among lesbian and bisexual women, the corresponding figure is between 15% and 24%, while between 28% and 36% of homosexual and bisexual men have been exposed to unprovoked violence.
The fact that sexual orientation determines to what extent someone is in danger of being exposed to violence is, of course, unacceptable.
It is important for us, as politicians, to make it clear that all human beings have equal rights and obligations.
If we tamper with that principle, we bring fundamental human rights and the UNâs declarations into question.
Â Â  Mr President, I have been a Member of this Parliament for a year and a half now and I find the experience âŠ
I do not have the Rules of Procedure here, Mr President.
It is a very brief question.
It is very frustrating that every time we ask questions in the debates, we never get a reply.
I asked a very precise question and I did not get an answer.
Â Â  Mr President, on the basis of RuleÂ 143(1), I wish to state that Mr Frattini is making out that we are all stupid because it was he who prepared the communication on the broader framework directive.
However, he did not bring forward a directive, as Parliament requested, because it seems there was no unanimity ...
Â Â  â MrsÂ Buitenweg, I am sorry, but Rule 143(1) has nothing to do with your request to take the floor.
It merely states that âthe names of Members who ask leave to speak shall be entered in the list of speakers in the order in which their requests are received.â
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Mr Catania (A6-0411/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission's fourth report on citizenship of the Union (1 May 2001 â 30 April 2004) (2005/2060(INI))
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the granting of citizenship and the rights associated with it is a prerogative of the Member States.
European citizenship is an emerging concept, a right deriving from national citizenship.
The fact that each country has different procedures for granting national citizenship means that there is no uniform procedure for acquiring European citizenship.
This report, for which I am the rapporteur, does not call the Member Statesâ prerogative into question: the right to citizenship and the granting of citizenship are their prerogatives, as expressly laid down in the Treaties.
The times are perhaps not yet ripe for harmonisation of the procedures for granting citizenship, as I realised even during the debate in committee.
Nonetheless, I believe it would be extremely useful and, indeed, necessary to begin a period of reflection â in the medium to short term â on the real and effective value of the idea of European citizenship.
In my opinion â and not just mine but that of most of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs â the only way to endow the idea of European citizenship with real value is to link it closely to the idea of residence.
European citizenship by residence is a very important issue, and thousands of associations and thinkers who have taken part in this debate have already submitted a petition to implement it.
European citizenship by residence can be included alongside the other procedures for acquiring citizenship â that is, citizenship by bloodline () or by birthplace () â which are provided for in many European Union countries.
I believe that granting citizenship by residence is a way to eliminate and avoid certain paradoxes.
Just think, for instance, that someone may be considered a European citizen â rightly too, perhaps â if he or she was born to Italian parents, lives in Argentina or Venezuela and has never set foot on EU soil, whereas someone else may not be considered a European citizen â unfairly, in my view â even though he or she has lived and worked in a Member State for 10 or 20 years but was unfortunately born to Tunisian or Egyptian parents.
I believe that bloodline, birthplace and residence may, together and at the same time, constitute valid grounds for granting citizenship rights.
Affirming that a person may become a citizen of the European Union after five yearsâ legal residence in Europe seems to us a practical way to reopen the debate on the future of Europe, which, since the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty, has plunged into a crisis that may prove fatal and irreversible.
Certain rights associated with EU citizenship are already conferred on the basis of residence: I am referring to the right to petition the European Parliament and the right to submit a complaint to the Ombudsman.
Thus the right of free movement and residence and also the right to vote in European and local elections might be extended, in the same way as these rights are granted to EU citizens residing in a country other than their own.
That would be an important step towards integrating all those non-EU citizens who live in Europe legally.
I also call on my fellow Members who belong to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to support this position and to give up excessively extreme positions.
The document I am putting forward not only received the support of my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in committee, but it also had the support of the Commission, whose members told the Committee on Civil Liberties that they were in favour of implementing citizenship by residence.
Commissioner Frattini has also said he is willing to give support of this kind.
I believe it is a very important step, which has also obtained the approval of a great many social and trade union organisations within civil society, both religious and secular.
I am referring in particular to two major Italian organisations: Caritas and a major Catholic trade union, the CISL, which have publicly come out in support of this report to introduce citizenship by residence.
Finally, I should like to reassure all those who, in their comments on this report, have raised the spectre of introducing a European tax in order to extend citizenship rights.
They even include the Italian Prime Minister, who wrongly claimed during a recent television broadcast that this Parliament wanted to introduce a tax in order to extend citizenship.
To dispel any doubts â although I do not see any threat in this report â I propose that we remove the explicit reference to a European tax and concentrate exclusively on the citizenship-by-residence concept.
I hope that doing so will also help to deprive those who are afraid to extend rights in Europe of their excuses.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrÂ Catania, whose contribution is, I think, particularly coherent and valuable.
After the Treaty of Maastricht, which introduced the idea of European citizenship, and after the added value given by the draft Constitutional Treaty, I believe the time has come to place human beings at the focus of rights and duties and thus, if I may say so, at the heart of the European integration process.
The basis of the report is the consideration that European citizens, as indeed is confirmed by the regular Eurobarometer surveys, attribute great importance to the idea of citizenship, so much so that a good 70% of European citizens know about the principle of European citizenship â something that is true in very few other areas, again according to Eurobarometer.
The problem is that many of these people do not have a clear idea of what rights and duties derive from it.
I therefore think that work done in this respect is a positive step forwards.
I shall illustrate this with a very strange fact: more than two thirds of Europeans believe that European citizenship automatically confers the right to vote in national elections in the country of residence.
These points therefore need to be clarified and, as proposed in the report, explicitly elucidated.
The chapter on the citizensâ right to information is very important, and is an area on which the Commission is already working.
Efforts are being made right now to inform citizens better.
The topic that I myself will be dealing with is the transposition of the new directive on European citizensâ right of residence, to ensure that the aspect of transparency of information is emphasised when the directive is incorporated by the Member States into their national bodies of law.
Another highly significant point is the one about non-European citizens, that is, third-country nationals who are legally resident in the European Union.
I personally am very much in favour of integrating third-country nationals who are residing and working legally on EU territory, and that is also the Commissionâs policy line.
I have published a draft European strategy on integration â Parliament will of course debate it â which is based precisely on the principle that citizenship at European level requires a framework of rights and duties for those who are not European citizens but who want to live, work and reside in Europe legally.
I believe that that is the starting point for MrÂ Cataniaâs report, and that is the route that should be encouraged.
Alongside rights, of course, as everyone realises, there are duties.
The fact is, therefore, that the gradual transformation of non-Europeans into European citizens on account of their residence must clearly be accompanied by respect for the laws of the country of residence and for those European guiding principles that are also enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
That is all part of the integration programme on which we shall be working in 2006 and which I hope to finalise with the agreement of the Council and Parliament.
An important first step is now in the pipeline, which is to grant long-term residents a permit to reside and move freely within the European Union.
This comes in a directive that has to be transposed by 23Â January this year â the deadline is thus in a few daysâ time â and I am putting political pressure on all the Member States to transpose the directive in question and to issue residence permits to non-EU citizens who have been residing legally in Europe for more than five years.
There must, of course, be a thorough debate on the concept of European citizenship by residence.
I am convinced that it is possible â perhaps without changing the structure of the Treaties, which do not provide for a link between European citizenship and residence â to start with a concept of civic citizenship: in other words, citizenship linked to the region and the place where the person works and lives.
I think that will be feasible without introducing rigid concepts that might â or perhaps should â entail a need to change the Treaties.
The European citizenship concept does not have its origin in residence but, since it is enshrined in the Treaties, if we want to introduce a new concept, the Treaties will have to be changed as well.
Given that the aim is a fair one, however, I believe we should reflect on a regional dimension to the area of rights and duties.
It is no coincidence that the integration plan that I have proposed casts mayors, provincial chairmen and regional governors as the main players in integration policy, more so even than the Member States, because it is precisely when one is closest to the issues affecting the citizens â be they from within the Community or from outside it â that one can understand the importance of the individual and his or her rights to education, to language teaching and to participation in local political life.
These matters are all linked to the area where a person lives.
That is the strategy on which I am prepared to start work straight away, if Parliament will decide on its position.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Frattini, MrÂ Catania, I should like to begin by congratulating you on the quality of the work done by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
On behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I congratulate you all the more because a number of the proposals we adopted have ended up in the final report: we are delighted by this outcome.
Commissioner, you spoke about rights and duties, and I believe that, in terms of citizenship, we are concerned here with a balance to which a number of us share the same approach.
Nevertheless, the issue of own resources, such as we had brought up in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and such as we had put to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which looked into it, must also be raised.
I am surprised by the remarks made by the Italian President of the Council.
It is by no means a question of creating a new tax.
It is a question of acting in the spirit of what we, in this Chamber, had voted in favour of with the BÃ¶ge report and proposing a mechanism aimed at ensuring a constant tax burden. This mechanism must not only enable recurring problems prejudicing the quality of the European debate to be resolved, but also, with regard to the âfair returnâ debate, enable a balance to be struck between the rights and duties of those residing in the European Union.
Beyond this issue, I believe that the rapporteurâs proposals with regard to the acquisition of citizenship of one or another Member State and to the discrimination against third-country nationals residing in a given Member State should be taken up by this plenary assembly, with all the political groups joining together.
I hope that this will happen.
Equally, when it comes to extending the rights attached to EU citizenship to long-term residents from third countries, I believe that, if we do in fact want to make progress with regard to integration and that if we want the notions of European citizenship to become a reality, then the opportunity for these long-term residents to, for example, vote in local or European elections, should be accepted and enhanced at European level.
Lastly, I believe that, with regard to our Parliament, the idea of a transnational election continues to give impetus to our work.
I am not sure whether we have brought this idea any closer to fruition in this report, but it seems important to me to mention it as a factor that can improve, and contribute to, European citizenship.
Â Â  â Mr President, with the fourth report on citizenship, the European Commission is honouring its commitment under Article 22 of the Treaty of the European Communities to submit a three-yearly report on the application by the European institutions of the provisions of the second part of the Treaty entitled 'European Citizenship'.
Basically, the fourth report presents developments concerning the rights which derive from citizenship of the Union.
It is worth noting that all past reports on citizenship related to the Europe of the 15.
We trust that the forthcoming report will provide an overall picture of today's Europe of the 25.
The Catania report, however, does not present for us all developments in the individual sectors which, together with the right to equal treatment, make up the particular character of citizenship, sectors such as freedom of movement, citizens' participation in elections to the European Parliament and in local elections, public information and, most of all, information for the young people who will make up the heart of the Union in the future.
In approaching the report within the framework of the remit of the Committee on Petitions, we highlighted the right of referral to the European Parliament and of complaint to the European Ombudsman.
We are delighted by the way in which the rapporteur included our proposals, except for the omission of the proposal on the application of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour.
However, the report emphasises, in paragraph 32, the importance of the right to good administration and the right of access to documents laid down in Title V of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The submission of a report must be characterised by simple, brief and transparent procedures, which the rapporteur failed to emphasise in his report, so that citizens will not hesitate to make proper use of their right.
Similarly, use of the right of recourse to the European Ombudsman requires suitable information of citizens and use of the means which the European Commission has as its disposal for an effective understanding of European citizenship.
Â Â  â Mr President, the duty of every rapporteur is to comment on the specific report on the basis of current legal terms and rules.
However, Mr Catania has formulated his own legal rules, most of which are vague.
Article 17 of the Treaty is clear and determines who can acquire citizenship of the European Union.
We cannot ignore this.
If we want to build legal structures, if we want to build structures which are not based on this specific provision, that is another matter, as is if we want to amend the Treaty.
I would further say that, given that citizenship of the Union has undoubtedly developed into a source of real, specific rights, it must depend on clear and specific rules for its acquisition.
I am delighted because Mr Catania rejected his own offspring this evening.
He told us in committee and projected the usefulness of a European tax.
Today Mr Catania appears to have understood where this proposal of his was leading and aborted it himself.
The European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejects these positions.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, is public opinion in our countries ready to accept either the way which Mr Catania advocates or the European tax?
Answer for yourselves.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am very pleased with the text proposed to us today and I have not, I might add, tabled any amendments for the vote in plenary.
I should like, first of all, to congratulate MrÂ Catania, who has contributed a remarkable piece of work in the context of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and who has succeeded in uniting the majority of Members around his draft report.
Thanks to compromise amendments drawn up jointly by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and thanks also to individual amendments tabled by Members of these groups, it seems to me that we have taken a number of important steps forward.
I will mention five of them.
The European Parliament is calling on the Member States to consider establishing a closer link between permanent legal residence over a reasonable period of time and the acquisition of national â and hence European â citizenship.
It is underlining its desire for greater coordination of the general criteria and procedures for the acquisition of nationality in the Member States.
Secondly, Parliament is calling on the Member States to discuss the possibility of drawing up a European voterâs card common to all the EU countries.
Thirdly, it is calling on the Commission to draw up a white paper on possible developments in EU citizenship.
Fourthly, it is calling on the Member States to extend the right to vote in local and European elections to third-country nationals and to stateless persons permanently residing in the European Union for more than five years, as well as the right of free movement and the right to a residence permit in any of the EU Member States.
Finally, Parliament is calling on the Member States to discuss forthwith the possibility of granting EU citizens the right to vote and to stand for election in the municipal, local and regional elections of the Member State in which they are resident, as well as granting them the choice of voting and standing for election in national elections either in the country in which they are resident or in their country of origin, though not in both.
Through these requirements and these desires expressed by the European Parliament, it is indeed a question of developing the Union into a real political community.
Political citizenship and democratic participation are the keys to the very future of the European project that we desire.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this report addresses the fundamental issue of the link between the citizens, between the people â in order not to use a term that is currently creating confusion â and the political project that we are trying to implement, and contains a series of statements of immense significance, all of which are inter-related and all of which are important.
Firstly, nationality still falls within the competence of the Member States; there is still a political entity in Europe which is called the âStateâ.
This is the case, even if some of us do not like it very much.
If we ignore this fact, we will merely be creating utopias.
Nevertheless, we must bear in mind that, to some extent, nationality also falls within the competence of the European Union.
It involves all of us.
When a State refuses, illegitimately, to grant citizenship to people who have lived in their territory for many years, it is denying them access to European citizenship.
This, in itself, gives us and the European Commission the power, without modifying the Treaties, to assess this issue.
The States grant European citizenship: it is therefore something to which we cannot be indifferent.
Furthermore, we cannot allow millions of people in Europe to contribute to our welfare and our wealth through their work and their taxes without having any kind of political rights.
Resolving this problem in a concrete fashion is a complicated matter.
But we cannot allow so many millions of people to be in this situation: contributing, but denied any right to express any opinion about their future.
I therefore welcome this report.
I believe that it is optimistic and that, in some cases, it goes rather further than the Treaties allow or than some of us would support: for example, the European Parliament and the national Parliaments must have the same degree of legitimacy and I therefore do not believe that, at this point, we can ask that certain people be allowed to vote in the European Parliament elections when they cannot vote in elections to national Parliaments.
Both parliaments should have the same legitimacy, and when they evolve, they must do so at the same time.
The Commission must publicise the rights that the European citizens currently enjoy much more effectively, for example in the consular field and in many other areas in which they are not even aware of the rights available to them.
The Commission can contribute a lot to this debate, providing transparency in relation to what the different Member States do in a field which falls, and for the time being will continue to fall, within their competence.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Verts/ALE Group supports the principal ideas in Mr Cataniaâs report.
We consider that EU citizenship based on residence should be the ultimate goal to make the European Union a genuine political community.
Those residing legally and on a long-term basis in the EU have to be granted political rights irrespective of their original nationality.
The crucial reality of the enlarged EU is that amongst those covered by the term âthird country nationalâ are half a million people who are not nationals of any state, being former citizens of a state which no longer exists: the USSR.
These people make up 20% of the population of Latvia and 9% of that of Estonia.
They are holders of non-citizenâs passports issued by those states, but for 15Â years they have been deprived of their rights to political participation.
In my opinion, Latvian and Estonian non-citizens may be the first candidates to become EU âcivic citizensâ, the term Commissioner Frattini proposed just now â and I am very grateful to him for that proposal.
I believe that by adopting the Catania report Parliament will signal to the authorities of Latvia and Estonia that respect for equal rights is crucial for the EU.
Â Â  MrÂ President, citizenship is conferred by states, and it is therefore logical that those who want to see the EU turned into a state should also fight to establish citizenship of the Union.
My group wishes to see practical European cooperation without wanting to construct a common state.
We therefore reject the plans to develop citizenship of the Union.
The place for common fundamental rights is in our own constitutions and in the European Convention on Human Rights.
The EC Court of Justice in Luxembourg must not be a rival, seeking to build a new state.
Our countriesâ voters must decide for themselves to whom they will give citizenship and at what juncture, as well as the rights and duties they will assign to such citizens.
The very plan to bring about citizenship of the EU state, with the freedom to settle anywhere and sell oneâs labour at reduced prices, destroys the EU and makes enlargement to include poor countries unpopular.
The June Movement is in favour of a common market and cooperation but opposed to common citizenship.
May I also remind you that, in 1992, the Danes voted against citizenship as provided for by the Treaty of Maastricht and obtained an exemption from common citizenship.
This exemption is not being respected.
Denmark is a party to every aspect of common citizenship of the Union, and using a Danish term for citizenship that excludes the element âstateâ and therefore appears less binding emphatically makes no difference.
Â Â  Mr President, the notion of EU citizenship is really a synthetic concoction; it is not a natural product.
Citizenship belongs to nation states.
It is not something to be purloined by the EU in its desperate scramble for internal and external credibility, made more desperate by the humiliating rejection of the unwanted Constitution.
What is being promoted here is a phoney and empty contrivance, designed to bring statehood to Europe.
The proposal reaches its most ludicrous and unacceptable point when it embraces the progressive financing of the EU by direct taxation.
If the proponents of EU citizenship think they will make the EU more loved and more wanted by promoting direct Brussels taxation, then I have to say that, happily, they are more out of touch with the citizens than I ever thought they were.
Foolish reports like this do more to assist euroscepticism than anything else I can think of.
Therefore, on that score, I suppose I should say: let us have more of them!
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vice-President, what has to be said, quite simply and bluntly, about the opinion of the European Parliament on the Commission's report on Citizenship of the Union that Mr Catania has presented is that it misses the point.
It does so by doing no more than demanding that EU citizenship be extended to include those who are resident in the EU but not citizens of it, so that, for example, foreigners and stateless persons would be given the right to vote and the right to stand for election.
Third-country nationals would acquire the rights of EU citizens while retaining their rights in their home countries.
To take one example, one could envisage a situation where, if Mr Catania had his way, an American who had lived in the EU for five years would be able to vote in the elections for the European Parliament, and indeed himself be elected to it, while at the same time being able to take part in elections in the United States.
The effect of that would be to accord people who are not EU citizens more rights than those who actually are.
The question at issue was, however, whether EU citizens actually enjoy, to the degree originally envisaged, the rights that they are accorded by law.
Specifically, how do things stand with the rights of EU citizens as guaranteed by the Treaty on the European Communities?
Can our citizens really, for example, settle in other EU Member States without getting too tangled up in red tape?
What are the obstacles that make it more difficult to take up a job in another EU country?
If someone does that, how do things stand as regard the transferability of social security and health insurance, or the changeover to another system?
Are the controls on citizens at the internal borders unnecessarily rigorous?
Mr Catania, unfortunately â and I say âunfortunatelyâ in view of the fact that these are issues with which every citizen of the EU has to deal in everyday life â does nothing to answer these questions, not to mention others besides.
Rational answers to them enhance the credibility of the European Union in peopleâs eyes.
Improving the realities of day-to-day life and the cultural exchange between the European peoples makes Europe more readily acceptable.
It is because the opportunity to do that has been missed that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be voting to reject this report.
Perhaps I might be permitted to explain to the chair why it is that all the speakers are leaving the Chamber as soon as they have finished their speeches.
As of 7 oâclock, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has been sitting, and all of us are required to go straight there.
I would just like to clarify that for fear that it might be seen as discourteous.
Â Â  â Mr President, European citizenship does indeed, as Mr Catania quite rightly says, depend on nationality.
As long as some people continue to see immigrants as second class citizens, as long as they believe that people who do not have European blood cannot acquire European rights, as long as, instead of integrating immigrants, they wish to keep them indefinitely in a grey zone, then immigration runs the risk of turning from the big hope of Europe into its big time bomb.
The debate on European citizenship, as Commissioner Frattini quite rightly says, is directly linked to the harmonious integration of immigrants and the major question of political citizenship.
The party from which I come in Greece, PASOK, has institutionalised the participation of immigrants in all its institutions.
No European law is needed for that.
It supports the participation of long-standing immigrants in local elections.
We must become more open-minded in Europe and I am very grateful to Mr Catania, because his report allows us to hold a material political debate and to touch on matters which many conservatives in Europe do not appear to wish to touch on.
Â Â  Mr President, this report promotes the stupidity and falsity that is EU citizenship and proceeds to come up with suggestions as to how this ridiculous and failing notion can be promoted.
The EU institutions show, with unwavering consistency, how totally out of touch they are with the sentiments and views of the public.
The Maastricht Treaty may have created citizenship in principle, but it is a classic example of theory being impossible to put into practice.
For example, EU citizenship is impossible to renounce.
I do not want it.
I was not even asked before it was imposed upon me.
We now have clear proof of the desperation entering the thought processes of the federalists in this Parliament.
It is their belief that âa direct link between some aspect of the tax system and the financing of the European Unionâ would make EU citizenship more balanced.
As any student of politics knows, linking something to a tax is the sure-fire way of condemning it to the dustbin of history.
I have said many times before that if the EU is the answer then the question must have been a stupid one.
This report proves that beyond doubt.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the creation of European citizenship because we want a Europe of the citizens and not simply a Europe of goods, services and capital.
This citizenship grew out of increased protection of the rights and interests of citizens of the Member States and the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice.
I wish to congratulate Mr Frattini on the work he has done in this regard.
We broadly welcome the balance sheet on the last three years presented to us by the Commission.
The biggest problems that have come to light have primarily been down to incorrect implementation and practice, and not to non-compliance with national laws.
This serves to reinforce the importance of a policy of information regarding the correct interpretation of Union rules and the correct implementation of the citizensâ rights, and reminds us that steps need to be taken to make the Charter of Fundamental Right legally binding.
We want to strengthen and consolidate European identity and to increase the citizensâ involvement in the process of European integration, which needs to be reflected in higher turnouts at the European elections.
Less welcome is the Catania report before us today, in which around half of the 40 points undermine the very concept, promoting recognition of EU citizenship regardless of whether or not the person has citizenship of a Member State.
This clearly runs counter to the Treaty.
European citizenship must not be understood as the idea of artificially creating a supranational identity to replace the sense of belonging to oneâs country.
The act of promoting a shared heritage based on a series of fundamental traditions and values should go hand in hand with respect for national identity.
Union citizenship is complementary citizenship in addition to national citizenship and does not replace it.
To advocate the opposite is to destroy the concept of European citizenship and to undermine the European project.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Catania on his excellent report, which I support fully.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that there is no longer a European , but it is also true that we Europeans have decided to share a common destiny and that strengthening and developing European citizenship will undoubtedly contribute to our feeling increasingly more involved in the European project that we are implementing.
We should remember, though, that millions of our fellow citizens live outside of the Unionâs territory â almost one million Spaniards alone â and we should also remember that, regardless of our places of birth or residence, we are all equally European.
There cannot be first- and second-class Europeans.
I myself am the son of emigrants and I have spent most of my life outside of the Unionâs borders.
I have first-hand knowledge of how important it is to maintain a link with the country of origin and how necessary it is to bring the Union closer to the Europeans living outside of its territory as well.
We must ensure that the rights that come with this citizenship are guaranteed for Europeans living in Switzerland, Argentina or any other part of the world, just as they are guaranteed for Europeans resident in France, Germany or any other State of the Union.
In its White Paper on the development of citizenship, therefore, the Commission should provide for all appropriate measures to improve the conditions for exercising these rights and to guarantee that they become fully effective outside of the Union too.
Mr Catania, I would like to thank you for having accepted the amendments that move in that direction and I hope that the Commission will take account of this Houseâs requests.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Mrs Prets (A6-0400/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, on strategies to prevent the trafficking of women and children who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation (2004/2216(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, if one makes a comparison with the statistics and requirements relating to the trading of animals, then the trafficking of human beings, and of women in particular, is a taboo subject.
Human beings appear to be less valuable than animals, and every year sees an enormous increase in the number of women and children who are trafficked; in the absence of solid statistics and figures, estimates range between 800Â 000 and 3-4 million women and children every year.
Figures of that order really should shake us out of our somnolence and bring us face to face with the need for action.
Organised crime is on the rise, and trafficking rings are becoming ever more flexible in the methods and routes they use.
Demand is on the up; the market is booming.
Trafficking in women is a crime and a modern form of slavery.
It demands more rigorous investigation and prosecution of the criminals concerned, care and support for their victims, and preventive action too.
Both within the EU and internationally, what is needed is a holistic, integrated and inter-disciplinary approach.
It needs to be holistic, because, in combating the trafficking in human beings, light needs to be shed on the triangular relationship between the victim, the client and the dealer.
Nor, under any circumstances, must the people-smugglers, the pimps, the middlemen and all the places where the business is done, not to mention those who profit from them, be overlooked.
The primary objective must be to address the most blatant aspects of the problem, such as the increasing impact of poverty on women, high unemployment and wealth differentials, and to reduce the considerable potential for violence.
It is for this reason that this report makes concrete demands, among other things for action to prevent and counteract people-trafficking to be implemented across the EU as part of its Neighbourhood Policy, its development policy, its foreign policy and of many other potential horizontal policy areas.
The EUâs aid policy, too, must focus more on the reduction of poverty and hence have an indirect impact on the people trade, but there is also a need for the aid policies of the World Bank and of other big institutions to be analysed and examined with a view to finding out whether the money really does reach the people who need it, and whether it might not be doing the opposite of what it is intended to do.
We know, after all, that international development policy does not reduce poverty, but can even contribute to the further marginalisation of groups at risk.
One great deficiency is the absence of a database, so what is needed is a unitary data collection system, and the Commission needs to work together with other international organisations to develop one.
The only way we will get the same results from inquiries is to tackle them in the same way.
There is also a need for information campaigns in the countries of origin and of transit, along with an annual âAnti-trafficking Dayâ with a logo making visible the enormity of the problems involved.
The European Union needs â by which I mean that the Member States need â to take action, action in the form of information campaigns aimed in particular at the victims, but also in the existing structures, such as the establishments where police officers, social workers and the judiciary are trained and in similar places, along with more cooperation with NGOs and the executive.
For this, the prosecuting authorities will need staff and funding allocated to them, and information offices on the trade in women will need to be set up.
National and international telephone helplines need to be set up and publicised on national and local television.
There need to be reviews not only of current visa practices but also of the many things that happen through diplomatic networks.
It is as a particular matter of urgency that we urge that victims be given the right to remain not only for the duration of a trial, but also after it is over.
The fact is that a victimâs testimony can help considerably to identify criminals, and we know that many victims are unwilling to testify out of fear, not only of public shame, but also of deportation.
Something of a rethink is called for here.
Anonymous statements by victims and clients also need to be accepted if the perpetrators of these crimes are to be hunted down.
Campaigns will need to be started to make those who provide the demand for these services aware of the catastrophic consequences of this trade, and I would also like to see anonymous hotlines for clients as well, in order to get more evidence from them.
I am not, however, in favour of the clients being criminalised across the board, and I have, in this report, endeavoured to avoid focusing on national legislation on prostitution and thereby sacrificing a global problem to national differences.
I would also like to mention that the International Committee for the Rights of Sex Workers recently demanded social security rights and legalisation across the EU.
Another specific demand has to do with the trafficking in children: it appears that, in some cases, corrupt customs officials retain childrenâs identity cards.
Belgian identity cards for children are not numbered; they are retained and used for child-trafficking.
I would suggest that a numbering system for them be introduced.
As you can see, there is much for us to do in contending with the trafficking in human beings, and we have to be aware that these tragedies are being played out on our doorsteps.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly pleased with the debate that has taken place on this subject.
Many of you are aware that I regard fighting the traffic in human beings as one of those personal priorities which, I believe, must achieve not only visibility but also tangible and significant results during my mandate.
Last October, as you know, I put forward a Commission communication devoted to this subject, precisely along the lines suggested by the rapporteur, MrsÂ Prets.
It takes an integrated approach geared towards finalising a European action plan for firmly and decisively combating the traffic in human beings.
In December, following that communication, the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers agreed with the proposal put forward and adopted an action plan.
This plan specifically refers to best practice and to common standards and procedures to combat and prevent trafficking in human beings.
With todayâs report, which I particularly endorse and value, Parliament is adopting a vital â and certainly necessary â political role of its own, paying particular attention to women and children.
These are the groups which, in my view, are most vulnerable to this real kind of slavery, which Europe has a duty to fight.
I shall even say it has a moral duty, and not just an institutional and legal one, to stamp out this kind of slavery.
This moral duty, as the report suggests, requires us to take an integrated approach based on the principle of having absolute respect for the dignity of every child, every woman and every man: every human being in general.
This is not a legal or bureaucratic basis, but one of our fundamental principles grounded in the rules of the Treaties and of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and also, if I may say so, in the rules of morality.
Although the European Union is already implementing policies in this area, they need to be strengthened.
What I mean is, for instance, a policy designed to strengthen the principle of gender equality in order to prevent the marginalisation of womenâs roles in the job market and their relegation to lower-paid jobs.
Such a policy will certainly foster an improvement in cultural standards, which will be needed to root out the demand.
That is another important point: demand is unfortunately a key part of exploitation.
If there were no demand, if there were fewer customers, or if the number of users prepared to collaborate with the exploiters were cut drastically, the scale of the problem would undoubtedly be less horrific.
I understand why the rapporteur chose not to focus on the topic of prostitution in the report we are examining.
Personally, however â and I stress that this is my personal view â I feel that we must also address the issue of introducing tough measures to deter the clients, who are well aware that the girls they use are exploited and victims of trafficking.
No one can fail to notice their tragic circumstances.
This is an extremely sensitive subject, which we cannot examine in any depth today but which will have to be debated.
The current degree of harmonisation is limited.
The Member States have different legislations and, although there is a framework decision precisely on trafficking in human beings, child exploitation, the vile subject of paedophilia and child pornography, harmonisation at a practical level still appears limited.
I agree with the rapporteur that little has been done for the victims of human trafficking, who should not be helped only when they decide to collaborate with the police.
They also need help to rejoin society!
A child who has suffered the horrors of pornography and paedophilia should not be helped only when she cooperates with the police and reveals the names of her exploiters, but requires constant, life-long assistance, because the consequences of the harm she has suffered will probably mark her forever.
The Commission has also attempted to base the approach to European legislation on the major guidelines drawn up by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
I am pleased to see that the Council also shares this approach and is thus in favour of extending all forms of child protection to young people under 18 years of age.
We must not define the concept of âchildâ too restrictively: those who are not yet 18 must also be able to benefit from the protection rules recognised by the United Nations and Europe.
I also agree with another aspect of the report, where it emphasises the links between the strictly criminal matter of human trafficking and illegal immigration.
I also endorse the topic of social protection and the need for a European Union foreign policy that aims at introducing a clear reference â as we are doing in all our international relations â to human trafficking as one of the Unionâs priority areas.
In short, those who negotiate with the Union and intend to develop close international relations with us must be aware that the European Union cannot even remotely tolerate the enormous traffic in and exploitation of women and children, and of human beings in general.
In order to do all that, we need a database.
I agree with you on that, and we are in fact working to set one up, including on a technical level.
I am cooperating closely with Europol on enhancing their database, so as to be able eventually to set up a proper European statistical system providing reliable data.
All too often, in fact, we do not know the real scale of the problem, and that is not acceptable.
Europe will get a database and a reliable statistical system.
At the same time, I intend not only to accept Parliamentâs invitation but also to propose a great many practical initiatives which, on the basis of the action plan approved in December, will transform our desire to thoroughly stamp out the traffic in human beings, particularly women and children, into concrete action.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Frattini, it is gratifying that Parliament is today debating the trafficking of women and children.
When the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I was draftsman, decided on the opinion I was to draft, there was not only a very large majority in favour of strongly condemning the odious trafficking of persons but also a desire to see human trafficking as an aspect of prostitution in the EU.
What was important to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was to set the target of halving the trade within ten years and to see considerable efforts made to ensure that we MEPs obtain a better basis for decision-making, better statistics and, of course, better cooperation between police, prosecutors and judges. We believe â and I emphasise âbelieveâ â that up to one half of the victims of human trafficking may be children and minors.
It was therefore important for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to emphasise that a minimum, inviolable age limit of 18 years must be set.
For me, it is also only natural that women and children who have been victims of human trafficking be given the right to stay or else help in returning to their own countries.
I also hope that, in the future, there will be cooperation with the tourist industry.
Administrative districts and municipalities that receive large groups of tourists must make it clear that they view the trafficking of women and children as unacceptable.
A concomitant of the decision about the tourist industry that we are to take here in Strasbourg are the rumours that thousands upon thousands of women are to be imported as prostitutes in advance of this summerâs football World Cup â a matter for protest on the part of the EUâs women Social Democrats.
I am pleased to be able to say that, in Sweden, both our EU minister and the minister responsible for gender equality have condemned any such development, as has the chairman of the Swedish Football Association.
I hope that all the speakers in this Chamber today are able to give their support to this protest against the trafficking of women.
Sport, prostitution and the trafficking of women do not go together.
In its ambition to draw attention to prostitution in the EU, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs wished to go further than the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality is doing.
I intend to return to this issue on a later occasion, for example in connection with our debate on MrÂ Frattiniâs communication.
We cannot, as MrsÂ Prets believes, bring the trafficking of persons to an end by providing information about it.
What is required is for courageous politicians, including EU politicians, to take responsibility for doing so.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrsÂ Pretsâ excellent report tackles an extremely pressing and highly topical issue.
At the very moment, in fact, when our societies are legitimately yearning to preserve the memory of what constituted slavery in centuries gone by, so that such crimes might never again take place, can we tolerate the continuation and development, throughout the world, of a new and modern form of slavery â sexual slavery â which is viewed by the traffickers as a run-of-the-mill commercial activity?
The response â and a unanimous one at that - of MrsÂ Prets and the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality is âNoâ.
It must be recognised today that in spite of media interest which, I might add, is only a recent development, people still have a poor grasp of the devastating physical and psychological effects of trafficking.
It must be recognised that, up to now, the texts we have adopted with a view to combating, at European level, the criminals who increasingly turn to this activity have more often than not gone unheeded.
I therefore welcome the fact that MrsÂ Prets is proposing a series of measures relating, at one and the same time, to prevention, awareness-raising and repression, which is the integrated approach MrÂ Frattini was talking about.
For the first time, the ground has been prepared for a genuine common policy for combating this terrible modern-day scourge.
MrsÂ Pretsâ report is timely in avoiding the debate on what constitutes, on the one hand, trafficking and, on the other, prostitution. Due to the profound differences between our various sets of legislation, this debate would be liable to come to an abrupt end and to leave us powerless.
I appreciate this approach, which is at aimed at effectiveness, but I also appreciate the fact that the taboo problem of demand has not, for all that, been sidestepped because, in the triangle formed by the actors in this tragedy â the traffickers, prostitutes and clients â it would be impossible, without being hypocritical, not to mention the clientsâ responsibility in this affair.
I therefore hope that the points raised are upheld.
They underline our Parliamentâs awareness of the problem and its desire to resolve every aspect of it, that is to say to banish sexual slavery from our society.
I hope that the solid consensus demonstrated in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality is repeated in our plenary, and I am convinced that the commissioners concerned, particularly MrÂ Frattini â who said as much to us - will hear our message and be very keen to make this fight a priority.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I speak for the Socialist Group in this House when I say that we are grateful to Mrs Prets and all the members of the Committee on Womenâs Rights for their collaboration on this report.
We have tabled many proposals as to how the battle against trafficking in women may be waged.
We are alongside you one hundred per cent, Commissioner Frattini, if you take decisive action against this modern scourge.
We have to drain this swamp and take action, and, with the action plan and with the help and cooperation of other bodies such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the United Nations, we will be able to do just that.
There are plenty of proposals in the report that we can take up, and they need to be implemented now.
Funding needs to be made available; Europol must be equipped with powers to act; a police task force needs to be set up: all these things can help.
During the December part-session, half of the Members in this House supported the establishment of helplines for children.
We want the Daphne programme to carry on being an effective instrument, but as something separate from the prevention of drug use.
That is another issue, and every bit as important, but it needs to be dealt with separately.
Where this is concerned, Commissioner, you have our backing.
None of these things can be delayed for any longer.
This was an issue that concerned both your predecessor, Mr Vitorino, and Mrs Gradin; thank heavens there are rather more people interested in it now.
We also, however, have the World Cup football to look forward to, and that will prove to be another test.
Germany is expecting no fewer than 40 000 additional prostitutes, supposedly to meet the needs of the men who will be going to watch the games, and the fact that these women will not be working of their own free will means that something needs to be done.
We will continue to consider this issue in the Womenâs Committee and will not stand idly by.
What should go forth from todayâs debate is a clear message to the organisations that we support women in their campaign and will not shrink back from raising the issue of demand for prostitutes in specific terms.
Let us address this problem together and, not least by collecting the relevant data, as also with concrete policy measures, at last make this grey area the subject of headlines and make the public aware of it.
Â Â  . MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank MrsÂ Prets for the work she has done, and I will be voting in favour of her report.
The report sharply underlines our shortcomings with regard to combating the trade in, and trafficking of, women, adolescents and children.
The laws in Europe on paedophilia, sex tourism and organised prostitution are in fact so diverse that we really need to show courage and determination in order to reach a consensus.
We need to act quickly if we are to stop the growth in these sordid â indeed Mafia-like â markets and to combat the traffickers and their accomplices, who rely both on the prostitutesâ distress and on the clientsâ sexual deprivation.
I am not offended by the fact that prostitution exists, and I do not deny that it satisfies a great deal of its consumers, but I do, however, take a firm stance against this attack on a personâs integrity.
I do not want to support a form of pseudo-morality that punishes the sins of the flesh but, at the same time, I do not want to accept a lax form of tolerance that disregards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly in relation to a personâs integrity, freedom and dignity.
We must not, of course, imagine that we are going to eradicate prostitution, but we must make a clear distinction between tolerance and legitimation.
I am in favour of criminalising demand.
It is our duty to reflect together on the implementation of in-depth laws to stop the growth in these markets and to thwart those who seek out, encourage and try to put in place these kinds of activities.
It is, in any case, crucial to arrive at a zero tolerance approach where cases of paedophilia and sexual exploitation are concerned, but we must also succeed in using information campaigns to raise clientsâ awareness and to give them a sense of responsibility.
In actual fact, even if the clientâs role in all of this is a pitiful one, I am convinced that it should not be swept under the carpet.
I am aware that it will be a long and difficult fight, but I do not want to be a party to a âleast worstâ policy by supporting a lax form of tolerance that mainly benefits the organised prostitution rings, which garner huge financial profits and which also facilitate money laundering operations.
I will conclude by saying that I am opposed to people being encouraged in any way to cast blame and to inform on others anonymously.
Â Â  . Madam President, the fact that the trafficking of people for sexual exploitation is today the most rapidly growing criminal activity and that the European Union is no stranger to this phenomenon, obliges us to react.
I therefore fully support the Prets report, which urges the Commission and the Council to establish a clear legal framework for combating this form of violence.
Within this framework, there must clearly be preventive measures to support the development and âempowermentâ of women in countries of origin, in order to prevent them from falling into the hands of people who take advantage of their vulnerability, and exemplary punishments for those who profit from people trafficking.
In any event, what we have to bear in mind is that these people are the victims, who need political, social and legal protection, and that, in all cases, we must guarantee â as happens in certain countries, such as Belgium or Italy for example â that, in order to encourage them to denounce their procurers, their right to residence after making that complaint is recognised.
When these measures are taken seriously, it may be possible for us to eradicate this people trafficking more effectively.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mrs Prets for her report and would like to take it as an opportunity to highlight an issue that will be of particular concern to us this year.
Major sporting events also offer an opportunity to engage in the people-trafficking business, in which women are forced into prostitution.
In sport, there is a constant emphasis on fairness and consideration for others, but if, on the occasion of the football world cup, the football supporters are offered brothels like the ones in Berlin, that is when I shall waste no time in spoiling the game.
The trafficking in women and children, along with forced prostitution, must be banned, prosecuted and impeded, both nationally and at the European level.
Let all those who are unwilling to take action against it be shown the red card!
Â Â  .Â Â Â MadamÂ President, the aim of a strategy for combating the trafficking of women and children should be to help eliminate the various causes of such trafficking.
The report makes reference to a number of these latter, including poverty, unemployment, social exclusion, lack of education, corruption and violence.
Our priority, however, should be to change peopleâs way of thinking, and to move away from liberal policies that legalise various forms of corruption, addiction and prostitution in the name of the much-vaunted principles of the free market.
A hedonistic and utilitarian approach to individuals lies at the root of such problems.
We must move instead towards a civilisation of life promoting ethical values that ensure individuals are treated with due dignity.
Another cause of social malaise is the crisis faced by the family, which is failing in its role as a morally healthy environment.
Children who are left to their own devices in problem families imitate the models they see promoted in the media.
They learn to adopt a consumer lifestyle in which the only goal or motivation to act is economic gain.
Such a lifestyle is driven by a desire for success and rivalry between women and men, who compete with each other for power and influence instead of working together.
This gives rise to frustration and various social ills.
Violence and the sexual exploitation of women and children are caused by the sexualisation that is becoming ever more prevalent, both in the media and elsewhere.
Together with what is known as âsex educationâ, it arouses urges before the attainment of mental and physical maturity, which is a prerequisite for control of oneâs own actions.
This produces people who operate according to primitive instincts and reasoning alone, and who lack empathy and the capacity for spiritual growth.
Â Â  I wish to express my thanks to Mrs Christa Prets for her report.
Trafficking in persons, in particular women and children, is one of the worst forms of crime organised by international criminal groups.
These groups mainly target people in lower-income categories on the pretext of employment as waitresses, barmaids, charwomen or au pairs.
Most of the women who are ensnared in this way come from regions with adverse economic and social conditions, and high unemployment.
Since trafficking in women is perpetrated internationally by well-organised supranational groups, combating this problem also requires coordination at the supranational level.
It is commendable that international institutions such as the UN, the Council of Europe and the European Union, are addressing this modern form of slavery belonging to the 20th and 21st centuries.
Their activities have led to the adoption of a number of conventions, the signatories to which have included Slovakia.
In my view, however, it is also important to monitor the actual implementation of these conventions.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mrs Prets' report is a truly exceptional, complete and integrated report.
It touches briefly on all aspects of the problem of the movement of and trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation.
Congratulations my honourable friend, and congratulations also to Commissioner Frattini on the sensitivity which he has shown and for the views which he expressed today on this issue.
The phenomenon of trafficking for sexual exploitation and trafficking in women and children is a serious disgrace to contemporary society.
Unfortunately, instead of tending to disappear, it is increasing.
Prostitution is the atrocious reason for trafficking in human beings, but prostitution and trafficking in human beings are two sides of the same coin.
It is a fact that there is social tolerance of prostitution in all the Member States of the European Union.
That is not what I am discussing.
However, there appears to be no tolerance of trafficking for sexual exploitation in woman and, more importantly, children in any Member State.
Nonetheless, society is proving to be unable to stamp out this scourge.
There is zero tolerance in words, but no results in practice.
Who is to blame?
It is the inadequacy of the measures being taken to stamp out this phenomenon that is to blame.
As the foxes said to the hares, 'we would agree to be your allies, if we didn't know what sort of creatures you are and who you are fighting against'.
So an end to hypocrisy on the part of society, the state and individuals.
This phenomenon demeans man and infringes the human rights of the victims involved in this venture and must be wiped out.
There is no room for compromise or indifference.
Criminalising the knowing acceptance of sexual services from women acting under coercion, deception or conditions of social and economic constraint and, more importantly, from children, is the first practical step which needs to be taken and it will certainly have results.
The European Parliament is being called on to approve the Prets report by an overwhelming majority because, apart from anything else, it adopts for the first time the position of making the acceptance of such sexual services incriminating.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur and focus my speech on the use of the new information and communication technologies, particularly the Internet, and the trafficking of women and children for sexual exploitation, an aspect which has also been mentioned in the report and which has not yet been raised in this debate.
Ladies and gentlemen, everything that is illegal in society is also illegal in the information society.
The laws in force in each country also apply to the users and creators of the new information and communication technologies but, in practice, the very extra-territorial nature of those technologies and the fact that those laws are different in each country, make them extremely difficult to apply.
The fact that an illegal information point for the trafficking of women and children, or for any other criminal activity, can be created very cheaply, the fact that it is accessible from any part of the world and that there is no reason why the information necessarily has to be consumed in the country from which it originates, enormously hinders the application of the laws.
Furthermore, the technology is available to use the very mechanisms offered by the new information and communication technologies to hinder access by those people investigating the crime to the information point likely to be engaged in illegal acts.
This makes it even more difficult to investigate the crime and hence to apply the law.
If we really want Europe to be an area in which freedom and security are compatible values which enhance each other mutually, we must also deal with this problem decisively, thoroughly and in a joint fashion.
This is a difficult problem that requires cooperation at European level.
Understanding risks, rights and where to go for protection is essential to peopleâs protection.
To this end, education is fundamental and in this regard the information and communication technologies offer some extremely positive opportunities.
For all of these reasons, we would call upon the Commission, in coordination with the Member States, to tackle this aspect of the issue we are debating energetically and urgently.
Â Â  The attitude of considering human beings as commodities is a violation of human rights.
Trafficking in human beings and prostitution are closely related, since trafficking in human beings supplies prostitution with new women and children.
Experiences with the legalisation of prostitution show that it only increases trafficking in human beings.
It is therefore ridiculous to differentiate laws about trafficking in human beings from those pertaining to prostitution.
Trafficking in human beings is the fastest-growing type of organised crime.
Buyersâ demands change, but what they want is unlimited access to women and children, and the market is flourishing.
The globalisation of the economy also means the globalisation of prostitution, which is becoming an industry without borders.
I would like to stress that if we think that we can combat trafficking in human beings separately from prostitution, we are burying our heads in the sand.
It is time for some action across all areas of politics, because the sad numbers of victims show how the action taken up till now has been unable to control this situation.
I would like to thank Mrs Prets for her excellent work; and thank you for your attention.
Â Â  â The fact that we are having this debate is important, but more important still is taking urgent and effective measures to put a stop to the trafficking of human beings, and in particular women and children, for the purposes of sexual exploitation and enforced labour; this is tantamount to slavery and a grave violation of human rights.
We cannot turn a blind eye to this worldwide scourge, which affects 600Â 000 to 800Â 000 people, of whom 80% are women and children, and the EU, where more than 100Â 000 people a year are victims, is also not immune.
There are clear links between trafficking of this nature and war, political instability in the countries of origin, the deepening of social and regional inequality, the feminisation of poverty and unemployment and violence against women and children, which means that fresh approaches and integrated policies are required.
It is well known that trafficking for sexual exploitation is directly linked to prostitution, and it is therefore a matter of urgent priority that a range of integrated measures be adopted with the aim of protecting the dignity of women and children, and of taking action to combat the trafficking of human beings.
Steps must also be taken to combat money laundering, and to shut down tax havens.
Moreover, socio-economic policies that are aimed at enhancing solidarity, and are committed to economic and social cohesion, must also be adopted.
Â Â  Madam President, this evening I have heard the words âtraffickingâ, âslaveryâ, âviolenceâ, âabuseâ, âorganised crimeâ, âpaedophiliaâ, ârapeâ - all of them scourges of modern society, as we all agree.
However, I do not know of any national governments that have not already made these illegal.
I cannot for the life of me see the point in reinventing the wheel when all this is already illegal across the European Union.
What we need to do is get on with our business and start enforcing the laws that we already have.
I am also surprised that you are surprised that this is the sort of thing that happens when you tear down all the border controls.
It is difficult to believe that it has actually taken anybody by surprise at all.
It was surely inevitable.
As to the criminalisation of the client, which somebody suggested earlier, in the United Kingdom homosexuality was made legal in order to do away with what was then known as a âblackmailerâs charterâ.
If you start to criminalise the client in these matters, you will find that the law of unintended consequence comes into play, something at which I am afraid this Parliament is all too adept.
Â Â  â Madam President, trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, is as old as human society.
It is also true that, even if this practice is almost always judged to be condemnable and disparaging for the position of man compared with other living creatures, at no time and in no civilisation, including of course in our European civilisation, has it been addressed effectively.
The Prets report, on the one hand, is yet another attempt to highlight the ineffectiveness of national and Community laws and actions.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her methodical and realistic presentation and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on finalising a substantial text full of proposals and for developing effective actions not only at European but also at global level.
I congratulate you, Commissioner, on the integrated approach to your recent communication and on the Council's action plan.
I am highlighting what is for me the high point of the report, even though I know the difficulties and the limitations imposed by the Treaties, the call for a clear legal basis to be adopted in order to combat all forms of violence against and trafficking in women and children and the full communitisation of a horizontal European policy for prevention and to protect the victims in the sectors of immigration, employment, commerce and banking transactions, transport, tourism and the new technologies which can be used to make trafficking and exploitation uncontrollable and prosecution unfeasible.
Another point which gives cause for hope is the call in the report for closer cooperation between the national authorities and Îuropol and Eurojust by improving international operational cooperation.
It is a pity that the states did not hasten without hesitation to ratify the international agreements and conventions.
The Community institutions are being called on here to safeguard the coordination and cohesion of activities by international fora.
To close, I would highlight the reference in the report to the need for action with less costly means but of fundamental importance for the future of the civilised world, by which I mean educational programmes which will be capable of teaching boys and girls self-respect and, consequently, respect for their fellow human beings, so that they do not become either perpetrators or victims.
Â Â  I am glad to congratulate rapporteur Christa Prets for a timely and informative report.
Above all, I would like to emphasise that trafficking in human beings is international organised crime.
It is the most rapidly developing type of crime at the present time, if we consider for instance the rapid spread of cybersex on the Internet.
In order to combat this, we need well-organised international cooperation.
We need a clear legal basis.
We need to take the struggle up to the level of a joint European Union policy, so that we can reduce the number of slaves by half within 10 years, as underlined by the report.
The report highlights the need for the complete implementation of the existing structures.
I concur with that 100%.
Europol must make up for its idleness up till now, and ascertain the criminal networks, methods and persons involved.
At the same time, the opportunities afforded by the European Neighbourhood Policy must be more effectively implemented.
Based on the present incomplete information, the victims of contemporary slavery in Europe are mostly from Moldova and Ukraine.
In order to prevent trafficking in human beings, those countries need know-how and financial assistance like that provided to candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania.
The victims of trafficking in human beings are made all the more vulnerable by the poor economic conditions of their families and home countries.
As the leader of the Moldova delegation, I am well aware that every third woman in Moldova is unemployed.
At the same time, sources argue that every other prostitute in Paris is from Moldova.
It is clear that these facts are connected.
Womenâs unemployment and the shortage of sources of subsistence make it possible for criminals to trap their victims with simple lies of well-paying jobs abroad.
Therefore I share the rapporteurâs opinion that in political discussions with third countries, the Council and Commission must also very seriously raise the topic of trafficking in women and children.
For my part, I would like to draw attention to witness protection as a recognised method of combating organised crime.
In combating trafficking in human beings, one should also permit victims who testify to start a new life in a new country if they so wish.
Of the members of the European Union, only Belgium and Italy do this.
Thank you for your attention, and once again I would like to express my deepest thanks to the rapporteur.
Â Â  Madam President, there are always three sides to the trafficking of human beings: the victims, the organised crime networks and the demand side.
The customers, or âclientsâ, are predominantly males who feel that they have a right to buy women, or rather, girls.
Should we grant them this right without limits?
A recent comprehensive study commissioned by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality and conducted by the Italian-based Transcrime Institute, shows that this restrictive view on the demand side has a decisive impact on the number of victims of trafficking.
I am pleased to say that Finland is about to adopt a law similar to the one in force in Sweden, criminalising the buyers of sex.
The Prets report which we are now discussing is weak in that respect.
I know it will take some time before a majority of Member States have criminalised the buying of sex, but is it not time that we criminalise the buying of slaves and criminalise the men who buy the victims of trafficking?
I will end this speech in the same way I have promised to every time I speak in this House: â âI therefore maintain that prostitution must be abolishedâ.
Â Â  Madam President,
I wholeheartedly welcome Mrs Pretsâ report on combating the trafficking of slaves and those who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation.
It is a flagrant denial of the fundamental rights of a human being and must be addressed effectively.
I welcome the Commissionerâs comment that practical support must be provided for those who are victims of trafficking.
Allowing those who come forward to remain in the country would be one way of helping them to get out of the situation they find themselves in.
I would caution against approaching this problem, as we heard from one person here tonight, with a âfortress Europeâ mentality and using this as an excuse to reinforce borders.
I welcome the reportâs emphasis on setting defined targets to tackle trafficking in the coming years with a view to its total eradication.
Â Â  Madam President, human trafficking is a very serious violation of human rights.
It is mainly women and children who are, by various false pretences, recruited into it, thereafter being exploited in slavish dependence.
In many cases, those who end up in prostitution are victims of human trafficking, and they are treated like .
We must protect them from this, both in and outside of the Community, with all the means we have at our disposal both in the corrective and preventive spheres.
This means that these modern slaves who are caught up in this vicious circle must be actively given the opportunity of breaking out of it and starting afresh.
We must also prevent people from ending up in that in the first place.
Prostitution is not a normal industry, in which work is carried out, and so it should not be treated as one.
Clients of prostitutes do not buy services, but take advantage of other peopleâs bodies.
That is a form of violence and should, in my view, be punishable in the same way as other forms of violence.
Penalising prostitutesâ clients is the best way of preventing human trafficking.
I should like to thank Mrs Prets for her report.
The amendments I tabled are meant to add detail to it, and I hope that my fellow Members can accept them.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I want to start by congratulating my honourable friend, Mrs Prets, on her own initiative report which aims to highlight the major moral and political problem of trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation.
Despite the difficulty in collecting statistics, the numbers are terrifyingly large, both in terms of the people being trafficked, especially women who fall victim to sexual exploitation, and in terms of the income from this activity.
This is not a new issue, but it is worth asking how European societies and the civilised world in general tolerates and, more importantly, maintains these phenomena.
There are a great many reasons and responsibilities at all levels.
First of all, society is responsible, given that sexual exploitation is not necessary; it is the result of the law of supply and demand.
Secondly, the state is responsible, given that the Member States have not managed to control and combat these phenomena and their impact on the human victims.
However, nor has the European Union been equal to the challenges and created a common area of justice and security.
However, the European Union has certainly played a positive role in raising awareness, in cooperation and in addressing the phenomenon.
The 2002 framework decision and the 2004 directive contributed to a certain legislative harmonisation and to broader cooperation.
We must continue in this direction.
This crime is developing across borders.
Judicial and police cooperation need to be stepped up, using the facilities of Europol and Eurojust.
We need to continue towards the integration and communitisation of our policies which increasingly need to accompany the single market and freedom of movement.
I too would reiterate the importance of a common definition of the crime, so that we can collect statistics, the European arrest warrant, a clear legal basis, so that our policies and their Community and national budgets acquire European added value and effectiveness.
Â Â  Madam President, everyone here this evening has stressed that combating the trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes should be given far greater priority in Europe.
That is also the reason why I should like to thank Mrs Prets for her report, which contains so many specific recommendations.
We are talking about many hundreds of thousands of women and children who end up in this criminal industry every year, the fastest growing criminal activity which generates lots of cash very easily.
More effort is therefore desperately needed.
We should also search our own hearts, for there is no market without clients.
Money must be made, and that is why clients are needed, so we must start close at home in order to raise awareness and public sensitivity, as well as the visibility of this distressing problem, and to discourage the exploitation of these women and children in our Member States.
The Europe-wide anti-human trafficking day, for which this report argues, could serve as a useful instrument in this.
I look forward to hearing what Commissioner Frattini has to say on this subject, and whether he intends to embrace the idea.
At the same time though, we should not shy away from sacred cows in this report, namely the World Cup, for major events such as these have a habit of attracting criminals who want to make a fast buck at the expense of women and children.
We should also take far more decisive measures in tracing and prosecuting these criminals.
Europe is too slow in introducing legislation that intends to combat human trafficking, and the criminal investigation services do not yet accord its combating the priority status it deserves.
That is why I suggested that this legislation be included in the annual reports that we have requested.
Europol too should start tracing criminals as a matter of priority.
It is part of their mandate and they should now also act on it.
I could go on, but I think that this report has set the right tone for adopting a more proactive stance towards this problem.
Â Â  â Madam President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Christa Prets, both for her own initiative report and for her sensitivity towards a social issue of global proportions.
It is a problem about which no-one â and in particular the European Parliament â can remain impassive, especially when the information is extremely worrying for the Member States of the European Union.
The words 'trafficking in human beings', 'sexual exploitation' and 'forced prostitution', at both national and global level, encompass the risk of a pandemic similar to that which poverty and hunger have created, mainly in the developing countries, in the lower echelons of these societies.
Women and children are the victims.
I agree that criminal gangs are operating all over the world.
New electronic technologies give these gangs immunity, often with our tolerance.
However, when vulgar tactics are applied, such as coercion, constraint, kidnapping and threats to unprotected communities, by which I mean women and underage children, then I consider it incomprehensible for us to remain impassive to and remote from the phenomenon of violence and infringement of our human dignity and fundamental rights.
We are all jointly responsible, given that the punishment of traffickers and their accomplices is and remains a theoretical act, not the demonstration of strength in practice that we should all engage in.
To close, I should like to point out that major international events, such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup in Germany next summer, are used as cover for such incidents.
The rapporteur is right to point this out, but the roots of evil run deep and in such cases the best cure is prevention, vigilance on the part of the countries which host such sporting events and, most importantly, public information for the citizens which constitute the shield of society, women and children.
I ask you, Mr Frattini, is the Commission doing anything in this direction?
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all those who have spoken in this debate.
There seems to be total agreement, and I believe that the value added by the European Union, as we address the problem together through a global approach, is clear to everyone.
I should like to focus on a few specific points that have been mentioned.
The Commission will continue to encourage and promote specific projects aiming at the prevention of human trafficking and the protection of its victims, particularly women and children.
I can confirm that I am willing to ensure that the projects that come under the Daphne initiative are kept separate from the anti-drugs strategy.
I know that Parliament specifically wants that and, once you have drawn up a proposal to that effect, I shall be prepared to endorse it and to keep the instruments for preventing and combating the traffic in women and children (the Daphne programme) separate from the anti-drugs initiatives, as they are clearly distinct topics.
I fully agree with the idea of a European helpline for victims, particularly children.
I too am working on a project of this nature and I greatly value the proposal contained in the report.
I am thinking of initiatives in the framework of the Unionâs international policy to reduce or, rather, to root out sex tourism.
This is not exactly traffic into Europe, but there are unfortunately thousands and thousands of citizens of European countries whose ideal holiday is to go to countries where they can have sex with little boys and girls.
Such sex tourism must be stamped out, and I believe that one way to do so is to involve the vast international network of travel agents.
Travel agents know perfectly well, when they organise trips, what the aims of sex tourism are, and so we shall work with the governments of the countries involved and with the network of travel agents to pass on this powerful message at least.
As regards sporting events, this is undoubtedly an important matter.
I intend to write a formal letter to the German Government to recommend that specific preventive measures be taken during the 2006 football World Cup to prevent the influx and concentration of persons who would, unfortunately, be destined to go into prostitution during that period.
It will not be a difficult operation, since these are problems that are easy to spot, and the German Federal Governmentâs means and resources, including its investigative resources, will be in a position to help us.
I shall act on your suggestion and send this request.
I agree on taking a tougher attitude towards customers.
I am personally convinced â I have said this before and I repeat it now â that the clientÃšle needs to be deterred.
There will be a debate on this topic and, although it seems there is some divergence of opinion on it, I believe we can all agree that there would be no trafficking in human beings, or at least much less, if it were not for the people who call for it.
That is why careful consideration is needed, above all by the national governments, such as those of Sweden and Finland, which have adopted that strategy, and also by the European Union as a whole.
Let me repeat my view: we need to be tougher on the customers.
The last subject on which I should like to focus is information exchange: more information must be given to the countries of origin, but also more information must be exchanged within European Union Member States.
Like me, you probably know that a European criminal record does not yet exist for people convicted of paedophilia, for instance.
It was possible for the Fourniret case to happen because nobody in another country knew where this person came from or what sort of person he was.
Today it is necessary to focus on paedophilia, for instance â as we are doing â by setting up a European information register: not a new structure, but a flow of real-time information accessible to all the Member States for certain types of conviction, starting with paedophilia itself, which in my view is one of the most hateful of crimes.
Precisely for that reason, when I spoke to the director of Europol, I could appreciate the organisationâs commitment to combating paedophilia, including through the use of information systems.
I am saying this because MrsÂ Riera Madurell raised the subject.
I can tell you that an initial investigation last year into a gang of paedophiles in 13 European countries, coordinated by Europol itself, led to the arrest of almost 100 people.
That really is good news, even though few people know about it.
I repeat: 13 countries, and coordinated by Europol.
That shows that Europe can and must take action.
Of course, you can always count on my staunch support.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote shall be held at 12 noon on Tuesday.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong by Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo on behalf of the Committee on International Trade (O-0108/2005 B6-0348/2005).
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliamentâs Committee on International Trade, which it is my honour to chair, has participated in the preparation of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong and is currently continuing to work with a view to the next stages of the negotiation of the Development Agenda.
As you know, a delegation from Parliament followed the Conference in situ.
I have been able to tell Commissioner Mandelson that, in Hong Kong, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council were more united than in Brussels, and that was important in this difficult negotiation.
We are now at the stage of evaluating what happened in Hong Kong and preparing the recommendations for the future negotiation.
The Committee is going to produce an initiative report, the rapporteur for which will be Mr Papastamkos.
We hope that it can be approved in April, so that the conclusions can be on the table in time for 30 April.
With regard to the results, the most significant thing we can say about this stage is that we have reached the end of it.
I share the Commissionerâs view that the result are insufficient to make the meeting a success, but sufficient to prevent it from being seen as a failure.
The progress made in relation to agricultural export subsidies, to the production and trade in cotton and access to markets free of tariffs and export quotas for the least developed countries is not inconsiderable.
It is important to confirm to our partners in the developing countries that we remain true to our commitment that this should be a development round.
Nevertheless, we are still a very long way from achieving a global and balanced result and there is still a lot of work to be done if we want this round to be completed by the end of this year, in view of the limitation represented by the expiry of the United States Trade Promotion Authority, granted by Congress.
In Hong Kong, a series of intermediate stages were defined, which include such important elements as defining the methods for eliminating the different types of agricultural export subsidies, the reduction in internal support for agriculture and improving the conditions for access to the agricultural markets.
We shall have to assess jointly whether the necessary, though not sufficient, conditions are in place to achieve a global agreement.
As I said before, an important meeting is going to take place in Geneva at the end of April, at which we believe the European Parliament should be represented according to the methods we agree.
We shall be constantly and vigilantly following this issue.
There are three issues that I would like to mention to the Commissioner.
First of all, the negotiation on services, which is essential from the Unionâs point of view, is currently subject to a different timetable to that of the negotiation on agriculture and access to the markets.
Commissioner, how do you intend to ensure a balance amongst the concessions in these three sectors while also respecting the timetable set?
Secondly, the issue of geographical indications, which is very important to the European Union, particularly in order to safeguard the future of agriculture as compensation for the elimination of subsidies and also in order to defend our quality products, appears to be suffering a delay.
How does the Commissioner believe that this delay can be alleviated?
Finally, with regard to the situation of the emerging countries, who are partners of ours, who may benefit from the âeverything but armsâ initiative, which is an important European initiative, and who may see their preferences eroded, how do you intend to secure the support of the countries close to us for a possible agreement in which we must create a balance between advantages and disadvantages?
This is clearly a complex process, and one in which we must be able to achieve a balance between the Unionâs offensive interests, its defensive interests and the legitimate ambitions of the developing countries, and also to convince our fellow citizens that our interests are better protected within a WTO which is stronger, more open and more democratic.
Finally, Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to thank Commissioner Mandelson and Commissioner Fischer Boel and their teams of negotiators for the efforts they have made and the attention they have paid to us.
I can assure them that they can count on solid, but critical, support from the European Parliament, with a view to achieving these objectives.
Â Â  . Madam President, just to take up on the last point, I attach very great importance to encouraging and facilitating parliamentary involvement in trade matters.
This is a relationship which is very important to me, and I hope that our debate this evening is a further demonstration of that.
I am determined to keep these close and regular contacts between us going in the future.
Indeed, as I look round the Chamber this evening I see that many of us were in Hong Kong together.
This is a sort of early reunion and a good time to take stock.
You asked me to give my evaluation of the results of the Hong Kong meeting and say what conclusions can be drawn from it.
I want to do that.
You have also asked me to set out my views on the next steps that should be taken.
I will give you my preliminary views, but I also want the Members of this House to give me their opinions and reflections in turn, in order to shape my own views.
Therefore, my reflection, which is very topical and an active process, means that this debate comes at just the right time.
I am going to meet other Members here in Strasbourg tomorrow.
I cannot pretend that the Hong Kong conference was a staggering success: it was not.
According to the WTO Director-General, Mr Lamy, we moved from 55% to 60% achievement of the round.
That was pretty small incremental progress, and it certainly is a very expensive 5%.
If you consider how many people were in Hong Kong and how much it cost them to get there and stay there â not to mention the sleep deprivation whilst there! â it was indeed a very costly 5%.
However, it was enough to avoid failure and to prevent the DDA train from derailing.
So it was a good investment; it was worth it.
We have to bear in mind that expectations had been significantly lowered before we arrived in Hong Kong.
We were not expecting breakthroughs and we were not disappointed.
Modest incremental progress was the best that could be expected and that is what happened.
As for the European Union, we ourselves made the best out of what was at times a very difficult situation.
When I say âweâ, I mean all of us â the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
It must be said â and I wish to place on record my gratitude for it â that the support for, and the high level of trust and confidence that was placed in, Europeâs negotiators was of immense importance, value and encouragement to us.
It was important to our collective European credibility and I believe it will be equally important in the months to come.
At Hong Kong we found ourselves at times under very carefully orchestrated political pressure either to concede further unilateral concessions or to accept blame for failure.
In the event, we did neither: we did not give unilateral concessions, nor were we subsequently blamed.
Nonetheless, we made an important contribution, which was recognised as such, by accepting 2013 as the date for the final elimination of all agricultural export subsidies.
In doing so we did not cross our red lines; we remained united and we emerged with both credit and credibility. That is not a negligible achievement.
Europe was firm and reasonable and that is how I should like to characterise what I intend to be our future role and performance: firm and reasonable.
One important achievement in Hong Kong was agreement on the development package, which was made possible by the determined pressure we had placed on other developed countries in the months prior to Hong Kong.
Still, I should have liked the United States, Canada and Japan to follow us all the way down our âEverything but Armsâ road, and go for an all-country, all-product, duty-free, quota-free approach, as we ourselves have granted to the least-developed countries.
Ninety-seven per cent â not one hundred per cent, as we in Europe offer â is a major step forward.
It seems generous, but it will actually allow developed countries to shield some key products that are of importance to a number of LDCs and I regret that.
Similarly, we made progress on cotton subsidies, but the final outcome was, again, disappointing in respect of the domestic subsidies operated in the United States.
More generally, the outcome of Hong Kong leaves us with everything still to play for, and nothing in the final text prevents us from continuing to seek the kind of ambition and balance that have been our watchwords throughout this negotiation.
After Hong Kong we can still continue to seek a round that is economically meaningful and pro-development.
That means both more market access and stronger international trade rules for all.
Having said that, I will not hide from you that the road ahead will be tough for a number of reasons.
Firstly, there is a risk of some front-loading of negotiations on agriculture and NAMA â industrial goods â and then back-loading negotiations on services, rules and GIs.
This has to be minimised.
Secondly, a direct relationship has been established between market access for industrial goods and agricultural goods, which some WTO members might be tempted to interpret as necessitating reduced new market access for industrial goods, as opposed to new market access for agricultural goods.
We will be very vigilant on this.
Thirdly, and perhaps more fundamentally, it was not evident in Hong Kong that other important partners are ready yet to take the hard decisions, to make the offers and the contributions that will be needed if this round is to end on a successful note in a yearâs time or beyond.
Until a sense of mutual responsibility and flexibility â without which we cannot make the trade-offs or the bargains needed to bring this round to a successful conclusion â is demonstrated by all the key negotiating partners, we will not be able to look forward to an early conclusion of this round.
The dust is still settling and we are still evaluating our next moves with a cool head.
As I have said, todayâs debate will be a contribution to the analysis that we are undertaking.
I want to share with you some further thoughts on this.
We should be adamant in having the principle of the single undertaking respected.
That is central to this round and to how the WTO works.
We should not abandon that principle.
We should not accept further feet-dragging either in services, geographical indications or in rule-making areas, and the same is true for industrial goods.
Above all we need to engage with our partners to gauge the real level of ambition and see if our ambitious vision of the round is genuinely shared by them.
I really hope this is the case.
Europe could settle, reluctantly and grudgingly, at the end of the day, for a minimalist outcome.
We could do so if that is what the rest of the world wants.
But I have to say to you that it would be a great shame, a great pity and a great loss to do so.
It would not help our economies or othersâ growth and employment, and it would not help reduce global poverty. That remains the aim of this round.
So I will be engaging vigorously with all my partners in the weeks ahead to see if the negotiating material and the energy are still there for an ambitious and balanced outcome.
However, I am not inclined to sacrifice quality for speed.
I know that the United States Trade Promotion Authority will expire in mid-2007, and I will do what I can to achieve ambitious outcomes within the timeframes that we agreed to work to in Hong Kong, but not if that means sacrificing European interests or those of weak and vulnerable developing countries, which also need to gain tangibly from this round.
This round is not just about competitive, large-scale agricultural exporters but about the generality of developing countries, and their interests cannot be sacrificed for the sake of speed.
Importantly, we should be unambiguous in stating our aims, in particular towards the generality of developing countries.
We should be more active in our bilateral and regional contacts and indicate clearly what we are requesting from our counterparts in the WTO and what we are not requesting or expecting.
For example, that for the vast majority of developing countries we can give a lot, but seek nothing or very little in return.
This would avoid the misunderstandings â some genuine and some, I am afraid, wilfully encouraged â that can grow in the minds of some that this is a sort of extreme cantonist round in which we are trying to extract ounces of flesh from our negotiating partners who are not in a position to pay into this round.
That is not the case; it has never been the case and it will not be the case in future.
More generally, the development arguments need to be restated.
Reducing barriers to trade drives economic growth.
It is not an unfair price to be paid by imposition on developing countries.
At times in Hong Kong I felt that some developing country partners were simply not convinced that the progressive, properly supported opening of markets is good for development at all and that, instead, the panacea for all the developing worldâs illnesses was simply the tearing-apart of the common agricultural policy.
Of course, agricultural liberalisation should take place and needs to catch up, but this round is not an agriculture-only round.
Since agriculture is less than 5% of world trade in goods and services, it is obvious that the biggest gains of this round lay elsewhere, not only for the European Union but in particular for developing countries, which would benefit immensely from expanding their trade with each other where the bulk of that trade takes place, which is in industrial goods, not agriculture.
So the case for a strong South-South dimension of the round remains convincing.
I fully acknowledge the importance of granting developing countries the necessary flexibilities, and we need to explain and stress this all the time in Europeâs approach.
All our proposals include special and differential treatment which, in the case of the least-developed countries and the most vulnerable countries, basically means that they will not be requested to make any liberalising effort in this round.
However, the European Community is not going to sign up to an OECD round in which the G20 group of emerging economies simply sits back and enjoys the concessions made by the developed world without much, or indeed any, gain for the poorest and most needy developing countries.
That is not sellable across Europe; it should not be sellable across the world.
Finally, I should like to talk about your role and contribution in the months to come.
Clearly, the outcome of a negotiation must be sold and, to that conclusion, our policies and positions need to be explained as well.
This is especially true in open, democratic societies like our own.
I greatly appreciated your opinions and your help in Hong Kong.
I thought we really were in a real sense working together as Team Europe, even if on specific issues there were nuances and certain policy differences between us.
I would like your continued help in explaining not only to your own electorates but also to our WTO partners that the European constituency remains ambitious for the DDA, that we are deeply committed to its development values, but we will not be able to settle for an outcome that has nothing in it to enhance European growth or competitiveness or that can help us in creating more jobs to offset those that are lost in Europe as agricultural production falls away.
In trade negotiations you get what you pay for.
Europe will not be ready to pay for a round that offers nothing new on industrial market access, services, GIs or other rules that lend strength to the multilateral way of managing our international affairs.
If there are no advances or real improvements in those areas, then we are not going to pay and be the sole banker of this round.
These are my preliminary thoughts.
I have already started discussions with my main counterparts, and the forthcoming Davos meeting will be the first opportunity to further compare notes with trade ministers.
We will continue reassessing and fine-tuning our negotiating position in the light of the reactions and comments we get from other WTO members, but mostly, of course, from the Council and from you.
I will again outline my approach in a trade policy speech next Monday, 23Â January, in Berlin, after I have heard your views tonight.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I shall refrain from referring to the specific objectives of the European Union and the outcome of the negotiations in Hong Kong subject by subject.
The chairman of our committee, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, has already done so, as has Commissioner Mandelson, whom I feel a need to thank for his negotiating ability in Hong Kong and for constantly updating us Members of the European Parliament in the run-up to and during the conference in Hong Kong.
We look forward, Commissioner, to continuing our creative cooperation.
The overall review of the outcome of the Hong Kong conference is judged to be average but, at the same time, taking account of the objective circumstances, positive.
Average because, on numerous crucial issues of global trade governance there was no substantial progress, just declarations of programmes or declarations of intent.
Positive because, above all, there was a commitment â this was emphasised â to continue negotiations.
The Hong Kong conference demonstrated that our path towards the successful integration and completion of the current round remains open.
Nonetheless, it is useful for everyone on all sides to realise that there is no viable alternative to the multilateral trade system.
There is no alternative which can safeguard economic integration and development, the effective management of increasing economic interdependence and the peaceful and fair resolution of differences.
The successful conclusion of the Doha round negotiations will strengthen and broaden international exchanges and international development.
It will make the international trade system fairer, thereby generating benefits for everyone and will improve institutions and procedures.
It will even act as a dam to the spread of bilateralism and protectionism.
I am certain that the European Union will continue its effort and will develop dynamic initiatives to bring the round to a successful close.
This effort unites us.
It is a common challenge.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, the principal merit of the agreement reached in Hong Kong is that of maintaining the multilateral system and of not derailing the development round begun in Doha.
This agreement, which the Commissioner himself noted is an interim one, is a long way from concluding the round. Much remains to be done.
Following Seattle and Cancun, however, a new setback would have opened the door to a proliferation of even more unbalanced bilateral agreements between the North and the South.
The aim of the round must continue to be one of ensuring that the trade rules serve development, and this must remain the EUâs goal, even though we know that it will mean us obtaining less than what we offer to our partners in the South, not least where market access is concerned.
Commissioner, at times I have been hard on you and the Commission in relation to trade policy.
My group and myself will remain vigilant and demanding, particularly with regard to key issues such as public services or the support measures for LDCs and the ACP States.
That being said, I should like today, in this House, to pay tribute to the work you have done, not only on keeping the European Parliament delegation constantly up-to-date, but also â and above all â on ensuring that the Member Statesâ position was coherent in Hong Kong.
In saying that, I am thinking, in particular, of the difficult decision that had to be taken in order to reach a unanimous agreement on the elimination of agricultural export subsidies by 2013.
It was a long-awaited decision and an important sign â including in terms of supporting and doing more to defend the CAP in the future â even though we know that, as regards agriculture, we still need to break the back of the negotiations on domestic support and market access.
You have also shown the flexibility required to prevent a freeze on industrial tariffs and services, a freeze that would have proved fatal for the negotiations.
You will need to remain flexible because it is only right that developing countries should want to control open trade and to carry on being able to regulate their public services, and that they should not jeopardise their weakest industries.
I have one final comment to make: Hong Kong has demonstrated once again the need for an in-depth reform of the WTO.
We have seen once again the extent to which there is still a deep crisis of confidence between industrialised countries and developing countries and the extent to which the clash between national interests constantly threatens the steps taken towards achieving our common objectives: development, the eradication of poverty and fairer trade on an international scale.
We will only salvage the multilateral trade system by ensuring that it ties in with the other organisations of the UN system that work towards human development. This will be achieved by counterbalancing free trade with social development objectives, which amounts to guaranteeing that trade rules take account of non-commercial aspects, the environment, public health and social rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, the recalibration of the Hong Kong talks forced us all not to hope for historic breakthroughs.
It certainly delivered on this.
As Commissioner Mandelson pointed out, the round was not a failure, but it was hardly a success either.
A lack of democracy pervaded the talks, as they took place behind the closed doors of âgreen roomsâ, and the opportunity to lift millions out of poverty simply did not materialise.
In saying that, I do not wish to take anything away from the very close working relationship that the European Parliament had with the Commission throughout.
Despite the worldâs poorest countries joining hands to make the Doha Round a development reality, they were put in the impossible position either of accepting a text which left much to be desired, or of being on the receiving end of the finger-pointing blame game which plagued progress.
In the space of a few hours on the penultimate day of talks, there was a sudden shift on two problems on which there had seemed to be permanent stalemate.
The EU had a budget plan until 2013 and the WTO concluded the Hong Kong declaration.
They were linked, of course, and everyone here knows how difficult it was for some to give up 3.5% of the EUâs overall agricultural support.
However, one giant leap for the EU does not make one small step for the WTO.
Whilst exalting the successful moves on agriculture we must not overlook the fact that much will be cancelled out by an undermining of the right of developing countries to protect their basic services and emerging industries.
The elimination of trade-distorting agricultural export subsidies in 2013 is three years later than hoped for, and amounts to a symbolic gesture to the worldâs poorest farmers.
Until the dumping of all subsidised crops and products onto their markets is ended, they will continue to face an uphill struggle to lift themselves out of crippling poverty.
Last week Gordon Brown admitted that the UK had failed to maximise on its twin presidencies of the EU and G8 to complete its ambitious development agenda.
He proposed a five point plan to reverse that failure and a push by world leaders to restart and complete the trade talks.
And push we must.
We can do good.
On cotton, we agreed to eliminate all forms of export subsidies in 2006.
We ensured food aid could no longer be used as a system to mask continuing export subsidies, and the EUâs âEverything but Armsâ initiative was supported by all.
Commissioner Mandelson, you said that we were to create a stage.
We should now use that stage as a springboard.
Now is the time to be ambitious again.
Let the EU lead and hope others follow.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, we already knew that there were not really any good intentions behind the trade negotiations, but it must be acknowledged that being at the Hong Kong Conference meant sitting in on a summit characterised by hypocrisy!
I say this because, to be perfectly frank, the developing countries were totally cheated: practically no progress at all with regard to cotton, a sugar and banana reform that continues to be extremely problematic and catastrophic â particularly for the ACP States â and access to the market for LDCs, which, despite everything, is still not completely unrestricted and which has been delayed.
The only compensation for all that comes in the form of very strong pressure aimed at liberalising services and manufactured products, something that jeopardises extremely weak economies.
With regard to agriculture, therefore, one might say that, despite an apparent clash between the European Union and the United States, the policy carried out by both blocs has practically been the same, that is to say the ongoing protection of a type of agriculture.
This clearly shows that the âlowest priceâ policy does not work and that it is not viable in the long run.
Little or no consideration has been given to social and environmental rules, to small-scale farming, to the peasant farmers of the South who are very threatened by the agreements, to the small farmers of the North or to the interests of small and medium-sized farms.
We were therefore expecting the European Union to show a real, coherent interest in the poorest countries.
We were expecting it to promote sustainable development and the harmonisation of trade rules with social and environmental rules.
We did not see any of that happen and we are all the more disappointed as a result.
What next, then, for the negotiations?
We are very anxious about the new approach that seems to owe more to âtop-downâ than to so-called âbottom upâ thinking and that marks a retreat to small group negotiations, which are less transparent and less democratic.
We are particularly anxious about this matter at a time when many of our fellow citizens are deeply concerned about, and doubt, the European Unionâs ability to control economic globalisation, given the way in which it is being managed at the moment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this was supposed to be called the development round, but frankly I think we can sum it up like this: the winner is the self-interest of the Northern countries of the world.
The interests of US and European multinationals â effectively sponsored and represented by the work of the European Commission â have won yet again.
How can one talk about demolishing protectionism or defending the free market when every one of the 25Â 000 cotton growers in the United States receives an average of USDÂ 114Â 000 a year in subsidies?
That results in a 15% cut in the price of cotton on the world market.
The 20Â million African growers are thus reduced to hunger: they include the peasants of Mali, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Niger, all countries ranked at the bottom of the UN Human Development Index.
How can one talk about development policy, when a policy based on the dumping of agricultural produce has been extended until 2013?
The result of that is further destruction of the economies of developing countries, and we must not forget that 70% of the worldâs population lives off the land.
The European Union and the United States blamed each other, but in practice neither one is prepared to cut agricultural export subsidies on cotton straight away.
That means continuing to create a monopoly system dominated by the agribusiness multinationals.
We did not hear a single word about the need to include social clauses and to respect them: there was absolute silence on that topic.
Not only that, but the developing countries have been forced to open their markets to industrial goods from the North, as they must cut their customs duties substantially.
The result of that is unequal competition, which will further destroy what little industry has so far developed in Africa and the poorer regions of Asia.
To the unthinking public, 97% may sound a lot.
We know, however, that the problem will be the 3% of products that will not be allowed to freely access Northern hemisphere markets.
In addition, the development aid promised has not been confirmed in precise figures, and it has not even been specified whether it will consist of actual aid or loans: it is pure window dressing that is being exposed for the sham that it really is.
The services market is being opened up: education and social and health services will increasingly become less of a right and more of a commodity available only to those who can afford it.
There is also the risk that even water may be included on this market as a commodity, one that in the near future will rival oil on the market.
That is not to mention the situation of access to medicines, which are in practice denied to the 30Â million people with HIV in Africa.
I should like to know how one can talk of a development round when faced with such a reality.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst the sixth ministerial WTO Conference may not have been a failure, the very modest progress made in Hong Kong does make 2006 a particularly difficult year for negotiations.
I should like to ask the Commission how it thinks it can galvanise the other partners into action.
The G20âs salami tactics, which Commissioner Mandelson criticises, have eventually resulted in the European Union ending up virtually empty-handed in terms of industrial products and services after all, while more than enough time was taken to thrash out an agreement to end the export subsidies in 2013.
The Commission should therefore pull out all the stops in order to hold onto the momentum of Hong Kong in 2006, so that an acceptable agreement can be reached in the area of industry and the services sector too.
I should also like to ask the Commission what efforts it intends to make in order to give what are termed non-trade issues a more prominent place on the agenda.
Â Â  . Mr President, as one of the 26 MEPs who attended the world trade talks I would agree with the Commissioner that there was some success â it was not a complete failure.
But I must say from my understanding of what happened in Hong Kong that enormous pressure was exerted on the European model of agriculture at those talks, all in the name of helping developing countries.
As I said in Hong Kong and as I said in this House previously, my stance has been that this is a false impression.
A false impression is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to the EU markets.
Nothing could be further from the truth, indeed the least developed countries have very little to gain from such a gesture.
The real winners would be the beef barons of South America, if we were to allow the European farmers to be sold out.
In the streets of Hong Kong we saw Korean farmers fighting for their livelihoods, small Korean farmers threatened by transnational grain corporations which are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries.
In Europe we cannot allow our food supply to be outsourced.
Treating agriculture and food as ordinary products on a production line threatens our very food security.
It is clear that the WTO talks cannot succeed as long as it insists on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihood of our small and medium farmers, because they are the ones at risk, not the agricultural exports, Commissioner.
Perhaps it is time to exclude agriculture altogether from the WTO because, as you said yourself, it amounts to only 5% of world trade.
Why should 5% prevent the 95% progress that could be made?
This should be rethought in the interests of the overall talks, because I believe agriculture will always be a problem.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Mandelson, five lessons have been learnt from the Hong Kong Summit.
Firstly, there is a flaw in our negotiating method.
One year prior to the Summit, we make agricultural concessions by revising the CAP.
The outcome: when you arrive at the negotiating table, whatever talent you may have â and it is immense â you no longer have room for manÅuvre, unless you cross the red line on agriculture.
Secondly, Hong Kong validates Seattle and Cancun.
Despite the fact that agriculture only amounts to 5% of world trade in goods and services, it is undoubtedly the Ricardian comparative advantage of Europe, or why else would it be at the centre of the war that, for example, Brazil wages on us at every summit?
Thirdly, developing countries such as Mexico criticise the ostensibly generous reduction in customs duties aimed at promoting market access because these countries have understood all too well that the customs âgiftâ is not intended for the poor, but for companies from the North manufacturing their products among the poor, for example in Bangladesh or Vietnam.
Fourthly, this reduction in customs duties, while a nice gesture in political terms, is difficult to manage technically. Proof of this is the fact that, after 20 years of mathematical formulas â Swiss formula or otherwise - the Hong Kong declaration is unable to find a solution.
This amounts to saying â and this is my fifth and final point â that the road to a reduction in customs duties is a dead end that should be consigned to the past.
The modern solution consists of deductible customs duties in the form of customs credits or drawing rights provided by the importing State to the exporting State, credit equal to the total amounts of the customs duties levied on the exporterâs goods.
MrÂ Mandelson, if you were to achieve that, you would be Harry Potter, you would have succeeded in marrying together the theories of both Ricardo and Frederick List, you would have resolved the problem of global economic imbalances and you would have protected the interests of the poor and those of the rich, free trade and our social model in one fell swoop.
Â Â  Mr President, before I thank Commissioner Mandelson and he falls off his chair at the thought of my thanking him, I should like to make a criticism of the way that Parliament was involved there.
We had 26Â MEPs, 10Â support staff and a press officer.
At no time did I meet the press officer; at no time did the press officer run anything for the PPE-DE Group â not that he was there to support our Group; he was there for the whole of Parliament.
As the person who co-chaired the Interparliamentary Conference and got the agreement on that co-chairing, I was surprised that we had no press officer.
Robert Portman asked why the European Parliament was there and what the Members were doing.
MrsÂ Kinnock from the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly was there; there were Members from the Development Committee and the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, including me.
I hope you will take that message back.
Commissioner, I would first like to thank your staff: MrsÂ Nikolay was outstanding, as was Mr Trojan.
You also were outstanding in the way you kept us informed and kept us up to date with the negotiations.
You have asked specifically today for thoughts to take forward, so perhaps I can give you a couple of things to think about.
I think you did a wonderful job, but could you explain why the EU is continually being blamed â particularly by the United States â for holding up the talks?
It seems to me that there are other arguments that should be put forward and yet we are not getting the message across.
I have said that in the past and hope you can explain it.
In the Interparliamentary Conference, we succeeded in getting geographical indications forward.
You mentioned that and yet, as far as I know, it was never involved in the final discussions.
It is very important to Europe and many other countries.
I was disappointed by the polarised nature of the debate in Hong Kong.
There were few attempts to bring those differing viewpoints together.
As one of my colleagues said, there was a lot of finger-pointing and blaming of other people, which was counterproductive.
Is the big ministerial âjamboreeâ the best way to continue the negotiations?
Should we not look at a less circus-like approach?
Thank you for all the work you did, Commissioner, and may it continue.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take as my starting point the point just made by Mr Sturdy.
You, Commissioner, asked what you should do in terms of ongoing evaluation, and what we would like you to consider.
Mr Sturdy is, I think, right; we certainly should give consideration in future to whether the single undertaking approach will always be the right one.
Its continued use probably makes sense, but I strongly suspect that the future of the WTO will depend on other methods being found, on a more flexible outlook that will probably involve allowing issues to be negotiated in parallel and the use of a flexible and rolling work plan.
How all that will fit into this round is something I leave to you and your wisdom.
Following on from this is another consideration that you should bear in mind.
This House has always maintained â indeed, I myself drafted a report on the subject some years ago â that we should take note of the bilateral rounds too.
My own group consistently attaches a great deal of importance to the multilateral negotiating round and I am very much in favour of it, but it must nevertheless be clear to us that bilateral negotiations are of value too.
Now for my question: while the old Commission always refused to enter into bilateral agreements with Asia, have you, Commissioner, come to see things differently?
Would you like to set other priorities for work in this area?
Thirdly, I have just returned from Mexico, where, I was surprised to learn, a high degree of importance is attached to the services sector and to investments in infrastructure, although I did get the impression that there was no very precise understanding of what the Commission would like to do and of what we would like to do in the multilateral rounds on services.
Perhaps you could find something to say about that.
My fourth point has to do with standards.
I am firmly persuaded of the need for us to get back to discussing standards in the multilateral round more than anywhere else.
The more participants, the more important that will become.
The more problematic international competition becomes, the more pressing an issue this will be.
What I would like to know is whether you are thinking in terms of a new initiative.
Finally, framework programmes for research are under discussion, and many Members have raised one point that will become important where agriculture is concerned.
Where do you stand on the question as to whether we should invest more in agricultural and structural research?
What line do you take on research into bioethanol?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the process that started in Qatar was called a development round.
The ministerial meeting in Hong Kong did not live up to the promise, and that is worrying because, if we do not succeed in lifting 2Â billion human beings out of poverty and hunger, the world will march towards a series of uncontrollable political and social explosions with devastating effects.
I realise that reaching a compromise was very difficult, but the goal of 2014 for eliminating subsidies is too far off.
I am afraid that many things will happen between now and then.
Perhaps Europe was not entirely to blame, but we were partly to blame â not Commissioner Mandelson, but Europe itself.
It had been said that more needed to be done â and done better â to help and protect those who were unable to do so by themselves and who would be crushed by the market, as is actually happening.
Credit is due to Commissioner Mandelson for having represented a Europe in Hong Kong that was less arrogant than the United States.
It is the state of the West as a whole, however, that must force us to rethink the situation in a thoroughly new way if we do not want the round to collapse under the blows of growing worldwide disorder, which we are already witnessing.
The meetings that we had in Hong Kong demonstrated three essential points: first, the need to reform the World Trade Organisation; secondly, the world order is changing and China is lying in wait for us; and, thirdly, a drastic change is needed in the concept of world trade that led to the creation of the WTO.

Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner and the young team that he put together before the Hong Kong negotiations have failed to balance market access for agricultural products here in Europe against that for industrial products in the countries of the developing world.
The countries of the developing world had good reason to reject your liberalising tendencies, and you were perhaps little more than ridiculous in the eyes of the global public when you then failed to put a long-overdue stop to export subsidies.
We are offering the countries of the developing world a very great deal of market access; the only point at issue is what conditions we impose.
What comes into play here is qualification, participation at our price level and to our standards, so that these countriesâ economies can develop.
Where the developing worldâs access to the market in industrial products and services from our part of the world is concerned, it is vital that these countriesâ development â in commerce, in infrastructure and services should not be wrecked or made impossible; instead that they should be enabled to qualify, in this area too, as service providers who will benefit these countriesâ development.
Then perhaps we can talk in terms of a development round.
I hope that you will think these things through again and give priority to qualification when working through the next round.
Â Â  â Mr President, with a uniform strategy the European Union and the United States of America, despite their antagonisms, have used the sixth ministerial conference of the WTO to step up exploitation of the peoples and the plundering of the wealth-producing resources of developing countries.
Both the results of and the complete lack of transparency in the WTO negotiations are dangerous for the peoples.
The WTO is proving to be an imperial organisation which serves the interests of the multinational groups of big business.
The agreement which came out of Hong Kong strikes a serious blow at basic axes of the economy and countries' independence and sovereign rights in general.
The agreement on agricultural products will speed up procedures to wipe out small and medium-sized holdings and, at the same time, will strengthen the monopolies.
The agreement on non-agricultural products constitutes an insurmountable obstacle to industrial development in developing countries.
At the same time, by opening the markets to natural resources, the consequences will also be disastrous for the environment.
The so-called liberalisation of services â the Bolkenstein directive â which is being promoted through the WTO, will open up Pandora's box and the way for the full commercialisation of commodities such as water, health, education, transport and information, in a bid to increase the profits of the monopolies.
However, the situation is unacceptable and cynicism breaks every boundary in the production and supply of drugs.
This is a crime against humanity, given that over 30Â 000 people die every day, as victims of the exorbitant products of the international pharmaceutical industry, because they do not have access to drugs to combat major epidemics.
This proves that agreements through the World Trade Organisation are simply cowardly ...
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we were expecting much more from the Hong Kong meeting, even though it had already been announced that it was going to be a talking shop.
Beyond the good intentions on the need to ensure a multilateral trading system, too many issues remained unresolved.
Among the many issues that deeply affect thousands of European companies and workers is the problem of the unfair competition waged by certain non-EU countries to Europeâs detriment.
Such unfair competition, as in the case of China, consists of social and environmental dumping.
In plain words, that means European markets are being flooded with very low-cost goods, which in fact cost a great deal in terms of human rights violations, worker exploitation and a lack of environmental protection.
These are shoddily made goods, which literally plunder the intellectual property and technological skills of European companies with impunity.
Bringing down trade barriers is a good thing â nobody denies that â but it must not become merely an opportunity to place counterfeit goods or goods made with slave labour or child labour onto our markets.
In conclusion, MrÂ President, it is our duty to ensure that the WTO regulations include strict rules on safeguarding intellectual property and on protecting quality products by means of geographical indications of origin, and also clauses demanding protection for the environment and for workersâ rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Mandelson, following the WTO Conference, you pronounced that the outcome needed to be a constructive compromise because most people are dissatisfied.
That is a good point and, if it were a question of budget negotiations â a zero-sum game in which concessions in actual fact cost money â you would be right.
In this case, the situation is precisely the other way around.
In trade negotiations, just as much is gained from abolishing customs duties ourselves as from forcing others to do away with them.
This is no zero-sum game.
Even if the conference was not the disaster that many had feared, I think we must be honest and say that it was a failure.
The problems were deferred to a future in which disaster will loom ever closer, and I even think that, for important parts of the industrial and services sectors, the conference made slight changes for the worse to the document.
I detect two worrying reactions.
Firstly, there is a noticeable sense of resignation where multilateral negotiations are concerned and a desire to pin oneâs hopes on regional and bilateral agreements instead.
That would be a big mistake.
Such agreements would never produce results such as to enable world trade to be liberalised in significant areas, and opting for them would be an all too easy way of avoiding phasing out the protectionism that we ourselves practise.
Secondly, I hear people adopting the attitude that âwe did our bit in Hong Kong; it is other peopleâs fault if we are not making progressâ.
I think that that attitude is a recipe for failure.
People should realise that progress in negotiations does not stem from the ability to point the finger at the protectionism practised by other people.
That is like seeing the mote in oneâs brotherâs eye without noticing the beam in oneâs own.
Instead, progress is driven by an understanding of the costs of our own protectionism.
For Europe, the conference in Hong Kong should be a call to wake up, and not only to the obvious fact that the protectionism we practise in agricultural matters is costing us the far more important matter of the liberalisation of trade in services and industrial goods.
Above all, we must realise, together with the United States, Japan and others, that the costs imposed on our consumers and taxpayers by our protectionism in agricultural matters are reason enough for abolishing them.
âFree trade, one of the greatest blessings that a government can confer on a people, is in almost every country unpopularâ, said Thomas Babington as long ago as 1824.
The WTO conference in Hong Kong shows that that might equally well have been said today.
We must all, as consumers and employees, pay the price for the lack of trade liberalisation around the world.
Â Â  Mr President, free access to the American and Japanese market for the least developed countries is a good thing, but this advantage has been considerably watered down by the possibility of many products being exempted.
The same applies to a large number of sensitive products for which no progress has been made whatsoever, again, I believe, as a result of the EUâs own attitude.
Countries that rely on cotton, bananas and sugar were also left behind, clearly disappointed.
It is a very good thing, though, that a deadline for export subsidies has now been set for 2013.
Although this deadline is, I believe, too late, it has been set all the same.
I hope that the Commission will want to phase out those distorting export subsidies much sooner, and I am looking forward to a precise schedule.
The EU has pledged EUR 1 billion of aid for trade measures by 2010.
Can the Commission explain where I can find that amount reflected in the Councilâs multi-annual budget?
The same applies, in fact, to the sum of 200 million intended for the countries depending on sugar production and the pledges made there.
I think we are still writing cheques with nothing to back them up, and it is obvious that we are wholly opposed to the idea of the poor people of Latin America, Asia or Africa paying, as it were, for our solidarity.
In order to turn this development round into a success, the European Union must show its teeth.
Not by now insisting on the liberalisation of services with the G20 â all we need to do is to look in the European Union to see how difficult we are finding this â but by putting the labour standards at the top of the global agenda for the next round and by reforming our agriculture more quickly and more extensively during the current round.
The Commissioner deserves much credit for having averted a failure.
We will only be able to talk in terms of a success at the end of 2006, though, if this round has been actually completed and implemented in a fair manner.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for what he has said, and also to start with a critical observation on our negotiating position as Europeans, for I do believe that we were too honest, in that our position fundamentally repudiated deviousness as part of the negotiating mandate.
I think we need to reconsider this, since all the others used subterfuges.
We did not, instead preferring to put our outcomes on the table very early on.
On the credit side, I would like to point out that your negotiating style and the way in which you communicated information to this House helped reinforce our determination, and for that you have our warm thanks.
That has of course enabled us to influence the budget deliberations in Brussels, and that I regarded as a very good thing.
Where geographical designations of origin were concerned, we got nowhere.
That is something you mentioned, and many speakers have also made it clear how important an issue this is for us.
I have to tell the Commissioner that our geographical designations of origin and the intellectual property that is tied in with them are things for which we have to fight.
In doing that, we will have to be cunning and maintain a united front.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EUâs behaviour in Hong Kong was a disgrace.
The world had hoped that the EU would show leadership, demonstrate its solidarity with the developing countries and make efforts to secure genuine free trade with full access to the industrialised countriesâ markets, particularly for the poorest countries.
The EU should have used its powerful position to develop the WTO into an efficient multilateral agreement system with clear social and environmental conditions for trade.
From where I am standing, however, the EU behaved almost worse than the United States.
It was self-centred, lacking in solidarity, full of tricks and guilty of patently abusing its power in seeking to force the developing countries to open their markets to our exports.
There is no desire to do anything about our own exorbitant and destructive agricultural subsidies.
The agreement on abolishing export subsidies involves too long a delay and is full of underhand provisos.
The EU gets on its high horse over the United Statesâs cotton policy â and, indeed, has good reason for doing so â but it behaves in precisely the same way itself, for example when it comes to sugar.
What should, moreover, have been a development package to set the Thames on fire, and one that would have really got things moving for the poor, has ended up as a piffling little matchbox.
What a disappointment!
