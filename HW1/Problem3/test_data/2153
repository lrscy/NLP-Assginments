In the words of the UK Health and Safety Executive, the body set up to give the UK Government the expert and impartial scientific advice so necessary when dealing with such issues, these amendments provide "no benefit for health and safety and their sole effect will be to place unnecessary and unwelcome burdens on industry, particularly on small firms".
The Executive advises us to oppose most of the Socialist amendments.
Independently, UK Conservative MEPs had come to the identical conclusion.
One of these is Amendment No 18, which I see the trade unions are supporting, while curiously claiming that many employers support it, too.
I have not come across a single employer who supports this.
It will be interesting to see whether UK Labour MEPs vote as their government has advised or their trade unions have instructed.
I suspect the answer will be no surprise.
We shall be supporting the amendment to exempt music from the directive, an amendment originally conceived by my colleague Mr Pronk.
However, that still leaves us with the problems facing industry if other amendments also pass.
It is very telling that in the week EU leaders are in Barcelona, calling for EU businesses to become more competitive, and on the very day that the UK Prime Minister, Mr Blair, is spinning the line that he is so much against red tape, his Socialist MEPs continue to pursue the same old agenda, regardless of the impact on jobs.
I urge them, even at this late stage, to vote against these amendments, to vote for jobs, to vote for reform and to vote for Barcelona.
Mr President, I shall begin my short intervention by thanking the rapporteur for the work she has done.
Having said this, I will express my views on certain points of the report which, in my humble opinion, could have been dealt with differently, and on amendments and proposals which are difficult to accept, above all by professionals in the field of prevention; of course on the basis of the view that there is no such thing as zero risk and that work is an unpleasant activity.
I agree with the rapporteur that combating noise in the workplace is the best thing we can do, but I do not agree that collective protection measures should always have priority over individual protection measures.
In any event, I believe that they are complementary or supplementary, or that individual measures should be applied rather than collective ones.
We must consider the distribution of responsibilities; it clearly falls to the employer to provide the means, and it is they who have the disciplinary policy measures to ensure they are complied with, but the worker is no less responsible, and cannot ignore their responsibility, since they are the first to be affected if they do not adopt individual and personal protection measures.
I also disagree with you somewhat with regard to the scope, since I believe that, rather than talking about including the self-employed within the scope, it would be preferable to include them by means of the concept of workplaces and the person responsible for them, particularly in view of the increasingly frequent externalisation of many activities in numerous work sectors.
Amendment No 15 deals with an issue which is perhaps purely grammatical.
Where it speaks of hearing protection measures 'likely to be used', I believe we should say 'of mandatory use'.
Furthermore, there are activities involving a different intensity of sound at different times, which must be considered and resolved.
I liked what the rapporteur said about music.
All of this, Mr President, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, must be done from the point of view of providing quality employment with less risk to the health and safety of workers, and this objective demands legislation which is clear in its principles and in its wording.
Mr President, I should like, first, to congratulate Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, because she has dealt with what is, both technically and politically, a very difficult issue.
Just how difficult this issue is can be seen from the fact that the amended proposal has been pending before the Council since 1994 and the first part of the proposal on mechanical vibration is only now ready for discussion by the joint legislators.
We put health and safety at the top of the social agenda and we have undertaken to improve protection for workers' health and safety by bringing the directive which already exists - 86/188 - into line with Framework Directive 89/391 and updating some of its provisions.
I should like to point out that some of the proposals we have heard take us behind the current framework and the specific directive which already exists.
Loss of hearing is clearly the most widely-known harmful effect of noise.
It is the most serious, but not the only effect.
And as far as compensation for workers who have suffered the consequences of occupational illnesses are concerned, one-third concerns hearing problems.
In five countries in which studies have been carried out - Holland, Portugal, Spain, France and Germany - compensation for hearing problems costs EUR 96 billion a year.
The Commission has accepted the Council's common position in that it enhances the level of protection set out in the Commission proposal.
The reduction in the exposure limit value from 96 db to 87 db is clearly good progress.
The Commission fully accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 22, which improve the quality of the text and clarify its meaning.
The Commission partly accepts Amendments Nos 4, 15, 16 and 19 and rejects Amendments Nos 3, 5, 13 and 21, together with Amendments Nos 23 and 25.
Although I agree with the idea behind Amendment No 3, the second part of Amendment No 4, Amendment No 5, Amendment No 13 and the second part of Amendment No 16, the Commission cannot accept them for reasons of consistency and legislative procedure.
The Commission also rejects Amendment No 21, because it feels that the manner in which the Member States obtain access to the relevant medical and scientific advice is a question of subsidiarity.
Finally on the question of compromise Amendments Nos 23 and 25, which temporarily exclude music and entertainment from the scope of the proposal, the Commission is strongly opposed to this derogation because there is no scientific justification for it.
Applying health and safety measures to the music market will affect 3 to 5 million workers in Europe.
Factory noise has been compared with the noise from music or concerts.
I think the figures speak for themselves.
Musicians constantly performing in concert are continually exposed to noise levels as high as 130 db.
Constant exposure to this noise gradually gives them problems with their hearing, without which they cannot do their job.
I should also like to remind the House that HINDREC, the European Association of Industry, Hotels and Restaurants, agrees with the proposal currently on the table.
And there is another statistic I should like to give you: the noise level in small pubs is in the order of 75 db, that is, well below the limit value of 90 already set.
Finally to ear protection available on the market.
If you surf the Internet you will see all these new aids, which are very different from standard ear muffs. Basically what they do is to reduce the sound to which each worker is exposed to a level set by the worker, so that they can do their job without suffering this gradual deterioration in their hearing.
Finally, I should like to remind the House that there are another two physical agents in the workplace, optical radiation and electromagnetic fields, and that we need to start work on the next two directives, which are also very important and affect large numbers of workers.
Mr President, two things.
First of all, I should like to tell the Commission that I am pleased about the amendments that are being supported. I am rather annoyed that the Commission has not thought along the same lines as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regarding Amendments Nos 3 and 5, because they specifically emphasise the efforts at prevention I tried to emphasise in my speech.
I therefore hope that the Commission will reconsider them.
I would also ask the Commission to give us a little help today in responding to something said by Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mr Pronk.
Could the Commission first of all explain to these gentlemen that there is also something called sustainable development within employment and that, when we talk about wanting a proper working environment and proper health and safety regulations, what in actual fact we want is a sustainable labour market from which people are not excluded?
Mr Bushill-Matthews must also agree with me that, in the long term, what is economically most sustainable is not to have a whole lot of people sitting on the 'reserve bench'.
And, talking about a 'reserve bench', I also wish to address Mr Pronk and ask the Commission to help me a little.
Could the Commission explain to Mr Pronk once and for all that people who play football or go to football matches will not be affected by this directive?
And perhaps we could also, once and for all, have the lobbyists locked out of this House.
Mrs Diamantopoulou, do you wish to make any comment?
No.
Thank you very much.
The vote is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the Commission communication on unfair practices by airlines of third countries.
Mrs de Palacio has the floor.
Mr President, I am pleased to announce to the House that the Commission has decided to propose to the Council and the European Parliament a Regulation on the adoption of legal measures to react against the unfair competition practiced by third-country air companies receiving State aid.
We have all seen over recent months how, owing to several different circumstances, third-country air companies have received large amounts of public subsidy which in many cases have been used to lower fares and create unfair competition on routes on which European Union air companies compete.
This has created a legal vacuum which has placed our companies at an unfair advantage in comparison with the companies of third countries.
In order to provide ourselves with instruments which can allow us to defend and support our air sector, which is absolutely strategic for the European Union, we are going to propose, and today we have adopted, the proposed regulation on predatory practices within the framework of air transport services.
In the field of sea transport there is already legislation to combat charges which create unfair competition and in other areas, such as aid granted in the manufactured goods sector, we have other instruments.
Ladies and gentlemen, all of this is for a very simple reason: because the air services sector is not included within the multilateral agreements of the World Trade Organisation.
In this regard, it is a question of establishing forms of compensation to counter the advantages that the use of this State aid or non-commercial advantages represent for these third-country companies to the detriment of our companies.
I believe that it is a balanced regulation which contains - as you will see when you analyse it - a definition of what its principles are, of what is meant by guaranteeing fair competition, of what is understood to be unfair charging practice and establishes a procedure which guarantees that in no event will there be either overcompensation nor advantageous actions.
In this respect, by means of a complaint or simply as a matter of routine, it is proposed that the Commission should open an investigation to determine whether or not there is unfairness in the charges implemented by third companies, and, in accordance with the particular situation, there will either be an agreement with the country or with the relevant company, or, if not, measures may be taken, either provisional, for 6 months, or permanent, until such a time as there is a change by the relevant third countries or companies.
I believe that this is absolutely essential if we are to genuinely guarantee that we are going to prevent unfair competition and our air sector being affected by State aid or non-commercial advantages.
Mr President, I think the Commission is right to take action in this direction because we, as the European Union, need legal tools to deal with the specific issue of unfair competition from third countries.
Of course we shall be examining the Commission proposal in the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and studying the details, but I should like now to ask you three very brief questions.
First, have you already got evidence or at least received accusations from various European companies of unfair competition from third countries, America, Switzerland or other countries which we read about in the press from time to time?
Secondly, you referred to measures to be taken by the European Union in such cases.
What sort of measures are to be taken and how do they stand in relation to the transatlantic agreements already in existence on which the Advocate-General of the European Court has already expressed an opinion?
In other words, how do the bilateral agreements stand in relation to the European Commission's multilateral measures?
Thirdly, a question which bears no relation to this issue but is highly topical and, if you wish, you can answer us.
What is to be done about covering the European airlines' insurance premiums?
Cover expires at the end of March.
What is the European Commission's position on this?
I would ask all honourable Members, if they can - and I believe this is possible - to summarise their questions in no longer than one minute.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would simply like to pose two questions to supplement the comments made by Mr Hatzidakis.
If we call for new instruments, the question we will be asked is this: What are we doing with the existing instruments, and why are they not sufficient?
That is the reason for my two supplementary questions.
Firstly: Do we not already have the option of taking action against Switzerland?
I believe that what Switzerland has done with regard to the restructuring of Swissair into Crossair, Swiss Airlines or whatever is clearly a subsidy case.
Even if the treaty has not yet been ratified, there must be opportunities outside the treaty to proceed against Switzerland.
When will you do so?
Secondly: If we take action against unfair practices relating to ticket dumping outside the EU, can you tell us what you propose to do to combat internal price dumping within the European Union in the immediate future?
There are increasingly frequent cases of airlines offering tickets below cost price in order to control the market.
Do you intend to tackle this problem as well?
Mr President, I have a quick question for the Commissioner regarding the point of providing proof.
If a third country does not provide the information that is required to discover whether they are involved in unfair competitive practices, what would the Commission do?
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
It is true that two companies have caused this situation, one quite directly and the other in a more general way.
It is also true that various ministers, in their speeches at the last Council and in a letter that they have sent to me, have expressed their concern at the situation.
I repeat, however, that although there have been no complaints, this proposal will enable the Commission to take formal action.
With regard to the transatlantic agreements, the problem is that, at the moment, there is no EU-US agreement, for example.
There are only bilateral agreements with Member States of the Union, and these do not contain clauses that, in general, provide for the resolution of these situations of unfair competition.
Where insurance is concerned, the situation, in principle, has not changed.
We still maintain that on 31 March, the special guarantee for the provision of insurance by the Member States will end for new risks related to terrorism or to war.
Nevertheless, the Transport Council is due to look at this issue and consider practices in the United States and in Japan, because a normal insurance market will not function unless the United States and Japan and their airlines are also involved.
I wish to thank Mr Jarzembowski and Hatzidakis for their questions.
I should like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that this measure will work against any third country that grants State aid which is used by its companies to distort competition and which, therefore, encourages unfair competition.
As for Switzerland, ladies and gentlemen, you are all aware that the transport agreement has still not entered into force, not through any fault of Switzerland, but because of the three European Union countries that have not yet ratified it.
The fact of the matter is that we do not know how long this situation will take to be resolved.
In any event, also with regard to Switzerland, we must be adequately covered from the legal point of view.
I should like to reply to Mrs Foster's question on proof.
Ladies and gentlemen, in all of these types of mechanism, the States involved must provide proof.
Sometimes, third countries are reluctant to do this.
One possibility is that compensatory rights could be imposed, to be paid by companies engaged in unfair competition, to compensate for and eliminate this unfair competition.
These rights will be limited to artificial price lowering, but under no circumstances can this lead to additional costs to what is a reasonable fare, as defined in the texts we are debating.
I forgot to say in my answer to Mr Jarzembowski that we are investigating unfair competition within the European Union, when it occurs and, to be specific, at the moment we are looking at a problem concerning the use of an airport in Belgium.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to ask you this: What influence do airport duties have on these practices?
Mr President, I withdraw the question I was going to ask because it has already been put by Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Jarzembowski.
I thank the Commissioner for her communication but I would like her to say what she means by 'unfair competition' because I did not fully understand this point.
Unfair practice occurs when an airline that has received State aid in its own country does not use this aid to cover a certain type of cost but to artificially lower prices on routes in which it is in competition with European Union airlines.
With regard to the receipt of airport taxes, one way of receiving these compensatory rights, would be to impose a surcharge on airport taxes.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
That concludes this item.
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0008/2002).
Part I
Question No 34 by JosÃ© MarÃ­a Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado (H-0079/02):
Subject: International adoption of Romanian children
What action is being taken by the Commission (and, in particular, by its representative in Bucharest) in order to ensure that the review of the cases involving the international adoption of children which the Romanian Government suspended over nine months ago is carried out promptly?
Is the Commission aware that such suspension is having a serious effect on the hundreds of Community families who have applied to adopt children on the basis of full guarantees and who have paid out substantial sums of money?
What action is the Commission intending to take in order to protect the rights of those people?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, child protection in Romania is one of the most important issues arising within the framework of cooperation between the Commission and Romania, and it is an issue which I myself have also dealt with regularly and pro-actively since the start of my term in office.
There is no doubt that there have been serious problems in Romania regarding the protection of children in state-run institutions and also regarding the system of international adoptions.
Romania has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Hague Convention on Protection of Children.
The Hague Convention signatory states have joined with us in expressing their frequent concerns to the Romanian Government about the very serious shortcomings in the Romanian legislation and procedures governing adoption and the way in which they are implemented in practice.
I must tell you, Mr Gil-Robles, that I personally had no choice but to acknowledge that in Romania, there has been a very high incidence of commercial trafficking of children - which is just about the worst crime imaginable - but that on the other hand, adoptions have of course also taken place entirely in accordance with the proper procedures, and that a substantial grey area between the trafficking of children and normal international adoptions has existed.
The Commission therefore brought intensive pressure to bear on the Romanian Government to embark on a radical overhaul of the entire system, starting with the legislation and including the institutions, structures, procedures and decision-making channels - indeed, every aspect of the process.
Nothing in Romania's system of international adoptions could possibly remain as it was.
To ensure that no abuse of children can occur while these reforms are under way, the Commission resolutely supported the imposition of a moratorium on international adoptions.
I am very pleased to say that the present Romanian Government has succeeded in enforcing this moratorium.
It is not the Commission's policy to block international adoptions.
Quite the contrary - the Commission's policy is to help ensure that these international adoptions take place within a system which is entirely transparent, conforms with internationally recognised rules, and excludes any possibility that a single case of child abuse could occur.
I hope that appropriate legislation and administrative procedures will be put in place in Romania within the near future so that the normal systems governing international adoptions can be resumed.
The cases which you referred to in your question, Mr Gil-Robles, and which had already been initiated but where a decision was still pending when the moratorium was imposed are being examined by the Romanian Government on a case-by-case basis, and if it is quite clear that there are no problems with the adoption, the Romanian Government has the option of suspending the moratorium in these individual cases.
I believe that this will help to resolve the problem you describe.
However, let me say again, Mr Gil-Robles, even though this may not be welcome in some quarters: in striking a balance between protecting children in Romania and the needs of prospective parents - whichever country they may live in - our first priority must always be to protect the child.
I think it is quite reasonable to say to families who wish to welcome an adopted child into their lives that they have to wait another few months, rather than run the risk that even a single case of the corruption which was rife in Romania's child protection system could recur.
Commissioner, I have listened to you with the utmost respect, but there is another question I wish to put to you: why did the Commission, in the EC-Romania Association Council meeting, oppose that Council asking the Romanian authorities to pass this legislation, which they promised for the end of last year, as rapidly as possible?
We have had a moratorium in place since June 2001 and the Romanian Government has formally declared that this legislation would be ready by the end of last year.
According to my information, however, although it has been approved by the Council of Ministers, it has not been submitted to Parliament and is still floating around, no one knows exactly where.
I am surprised that the Commission, whose intentions the Commissioner has expressed very clearly, is not attempting to kick-start this process.
I fully agree that the priority must be the children's welfare, but this will not improve by holding up legislation that will enable international adoptions to take place.
The way to improve their welfare is to push ahead, as quickly as possible, with this legislation, and not to leave these children in the orphanages until that happens.
I should like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen and his staff for the consistent concern and attention they have shown with regard to this important issue.
Is the Commissioner aware that 93% of Romanian people are against inter-country adoption as a solution for abandoned children in Romania, as is the Romanian Government, and that the Romanian Orthodox Church to which 89% of Romanian citizens belong, wholly opposes such a practice?
Is he further aware that the payments made by these Spanish families have gone to Romanian foster families over a period of time, and thus these children are not officially abandoned according to international conventions, particularly the UN Convention, which has been ratified by the governments of all the Member States, including Spain and therefore forms a part of the acquis communautaire?
Baroness Nicholson, I am aware of the problems you describe, and I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the very resolute and determined action by the Commission with regard to the protection of children in Romania has resulted, not least, from the consistent pressure applied by the European Parliament.
It was this House which repeatedly called on the Commission to reject any compromises on the protection of Romanian children, and the Commission is firmly adhering to this course.
I fully agree with Baroness Nicholson that international adoptions are by no means the best instrument to protect children.
Nonetheless, I believe that in the Romanian case, they are an option which we should not rule out entirely.
Mr President, I agree with Commissioner Verheugen when he says that the most important aspect of this type of case is the welfare of the Romanian children.
There are, perhaps, two aspects of this matter that need to be raised: firstly, is Romania adequately protecting its children?
Are there any alternative systems?
Can the European Commission adopt measures to guarantee improvements in the way these children are treated?
Secondly, since Mr Verheugen is a member of a Commission that represents the countries of the European Union, has the Commission adopted measures to ensure that, in the event that international adoptions take place involving citizens of Community countries, guarantees will be provided in the reception countries for Romanian children to be treated appropriately, in accordance with international law, Community law and with the national law of the Member States?
Commission. (DE) Mr Medina Ortega, on the first point, I can tell you that the Commission has allocated substantial human and financial resources to improving conditions in Romania's childcare institutions for many years.
I am sure that everyone in this House is aware of the appalling conditions in these institutions directly after the revolution, and, indeed, for many years afterwards.
Thanks to the help we provided, much of it as pre-accession funds, steady improvements in the situation have been achieved.
Nonetheless, we are still a long way from a situation which we could describe as satisfactory.
This is why these measures will be continued on an intensive basis.
On the second point, I fully agree with you.
This is precisely the aim of our efforts in Romania and in conjunction with the Romanian Government - to ensure that the system governing international adoptions is fully and unequivocally in line with the standards required by the European Union and international law.
Question No 35 by Proinsias De Rossa (H-0097/02):
Subject: Chemical and electro-shock technology
Given recent concerns over the use of chemical and electro-shock technology in torture and human rights violations, how many companies manufacturing such equipment have received the CE quality mark?
Also, what is the process by which the CE mark is awarded to such products, and is the ethical question of how this technology is to be used considered as well as the safety of the user of the product?
Further, what research is used by the Commission as the basis for the decision to award the quality mark?
The CE conformity marking was introduced into Community legislation by a Council decision of 1990 concerning the models for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures which I intended to be used in the technical harmonisation directives, and by the Council directive of 1993.
The latter introduced the CE marking into a number of sectoral technical harmonisation directives.
The CE conformity marking must be affixed to any product falling within the scope of a technical harmonisation directive providing for it.
It signifies that the product complies with the legally binding requirements of the applicable technical harmonisation directive.
The manufacturer is responsible for affixing the CE conformity marking, although the directives often require the intervention of a third-party conformity-assessment body.
Member States are responsible for the designation of such bodies in accordance with the applicable provisions of the directives.
A number of services in the Commission are responsible for technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking, although most fall under the responsibility of DG Enterprise.
However, the Commission intervenes directly neither in the process of evaluating the conformity of products nor in the award of the CE conformity marking.
All manufacturers of stun weapons falling within the scope of the technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking must affix this marking to the relevant products.
The Commission does not have information about the number of manufacturers involved.
The Commission has already replied to this issue in 1997.
The question was then posed by Mrs Wemheuer.
The Commission then noted that a wide variety of equipment could potentially be used for the purpose of torture.
Moreover, it is not always possible to determine in advance to what use such equipment will be put.
I am therefore of the opinion that it is not feasible to apply a different treatment in the context of these directives to equipment that could potentially be used as an instrument of torture.
Nevertheless, and in order to take account of the concerns of the honourable Member of Parliament, the Commission, and especially the Director-General for External Relations is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
The aim of this regulation is, inter alia, to impose controls on exports of equipment which may be used for such purposes in a third country, which will in principle include electric shock equipment.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply and I welcome the proposal to prepare a new regulation.
Could you indicate to me when you expect this regulation to become effective?
Would you not also agree that, while there is obviously some equipment which may or may not be used for torture, stun gun equipment is made to deliberately inflict pain on the person against whom it is used; that up to 50 000 volts can be delivered to a person by a stun gun or by the stun belts which are also used; and that it is inappropriate for equipment of this kind which is marketed by the manufacturers of these torture weapons to carry an EU quality mark as a sign of EU approval of these particular instruments of torture?
I can inform the honourable Member that I will pass on the question of the timing of the regulation to my colleague, Mr Patten.
As far as the other questions are concerned, a recent report by Amnesty International says that stun guns are not used for torture or ill-treatment by the police or prison guards within the European Union.
The use of stun guns is for self-defence and riot control is not in question.
The other issues you raised must be reviewed in the context of this regulation.
I shall be ready to inform Parliament once I have obtained more detailed information from my colleague and his departments.
Mr President, the Commission has made representations to the Nigerian Ambassador in Brussels with regard to this case and President Prodi has appealed directly to President Obasanjo to intervene.
The developments in this case are also being followed closely by the Commission Delegation in Abuja.
An appeal has been lodged by the defendant and will be heard on 18 March 2002.
In the meantime, the sentence has been suspended by the Islamic Appeal Court of Sokoto.
The European Union is strongly opposed to the use of the death penalty.
With a view to attaining the prime objective of abolishing the death penalty where it still exists, the EU calls for its use to be progressively restricted and made subject to minimum standards.
The EU is also pressing for moratoria to be introduced where relevant.
The Troika recently made a demarche on the application of the death penalty in Nigeria.
The Commission is seeking to end the practice of public and particularly cruel executions pursued in certain Islamic countries.
In the case of Nigeria, the Commission will work through the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, two of the fundamental conditions of which are respect for human rights and equality between men and women.
Where these conditions are not met, the Agreement allows for a process of political dialogue between the national authorities and the Commission.
The country support strategy for Nigeria has identified the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights as areas requiring action and corresponding programmes will soon be forthcoming, including programmes to improve the status of women.
In addition, within the framework of the Community budget, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights includes Nigeria as a "focal country".
Nigeria is eligible for support for measures in the field of good governance and this will have a positive impact on the status of women by raising awareness among them of their legal rights.
A project is currently under way to strengthen civil society, especially in northern Nigeria.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response.
It is a delicate time, whilst an appeal is going on, to be raising what are emotive issues and I understand how difficult it is for you, Commissioner, to give a full outline of what action the Commission would take in future if the death penalty were to be imposed.
However, could I take this opportunity to ensure that, with the good offices of the Commission, and utilising the partnership agreements we have with Nigeria, there will be a greater understanding, not only of the respect for human rights, but also of our total abhorrence of the death penalty in any form, whether it be by electric chair or by stoning or by any other method.
I would have this strength of feeling with regard to America, as much as with Nigeria or any other country in the world that continues to use the death penalty.
If possible, could the Commission make resources available to make sure this woman has proper legal representation to guarantee that she has a fair hearing and that every resource is utilised to save her life?
Efforts to increase awareness of the rights of people within the framework of Sharia law are part of all the work we do, especially relating to the situation of women.
We are, in Nigeria, focusing a major part of our development cooperation at state level on a number of states.
This brings us closer to the authorities, and also, in some cases, closer to some of the states where Sharia law has been instituted.
We are trying to position ourselves in a manner which makes a meaningful discussion possible.
The broader issue of the death penalty is quite clear.
It is a global issue and I am sure it is something which we all agree on.
Finally, let me add that I very much appreciate the Member's approach and his tone given the fact that we are at a sensitive stage in the case in question.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am very grateful for your reply and relieved that the Commission has acted so swiftly in this matter.
The punishment of the woman in question was based on Islamic law.
An unmarried woman had become pregnant, by all accounts as the result of rape.
The question as I see it, however, is not just the status of women, but an attempt at power politics, where Islam is being used in Nigeria to stir up the feelings of the people and create artificial disputes, as I have brought to the attention of the Commission in my earlier written questions.
I would now like to ask whether the Commission has considered any tools that might be used through our policy on development cooperation to lessen this ever-growing exploitation of religious tension.
This will, in any case, be the theme of the analysis of what we can do.
I should warn, however, against the perception that our development cooperation activities with a given country make it possible for us to influence events of this kind profoundly.
The introduction of Sharia law in a number of northern states in Nigeria is a complex and highly political process with local roots.
We have a shared framework of values as expressed in the Cotonou Agreement. This is what we can discuss and pursue with the Government of Nigeria.
This is not an easy case, but it is one in which the widespread public attention it has attracted and international public opinion can really be of use.
We at the Commission will do what we can to help exert pressure.
Question No 37 by Karin Riis-JÃžrgensen (H-0148/02):
Subject: Take-over bids
Does the Commission believe that European companies will be given a disincentive to be listed on stock exchanges - and the development of efficient equity markets impeded - if the EU introduces a break through rule de facto eliminating shareholders' multiple voting rights in the event of takeovers as proposed by the High Level Group of Company Law Experts?
Does the Commission believe that owners of shares with multiple voting rights would suffer a loss if the EU introduces a break through rule de facto eliminating shareholder's multiple voting rights in the event of the takeovers as proposed by the High Level Group of Company Law Experts?
The Commission wishes to thank the honourable Member for her questions and her interest in the Commission's work concerning the matter of takeover bids.
It is still, however, a bit early for the Commission to provide final answers to those questions.
The Commission has launched a thorough examination of the recommendations made by the Group of High Level Company Law Experts relating to takeover bids and has consulted interested parties in order to decide whether and how such recommendations could be included in a new proposal for a directive.
The Commission is aware of the criticism raised by certain Member States regarding the specific recommendation on multiple voting rights and the possible loss of certain rights after a takeover bid via the "breakthrough" mechanism.
The Commission will, wherever possible, do its utmost to take account of the various opinions expressed during this phase of informal consultation with all interested parties.
I am afraid I can say no more at this moment, but no doubt Mrs Riis-JÃ¶rgensen, the committee of which she is a member and myself will engage in dialogue as soon as a more concrete proposal has been formulated.
I would also like to ask Mrs Riis-JÃ¶rgensen to contain her impatience until then.
Commissioner Bolkestein, women are not very patient but I will try to be patient and wait for you to come up with proposals which, hopefully, will balance all the interests you have mentioned.
I look forward to a thorough discussion and cooperation.
Thank you very much, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen. That is very kind of you.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.

Questions to Commissioner Lamy
Question No 38 by Paul RÃŒbig (H-0135/02):
Subject: Impact of the WTO disputes settlement procedure on SMUs
In paragraph 39 of the report on openness and democracy in world trade, which the European Parliament adopted in October 2001, Members expressed concern at the direct and grave effects of some WTO dispute settlement cases on undertakings throughout Europe, particularly SMUs.
Parliament called on the Commission to take concrete steps, both within the EU and at the WTO, to give such undertakings legal recourse to seek compensation.
What concrete steps has the Commission so far taken to this end?
What steps are planned? What is the Commission's view of the call for WTO punitive duties to be paid from the general budgets of WTO Members rather than by private enterprise?
The question concerns the impact of the WTO disputes settlement procedure on small- and medium-sized undertakings.
As you know, the WTO disputes settlement procedure is essential in ensuring that the multilateral trade system is secure and predictable.
The suspension of trade concessions, which are sometimes wrongly referred to as sanctions, is the last resort for a State which uses the dispute settlement procedure where the State that is at fault has breached either the agreements or the decisions taken under the WTO dispute settlement procedure.
From our point of view, the main benefit of the system for European businesses, including SMUs, is that it applies great pressure to respect the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
This is the main benefit for our businesses, and therefore for SMUs too.
There are, without doubt, cases where the international agreements have been breached and these must, of course, continue to be the exception.
On this point, we believe that compensation must be preferable to the withdrawal of trade concessions and, within the framework of the WTO, compensation, which is a voluntary measure agreed by the plaintiff State, is a better option.
In addition, this measure is only provisional.
Otherwise, the system would not be as secure and predictable.
I should like to give you two examples. Firstly, in the case of hormone-treated beef, we effectively lost a case at the WTO.
The Commission submitted a proposal for a directive in 2000.
We also hope, and I want to make this clear to the House, that the co-legislators are going to take a close interest in this.
We regret that this is not the case at the moment.
In the meantime, we are conducting negotiations with the United States to find an interim solution which, broadly speaking, would enable them to export greater quantities of hormone-free beef.
This is a case where, temporarily, compensation may enable a solution to be found.
Secondly, as part of the reform of the disputes settlement procedure, we recently submitted a proposal to the WTO in order to facilitate recourse to seeking compensation, as a real alternative to the retaliatory measures, in particular by providing for an arbitration mechanism on the amount of compensation.
This would have the huge advantage of enabling all parties involved in a dispute to negotiate on the basis of a figure set by a third party.
Mr RÃŒbig, this is the information that I can give you on the solution that is sometimes envisaged of possibly establishing such a supranational punitive system at the WTO.
We do not believe in such a system.
It would involve a fundamental change in international relations.
That is why we do not feel that the international fine option is, at this stage, the correct course of action, if only because it does not provide an answer to the question of what coercive measures to implement in order to force parties to pay a fine that they wish to avoid.
In contrast, we prefer the current system and the compensation system, which - and this will be my final point - is always provisional since the underlying objective of any system that imposes discipline and respect for these disciplines is to force the State at fault to toe the line.
That is our guiding principle.
Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that the imposition of punitive duties is a very powerful instrument which may threaten the economic survival of individual undertakings.
That is the reason for my question: Which methods could you envisage in future to protect enterprises from the adverse effects of such measures?
Would compensation, tax relief or other options be a possibility so that individual enterprises do not have to bear the consequences of a dispute settlement procedure?
Well, I think that the answer to your question, Mr RÃŒbig, is, in that case, to move from a system of sanctions to a compensation system which obviously has the advantage of being much more voluntary.
But the idea that businesses, which may fall victim to a system of sanctions, could have the right to compensation, for one reason or another, is not recognised in either international or Community law.
We have also challenged the American system at the WTO, for example. This system was conceived several years ago and finalised last year and involves compensating businesses that fall victim to antidumping with the income from antidumping rights.
We believe that this system provides an incentive to commit fraud and, therefore, we are not considering compensation systems.
Once again, sanctions are only there to apply discipline and if we can effect the transition to a compensation system, then we would have a system that is more voluntary and is, if I may so, less random and punitive than sanctions.
Many of the problems that affect injured parties in trade disputes, especially SMEs with limited resources, arise from the time it takes for the WTO to make its rulings - often many months, if not years.
No doubt this will be the case with the new steel dispute with the Americans.
But rather than granting compensation, which would probably arrive too late to prevent the business concerned from going to the wall, would it not be better for the WTO to have a system of temporary injunctions, which would require the suspension of such actions on the basis of prima facie evidence of illegal action until substantive decisions can be made?
Would the Commissioner be in favour of such a system?
If so, could he suggest how one might go about implementing it?
I agree that it is a very good idea, Mr Purvis.
The international legal system, and that of the WTO is rather slow although it is in fact not much slower than our national legal systems when dealing with this type of case, but 'summary' type proceedings, which you refer to as injunctions, might be appropriate.
I have two comments to make in response to this point.
First of all, it is a good idea.
Secondly, as it happens, the WTO disputes settlement procedure is still in its infancy.
It is barely five years old, which, for legal proceedings, is still very young, especially for France and we are, for the time being, working on improving other parts of the procedure.
I acknowledge, however, that this is a question that we must ask ourselves when the time arises.
However, this type of procedure does not provide a response to an objection raised, which is how do we go about ensuring that injunctions or summary proceedings of this sort are observed? If they are breached, do we have recourse to trade measures?
I do not think that the use of law enforcement authorities provided for in Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter is applicable in this case.
And as soon as this ceases to be the case and that there is no, if I may say so, State authority in command of a police force, you come back to the problem of sanctions.
The idea is a good one, but we must still answer the question of knowing how to implement this, if not through sanctions and compensation pay-outs, which brings us back to the previous problem.
Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr Lamy.
Questions to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m
Question No 39 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0062/02):
Subject: Packaging and packaging waste
Has Greece notified the Commission of its national measures to implement Directive 94/62/EEC
Mr President, an infringement procedure against Greece was opened in 1996 regarding the failure of the Greek authorities to transpose Directive 94/62 on packaging and packaging waste international legislation.
In July 1998 the Commission received notification from the Greek authorities on a draft law which would transpose Directive 94/62.
However, this draft law was not immediately adopted into Greek legislation and so transposition did not actually occur in 1998.
On 13 April 2000 the European Court of Justice condemned Greece for non-transposition of Directive 94/62.
On 2 May 2000 the Commission requested information from the Greek authorities regarding the measures taken to comply with the Court ruling, but no information was provided.
The procedure stemming from Article 228 was initiated against Greece on 8 November 2000 and a reasoned opinion was sent to Greece on 10 April 2001.
On 2 August 2001 Greece adopted Law 2939/2001, thereby transposing Directive No 94/62 into Greek national legislation.
The Commission received notification of this law from the Greek authorities on 26 September 2001.
This law has satisfactorily incorporated the observations of the Commission concerning the notification text transmitted to the Commission in 1998 and the procedure against Greece under Article 228 regarding transposition of Directive 94/62 was therefore closed on 20 December 2001.
Thank you, Commissioner, for such a detailed reply, full of dates and numbers.
The only question which remains is, when will the provisions of the directive and the law which you mentioned to us start being applied?
I am asking because there has been very heavy rainfall in Athens over the past two days, coupled with a strike by refuse collectors, and the huge volume of rubbish to which this directive applies has blocked all the drains and the town has flooded.
Can you tell me what is being planned apart from formally introducing this law?
I think that there are deadlines.
Can you tell me what your views are?
When, roughly, will the volume of rubbish start decreasing and a different sort of policy - a recycling and recovery policy - be introduced?
The Greek Government should have already started to implement the directive so I hope that it is now properly transposed and that all the necessary measures have been taken by the Greek Government to make sure it complies with the existing directive.
Question No 40 by Glyn Ford (H-0092/02):
Subject: Water Framework Directive
By 2015 under the new Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC
The water framework directive has set the objective to achieve good status for all waters in the European Union.
It will address all relevant sources of pollution, including industrial activities.
As a tool to achieve this objective the directive follows a combined approach of emission controls addressing pollution at the source and water quality standards to be achieved for the particular water body.
Complementing existing Community legislation on major sources of pollution, urban waste water discharges, pollution from agriculture and impacts from large industrial installations, the water framework directive foresees emission controls for particularly hazardous substances and water quality standards at Community level.
Commission proposals for these to Parliament and the Council have to be submitted by December 2003, also taking into account cost-effectiveness and proportionality.
Participation of all relevant stakeholders will be one of the key elements of the directive.
This will be achieved by mandatory public participation when developing and adopting the necessary river basin management plans, but also by broad participatory processes at EU level, facilitating the implementation of the directive.
This process is to ensure input and participation by all interested and involved parties.
Further, Community research efforts under the Sixth Framework Programme will support the implementation of the directive, as will the LIFE financial instrument in the field of innovative and integrated techniques and methods.
Beyond those measures the Treaty provides for clear guidance as regards financing Community environmental policy being, as a rule, the responsibility of Member States.
On state aids the Commission does not intend to propose changes.
I am slightly disappointed with the response from the Commissioner.
While I am fully in support of strong, effective and costed legislation to force improvements in environmental standards governing water quality and other matters, and of the proper policing of such legislation, I would also like to see this stick approach complemented by, as it were, a degree of carrot.
In my own region - and particularly in Cornwall, which is an Objective 1 area - we have very many small and medium enterprises that will find it most difficult to comply with this legislation.
I would like to see some financial incentives or rewards introduced to enable them to stop polluting water.
If we merely have, if you like, the stick approach and no carrots, then I am afraid we are going to find it more difficult to reach these standards and, at the same time, increase suffering in some of the very small enterprises in the UK county hardest hit by job losses, when we are actually spending considerable sums of money trying to create jobs there.
Mr Ford, I wish I had more carrots and more money to provide us with a financial incentive, but I do not have this money and it is actually for the Member States to follow up and ensure that they create the kind of financial steering instruments and the kind of financial incentives necessary here.
That is the only answer I can provide apart from repeating that we have some funds available, LIFE, project funding and research.
But we cannot go into each and every Member State directly and create those incentives.
That will have to remain the responsibility of the Member States.
I have a very specific question: When will the treatment of waste water in Brussels comply with the legislation?
The implementation of the waste water treatment plans in Brussels is long-awaited and, as you know, we have initiated infringement proceedings against Belgium on this matter.
According to the latest information we have received, it should be ready by 2006.
Question No 41 by Nuala Ahern (H-0093/02):
Subject: Assessment of radioactive emissions from Sellafield and Cap de la Hague
Has the Commission already made an assessment and if not, will it undertake an immediate comparative assessment of the details of radioactive effluents and emissions released respectively from the Sellafield nuclear waste and fuel processing plant, operated by BNFL in the UK, and the La Hague nuclear waste and fuel processing plant, operated by COGEMA in France, as published in the Commission Radiation Protection Report 127, Radioactive effluents from nuclear power stations and nuclear fuel reprocessing plants in the European Union, 1995-1999, and the report prepared for the European Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment Programme (STOA) on 'Possible Toxic Effects from the Nuclear Reprocessing Plants at Sellafield (UK) and Cap de la Hague (France)', published in December 2001 and November 2001 respectively?
Mr President, I am wearing my Irish scarf today.
In response to the question, the Commission has compared the following two reports: its own radiation protection report 127 (Radioactive effluents from nuclear power stations and nuclear fuel reprocessing plants in the European Union, 1995-1999), published in December 2001; and the so-called WISE report, drawn up for the European Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment Programme (STOA), on the possible toxic effects from the nuclear reprocessing plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague in France, published in November 2001.
In particular, the Commission compared the reporting of radioactive effluents released from the Sellafield and La Hague sites.
The Commission can confirm that the data reported in the two documents were found to be consistent.
The difference between the two documents lies in the fact that the Commission document simply reports discharge data whereas the WISE report presents an analysis of the impact of these discharges on human health and the environment.
A separate analysis of the data carried out on behalf of the European Commission is now available on the Europa website and I will ensure that a copy is made available to the honourable Member.
In order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of all historical discharges on the northern European marine environment, in 2000 the European Commission launched the so-called Marina II study, which will be completed this summer.
It will provide additional detailed information on radioactive discharges and resulting activity concentrations.
It will also make an assessment of their levels in northern European marine waters and their impact on human health and on the environment.
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
I am aware of the Marina study.
I am very interested in its outcome.
It will not report for a while yet, as you said.
However, I should like to ask, based on that and the assessment you have already made, what further steps the Commissioner would recommend to control the continued emissions of radionuclides from Sellafield and La Hague.
They are the largest man-made radioactive emissions and pollutants and do not pollute just EU Member States but migrate across the globe.
Indeed, Norway has complained particularly about the Arctic fishing grounds being affected.
What would you recommend as a result of all this assessment and forthcoming studies?
You recently visited Ireland - you have your Irish scarf on!
You indicated that you are concerned about the emissions from Sellafield.
We also have a recent RPII report, which I would recommend the Commission to study.
You urged the Irish Government to pursue the issue at EU level instead of simply under the OSPAR.
I have also made a complaint.
I want to ask you to address that in depth.
I have had to engage a lawyer to follow up the fact that this has not been dealt with responsibly over the last couple of years.
There has also been a recent departure of a Commission official, Mr Curry, to the board of BNFL.
Has the Commission agreed that this is not a conflict of interest?
Mr President, firstly, I would like to say to Mrs Ahern that the overall objective lies in meeting the OSPAR commitment, the aim being to achieve a substantial reduction in discharges by 2020.
The Commission is committed to helping OSPAR achieve that aim and the Member States will assist them to that end.
We are, of course, following developments closely.
That is our task, but only after the Marina study is complete will we be provided with a good basis and platform, a scientific assessment of the situation enabling us to judge what exactly we should do and find the correct measures, if necessary, to help reduce discharges.
So once the Marina study is complete there will be another opportunity to take stock and decide on the measures to come.
I have indeed heard and seen in the media that Mr Curry has been appointed to the Board of the BNFL.
Since, to the best of our knowledge, Mr Curry had not contacted us in advance to notify us of this new appointment, the Director-General for Personnel and Administration sent him a letter asking him to clarify his situation further and reminding him of his obligations under the Staff Regulations.
We are looking forward to a reply from him.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question which interests me is this: what is the legal basis - the relevant legislation and technical directives - for the assessment of radioactive effluents?
We make use of our Legal Service to assist with our obligations under international conventions and with the basic safety standards which it is the role of the Commission to establish.
We also make use of experts and have expert committees comprising representatives and experts from all the Member States.
We base that on the best available scientific knowledge.
Question No 42 by Pernille Frahm (H-0100/02):
Subject: Brominated flame retardants
In the light of recent research (e.g. at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science) showing that brominated flame retardants used, for example, in TVs and computers, have been found in large quantities in fish and in mother's milk, will the Commission take initiatives seeking the introduction of a total ban on their use?
Recent research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science has found the brominated flame retardant penta-bromodiphenyl ether (penta-BDE) in freshwater fish.
Previous studies have shown that penta-BDE is also found in mothers' breast milk.
That is the brominated flame retardant that belongs to a group of ten chemicals known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PDBEs.
Three polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants are available on the market. These are: penta-BDE, octa-BDE and deca-BDE.
Penta-BDE is used almost exclusively as a flame retardant in polyurethane foams such as those found in vehicle upholstery and household furniture.
At present there is a Commission proposal to ban the use of penta-BDE as from 1 July 2003.
A major use of octa-BDE is as a flame retardant in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastics, whereas deca-BDE is the flame retardant of choice in high impact polystyrene.
These plastics are used to mould, for example, housings for computers and as packaging for electronic appliances.
Due in part to the presence of brominated flame retardants, including octa-BDE and deca-BDE, in electrical and electronic equipment, the Commission has proposed that Member States set up separate collection schemes and ensure the proper treatment, recovery and disposal of such equipment.
Furthermore, in a parallel proposal the Commission has called for a ban on the use of polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in electrical and electronic equipment as from 1 January 2008.
The common position adopted by the Council on 4 December 2001 brought forward this date to 1 January 2007.
At present, octa-BDE and deca-BDE are undergoing risk assessment within the framework of Council Regulation 793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances.
Risk reduction measures in addition to those mentioned above may, if necessary, be proposed in the future.
Mr President, thank you for your answer and for the attention that is being given to this matter. However, I can remember a time when no one could discover how to replace asbestos.
What in reality got things moving was the desire to ban the material. I can now understand people's wanting to make collections.
That is also all well and good.
However, it is of course not only a question of what happens to the material when it is worn out but also of what happens to it while it is in use. The problem is that, when in use, it emits materials that are absorbed partly into our blood, partly into our layers of fat and partly into mother's milk.
Now that there has been an investigation indicating that the quantity of brominated flame retardants in mother's milk is forty times greater than had previously been assumed, we would ask if it might not then have been a good idea to draw up a long-term plan for when these substances might also be banned in their two aforementioned forms, which I shall refrain from trying to pronounce.
I agree entirely.
These flame retardants belong to a group of chemicals which we must keep an eye on, but that alone is not sufficient.
We now have a ban on one of these flame retardants, and the two others have undergone risk assessment.
In a few weeks or at least in a month or two, we should be able to decide on the next step.
We have not ruled out introducing further bans, but we want to have an opportunity of assessing what needs to be done on the basis of these risk assessments.
We do not rule out any measures for actually dealing with these chemicals which, as has been pointed out, accumulate in the environment.
Furthermore, we must ensure that recycling takes place and that the old materials are collected.
We must have control of where these substances occur.
Madam Commissioner, do you know whether any Member States are already giving serious consideration to the possibility of banning these brominated flame retardants at present, or, indeed, have already introduced such a ban?
Yes, I am aware that this debate is underway in several of the Member States.
I know that such a debate is taking place in the country I know best and that this is also the case in other countries.
This question has been brought up on several occasions and has been discussed in the Environment Council.
There is a great deal of interest in it.
I believe that we are all agreed that we need to take action to control the use of these dangerous chemicals and, it is hoped, ensure that we can find safe replacements as quickly as possible.
The risk assessments and risk evaluations give us that opportunity.
Question No 43 by Patricia McKenna (H-0101/02):
Subject: Ireland's compliance with EU environmental laws
During Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m's recent visit to Ireland she stated that she would use the leverage of structural funding to force Ireland to comply with some key directives such as the Nitrates Directive and the Framework Waste Directive.
Apart from the ongoing legal actions, what does the Commission exactly propose to do to ensure that Ireland complies with EU environmental laws?
Is the Commission envisaging toughening the current, protracted complaint-making procedure to penalise Member States who consistently fail to comply with EU law and what would these reforms consist of and when would they be launched?
In light of the numerous environmental complaints filed by individuals and organisations in Ireland, the highest rate per capita in the EU, what kind of supplementary resources is the Commission prepared to make available to ensure that these complaints are processed swiftly and effectively?
Questions to Commissioner Fischler
Linkage between allocation of Community funds and compliance with Community and environmental law is even-handed and applies to all Member States.
Linkage has already been established between Member State compliance with key aspects of the habitats and nitrates directives, and funding under the Structural Funds Regulation and the Rural Development Regulation.
As the linkage deadline for structural funds approached at the end of 2000, Ireland dramatically improved its level of compliance with the habitats directive.
The immediate focus is now on the Nitrates directive.
Ireland is currently the only Member State with no nitrate-vulnerable zones.
In its rural development plan, Ireland committed itself to complete designation by the end of 2001.
As this has not yet happened, the Commission will not approve any modifications proposed by Ireland to its programme under the Rural Development Regulation.
Recently, Ireland brought forward a routine modification which is now blocked by the Commission's services.
The amount of discussion on designation in Ireland at present reinforces the importance of this action and I look forward to Ireland completing its designation very soon.
The framework waste directive is not an issue since Ireland has submitted a complete set of up-to-date waste management plans.
As regards the toughness of Commission enforcement procedures, steady incremental reforms have already speeded up case handling.
These reforms involve better internal use of information technology and a quicker dispatch of warning letters to Member States.
Furthermore, in 2000, the Court of Justice imposed its first financial penalty in a case concerning waste management.
As regards the allocation of supplementary resources to speed up the handling of Irish cases, my services keep resource needs under constant review.
However, the honourable Member will be aware that the Commission must operate within overall constraints that are very tight, and that there are many competing demands.
Commissioner, I received your letter today after your visit to Ireland, but the last point you raised, which your letter failed to address, relates to the lack of resources in the Legal Unit of the Environment Directorate to deal with complaints.
This is a major problem that has to be addressed, because the rights of EU citizens are being denied where complaints are not being fully examined. At the same time environmental damage continues.
We must address that.
In relation to waste, the problem with Ireland is that it is failing to comply with the waste directive.
In today's Irish Times Wicklow County Council admits to the existence of up to 88 illegal dumps, 19 of which have not even been examined yet.
That council has been suspected of being involved in dumping in some of these illegal sites and the EPA, the body responsible for protecting the environment, has actually granted a waste licence to one of these illegal sites.
Unfortunately our minister has today ruled out any kind of independent inquiry into this.
In the light of the failure of the Irish authorities to comply with EU directives, particularly in relation to waste, is there any possibility that the Commission might consider sending in an independent team to investigate the damage that is being done and the irregularities present in relation to waste in this area in particular?
I must say, after listening to you, that it is clear that Ireland is where the resources ought to be put to take care of the waste problem.
I also wish that I could have more staff, to be better able to deal with all the cases, but it is in Ireland where action needs to be taken to comply with the directives, including the waste directives.
I know from my visit to Ireland what a very important, controversial and difficult issue this is.
I understand that it is a big challenge to Irish society and its government to handle the waste problem, and I have of course made my understaffing problem known in the Commission's internal discussions on resources.
Action absolutely has to be taken in Ireland to comply with our directives.
I hope Commissioner Fischler understands that Members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy fully endorse what the Commissioner has just said about the need for extra resources to ensure that environmental legislation is properly enforced.
But it is not just Ireland that is causing difficulties.
In October last year a reasoned opinion against the construction of the Odelouca dam in Portugal was issued and yet I understand that construction on the dam started in January this year.
What steps has the Commission taken to try to persuade the Portuguese authorities to stop construction of this dam?
. That is a completely different question and I would like to have the full background so that I am fully updated on all the facts.
I would be more than happy to answer to your question, but please give me a chance to look into that particular case and then come back to me so that I can give you an updated reply.
This is a supplementary point.
What Mrs McKenna said about Wicklow County Council is absolutely true.
Revelations followed daily and the local authority had a heated and intense discussion on this question yesterday.
I have made a complaint to you regarding the illegal waste dumps found in Wicklow.
However, it is now possible that the local authority itself is implicated.
This is very serious and yet the Irish Government is not setting up an independent enquiry.
Is there anything that the Commission can do and will it address my complaint speedily?
Yes, we take all complaints seriously and we work on all complaints.
We have, as you know, a record number of complaints from Ireland in particular.
We look into those as speedily as possible.
There is also the possibility for me to raise this issue in my contacts with the Government of Ireland.
This is what I intend to do.
These are concerns that were very clearly expressed by people in Ireland when I was there. I will definitely take them to the minister responsible and to the Irish Government.
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 44 to 47 and 74 will be answered in writing
Question No 48 by Alexandros Alavanos, which has been taken over by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0064/02):
Subject: Quota buy-back by tobacco producers
The regulation on tobacco, as last amended, makes provision for tobacco producers to buy back quotas allocated to other producers, who are leaving the sector, in order to improve their business and their financial position.
However, the Commission's recent announcements and decisions concerning the phasing out of aid over three years have effectively scuppered the quota buy-back programme as tobacco producers cannot afford the outlay and additional investment required when they do not know whether tobacco subsidies will be available for the 7-8 years minimum period they need to recoup their costs.
What guarantees can the Commission provide to induce producers to take part in the quota buy-back programme under Regulation (EC) 1636/98
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the quota buyback programme in the tobacco sector was introduced to make it easier for producers wishing to switch away from tobacco to embark on conversion.
For specific types of tobacco which face steadily declining markets, the buyback price was increased significantly so that producers have an incentive to cease cultivation.
With regard to the acquisition of quotas from the buyback programme, however, the other tobacco farmers who wish to purchase the quotas have priority.
We can only buy back the quotas which are not bought by other tobacco farmers.
For the coming three years, the Commission has submitted a proposal for a Council regulation which sets the premiums and quotas until 2004.
Among other things, this proposal provides for a restructuring of the Community Tobacco Fund in order to finance studies in the Member States on the opportunities for conversion of tobacco production to other crops outside the tobacco sector, and on the initial experiences of this conversion.
In this proposal, the Commission has also announced a further proposal for the first half of 2003, which will be based on the guidelines contained in the Commission communication of 16 May 2001 on the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development.
To this end, it is essential to ensure that there is precise information available on possible alternatives and the socio-economic impact of phasing out tobacco subsidies. A study is therefore also being undertaken at present to evaluate the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco.
This study should be ready at the end of this year. It assesses the socio-economic impact of tobacco cultivation in the various production areas.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
I think that the question by my fellow Member, Mr Alavanos, was based on the following argument, which is extremely serious.
If you subsidise the takeover of quotas by other producers, obviously the producers who take over this production potential need some time to amortise their investment, about 7 or 8 years.
If you say that you are going to stop paying them a subsidy within three years, then there is no point in their taking over the quotas.
And I should also like you to explain the following contradiction.
You say, Commissioner, that you will carry out a study to see what the possibilities are for other crops.
Quite right too and we have been supporting that here for some time now; however, you yourself have replied to repeated questions which honourable Members have put to you in the past, saying that this is more or less impossible.
Have you perhaps any more news on this front?
Mr President, that was not really a question, but of course the Commission is well aware of the effects of this quota buyback programme.
However, I must also point out that this is an entirely voluntary programme; no one is forced to buy quotas.
For this reason, we also cannot raise any legal expectations should the phasing out of subsidies for tobacco cultivation take place at a later stage.
However, I would also like to point out that we will have an opportunity later this week to discuss the future of the common organisation of markets in raw tobacco in great detail during Thursday's debate here in the plenary.
The three-year extension and its implications will be a key issue in the debate.
Commissioner, what are tobacco producers in Granada going to live on now?
What do you think the prospects for employment are for the 2000 or so families who made a living from tobacco?
Please be so good as to answer in writing if you are not able to give an answer straightaway.
Cetarsa has announced that it will be closing its Granada factory and Mr Prodi has, to stir things up, announced that there will be no more aid for tobacco growing.
I ask you Mr Fischler, as Commissioner for Agriculture, what guarantees can you offer Granada's tobacco growers?
Please answer me, but give me an answer that talks about alternative jobs and practicalities and do not try to silence us with rabble-rousing talk, or some nonsense about alternative crops.
Commissioner, please give us a detailed answer.
Mr President, Ms Izquierdo Rojo, let me answer with due stringency.
Firstly: it is quite clear, also from what was agreed at the summit, that the phasing out of tobacco subsidies must be accompanied by an appropriate range of alternatives.
This means that we can only implement the phasing-out process if we are able to offer genuine alternatives.
That is my position here.
We want to use the Community Tobacco Fund in the coming years for precisely this purpose, so that we are able to try out options and genuine alternatives and see what works and what does not.
Only then will a decision by the Agriculture Council and an opinion by Parliament be necessary, based on a Commission proposal which will draw on the findings of this year's study.
And only then can this phasing out be implemented in practice.
This is exactly why we intend to undertake a study, at local level, of the options available in the most-affected regions: in Granada, in Estremadura, in Thrace in Greece, and a number of other regions.
We will not be fobbed off with far-fetched ideas; we want to investigate the reality.
I think that this is an entirely fair approach.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without going into the issues raised by the honourable lady, I would like to point out on behalf of the Commission that matters concerning the bilateral relations between Morocco and an EU Member State have no bearing on the European Union's comprehensive strategy on the Mediterranean countries.
These relations are governed by the Barcelona Process.
In line with the principles which were endorsed by all the EU Member States and our Mediterranean partners in Barcelona in 1995, trade in agricultural products will be progressively liberalised by all parties.
Against this background, the Community then concluded an Association Agreement with Morocco in 1996 which provides for reciprocal concessions on agricultural products.
The Commission and Morocco recently initiated formal negotiations in order to rework these concessions with a view to deepening the liberalisation process.
Commissioner, your reply has been quite inadequate and confused, because we know from the press that on 15 March negotiations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco on the agriculture chapter will be starting in Rabat.
As I am sure you know, Commissioner, Mr Aznar is the President-in-Office of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union.
I am therefore speaking purely in terms of the EU.
I would like you, Commissioner, to tell me what basic premises you will be working on in these negotiations and whether you think a climate of good relations with Morocco would have been desirable instead of Mr Aznar's scandalous failure.
I am not speaking in the context of Spain but of the European Union, since the negotiations that will be opening on 15 March have nothing to do with Spain and are completely European, just as this House and my question are also entirely European.
And yet the replies you give to the Members of this House are quite unsatisfactory, as if you have no respect for democratic representation.
This is disgraceful!
I would ask speakers to put questions and to state their opinions but not to put words into the mouths of others because this is not what we are here for and nor do I think that this is the spirit in which we should be working.
Mr President, Ms Izquierdo Rojo, let me make it clear: I began by pointing out that a distinction must be made between Spain's bilateral relations with Morocco and the European Union's relations with Morocco.
In my reply, I also mentioned the very negotiations you refer to, which were held on 15 March.
The only detail I omitted was the date when they took place.
However, I really must remind you that the procedure for liberalising trade in agricultural products with Morocco was established as early as 1995.
The purpose of the current negotiations is merely to decide on the next step in this liberalisation process.
It must be clear that liberalisation must be a two-way street.
It is not merely a matter of agreeing on the concessions we should make to the Kingdom of Morocco; the question is also which concessions the Kingdom of Morocco will make to us in the trade in agricultural products.
For example, if you look at recent trends in the trade in agricultural products, you will see that interestingly enough, Morocco's imports such as grain from the USA have increased very substantially.
With regard to the trend in imports from the European Union, the opposite is true.
This is not a one-way street, it is a two-way street.
Of course, we must also be prepared to make further concessions.
Our approach to the negotiations is very constructive.
After all, the talks have only just begun and still have a long way to go.
They are scheduled to close at the end of this year, so there is still enough time to make progress.
Question No 51 by Esko Olavi SeppÃ€nen (H-0083/02):
Subject: Breaking up of fishing vessels
In connection with the consideration of the 2002 budget, an appropriation was approved for the breaking up of Member States' fishing vessels as compensation for the failure to renew the fishing agreement with Morocco.
On what basis is the Commission granting these appropriations?
Can they be obtained not only for breaking up fishing vessels but also for selling them, e.g. to Moroccans, and can subsidies also be paid in respect of the breaking up of vessels built elsewhere with EU aid?
Mr President, Mr SeppÃ€nen, ladies and gentlemen, on 17 December last year, the Council adopted the Commission proposal to allocate appropriate financial aid to fishermen and vessel owners who had operated under the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco, in order to enable them to undertake conversion of vessels and activities.
A total of EUR 197 million will be allocated to the programme: EUR 170 million in this year's budget and EUR 27 million in next year's budget.
The funds are to be used as follows: The share of aid to be allocated to the scrapping or permanent conversion of vessels to activities other than fishing must represent at least 40% of the global amount.
A maximum of 28% of the total amount can be used for the permanent transfer of vessels to a third country with or without the creation of a joint enterprise, or for the modernisation of vessels.
At least 32% of the total amount of aid must be allocated to social measures such as retraining for fishermen who have lost their jobs or part-financing of early retirement schemes.
Thus the permanent transfer of vessels to Morocco through sale or creation of a joint enterprise in Morocco is also eligible for funding.
However, the premium for the creation of a joint enterprise amounts to just 80% of the scrapping premium, and the premium for export of a vessel amounts to just 50% of the scrapping premium.
Furthermore, vessel owners who purchased their ship with Community aid and who now wish to export it or transfer it to a joint enterprise with a Community subsidy must repay a proportion of the subsidy received for the original purchase.
The amount to be repaid depends on the age of the vessel.
In the case of a five-year-old ship, for example, half the subsidy must be repaid.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply, which was quite thorough with regard to the use of this aid.
I would still like to home in on one matter with a question that was contained in the original question. Were these ships, which are now being scrapped or sold to Moroccan buyers with EU aid, possibly financed out of other EU funds at the stage when they were purchased.
In other words, I wish to draw attention with my question to how short or long-term EU fishing policy is.
Mr President, the situation is really quite clear: This is a specific programme which was adopted in order to address the particular problem arising from the non-renewal of the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco.
Within this specific programme, the conditions which I have outlined apply.
Outside the framework of this programme, there are only the Structural Funds for the fisheries industry, which govern all scrapping measures and where the same conditions apply universally.
The additional funds and improved conditions for the scrapping or sale of vessels only apply in this individual case.
As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 52 and 53 will be taken together. Question No 52 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0086/02):
Subject: EU export subsidies for agricultural produce
The EU spends nearly EUR five billion each year on subsidies of exports of its own agricultural produce.
These subsidies seriously damage the prospects of other countries, particularly developing ones, of maintaining a viable position on the market in agricultural produce.
The Court of Auditors has also highlighted the fact that the expenditure is not checked in a satisfactory manner.
The EU's subsidies have come in for strong criticism in the WTO and part of the conclusions of the WTO meeting in Qatar was an objective to review subsidies.
What plans does the EU have for scaling down or phasing out these subsidies in the years to come? Question No 53 by Paulo Casaca (H-0142/02):
Subject: Phasing-out of export subsidies
The Commission undertook in Doha to launch negotiations for the 'reduction of all forms of export subsidies, "with a view to phasing out"'. This agreement, like any of the others and as is usual with such texts, is conditional on the final outcome of the talks.
This bold undertaking by the Commission is also justified internally, given the considerable inefficiencies and abuses which this system has given rise to, not to mention its dubious impact on fulfilment of the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty, especially regarding action to ensure a fair income for farmers.
Can the Commission explain, in terms of timetables and procedures, how it intends to act on this objective, on the basis of full compliance with Article 33, paragraph 1(b) of the Treaty?
Mr President, I would indeed prefer to answer these two questions together, as their content is the same.
In the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the WTO members pledged to engage in comprehensive negotiations aimed at reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies, although the text ultimately adopted in Doha left the final outcome of the negotiations open.
The negotiations will cover all forms of export subsidies, not only our export refunds.
For example, they will also focus on a regime for export credits, the export subsidy element of various food programmes, and trade-distorting practices by state-owned trading companies.
It would be unacceptable to demand a further reduction of subsidies from the European Union alone.
We have already made this very clear in the proposal we put forward as part of the Article 20 negotiations.
Furthermore, the European Union has already reduced its export refunds by 50%.
In 1993, export refunds still totalled EUR 10 billion, whereas they currently amount to less than EUR 5 billion.
The Commission is also endeavouring to shape its export policies in such a way as to avoid negative impacts on developing countries' production when granting refunds.
As far as the common agricultural policy permits, the process of reducing subsidies will continue, with due account being taken of the interests of our own producers and trading companies in this context.
In response to the criticism voiced by the Court of Auditors regarding the use of export refunds, the Commission has devised an action plan which will be implemented during the first half of this year and which will introduce substantial changes to the current system.
As the WTO negotiating round which has now been agreed is scheduled to end in 2004, it would be premature at this stage to determine the European Union's positions in detail or, indeed, predict the outcomes of the negotiations.
Our final positions must be established against the background of the overall negotiations.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for that exhaustive answer.
I think that the European Union is in a unique position when it comes to export subsidies.
The EU is in a class of its own as the biggest subsidising power on a global basis.
My question concerns what the plans look like for the years ahead.
Are there any plans for the next two, three or four years to further reduce the EUR 5 billion granted as export subsidies in the past year?
Mr President, we are indeed the largest market, and we are by far the largest importers of products from the developing countries.
In my view, we should also remind ourselves sometimes that the European Union alone imports more agricultural products from the developing countries than the USA, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia put together.
We therefore have every reason to hold our heads high when dealing with the other developed states.
Furthermore, as you are aware, we have agreed on an open-door policy for products from the poorest countries of the world.
With regard to exports, a key factor in this context is that we can only reduce export refunds in sectors where appropriate reforms of the common agricultural policy are taking place.
If you look at the structure of export refunds, you will see that we spend by far the most substantial proportion of funds on exports of milk products, sugar and sugar products.
Why?
Because the gap with the world market price is still very high in these sectors, and this price can only be reached by carrying out reforms in these two sectors.
On the other hand, in the last two years, we have more or less phased out export subsidies on grain, and massively reduced them on beef.
Given the pace of the common agricultural policy reforms, further reductions in export refunds can therefore also be anticipated.
Mr President, I should also like to thank Commissioner Fischler for the explanations he has given us, which have been extremely useful.
But I must confess, Commissioner, that I am somewhat disappointed at the lack of force in what you had to say about this commitment to phase out subsidies for farm exports, which is absolutely essential. According to the press, since last December this type of compensation has risen very substantially in the meat sector.
I must also point out that in 2001 this reduction was closely connected to the rise in the value of the dollar and not to any reform of agricultural policy; and I must also say that there have been substantial increases in the amounts of subsidies for all products not included in Annex I. This is a situation that concerns me and I should like to ask Commissioner Fischler if he thinks it realistic that these reforms of the CAP that he has been talking about will be carried out in good enough time to be able to gradually eliminate these export subsidies?
Mr President, Mr Casaca, stringency is one thing, but coherence is another.
Let us take the milk production sector as an example, as I have already mentioned.
Under our current organisation of the market, we have a commitment to guarantee a specific price for skimmed milk powder and butter.
As long as this commitment is in place, we can only export butter and skimmed milk powder with appropriate subsidies.
As you probably know, there is currently no political majority in the European Union in favour of reforming the existing organisation of the milk market.
It is therefore a little over-simplistic merely to point out to the Commission that reforms are required.
That is something which should be drawn to the attention, first and foremost, of the Member States.
With regard to sugar, the situation is as follows: We have pledged, also to this House, that we will undertake a study of competition in the sugar industry this year and that depending on the findings, the Commission will then exercise the option included in the extension of the common organisation of the market in sugar: we can utilise the review clause which it contains and then make further proposals in line with this clause.
The reform process, too, is set to continue.
As you know, the next step is the mid-term review in June this year, but in some sectors, further measures are already planned, for example in the olive sector, the fruit and vegetable sector, and in many others too.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler, for your dedication to Question Time this afternoon.
As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos. 54 to 92 will be answered in writing
The next item is the report (A5-0063/2002) by Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the biodiversity action plans in the areas of conservation of natural resources, agriculture, fisheries, and development and economic cooperation [COM(2001) 162 - C5-0467/2001 - 2001/2189(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present to you the report on biodiversity.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Members here today and those who worked with me with a view to drafting and presenting this resolution to you today.
I would also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Development and Cooperation who supported all the drafts that your rapporteur presented on the protection of biodiversity.
Lastly, I would also like to thank the NGOs who really made an enormous effort for this report.
We know that they are excellent observers who have a perfect understanding of the status of biodiversity throughout the world.
Mr President, the situation is not rosy and I would like to answer a question that, strictly speaking, has not been raised but which is often implicit in some Members' comments. What is the real use of biodiversity, or, in more straightforward terms, why protect nature when there are so many other issues of concern?
I would like to remind you that biodiversity plays a part in our own survival and that although nature does not need man to survive, we, as human beings, need nature in order to live.
Our responsibility as elected representatives is to preserve a rich biodiversity.
This rich biodiversity holds the assets for the development of future generations.
Each living species that disappears from the face of the planet is an irreversible and irretrievable loss, and if we allow biodiversity to be destroyed, we are slowly but surely destroying ourselves.
We can see this destruction taking place every day.
Is the Brazilian Congress not due to issue an opinion in the near future on a project that authorises the use of 50% of the Amazon rain forest, which we know represents a huge genetic pool?
It is not out of disinterest that man destroys or threatens biodiversity - very much the opposite in fact.
It is out of genuine interest.
It is because huge financial interests are at stake, involving the precious wood as well as trafficking in endangered species, the intensive farming of land, the overexploitation of fish stocks or even the pillaging of the age-old practices of indigenous peoples.
In order to put a stop to this massacre, the Convention on Biological Diversity was signed at the Earth Summit in Rio.
Ten years down the line, it is still the poor relative - the Convention's signatory States have not kept their commitments and so far no country has biodiversity in its list of priorities for September's summit in Johannesburg.
In just a few days' time, the Conference in The Hague will be held, which will bring together those party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the European Parliament, by means of our resolution, must shoulder its responsibilities and send out a strong and clear message.
We call upon the Union to place the issue of biodiversity on the Johannesburg agenda and upon the Commission to present an action plan at this meeting, as it is doing for the European Union.
We must reiterate the fundamental role of biodiversity as the cornerstone of sustainable development and the importance of the full application of the Convention and its provisions.
We also call on the Union to put in place an ambitious policy to preserve its own biodiversity.
The action plans presented by the Commission in the areas of natural resources, agriculture, development and fisheries, which are the subject of this report, may, of course, be seen as a first step along this road, but they are not enough.
We need additional action plans, particularly for forestry and for transport, as all these Community policies had or still have a negative impact on biodiversity.
And although the Commission claims its ambition is to reverse the current trend, it is fully aware of the challenge that it faces.
The report states - and I quote - that 'during recent decades, the reduction and loss of biodiversity in Europe and worldwide has accelerated dramatically and existing measures have proved to be insufficient to reverse present trends?.
I would add to this the new threats posed by the introduction of certain GMOs and even the conflicts related to the ownership of living things, which give an indication of future ambitions.
To reverse this destructive tendency is a bold challenge, admittedly, but it is one we are prepared to face.
The European Union has still to equip itself with the political and financial means to hope to achieve this objective.
We already have the birds and habitats directives, which enable us to preserve a part of our biodiversity.
We demand that they be applied throughout the European Union, including in the candidate countries and in the outermost regions and particularly in areas such as the coral reef.
We must find ways of preserving these areas.
The second way of making headway in implementing a sustainable ecological development plan, as formally acknowledged at the Gothenburg Summit, is to equip ourselves with effective means of measuring how far the environment is taken into account in the Union's policies.
The Barcelona Spring European Council is due to adopt six environmental indicators.
This is not enough.
No mention is made of biodiversity.
We also call on the Commission to present a specific indicator for biodiversity by 2003.
If we want to make progress in the area of biodiversity, we know that we must begin immediately and continue every day to integrate this problem in the policies of the Union, starting with the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, the policy on transport and the Cotonou development agreements.
Although there is consensus between the various groups within Parliament on the ways of protecting biodiversity, several Members hold conflicting views on the impact of GMOs on biodiversity.
Nonetheless, as rapporteur, I hope that the references to the environmental liability of GMOs for polluting the countryside are retained.
To sum up, allow me, Mr President, to presume that no one would even think of planning to destroy a cathedral, for example, or a listed monument to build a motorway.
We must have the same approach towards preserving our natural heritage and biological diversity.
As you will have realised, the large screens are not working properly; however, the screens serving the President's bench are working.
- (ES) Mr President, farming is an economic activity that depends on biological processes and which accounts for the use of much of the Community's natural resources.
For this reason, it must play a double-edged and central role in the conservation of biodiversity: first, by consolidating farming practices that are compatible with the environment and, secondly, by ensuring the survival of viable farms and systems of production throughout the territory of the European Union.
Both the relentless intensification of farming and the fact that farmers are leaving the industry, with the consequent decline of rural areas, are having a devastating effect on biodiversity.
A Community strategy for biodiversity must guarantee a method of farming that is more sustainable, in the broadest sense of the word, and which, in addition to the biological aspects, incorporates economic and social requirements and, ultimately, the survival of the rural world.
Furthermore, maintaining this sustainable form of farming is a prerequisite for the European agricultural model, which is based on the protection of multifunctionality in agriculture, as the Council and the European Parliament have reiterated in numerous resolutions.
The CAP is a useful instrument for biodiversity, as are the resolutions of the Earth Summit adopted at the Helsinki and Gothenburg Councils.
On this basis it would be a mistake to confine the protection of biodiversity within the narrow limits of the CAP's second pillar and, more specifically, within agri-environmental programmes - designed to encourage the extensification of organic farming, the preservation of native species, the protection of natural habitats, etc. for two reasons: firstly, because the second pillar of the CAP accounts for only 10% of the agricultural budget and, secondly, because although agri-environmental programmes encompass 20% of the EU's farmland, they have been implemented very unevenly and these days they are restricted almost entirely to the least productive areas of five Member States.
This state of affairs is aggravated by the fact that there has been insufficient insistence upon environmental protection requirements in respect of market aid, and this has generally resulted in the setting of excessively low standards.
Therefore, we should extend eco-conditionality and encourage more active use of the agricultural market policy mechanisms designed to protect the environment and biodiversity.
We must support these requirements in our legislation on food quality, plant-health products, seeds and genetic resources.
It is crucial that we strengthen the financial element of the CAP's second pillar as well as making a distinction between its measures for socio-rural development and its agri-environmental measures.
We are facing a major challenge, which is to consolidate Community agricultural policies and to draw them together so that they work in parallel to preserve biodiversity.
Mr President, I should first of all like to say that I am not speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, where I was shadow rapporteur.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for her clarity of vision.
She spoke about Brazil, but I should like to start close to home in discussing biodiversity.
At present in the fishing industry we are depleting glass eel stocks from our coastlines, with the result that the eel itself hardly occurs in its natural habitat.
This seems to me to be an issue for the Commission and our Environmental Commissioner to look into further and to draft a policy accordingly.
The Fishery Committee's second point of concern pertains to the development of genetic engineering in fish farming.
Canada and the United States currently have a system which they can set in motion as soon as they receive the green light.
It seems important to me for the Commission to verify to what extent we can stop this development in Europe, or at least are able to hold a reasonable political debate on the subject before we resort to such technology in fish farming.
The third point concerns aquaculture and the implications on the maritime environment.
We need more research on that score too, particularly to find more closed systems.
The fourth point to which the Fisheries Committee would like to draw your attention is the implications of the dissonance which sometimes exists between bird and fish stocks.
Particularly with regard to cormorants, there are serious problems in Europe.
Fifthly, the Fisheries Committee wants research to be carried out into the connection between climate change and fish stocks.
What is the connection?
Insufficient research has been carried out in that area and we will very much welcome the Commission's action plans particularly on that score.
The sixth point concerns policy we are currently adopting to close areas in order to protect certain fish species.
It is unclear whether this has truly positive effects on fish stocks or not.
More research by the Commission in the framework of biodiversity would be appreciated in that area too.
Allow me to conclude by at least inviting the Environment Commissioner, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, to come and exchange ideas with the Fisheries Committee on these specific points, so as to ascertain to what extent she can make a contribution to the Green Paper on fishery, also in terms of biodiversity.
We would welcome such an initiative from the Commissioner with open arms.
of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. (DA) Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, on her brilliant report.
My only objection is that, because most of the world's biological diversity exists in tropical areas in the developing countries, I should like to have seen the development aspect given a rather more prominent place in the report.
Paragraph 49 calls for EU support for measures aimed at encouraging indigenous peoples to manage and preserve biodiversity.
I have tabled an amendment adjusting the wording to the effect that the EU should support the role which, in virtue of its traditional knowledge, the original population plays in preserving and managing biodiversity.
That applies especially to protected areas in which it is important for the indigenous peoples to participate in management so that forced relocations and inadequate access to resources are prevented.
I have tabled an amendment with a view to having this aspect included in the report.
In a number of developing countries, there is a clear need to be able to derive economic benefits from the sustainable use of wild resources, if people are to have an incentive to preserve stocks.
In southern Africa, elephant populations have become so large that they destroy biodiversity and, given the economic situation of the countries concerned, it is completely unreasonable that the latter should not be able to obtain an income from their elephants.
Biodiversity is now being lost at an unprecedented rate but, for all that, nothing has really happened since Rio.
Biodiversity has become a concept that has been put on the back burner, and it is now our task to try to keep it on the agenda.
In order to tackle the issue of conservation, it is necessary to protect the whole ecosystem.
The Community's cooperation programmes have proved to be sustainable alternatives to a protectionist approach, and I am able fully to support this way of thinking.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, species extinction and the loss of biodiversity in Europe and worldwide are proceeding at an ever-increasing pace.
Despite all the measures we have taken so far, we have quite simply failed to curb this trend.
Following the adoption by the Council of the Community strategy on biodiversity in June 1998, it is gratifying that the communication proposes biodiversity action plans in four areas - conservation of natural resources, fisheries, economic cooperation, and development - and this is of course very welcome in principle.
The Commission's proposals on agriculture are to be welcomed as well.
I am therefore rather disappointed that the otherwise excellent report by the rapporteur takes such a negative view of agriculture - at least, that is how we see it - and fails to make any mention of agriculture's contribution to protecting biodiversity.
My group will vote for this report, but we will vote against it on a number of individual points.
You see, I come from a country which would have no future without its farmers.
Austria is primarily an Alpine country, and without our Alpine farmers - whose working practices date back a hundred or even two hundred years - there would be a great deal wrong with our country.
We are well aware that agriculture - especially non-intensive agriculture - also maintains specific eco-systems.
Some habitats, such as those which exist in the mosaic of planted fields and boundaries defined by hedgerows and ditches, are quite simply vital to protect specific flora and fauna and ensure that they can nest and find sources of food.
I do not want to recite a list of the different types of bird affected or tell you which species have survived as a result of agriculture, and I certainly have no intention of telling you all about plant and insect species.
Nonetheless, I think it is important to mention that non-intensive agriculture - let me emphasise this quite specifically - non-intensive and family-based agriculture has made a very substantial contribution to the conservation of wild and, indeed, domesticated flora and fauna.
I believe that if we fail to recognise the contribution made by farmers today, we are doing a disservice to our natural environment and our eco-systems.
We will vote for this report, but in the areas where we think it does not do justice to our farmers, we will vote against it.
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Mrs Isler BÃ©guin on her report which I think is excellent and constructive.
The protection of biodiversity deserves top priority.
When species become extinct, they are gone for ever, and this is why now is the time for action.
Action plans cannot be non-committal.
They can only be successful if they take account of the socio-economic circumstances of the people in that area.
They must set priorities.
We must tackle hot spots worldwide; areas that are particularly rich in species deserve special protection.
Action plans must be clear and, above all, concrete.
Public support is important, and nobody gets excited about an abstract idea such as biodiversity.
It is about the conservation of the natural resources, valuable landscapes and endangered species.
We must be well-informed, independent monitoring must be put in place, and we must draw up annual balance sheets of the quality of the natural environment.
This motivates and inspires.
The European Union itself should be a little more consistent.
The bird directive and the habitat directive epitomise biodiversity protection.
These must be implemented effectively, however difficult that may be at times.
The end result must always be at the forefront of our minds.
However, these pearls of nature preservation are in sharp contrast with other policy.
I mean in the first place agriculture, but also fisheries.
Large-scale agriculture and the conservation of biodiversity are a difficult match.
The common agricultural policy must for that reason alone undergo far-reaching changes.
Subsidies purely based on production are asking for trouble.
The fishery implications for biodiversity are less visible.
Seabed disturbance in many coastal waters and deeper waters threatens biodiversity.
This should be met with a forceful response.
Biodiversity must form a guideline in regional planning.
Member States should draft action plans for that purpose.
I ask the Commission to select and support a flagship project annually, preferably in one of the candidate countries.
These projects must set an example to other nature reserves.
The Polish primeval forest could be a good flagship project.
I should once again like to thank Mrs Isler BÃ©guin for her sound report.
Mr President, Commissioner, I, for my part, would also like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and the Commission for preparing this matter for debate.
The proposals have an aim worthy of support: environmental diversity is something that is important to all of us.
I would, however, like to raise two matters in this parliamentary report.
Firstly, in item eight the matter of forests is raised, mentioning the desire to see a bureaucratic, centralised monitoring system for the EU based on certification for forests and all living organisms in them.
The use of forests in the Member States would be controlled by the EU by means of action plans.
At this point we must remember that forestry matters in the EU are covered by the principle of subsidiarity and there is no cause to extend Brussels' control in these matters unless there are special reasons for doing so.
Furthermore, all those engaged in forestry matters agree that certification should work on a voluntary basis, and on no account should it be managed by the EU.
Secondly, in item 44 it is proposed that all support payments for agricultural production should be replaced with environment-based aid.
We have to remember, however, the situation regarding world trade which we have today.
If production aid were not paid there would no longer be any agriculture on the present scale in the EU in the future.
How would things stand regarding biodiversity then?
In certain regions of the EU, production aid is, relatively speaking, even more important than in central Europe.
For example, in my country the major problems are not really connected with the state of the environment or biodiversity, but the fact that production must in general be supported, production costs being as high as they are.
For farmers it is a waste of time to talk about additional environmental action, as all production in our country is in practice organic.
I propose that point 44 should be deleted from the text. The same goes for the last part of item 42, where agri-environmental action would be solely geared towards protecting endangered species.
No self-respecting EU institution should record something like this in the resolutions.
Mr President, we agree with Mrs BÃ©guin's report because it is underpinned by a particular situation: neither the Convention on Biological Diversity, signed in 1992, nor the various international conventions incorporated into Community law, specifically the birds and habitats directives, have managed to put a brake on the destruction of biodiversity.
Furthermore, it clearly shows that thousands of species that have not even been identified will disappear.
In fact, 11 000 species of fauna and flora are in danger of extinction. I believe that is sufficient for us to adopt the appropriate measures.
The rapporteur welcomes the plans that are proposed but points out that there are plans that have still not been carried out such as, for example, those concerning forests.
She also speaks clearly about the need to incorporate environmental policy into our other policies, whether they concern agriculture, fisheries or anything else.
As I have very little time, Mr President, I shall just give one example, because examples are the best way of explaining what needs to be done: the use of EAGGF Funds in the destruction of the last remaining laurel forest on the island of Gran Canaria.
I spent last weekend on the island of Gran Canaria with a group of volunteers who protested to the European Commission - I refer you to the question I asked at the time - that in the lime-tree forest of Moya, the only laurel forest remaining on the island, now that all the water that used to come down during droughts has been enclosed in pipes, all the forest's trees are drying up. This is being done with EAGGF Funds.
We must acknowledge all the valuable work done by volunteers, because they give their spare time, unpaid and unrewarded, to fight to preserve this natural resource.
The volunteers are grateful for the answer that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m gave them, because it proved her excellent knowledge of the area - which must be looked after, because it is likely to become part of the Nature 2000 network - and because she asked the Spanish Government to assume responsibility for looking after this area.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, your speech gave hope to the volunteers.
This is a clear example of why European Funds should not be used for projects that damage the environment.
Mr President, I join with other speakers in complimenting the rapporteur and welcoming his report.
The extent to which biodiversity impacts on the lives of all citizens and the quality or otherwise of their lives makes this debate extremely important.
Those of us entrusted with the task of ensuring a future for our past must now act with decisiveness.
We must do so, however, in an enlightened and informed way and be prepared to avail ourselves of modern research and technology in achieving this objective.
Controversial areas such as biotechnology must, in my view, be part of this equation.
The role of farmers as guarantors of sustainable and quality food supply must be brought more into focus, because we ignore at our peril the fact that agriculture is a commercial activity.
The unique role of farmers as environmental managers must also be fully recognised, appreciated and rewarded.
In this regard, I ask the House to take serious note of the fact that the profession of farming is in decline.
Farmers are getting older and young people are reluctant to take up farming as a career.
From a biodiversity viewpoint, the role of farmers and the preservation of family-based farm units are important.
They represent an important part of the rural infrastructure.
Biodiversity and sustainable development will not happen if they are planned out of the equation.
In short, and in conclusion, we must adopt a practical approach which safeguards biodiversity, while, at the same time, acknowledging the professional and commercial role of farmers.
Mr President, as the Natura 2000 network is being established almost everywhere in Europe, against the advice of the rural community and with disastrous consequences for man, I regret that the report on biodiversity has been hastily debated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
This is, however, an important subject, affecting areas that the Union is considering, such as the protection of natural resources and the relaunch of the development policy, as well as the new objectives for agriculture and fisheries, for example.
Drawing up national strategies or action plans on biodiversity could only be contemplated if they were drafted after a broad consensus had been reached, respecting regional socio-economic interests.
As for enlargement and the rapporteur's proposal to select a flagship project on the protection of biodiversity, we must not forget that the candidate countries want to join the Union in order to make up for their economic and social shortfalls as quickly as possible and to modernise their infrastructures.
Biodiversity is not their main concern.
I regret the fact that the four amendments that I tabled in committee were all rejected, even the amendment in which I called for a CAP that respects the environment as well as those working in the rural community.
Several points in this report give me cause for concern and, in particular, the desire to introduce certification for the timber sector and for animal species seems unrealistic in my view, given the considerable diversity in forests and living species.
What added value does this kind of certification provide?
What has happened to the desire to increase the financial resources granted to Natura 2000 and to other measures on biodiversity?
Why continue along a path that is, increasingly, called into question by the people, landowners, farmers and users?
Who will pay for the introduction of a strict protection system beyond the zones specified in the birds and habitat directives?
Are we moving towards a situation where the entire territory will be divided into zones?
What are we aiming to achieve with this maximum protection approach towards biodiversity?
When reading this report, I wonder whether, in the rapporteur's mind, man is still included in this biodiversity.
In our view, there is no doubt that he is.
You are right, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, the alarm bells raised from all quarters in response to the decline of biodiversity are justified.
Yes, there are plant species that are disappearing, animal species that are at risk and, even within the species and breeds which are not threatened by extinction, the reduction in numbers, the consanguinity and the uncontrolled spread of GMOs are giving rise to genetic decline, which is a threat to the environment.
But I wonder whether forcing through regulations without properly consulting the local actors, with the declared objective of transforming sizeable areas where people live and work into sanctuaries - people who have helped considerably to shape current ecosystems - as well as introducing incoherent procedures for implementing Natura 2000 in a number of countries - is the right way to protect biodiversity?
Is there not a danger that this will have quite the opposite effect and, instead of achieving the desired goal, will provoke an exodus from farming, which will harm biodiversity?
Therefore, we will support the rapporteur's reaffirmation of the 'polluter pays' principle, her prudent approach to GMOs, and her appeal to subsidiarity, but we will not support her call to tighten the Commission's proposals on agriculture, which would result in the CAP being completely taken apart as of 2003.
We will not preserve biodiversity without the help of the farmers.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express an opinion on the action plan as it relates to the preservation of biodiversity in the context of economic cooperation and as it relates to development cooperation.
We have already heard this evening that the greatest degree of biodiversity is to be found in the tropical regions of the developing countries.
These parts of the world have a wide range of crop plants, livestock, wild animals, etc. Moreover - and this is equally important in our eyes - huge numbers of the local, the indigenous, populations are dependent on the existence of this biodiversity.
If the breadth of biodiversity is now reduced, if there are major erosions of the natural world, this will create a knock-on effect which will plunge the people of these tropical regions into poverty.
We also know that, unless action is taken to combat poverty, it becomes very difficult to raise and foster awareness of the need for biodiversity and sustainability.
This is why it is important that this action plan seeks to integrate the principle of preserving biodiversity into the development-cooperation programmes of the European Union.
This means supporting the sustainable use of natural resources, particularly forests, as well as more frequent recourse to environmental-impact assessments of planned development projects.
May I also express the support of my group for all those amendments which emphasise the fundamental role of indigenous populations and their social, economic and cultural rights?
Now that we are talking about biodiversity and, of course, sustainability too, I should not wish to miss this opportunity to say that we must also put our own house in order if we want to possess credibility in the eyes of the international community.
When I recall the discussions on the resolution concerning the Barcelona Summit, a resolution which referred quite clearly to specific projects in Europe that contravene the principle of biodiversity and fail to protect rare flora and fauna, I am persuaded that it is not enough for us here in Europe merely to keep tabling splendid resolutions designed to protect mountain gorillas in African forests but that we also need to engage wholeheartedly in the implementation of projects and of our own European programmes, such as Natura 2000.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their work on drafting the report and this resolution.
Biodiversity is a central issue in terms of sustainable development and the integration of environmental considerations into other policy areas.
It is important in its own right but also forms the basis for activities based on natural resources such as agriculture and the fishing industry.
Biodiversity is also important environmental capital which local societies in many countries depend on for their livelihood.
At the same time, it is disappearing faster than ever before in human history.
I have sad news tonight.
We have now lost the first species on our list of protected species.
The Pyrenean mountain goat has vanished for ever.
We are thus unable even to completely protect the species we have placed on our lists of species we have promised to protect.
Both the EU's strategy for sustainable development and the seventh Environment Action Programme state that one of their central goals is that of halting the decline in biodiversity by 2010.
If we are to be able to achieve this goal, it is very important that the action plans for biodiversity which we are discussing today are really implemented.
Safeguarding biodiversity depends on the birds directive and the habitats directive being implemented in full.
However, this is not enough.
If we really want to stop this loss of biodiversity, we have to look at the entire territory of the EU and not just the protected areas.
It is necessary to integrate the question of biodiversity with the policy on the development and use of the mainland and the sea.
The biodiversity action plans are not just ambitious but also realistic.
They mean a great step forwards in terms of integrating biodiversity into agriculture, fisheries and development cooperation policy, as well as into our own environmental policy.
The action plan for the conservation of natural resources clearly shows our firm intention to fully implement the birds directive and the habitats directive and to support the work on Natura 2000.
This also states how we intend to use general environmental controls such as environmental impact assessment, environmental labelling, environmental audits and other financial controls to promote the safeguarding of biodiversity throughout the EU.
The action plan relating to agriculture states priorities for achieving mutual benefits from agricultural activity and biodiversity.
The most important instruments cover everything from rural development measures to various environmental initiatives in the common organisations of the market for beef, milk and cereals, etc.
The action plan covers all of our countryside, including the Natura 2000 areas.
The action plan for fisheries addresses threats from both traditional fisheries and aquaculture, and it complies entirely with the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy.
The majority, and the most serious, of the threats to global biodiversity are in the developing countries.
The battle for biodiversity therefore has a great deal to do with our strategy for eradicating poverty.
We have a responsibility for helping developing countries so that the natural resources which are crucial to their well-being can be protected.
The action plan for economic cooperation and development provides the tools for this.
These plans for biodiversity are not static instruments but instead will be developed primarily through the use of various indicators.
This has been pointed out during the debate and is naturally also something which the Commission supports and which we have begun working with.
These plans will primarily contribute to the discussion of the reform of the common fisheries policy, common agriculture policy and the regulations on the Structural Funds.
I hope that these reforms will have the scope and provide the controls that are required if we are to completely meet the goals of the biodiversity action plans.
Only then will we be able to achieve the overall goal, namely that of halting the decline of biodiversity by 2010.
I would like to thank all my fellow MEPs for your valuable contribution to the debate.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0044/2002), by Mrs Emilia Franziska MÃŒller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements [12394/2/2001 - C5-0640/2001 - 2000/0080(COD)].
Mr President, on a point of order, I wanted to announce, before Mrs Emilia Franziska MÃŒller gets started, that the fact that the screen showing the list of names of the speakers has gone wrong may perhaps explain why people might not come to the debate.
Also, we are only getting the German interpretation in our offices.
This is a great help to me because I am doing a course at the Goethe Institute, but other people may find it a little difficult.
There you are, Mrs Jackson, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good!
I announced this problem just now and the technicians are trying to resolve it.
I hope that they manage to sort it out as soon as possible.
However, you are extremely optimistic when you say that the only reason there are so few Members in the Chamber is because we have got a few technical display problems.
If only that were so!
.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, about 20% of all Europeans regularly supplement their daily diets.
In 1999, European consumers spent EUR 1 615 million on vitamins and minerals alone.
Demand is rising constantly, because people's living and eating habits have changed radically.
Vitamins and minerals are involved in numerous biochemical processes in the human organism.
It is crucial to people's health and to their physical and mental capacity that they optimise their intake of these substances.
I believe that the opportunity to enrich our daily food intake with additional vitamins and minerals is very valuable.
When we speak here today of food supplements, we primarily mean vitamins and minerals that are marketed in the form of tablets, capsules and powders.
The directive on food supplements is designed to harmonise the laws of the Member States.
This will give manufacturers easier access to all markets, subjecting their production and marketing practices to a uniform set of conditions.
The directive unequivocally assigns food supplements to the domain of foodstuffs.
Food supplements are not medicinal products, nor can they serve as substitutes for medicinal products.
Through their categorisation as foodstuffs, food supplements are subjected to all the provisions that apply to foodstuffs in the European Union, including the provisions of quality, hygiene and safety legislation.
The consumer must be able to rely on the complete safety of all foodstuffs, particularly of substances such as vitamins and minerals, where stability levels sometimes differ between products.
The new directive targets two specific areas: consumer safety and the completion of the single market in food supplements.
The Council of Ministers has adopted Parliament's key demands from the first reading.
Parliament welcomes the fact that the Council took account of our position regarding the need to include more substances in the directive.
The substances in question are already on the market but have not yet been evaluated by the competent scientific committee.
These are to be included in the annex to the directive.
In the common position, a period of 18 months has been set for the preparation and submission of a dossier.
The Committee on the Environment has extended this 18-month period to 36 months in order to give small and medium-sized businesses in particular sufficient time to compile the relevant data on their products.
The House now has two further amendments on the table - one for 24 and one for 30 months.
I would personally argue for 30 months, because I believe that two and a half years should be enough time to prove the safety of a product that has been sold to consumers for years.
I attach great importance to the principle that substances should be scientifically tested before they become the object of Community legislation.
As far as doses, and hence optimum consumer care, are concerned, Parliament welcomes the system of maximum safe doses combined with the reference quantities per head of population.
In other words, manufacturers' dosage instructions must not be based on the limits of human tolerance.
On the other hand, they need not be bound by the recommended daily allowances, which are normally set at very low levels.
On this particular point, the directive manages to take account of both the wishes of consumers and the need to protect them.
The common position has come up with a compromise here that I entirely support.
For this reason we reject Amendment No 6 to Article 5 of the directive.
With regard to product labelling, the directive provides for clear dosage recommendations.
The substance of Amendment No 8 on greater transparency is already clearly covered by Articles 38 and 42 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of 28 February 2002 establishing the European Food Safety Authority.
For this reason the PPE-DE Group also rejects this amendment outright.
For all the reasons I have outlined, I can have no truck whatsoever with the proposal to reject the common position that is made in Amendment No 7.
Finally, a few words on the campaign which all Members of Parliament have been forced to endure in the last few weeks and months; this is a campaign through which a single producer and dealer of vitamin products has been pursuing interests of a purely economic nature.
The company behind this campaign is engaging in image-making at the expense of the sick.
It is breeding anxiety among consumers and exploiting their distress for its own ends.
I sympathise with all those people who have been taken in by the scaremongering and utterly specious arguments that have emanated from the company concerned.
It is clearly not the case that we seek to prohibit vitamin therapies by means of this directive on food supplements or that we are trying to curtail access to natural treatment methods.
What the directive does prohibit, and rightly so, is any attempt to mislead consumers by making exaggerated claims about the curative or preventive powers of vitamins and minerals.
This directive gives consumers in Europe the support of a legal framework that attaches great value to product safety and responsible labelling without restricting the range of products on shop and supermarket shelves.
In short, it is a legal regime that combines free circulation of goods with a high level of protection.
After talks with many organisations - industrial associations as well as consumer associations - I am more convinced than ever that this directive points in the right direction.
(Applause)
Mr President, allow me to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs MÃŒller, not only on her sound report but also on the tenacity she has displayed.
The issue we are debating today has caused a huge stir.
As we know, there are different traditions, as well as do's and do not's in Europe.
Like the United States, Great Britain and the Netherlands have, in fact, very flexible legislation whereby, once registered, all vitamins and minerals can be freely bought, sold and used.
However, there are also products, certain vitamins and minerals, that are not without risk.
In Germany, another Member State, rules are very strict.
Food supplements are only available on prescription and at the chemist.
This is sufficient reason, also as far as the European citizens are concerned, to start to harmonise the internal market.
This harmonisation should be subject to two criteria: firstly, the indication of a recommended daily intake as a guideline to the consumer and secondly, the establishment of a definitive list of permitted products.
Products not yet on the European list will be permitted if their file has been submitted to the independent scientific committee for testing.
Honest European businesses are satisfied with this directive, unlike cowboys such as one Mathias Rath, who, just across the German border in the Netherlands, runs a very lucrative business using his own products.
Adoption of this European legislation will ensure that his trade, which is primarily aimed at Germany, will fizzle out because consumers will be able to buy safe vitamins and minerals at the chemist or the supermarket anywhere in Europe.
I am also inundated with an incredible number of e-mails, thousands of e-mails and letters.
Rath drove the anxious citizen to action with false arguments, no less.
Let me be quite clear: nothing is being taken away from the consumer.
There is a 30-month period during which businesses can prove that their products are indeed safe, and I will continue to monitor the scientific committee with regard to registration. I am pleased that Europe is calling an end to a practice which is only aimed at excessive profiteering on the backs of many people who are seriously ill.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to congratulate Mrs MÃŒller on her consistent, expert and tenacious approach.
Her work currently has great significance.
The food supplements market is growing fast.
Food supplements can make a positive contribution to health.
Anyone who can afford it is keen to buy good health.
However, it is obvious that quality is not always guaranteed.
We must therefore separate the chaff from the wheat.
The consumer is entitled to a safe product and sound information.
In the field of food supplements, large industrial interests are at stake.
We have already gathered this from the thousands of e-mails, four books, video cassettes and postcards in support of the cause of the producers.
In the magazine 'The Rapporteur', the vitamin lobby campaign was described as counter-productive.
If only!
Unfortunately, a number of fellow MEPs, mainly from the liberal and green groups, have fallen for this lobby.
I recently received 35 letters from anxious consumers.
I did not receive them directly but via the industry, which immediately makes one wonder.
The letters were written by people who said that they benefited from taking multi-vitamin tablets and that they had heard that the European Parliament would ban them henceforth.
A clear example of misinformation.
Multi-vitamin tablets can still be taken.
Only when they contain substances or compounds which do not feature on the extensive list must the manufacturer prove that they are safe.
Is that too much to ask?
Anyone who claims that hardly any damage has occurred involving food supplements to date is probably right.
However, their use has so far been restricted.
Only latterly has the market grown and do high-dose tablets appear in the shops.
Safety must be the main concern.
Producers have 18 months in which to demonstrate that their products are safe.
This appears to me to be sufficient time, but I have no problem with extending this period to 24 months.
The directive is of huge importance, and it is futile to regulate safety for each Member State individually.
We do not do this for food either.
With regard to food supplements, there is currently no internal market, but many different, national rules.
We must set up this internal market for food supplements.
In my personal opinion, the internal market is a great good, provided, however, that it prescribes common standards at a high level, which is where this directive comes in.
The Commission has laid down a solid foundation for the establishment of maximum safety levels for vitamins and minerals, and that also forms the basis for consumer confidence.
I would urge you to vote for this directive.
Mr President, Commissioner, the consumption of vitamins and other food supplements by our society is a genuine trend rather than a fashion.
The market that this generates is huge.
The considerable lobbying that has been carried out on this issue is proof of this, if it were needed.
Let us turn directly to the main question which is niggling a number of my fellow Members who oppose this directive and that is should we legislate?
I have no hesitation in saying 'no' and I have at least three reasons for this.
First of all, the proposal for a directive provides a specific response to a reality, namely the lack of an internal market, which has damaging repercussions both for the economic actors in this sector and for consumers.
By way of example, it is currently virtually impossible for a vitamin manufacturer based in the UK to export and place his products on the market in Belgium or in France, for instance.
Secondly, it is useful, even so, to recall the two major battles waged at first reading regarding the inclusion of substances with psychological effects - fibres and plant extracts, in particular - and the essential labelling standards to enable consumers to make an informed choice.
Parliament made its view heard.
I would add, and this is my third point, that no high-quality food supplement, regardless of its ingredients, will be banned under this directive.
I stress the point that we must stop brandishing the prospect of bans and of a Europe that castrates.
Manufacturers will have three and a half years, depending on our vote, to submit their dossier and prove that their products which are not currently listed in the Annex are safe, and if a ban has to be imposed eventually, it would therefore be placed on doubtful substances. Anyhow this is the least of our problems, as far as I am concerned.
Since I am speaking of the purely health-related aspect of this matter, I would also like us to stop saying that vitamin abuse poses no danger.
This is wrong, simply wrong!
We must say that excessive consumption of all fat-soluble vitamins such as A, K, E and D are problematic, and, to give another example, excess vitamin A has known harmful teratogenic effects and can result in foetus malformation.
We can allow political opposition to this directive therefore, but in no case can we allow scientific falsehoods to go unchallenged.
To sum up, and for all the aforementioned reasons, we are dealing with flexible and balanced legislation which takes into account the interests of consumers, manufacturers and distributors and which lays a basis for the harmonisation that is necessary in this sector.
The majority of my colleagues in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will vote in favour of this very good report by Mrs MÃŒller and I too would like to congratulate her.
I believe this directive is an unacceptable assault on the right of citizens to choose how they look after their health and well-being.
Huge numbers of EU citizens choose to take supplements to reduce the possibility of their falling ill and needing to seek medical advice to obtain prescribed drugs.
People should have the right to opt for a healthy approach, rather than waiting for disease to set in and then having to resort to pharmaceutical drugs, many of which have dangerous side effects.
I am not surprised that the pharmaceutical industry is supporting this directive, since it plays right into their hands and means more business for them.
Products which have been widely and safely used for many years in several EU Member States are being restricted without any health and safety justifications.
