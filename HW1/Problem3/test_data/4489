It would be wrong to let the Irish carry the can.
After all, the question is whether the Nice Treaty would survive a referendum in other Member States.
We need more than just greater transparency if we are to overcome this European crisis.
It is nothing less than the political significance of the European Union that is at stake.
Our Heads of Government need to talk seriously to their opposite numbers about this.
The Gothenburg Summit has to be the starting point.
I only have one minute to congratulate the Irish people on their lucidity and courage and to thank them for saying 'no' to the Treaty of Nice, and also to note that this means the treaty is now null and void.
Some people pretend to believe that this was just a passing whim.
In fact, it is the result of a popular referendum, something that ought to be the absolute rule on issues such as this.
For we cannot keep on singing the praises of the people of Europe and of democracy while denying those people their democratic right to speak.
By clearly choosing independence, freedom and national identity, the Irish have thwarted the dreams some people had of creating a federal super-state.
It will not surprise you that I welcome this.
Mr President, the applicant countries who are due to meet in GÃ¶teborg at the end of this week already know, in spite of the vicious analysis offered by the mass media, that, as Mr Cox, Mrs Ahern and Mrs Doyle and other speakers said, the Irish people welcome the EU's enlargement.
In rejecting the Treaty of Nice, the Irish people have actually blown away the smokescreen that hides the real issues, for instance, that Ireland was moving away from neutrality and towards gradual cooperation into NATO, a move that erodes Irish neutrality, and would mean involvement in the armament industry and the rapid reaction force.
The Treaty of Nice not only damages the Irish people's interest but those of every small nation in Europe, the applicant countries included.
The Irish lesson is a good one.
They have said "no" to removing democratic control from the hands of the people.
Thank you Ireland.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I was astounded when I heard the outcome of the General Affairs Council meeting last Monday.
The message was really something like 'business as usual' , too bad, we shall just carry on, give Ireland another chance.
I would point out to Mrs Van Lancker that it was the majority of Socialists on the General Affairs Council that decided to go on with business as usual.
You do not need to tell us that strengthening is extraordinarily important along with enlargement.
We have always maintained that.
I hope you will tell your Socialist friends that business as usual is not acceptable.
However, I do believe that Gothenburg should be primarily an opportunity to reflect on what has happened and what the implications are from the point of view of involving our citizens more in Europe.
We must make sure our Heads of Government do not come out with all kinds of conflicting views after the signature of the Nice Treaty and simply add to the public' s confusion.
Let us just think about what we have in common and what we want to achieve together.
Let Gothenburg also be the Summit at which, as you so rightly said, at last we shall be using a different method of operation, the convention.
But let Gothenburg also be the Summit at which we are ready to think about how we can speed up the process and how the public can become more involved in what is happening in Europe.
I think that is how we can benefit from the signal given by our Irish friends.
Madam President-in-Office, you mentioned the Middle East road map.
I sincerely hope that Europe is not going to go back to blueprints again. We need to use our diplomatic skills to help resolve the massive conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
In my view, that must be the main issue and also, in particular, let us make every possible effort to find a solution for Macedonia.
Mr Poettering was quite right to draw attention to it. That is the litmus test for Europe.
Mr President, yesterday afternoon, an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was held to discuss the serious implications of the referendum which has just taken place in Ireland.
After a very broad, coherent debate resulting in general political agreement, a declaration was adopted. This is the French text:
The result of the Irish referendum casts an unexpected and dramatic shadow over the method adopted by the Intergovernmental Conference last year.
This result shows a serious lack of understanding by public opinion in the Member States, which is due to the lack of transparency in the negotiations, the tortuous nature of the agreements concluded and the complexity of the issues relating to EU enlargement and the process of integration, all questions which have not really been discussed head-on with the citizens and therefore clarified.
We can certainly not leave any question marks hanging over the commitments we have already entered into with the candidate countries.
At the same time, when the national parliaments come to examine the Nice Treaty prior to ratifying it, they must not disregard the problem posed by the Irish vote. Quite aside, however, from seeking solutions to the situation that has arisen, to which the Irish Government will make a vital contribution, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs wishes first and foremost to reaffirm, with even greater conviction, the positions it expressed in the resolution adopted in plenary on 31 May on the method to be followed from now until the year 2003.
The Irish vote confirms the need not only for a wider debate on the issues relating to the Union' s future but also for a mandate to draft texts that have a constitutional value. This should be entrusted to a convention which, thanks to the participation of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, can guarantee the kind of transparency and complete legitimacy that have been missing until now.
Thank you.
Mr President, the Irish 'no' vote must be respected, but when those who say no also say that the Treaty of Nice has come to nothing, that is not the case.
The Treaty of Nice will not have come to nothing until the moment when the Irish government formally tells the other countries that it will not be able to ratify it.
And that is something that the Irish Government has not done for the time being so, politically speaking at any rate, we have, in reality, the period up until the end of 2002 to see if we can get the Treaty of Nice ratified.
If that has not happened before 2002, then we have a serious problem.
Denmark has already ratified the Treaty. That is due to the fact that there is a broad political majority in favour of enlargement, and we have not wanted to place question marks over enlargement.
The instrument of ratification is being lodged in Rome today.
It is also important, however, for us to have a discussion about grassroots support, which was the Swedish Presidency' s third key point.
It is therefore up to us seriously to get some impetus into this debate with a view to the periods both before and after Laeken.
Mr President, I do not blame other European governments for ignoring the decision of the Irish people.
The Irish Government themselves have ignored the mandate that they clearly got from the people.
As Mrs DybkjÃŠr has just said, what they have done is to tell the other EU governments to carry on as usual; they will then go back to the Irish people and get them to vote again until they get it right.
They are going to ask the Irish people to vote again on the same Treaty with declarations attached which are not legally binding.
That is completely unacceptable to the democratic process and our government is guilty of treachery in its approach to the Irish vote.
Enlargement can go ahead, but we want it to be fair and equitable.
We would like to see the new Member States come in under the same conditions as those offered to Ireland.
Instead, the doors have been tightly closed to keep those countries out until the rules are changed to suit the big and wealthy countries in Europe.
That is not acceptable.
The eastern European countries are being misled by those EU leaders who maintain that the "no" vote in Ireland was a "no" to enlargement.
That is not so.
As Mr Cox has said, we campaigned for enlargement but against the Nice Treaty, because it is not in the interests of the countries coming in, nor is it in the interests of the existing Member States.
It merely serves the interests of the more powerful, and that is not a Europe that we want to see emerge in the future.
, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. (DE) Mr President, I too should like to thank the Swedish presidency and, more especially, you Madam President-in-Office, for your cooperation.
The Irish vote proves that our citizens want Europe, but that they want a Europe they understand, a Europe that is transparent, capable of action and democratic.
So exactly how do things stand right now?
We have a treaty which no one approves of, but which everyone says must be ratified because otherwise enlargement hangs in the balance.
But what will happen if the treaty is ratified in fourteen national parliaments - meaning that not a single comma can then be changed - and is then rejected by Ireland for a second time in the autumn of 2002?
That is taking a huge risk.
Perhaps we should be preparing other options, so that the formal conditions for enlargement, such as the number of seats and votes and questions for the enlargement treaties themselves can be negotiated, as we did on previous occasions?
I think we should at least prepare such an option, so as to avoid delaying enlargement and sending out the wrong message and giving rise to uncertainty in the candidate countries between now and November 2002.
We must ensure that the post-Nice process is speeded up through public debate and a convention and can be wrapped up by the end of 2003, as the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro report suggests.
For the rest, I would advise the governments in the Member States to take a good look at this report, because it contains a whole series of tips on how to manage this crisis.
We have no use now for tricks, protocols, opt outs or anything else of the sort; what we need is a treaty which clearly shows our citizens how they can play a part in Europe.
And although the SchrÃ¶ders and Fischers and Jospins and Blairs may have given brilliant visionary speeches over recent months, I for one should like to see them convert some of these fantasies into practical policy and for our social-democratic Europe not to go down in history as the Europe which was unable to resolve its problems, either present or future.
Mr President, as has already been said a number of times, the Irish "no" was not a "no" to enlargement.
Not one single political party in Ireland argued against enlargement, either on the "no" side or the "yes" side: only one organisation - a non-party organisation which campaigned for "no" - argued against enlargement.
The Irish people has spoken on Nice and its decision will be respected.
The people of the other fourteen Member States are also entitled to have their say on the Treaty in accordance with their constitutions.
For them it will be expressed through their democratically elected parliaments.
They must not be denied that right.
It is ironic, that the people in this House who argued against Nice, because Nice was too much Europe, are now saying that Europe should instruct its Member States not to ratify Nice.
It beggars belief that this undemocratic attitude is being expressed here by the Irish Greens and by others.
Could I put it simply for them, because it seems to be very difficult for them to understand: do they argue that the World Cup should be lost because the first team that plays should lose if it does not score the first goal, or should the game go its full term and should every qualified team play the complete game to the end?
There is time for ratification, even if we need extra time, let us take that time.
As a democracy, where the people are sovereign, the Irish people is also entitled to decide to reconsider its decision and to confirm or reverse it.
We now need a sustained debate on Nice.
Those parties who supported Nice should seek a mandate at the next general election, which will take place by June 2002, to present a new proposal on Nice to the people before December 2002.
John Cushnahan and I have published a seven-point initiative on measures, which could help to clarify the issues and to assuage fears in Ireland.
I am happy to report that one of those initiatives, the establishment of a forum in Ireland on the future of Europe, has been adopted by the Irish Government.
That is a proposal which I tabled in December 2000 after Nice.
I thank the Swedish minister here this morning for her confirmation that there is going to be a convention.
It is not easy to discern the myriad of concerns, some domestic, some European, which gave rise to the "no" result in Ireland.
There is one overriding and general concern, the sense that people are losing control of their government and their lives.
People know that the European project is necessary and important, but they are at a loss as to how they fit into the scheme of things.
The bottom line is that if we want people in Europe in every country to initiate a new experiment in sharing their democracy, sovereignty, benefits of freedoms, then we, as their elected representatives have to lead courageously by spelling out in great detail how it will work.
In conclusion, the rights of each Member State and each person who lives in Europe must be guaranteed.
That can best be done through a new federalism based on a European constitution.
So far, we have only the vaguest outline of what that might represent.
We have a mountain to climb, but I am confident that the people in Ireland and the rest of Europe will rise to the challenge when they are given the chance.
Mr President, it is ten years since our Heads of Government discussed sustainable development at a summit meeting.
That is a disgracefully long time.
The Commission has submitted a good document, but why did the Swedish Presidency remove this Commission proposal to stop subsidising fossil fuels from the draft conclusions even before the Heads of Government arrived in Gothenburg?
Why are they acting so cowardly?
Why is Sweden scrapping sustainable development even before the Summit has started?
The European Parliament voted by a 95% majority for Europe to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, even without the United States.
I urge the Heads of Government to make it clear to President Bush that it is irresponsible for any country to remain outside the Kyoto Protocol.
It is bad enough that the United States still imposes the death penalty, as it has again this week, but that is after all a matter for the American people.
But President Bush' s energy plan for more oil, more coal, more gas and more nuclear power stations is going to destroy the climate all over the world.
That is irresponsible and it calls for plain language and decisive action from our Heads of Government in Gothenburg.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that you will leave this meeting happy because we are telling you that you are entering the final exam at Gothenburg well prepared.
I believe that today Parliament has recognised the efforts of the Swedish Presidency, and yours in particular, to carry out successful work.
And I also want to acknowledge this.
I believe that you have acted with political care.
For example, on the agreement on the memorandum on the cohesion funds you acted quickly, and that is positive, because Europe is not a Europe of traders, but a Europe of cohesion and of the common principles and values which we all share.
And I also believe that in the same way there has been a change in the Swedish Presidency in the latest preparatory documents on an issue which is of great concern to this Parliament; the convention.
I believe that between the outset and today there has been a change, and that is that you have understood that the next Intergovernmental Conference should be prepared in such a way as to prevent what happened with the Treaty of Nice, and I believe that the convention model is showing the way: this models means participation, openness and transparency, all characteristics which you have a particular interest in.
I would like to ask you now to show a little more daring - as a French revolutionary would say, de l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace [what we need is to dare, still to dare, and always to dare].
You will notice that I am next to FranÃ§ois Bayrou and I have been imbued with these revolutionary ideas.
Be more daring, opt for the convention, because I believe that that is the lesson we must learn from the Irish referendum.
We must count on the people, listen to them, hear them, and the convention is a useful method for doing this.
I therefore urge you to continue in this direction, which the President of my Group, Mr Poettering, has argued for, and to come back from Gothenburg with the good news that that convention has been launched to assess the future of Europe.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission. I intend to focus on foreign and security policy aspects which the European Parliament may care to recommend to the Gothenburg Council.
First, I should like to thank the Swedish presidency for its initiatives in the area of conflict prevention and civil crisis management.
They are a credit to the tradition of your country and they are right and proper for the European Union.
I should like to encourage you, Madam President-in-Office, to bring the project which you have started to a successful conclusion in Gothenburg in the form of a strong, specific programme which can be implemented at once.
One of the most difficult tasks, not just for the Council presidency, but for the European Council as a whole in Gothenburg, will be to convey to the American president just how worried and concerned we are about the new policy which he has adopted for the United States of America.
We are not just extremely worried about the rocket defence system, the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the USA's attitude towards the International Criminal Tribunal; the USA's aversion to traditional cooperation with the European Union is a particularly worrying sign for anyone who sees this cooperation as instrumental when it comes to resolving huge international problems.
Madam President-in-Office, my closing point concerns a very sad and dramatic situation emanating from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
We were due to receive Mr Trajkovski, the president of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, here within the hour.
He will not be coming - presumably because of the serious situation in his country.
And we must take our share of the blame, Madam President-in-Office, for the situation in his country.
We must take our share of the blame for the terrorist action of the KLA, which we have failed to disband, despite Security Council Resolution 1244, and which is now attacking this country and undermining its very existence.
The European Union must do everything it can, Madam President-in-Office, to put an end to this terrorism and help this country.
Mr President, President Lincoln said you can fool some of the people all the time, all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.
What is currently happening in the aftermath of the Irish vote on the Nice Treaty is unacceptable by any standards of Western democracy.
A Member State, under the provisions of the Treaty, has sounded out its people on the conclusion of Treaty changes.
They have for a number of reasons declined these changes.
This result cannot be ignored, either on the basis of a lower-than-normal turnout - what price legitimacy? - or because some people feel that the only good referendum result is a positive one.
As the EU moves towards enlargement, we must not suggest to countries waiting at the door of the European Union that democracy and the rule of law can simply be overruled, by tacitly encouraging the Irish Government to hold another referendum sometime in the future.
No tinkering around with additional protocols will convince the sceptical public to vote in favour of Treaty changes which are difficult to explain and bring nothing of real benefit to improve the effective operation of the European Union.
There is only one way to reassure public opinion and maintain the vital goal of EU enlargement.
The Nice Treaty must in time cease to exist.
In these circumstances no treaty in these circumstances is better than a bad treaty.
Instead we now urgently need to hold a genuine, substantial debate about the future of the European Union.
The idea of a non-binding convention, to which other speakers have referred, is an idea whose time has now come.
This process will only be successful, however, if all European citizens are involved and consulted on these essential issues.
By the end of 2003 at the latest, the national parliaments should then be able to ratify either the relevant provisions of the Nice Treaty or those of the convention.
Should the European Council not follow this course and be seen to be trampling on the democratic procedures in small Member States, this will only serve to further alienate a European public which is genuinely in search of more information.
Europe and its institutions can only be built with the long-lasting support of its peoples.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the Swedish Presidency for conducting the enlargement negotiations so skilfully and for preparing so well for the GÃ¶teborg Summit.
I want to take up two subjects so that everything else is not drowned out by the referendum in Ireland.
First and foremost, sustainability.
I believe that getting this overall strategy on sustainability adopted will be a very positive contribution to European development.
We need to see incorporated into European cooperation a compulsory system for integrating environmental considerations into all areas, something which will happen with the Sixth Environmental Action Programme as the environmental pillar for the strategy during the next few years.
As we specified in Parliament' s decision, sustainability must be seen in a global context.
At the moment, there are no other powerful parts of the world, outside the EU, which are in a position to take on that role, and I therefore hope that the presence of President Bush, who is perhaps the least sustainability-minded of all, will paradoxically make the EU more strongly united regarding this task.
And now a couple of words about enlargement.
We must be careful of rhetoric.
I believe we must show respect for the decision taken in the Irish referendum. I am also listening, however, to the Irish politicians on both sides of the referendum debate who say that it was not enlargement as such that was the problem in Ireland.
I therefore think it is very important that, following the referendum in Ireland, it should be clearly accepted that the enlargement negotiations can continue at the same pace until such time as a solution is found in relation to Ireland.
It would be an historic mistake if, because of this referendum, enlargement were to come to grief or were to be postponed when it was not this that was the problem for the Irish people.
I would therefore call upon the European Council, headed by the Presidency, to show flexibility, provide maximum support and make time for finding a solution that is satisfactory to the Irish population.
Mr President, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr President of the Commission, enlargement is more than just an economic matter, it is a great political event rooted in the history of the European peoples, in the culture they share: Roman law, Christianity, the universities and Enlightenment.
It is now our duty to rediscover this cultural unity which must consolidate the necessary and, I would argue, right and proper, irreversible decision to enlarge the Union.
The Commission, the Council and Parliament have the task of involving the citizens in this process, as President Prodi has stressed.
The Irish vote must certainly make us stop and think: we must not get things out of proportion but it is certainly our duty to involve the European people in the important matters concerning the Union.
In its endeavours to achieve the goal of enlargement, the Commission can count on the full, firm support of my political party and the new Italian government, which is involved in a fresh, incisive Europeanist initiative, as Mr Solana and Mr Giscard d'Estaing have stressed and acknowledged today as well.
However, because it is our duty to involve the peoples of Europe, I feel that an initial stage should be also envisaged in the reform process in which the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the governments and the Commission work together to prepare for the 2003 Intergovernmental Conference.
President Prodi, I agree that the debate must not be confined to an elite: there must therefore be less elitism and more parliamentarianism in the reform processes.
As regards the other matter, relations between the United States and the European Union, I feel that we must foster transatlantic dialogue and, therefore, I welcome President Bush's visit.
Finally, we must be committed to the Middle East peace process.
The European Union must do everything in its power; in the future, once the most difficult stage is over and recourse to terrorism has been avoided, it should take action to assist the economic growth of the territories surrounding Israel as well, for they must not be subjected to economic as well as ethnic and political tension.
I feel that the European Union will be able to play a major role in this matter.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the 15 Heads of State and Government will be meeting this week for the European Council that will close the Swedish presidency of the Union, a presidency everyone agrees struck a positive note, especially in regard to transparency and citizens' access to information.
This summit will also have to evaluate the unexpected results of the Irish referendum on ratifying the Treaty of Nice.
We are sorry the Irish people said 'no' to this treaty; although far from perfect, at least it resolved the left-overs of Amsterdam and, above all, opened the way to enlargement of the European Union to other countries.
So what are the Irish saying by abstaining so heavily?
That all too often the citizens see Europe as some nebulous abstraction, with no bearing on their daily concerns.
If there is a message in this vote, it concerns the urgent need to hold a real, popular grass-roots debate on these issues.
I am confident that the Union can rise to this challenge.
We hope the Treaty of Nice will enter into force before the end of the year 2002, so that the Union can welcome the new Member States in 2004, as it has undertaken to do.
All the existing Member States must hasten to ratify this treaty without delay, and I am glad that by its vote in the National Assembly yesterday, France is now one of the first countries to do so.
Our priority, which the Gothenburg European Council must solemnly reiterate, remains to prepare for enlargement.
We will do our utmost to ensure that the post-Nice situation lives up to the European citizens' expectations with regard to the purpose of the Union, in the light of its political project and its democratic deficit.
We will say 'yes' to the post-Nice situation, prepared by a convention made up of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, the governments of the 15, the Commission and civil society.
We will say 'yes' to a European constitution that reaffirms our common values, respect for human rights, cultural diversity and the social model, and that defines the respective competences of the Member States and the Union.
We also say 'yes' to a federation of nation-states in which each state will retain its specific nature and its competences.
Mr President, enlargement has been the main focus of this debate, which I believe is quite natural.
I am very pleased about the widespread support in Parliament for enlargement.
Parliament has played a vital role so far, for example with its requirement that the applicant countries will be able to take part in the European Parliament elections in 2004.
You will also continue to have a key part to play in moving enlargement forward.
I will now return to Gothenburg bearing your stated wish for clear signals from Gothenburg, including a clearer timetable.
I will also return with the large majority in favour of ratification of the Treaty of Nice continuing.
I would like to say that I particularly appreciate Mr Poettering, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, Mr Cox, Mr Collins and other group leaders expressing this view.
Of course we will take the referendum in Ireland seriously.
We must become better at obtaining more grassroots support for European issues and the European project.
We must take the referendum result seriously.
It is a common responsibility and common lesson for us all.
We will naturally all offer Ireland whatever help it and the Irish government decides it requires.
However, in order not to damage the European project any further and not to weaken faith in the Union, we must also move forward on ratification of the Treaty of Nice and enlargement.
I would like to say how fortunate it is that group leaders Mr Wurtz and Mr Bonde do not have a majority either in the European Parliament or in the national parliaments when they argue against ratification of the Treaty of Nice, for it is precisely this that is causing concern in the applicant countries.
The Treaty of Nice is, of course, the precondition for enlargement.
A no to the Treaty of Nice is a no to enlargement and, with friends like that, the applicant countries do not need any enemies.
It is also important for enlargement that the process of addressing the points at issue continues.
President of the Commission Prodi and several others have today emphasised the importance of addressing the seriously difficult issues and starting to deal with them, e.g. issues concerning the environment, free movement of people and free movement of capital.
I believe it is important to state before Parliament that, following the negotiations which we had at the start of this week, we have now not only created common positions among the Member States on these difficult issues but have also started negotiations with the applicant countries and even completed negotiations with several applicant countries. We have successfully addressed the environmental issues with four applicant countries.
We have also successfully addressed free movement of people with a couple of applicant countries and free movement of capital with a couple of applicant countries.
Let me particularly comment on free movement of people, as this has been a very sensitive issue.
In this area, we have sought a flexible solution which entails our providing the opportunity for transposition periods for those countries which are absolutely sure that they need them, while allowing flexibility for others.
The Swedish and Dutch governments have recently declared that they will open themselves up to the labour force of new Member States right from the start, so that the labour force from new Member States will have the opportunity to work with us on the same terms as the labour force of current Member States.
I hope that many other countries will follow suit and give equivalent declarations as soon as possible.
In this respect, I also believe that you European parliamentarians can help bring pressure to bear on your national governments.
Many people have also mentioned sustainable development and the environmental issues.
I can guarantee that we will stand by the Kyoto Protocol.
We will be addressing climate issues at the summit and discussing them with President Bush.
We will do our best in Gothenburg to ensure that we take important steps forward on environmental issues.
At the same time, I think it is important to take up social issues, as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and some others have suggested, and establish that we have made progress on these issues and the situation of the labour force.
With regard to foreign policy, we will continue to work with the Western Balkans and the Middle East.
We have seen the way the EU can play an important role.
Naturally, this work must continue.
I regret that we are unable to meet Mr Trajkovski today in Parliament but, on the other hand, I believe that he has made the right choice in these difficult times of ensuring that he takes the negotiations in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia forward towards a peaceful solution.
I also believe that we have good instruments, and will have good instruments, from the Union for future work through the European programme for conflict prevention which Mr Sakellariou brought up.
This is also something which we in Sweden are keen to do further work on, even after the Presidency.
Finally, I would like to thank everyone for the kind words on the Swedish Presidency.
I would like to reply with my own thanks for excellent work and constructive cooperation with the European Parliament.
Unfortunately, this is the last time I will be speaking in this capacity, but I hope to enjoy continued cooperation with Parliament as an "ordinary foreign minister" .
(Applause)
Mr President, a brief response to some of the points that have emerged during the debate.
Firstly, I am extremely pleased to see that Parliament has taken the will expressed by the Irish people very seriously, not just because it is representative - although the turnout was not very high - of the wishes of an entire people but also because it represents the wishes of an entire country. Most importantly, this will encourage us all to find new ways of governing Europe.
It is a lesson, and I welcome the fact that a common desire has been shown - by Parliament, the Commission and the Swedish Presidency, as well as in the statement by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs read out by Mr Napolitano - to turn the page and change the way we run summits and legislate in Europe.
This is the real lesson we must learn, and therefore the great, transparent Convention which we are working towards must be the new approach, the approach upon which the European peoples can express their opinions in an informed manner, with peace of mind, familiar with the matter under consideration.
In an aside, Mrs Doyle touched on the statements made by Mr Solbes, myself and Mr Jospin, and their effect on the outcome of the Irish referendum.
My answer relates to the Commission's statements.
The opinion expressed on the Irish economy and on certain problems which had arisen was based on a large number of criteria to which we must adhere.
It is the Commission's duty to adhere rigorously to these criteria, which were, moreover, agreed upon by the 15 countries, including Ireland.
Our duty is not to make exceptions for some countries: our duty will be to apply the rules to small and large countries alike, for the Commission's duty is to be the guardian of the interests of all the European peoples and countries.
This is what we have done thus far and this is what we will do in the future.
I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this brief answer to make two observations.
Firstly, we must not disregard - and I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency once again - the great progress made in resolving the sticking points of the social guidelines.
There had been an impasse in this area for a long time and they were a genuine problem: now another step forward has been taken.
In this connection, I would also like to thank Mrs Diamantopoulou for her work.
Lastly, a reference has been made to the speech I made a few days ago on the need for a European tax.
I would like to reiterate this concept, clear up any ambiguity and open a discussion with Parliament on this very sensitive matter.
The Commission is working on it, it is analysing the possibility and feasibility of introducing such a tax, which will have to replace existing taxes and will not be an additional burden of any kind for the European citizens.
We were quite clear about this from the very first time the matter was raised and we must continue to be so now.
We must also, however, make it clear that this initiative is a response to an explicit request from the Council and Parliament.
We must reflect on these matters, for the institutions must be democratic in matters of taxation as well, and thus the purpose of this hypothetical future tax is to replace the current - complex, obscure, non-transparent - system of contributions from national States and to make the citizens more aware that we have a democratic way of acquiring resources and a transparent way of spending the resources acquired.
This is our absolute duty for, apart from anything else, we must combat as far as possible the attitude, often common in our Member States, of "I want my money back", the rather circumspect kind of accounting practised by the national States which leaves European institutions at their mercy.
In my opinion, this must change and, I repeat, it is a compulsory step for all democratic institutions: they must be able to count on clearly-defined resources - which can, of course, be transfers from national taxes to European taxes but must be clearly defined and specifically dedicated to the European institutions - and to answer equally transparently to the European citizens.
In my view, these are the methods that we must always use.
If we use these methods, the attitude of the European peoples will become much more positive and much more sympathetic, for they will understand what we are doing with their trust and their money.
Finally, we must also take the lesson of the Irish referendum and the subsequent deliberations to heart.
The European peoples want and must have an incisive, ambitious project on which to express their opinion.
They want to have a comprehensive project to assess; they want to know what part of their future it is they are going to share with the other European countries.
They harbour no preconceived hostility, they have not suddenly become narrow-minded: they simply have the right to understand, the right to be aware of every new step that takes place, every new step that will affect their lives.
Since we have to take decisions, now and in the near future, which are important for all the European citizens, we must set this course, we must move in this direction.
And the convention is - or will be - the first tentative stage in this new era for the European institutions.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
The debate is closed.
I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up this debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparations for the Gothenburg European Council.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
We have concluded this morning' s debates.
I therefore suspend the sitting until the vote at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.33 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon).
Madam President, my point of order refers to an issue which I have raised on other occasions in this House and it relates to the fact that African people are continually dying on Spanish coasts.
Recently, fifteen Africans died when the Spanish Civil Guard attempted to board their ship off the coasts of the Canary Islands and this week another person has died.
We are terribly concerned when Mexicans die in the Arizona desert, but we are completely indifferent to the fact that people looking for work in Europe continually die off our coasts.
I believe it is high time that this Parliament and the other European institutions took measures to combat this serious problem which affects all of us.
We shall take note of what you say, Mr Nogueira.

Joint motion for a resolution on the preparation of the European Council on 15-16 June in Gothenburg
Before the vote on the fourth indent of the preamble
Blokland (EDD).
(NL) Madam President, the fourth indent of the resolution refers to the HulthÃ©n report and the Myller report.
There is no mention of the Blokland report on the Commission communication: on bringing our needs and responsibilities together - integrating environmental issues with economic policy.
I suggest that that should be added.
I have discussed it with those who tabled the motion and they have no objection.
(Parliament agreed to take into consideration the oral amendment)
Before the vote on paragraph 8
Madam President, I have an oral amendment which will further detail Paragraph 40, particularly at the beginning, where it refers to the UCK.
The oral amendment reads "from the UCK and armed groups associated with it" .
I hope it is clear that this renders the text more specific.
Madam President, we have registered an amendment to paragraph 41 replacing Macedonia with Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia.
I hope that this is noted before we hold the final vote.
Of course, this is a most important linguistic correction, which will be noted.
So we do not need to vote on it as it has been duly recorded.
Madam President, the text reads "Macedonian government" .
This is an oral amendment and we should ask if there are any objections to it.
No, that is not at all the case. It is a matter of consistency to use the term FYROM throughout the text.
(Exclamation by Mr Posselt: 'No, that is not true!')
So it is in that spirit that we have made this change.
It really does not need to be put to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, this is a highly political issue and I would therefore ask that you arrange for it to be examined by the relevant committee.
These linguistic shenanigans are in fact political points.
Otherwise what we put in before was also a linguistic correction.
Yes, Mr Posselt, once again let me assure you that we really have checked this: it is not a question of taking a political position but of consistency.
There was a linguistic error in the text, which has now been corrected.
Madam President, I think Mr Posselt is quite right.
Our Parliament has taken a political decision to stop using the term 'ARYM' or 'FYROM' , which is meaningless, and to call the country by its real name, which is 'Macedonia' .
Madam President, I do not like the result of this vote.
Could we have it again, and maybe set up a forum to discuss it first?
That is what we are asking the Irish people to do on this issue.
The correction in question is designed purely to make the text consistent.
We cannot use one word for something and then use a different one elsewhere in the same text.
That is obvious.
Having said that, if on some other occasion the European Parliament wishes to proceed differently, that is a political decision it will have to take.
We cannot, however, take a decision of this kind on one word in a text.
I therefore assume responsibility for the vote that has been taken.
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0187/2001), by Mr Davies, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to ozone in ambient air (13114/1/2000 - C5-0090/2001 - 1999/0068(COD))

Recommendation for second reading (A5-0179/2001), by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common positions adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation amending:
I. Council Regulation (EEC) 3528/86 on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution (14644/1/2000 REV 1 - C5-0072/2001 - 1999/0159(COD))
II. Council Regulation (EEC) 2158/92 on protection of the Community's forests against fire (14645/1/2000 REV 1 - C5-0073/2001 - 1999/0160(COD))

Before the vote
Madam President, when it comes to this report, the Finnish amendments for the part- session were only received this morning, i.e. I only received the 14 last amendments for this part-session in my native language this morning.
In my opinion this is unsatisfactory.
However, I am not demanding that the voting on this report be delayed because of this but I would just like Parliament to know that having these amendments arrive in my native language so late just will not do.
Thank you, Mrs Kauppi. I agree with you that this is quite unacceptable.
Thank you for your understanding and I will ensure that it never happens again.
Before the vote on Amendments Nos 47, 48 and 49
Madam President, before we vote on Article 26, colleagues have pointed out to me that the English wording of my Amendment No 47, which I hope the House will adopt, is not entirely clear in other languages.
Therefore I should like to read out the English-language text, which refers to radio and television broadcasts.
The text, for clarification, reads: "... in pursuit of a public service broadcasting remit".
I emphasise the last word because that is intended to include both public service broadcasting and private sector broadcasters who work under a public service remit.
I believe that is not clear in every language.
I ask you to ensure that the final translation in other languages - assuming that my amendment is accepted - covers that point.
Certainly, Mr Harbour.
In that case, we will, of course, make the necessary checks.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, I refer to paragraph 21 of the Brok report.
We voted on this paragraph and I rather thought that we rejected it.
But you say that this paragraph was adopted.
Could you please check exactly what happened?
You are right, the original text was adopted by an equal number of votes, since the amendment was rejected.
Madam President, I refer to the vote on paragraph 21, not the proposed amendment.
Mr Sakellariou, I have had it confirmed that it was adopted by a large majority.
I am sorry, but we cannot re-take votes.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Gothenburg European Council
I voted against the second part of paragraph 23 of the joint motion for a resolution on preparation for the European Council in Gothenburg for the following reasons:
First, because there is no official Commission proposal on the gradual abolition of tobacco subsidies, merely a reference by the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, to the debate on sustainable development.
The wording of paragraph 23 is therefore incorrect.
Secondly, because abolishing tobacco subsidies in order to combat smoking is a hypocritical approach.
It is hypocritical because any such measures in a European Union with a tobacco deficit will achieve two objectives: first, they will punish tobacco farmers in southern Europe and, secondly, they will strengthen tobacco farmers in other, third countries, from which tobacco will be imported to make up the resultant tobacco shortage, which in turn will affect the balance of trade of the European Union.
Thirdly, because there are areas in Europe, such as the prefecture of Xanthi in northern Greece, where the rare Basma variety of tobacco has been the only crop cultivated for several generations and where it is the sole means of support for over 20,000 farmers who work in small, remote, mountain plots measuring between 30 and 300 square metres, where nothing else will grow, and who will be plunged into total poverty if the ideas being promoted are put into practice.
Madam President, I voted for this resolution on the forthcoming Gothenburg Council because it contains an important point on the undertaking to secure pensions in Europe - as the report says - which are sustainable and enable those who have worked to live a dignified life.
I feel that Europe must be close to its citizens, not just in terms of the economy but also when they have finished working and have a right to a pension which allows them to live comfortably even when they are too old to continue working.
I therefore hope that we will genuinely take this path.
Madam President, I voted against this resolution.
There were some good things in it, on enlargement and sustainability; but in relation to defence policy, I just could not accept the idea of welcoming the rapid reaction force and wanting it to be operational before the end of 2001.
I do not support the militarisation of Europe.
There are a number of aspects of this resolution, in relation also to defence budgets, which promote the militarisation of Europe.
There is one point that I voted against in the roll-call votes, in relation to the US missile defence system.
I feel the point was not made strongly enough.
It seemed to accept the missile defence system.
Just asking to be kept informed about it is not enough.
We should not go along with the US missile defence system.
We should oppose it at every opportunity rather than saying: just keep us informed about it.
In general I feel this resolution points in the wrong direction.
It supports the militarisation of Europe - something I do not support.
I voted "against".
Perhaps, if you put it to me again, under a lot of pressure, I would change my mind, just as the Irish Government hopes the Irish people will do with regard to the Nice Treaty.
Madam President, the young people of Europe see this Gothenburg appointment as extremely important, for the Treaty of Nice and the Irish referendum are in danger of compromising the future of many of them.
This, therefore, is why, in expressing an opinion on the Gothenburg Summit, we have called upon the Council - and it is an appeal that I am also making in this explanation of vote to you, Madam President, who will be going to Gothenburg and who will certainly be able to refer this request with great authority, given that it would appear to come from Parliament - for a change of direction, for it to be taken into account that we cannot conduct European politics or achieve European unity in the same way as the diplomats of the 16th and 17th centuries.
Europe is different, and we must ensure that it is built by the elected representatives of the people, by an ad hoc body which is close to the citizens and young people, in particular.
Madam President, I voted against the joint motion for a resolution on the preparation of the GÃ¶teborg Summit because paragraph 8 thereof, on the future of the Union, calls for a Convention to be established to prepare the forthcoming IGC at the end of 2003 or 2004.
As worded, the common position excludes all "stateless nations" inside the European Union.
Basques, Corsicans, Sardinians, etc. In all more than 50 million people will have no opportunity to participate in this debate.
That is quite undemocratic and most regrettable.
That is why I say clearly that it is a big mistake to exclude all these people.
Last week a similar amendment to the report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro was excluded.
It is regrettable that we have made the same mistake today.
. (EL) Once again the leaders of the ÃU will meet behind closed doors in order to decide on our future.
Military and civil "crisis management", the fire which has broken out in the Balkans and the increasingly acute destabilisation of the area and the enlargement of the EU are just some of the items on the agenda.
They will also receive the President of the USA in order to carve up the world and broker an understanding with him on the new Star Wars.
However, in reality, the summit will be held under the shadow of the recent referendum in Ireland, in which the people rejected the Nice Treaty.
However much the leaders of the EU try to play down the results of the Irish referendum, they cannot alter the fact that the Irish people have spoken out against the barbaric and inhumane policy being imposed by the interests of big business on our continent.
Their reactions show exactly where the limits of civic democracy lie.
They have provocatively stated that the timetable for ratifying the Treaty will be adhered to, the results of the referendum notwithstanding, thereby confirming that their democracy is a dictatorship of big business.
The state of the European economy, the fall in the euro and other economic issues will be addressed with even stricter anti-grass roots measures than before, at the expense of the workers, by speeding up capital restructuring and hitting the insurance systems, so as to safeguard the competitiveness and profitability of big business in Europe, thereby creating more poverty, unemployment and insecurity for the people of Europe.
This is the Europe of their visions; by no stretch of the imagination is it the Europe of the workers.
The reference to the environment and what is euphemistically called "sustainable development" is a smokescreen to hide the fact that neoliberal policy is invading the collective sector which we call the environment.
The motion for a resolution by the European Parliament not only accepts these guidelines, it goes even further.
It distorts reality in a desperate bid to convince the people that all this is for their own good.
It plainly commends the militarisation of the European Union and expresses the hope that the Rapid Reaction Force will start demonstrating its operational capacity before the end of the year.
It calls for the Member States to spend vast sums on military expenses and on the European Council to approve a strong and efficient conflict prevention programme.
It hypocritically condemns terrorist action by the KLA and applauds the pressure being exerted on the government of the FYROM via Mr Solana and Mr Patten.
And to prove just how meddlesome it is, the European Parliament has seen fit to commend the Commission's proposal that tobacco subsidies gradually be abolished.
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion.
The referendum in which Ireland said 'no' to the Treaty of Nice has given rise to all kinds of biased interpretations, which only goes to show how anti-democratic the federalists can be.
Some of those who want to pursue the ratification process as though nothing had happened have questioned the 'relevance of the referendum', on the grounds of the low turnout.
Perhaps they think that decisions taken by Eurocrats alone are more democratic?
At any rate, the low Irish turnout was due mainly to the demobilisation of the 'yes' voters, which is, of course, something else to be put on the debit side of the Treaty of Nice.
The second misinterpretation is that the Irish said 'no' for specifically Irish reasons, i.e. because they wished to retain their neutrality in relation to defence, did not want to become a net contributor financially, wanted to retain their restrictive legislation on abortion, and so forth.
But these individual explanations do not suffice.
There is only one real reason for the open or underlying 'no' vote: the Irish people's wish to retain their freedom of decision faced with an invasive Europe, which would become even more so with the Treaty of Nice.
The third misinterpretation is this: we are told that in rejecting Nice, the Irish rejected the intergovernmental method of negotiating treaties on the grounds that it is too obscure.
That may be true, but we certainly must not conclude from this that in future we will have to take these powers away from the governments and introduce more supra-national methods of preparing or reviewing treaties.
On the contrary, we must give the nations greater powers.
Lastly, worst of all, perhaps, are those who regard the Irish vote as a reaction against a Europe that is indifferent to its citizens and explain that the only remedy is to establish a European constitution, as soon as possible.
Of course, this remedy would only make things worse by reinforcing the supra-national aspect.
So let us take a sober and simple look at the result of this referendum: it signals the rejection of a federal Europe.
- (DA) We abstain from voting on paragraph 5 about the pleasure felt at agreement' s having recently been reached on a common EU position in connection with the negotiations with the applicant countries. That is because we cannot support the common EU position (the Treaty of Nice), but are in favour of enlargement of the EU.
We voted against this proposal because the Europe of which it depicts some aspects is not our Europe, does not relate to the world of work.
It is the Europe of the traders, the bankers and the large industrial groups, a coalition between their respective states.
This Europe, laboriously established over the past fifty years by the bourgeoisies of European countries condemned to get on if they were not to disappear from the international economic stage, and yet competing among themselves, was built purely in their interests.
The difficulties it is facing in its attempts to enlarge to the countries of Eastern Europe are simply a reflection of its fundamental nature.
The future certainly lies in the unification of Europe, of the whole of Europe, on the basis of total equality between its peoples and the abolition of borders.
It cannot, however, be founded on an agreement between capitalist groups that are concerned solely with making profits, while totally disregarding the interests of the people.
A truly unified Europe under the democratic control of its people will emerge only if profound social changes are made, which bring an end to the economic and social domination of private financial groups.
. The Irish 'No' was not a 'No' to enlargement.
Not one political party campaigned against enlargement.
Only one non-party organisation did so.
The Irish people have spoken on Nice and their decision will be respected.
The people of the other 14 member states are also entitled to have their say on the treaty in accordance with their constitutions.
For them it will be expressed through their democratically elected parliaments.
They must not be denied that right.
As a democracy where the people are sovereign, the Irish people are also entitled to decide to revisit their decision to confirm it or to reverse it.
It is my view that we now need a sustained debate on Nice and for those parties who supported Nice to seek a mandate at the next general election, which will take place by June 2002, to present a new proposal on Nice to the people before December 2002.
Myself and my colleague, John Cushnahan have published a seven-point initiative on measures, which we feel could help to clarify the issues and to assuage fears in Ireland.
I am happy to report that one of those, the establishment of an Irish Forum on the Future of Europe, has now been adopted by the Irish Government.
It should, in my view act in parallel with and interact with the European Convention proposed by the Socialist Group and which Minister Lindh has this morning supported as a proposal for Gothenburg.
It is not easy to discern the myriad of concerns, some domestic, some European, which gave rise to the No result.
There is however one overriding and general concern: The sense that people are losing control of their government and their lives.
People know that the European Project is necessary and important to them. But people are at a loss to know how they fit into the scheme of things.
The bottom line is that if we want people in every European country to initiate a new experiment in sharing their democracy, sharing their sovereignty, sharing the benefits of their freedoms, then we as their elected representatives have to lead courageously by spelling out in great detail how it will all work.
The rights of each and every nation state and each and every single person who lives in Europe must be guaranteed.
I believe that can best be done through a New Federalism, based on a European Constitution.
So far, we only have the vaguest outline of what that might look like.
We have a mountain to climb but I am confident that the people in Ireland and the rest of Europe will rise to the challenge when they are given a chance.
. I voted in favour of the joint resolution because I believe that the issues of sustainable development and climate change are so important in the context of the GÃ¶teborg summit that the European Parliament must make a very clear statement.
However, there are elements of the resolution that I did not agree with.
With reference to paragraphs 35 and 36, I do not believe that a military alliance which is based on the possession and threatened use of nuclear weapons can be a force for "security and stability".
Secondly, I am totally opposed to the proposals for the US missile defence system - a system which would be banned under the 1972 ABM Treaty and will increase international tension.
I do not agree that it should go ahead, whether or not there has been consultation with the European partners.
Despite this, there is a need for strong political leadership on sustainable development and I hope that the encouragement given to the Council to take on this role will result in progress at an international level.
In addition, the decision to look at Parliament's own working methods and hold an annual debate on sustainable development are important steps forward.
. (PT) At a time when we are discussing the Gothenburg European Council, a few days after the resounding 'No' in the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice, it is crucial that the European Union' s political leaders, including the governments of the various Member States, draw all the political consequences of this important decision.
In a democracy, the results of a move such as this must be respected.
We must, therefore, review the content of the amendments to the Treaty, which were adopted in Nice and not insist, which is what happened recently with the vote on the report co-signed by the socialist Member, AntÃ³nio JosÃ© Seguro, on speeding up the process of the federalist integration of the European Union. This would endanger various fundamental aspects of national sovereignty and the interests of the smaller countries.
It is regrettable that, in Gothenburg, the opportunity of the Summit has not been taken to reflect on the need to review the current process of integration, which is neo-liberal, federalist and militarist, including the rather undemocratic methods that have been used.
We must insist on a new direction, grounded in respect for cooperation between sovereign and equal States, in promoting peace, and in responding to people' s real needs.
It is, therefore, essential that in Gothenburg we see progress on support for peace in the Middle East, on respect for the rights of the Palestinian people, on protecting the environment and on sustainable development.
It is equally important that we adopt a clear stance towards George Bush - against his most aggressive positions, specifically with regard to the American anti-missile defence project and the death penalty and to demand that he respect the Kyoto commitments.
. (EL) The group of MEPs from the Panhellenic Socialist Party voted against part two of article 23 of the motion on preparation for the European Council in Gothenburg because it feels that abolishing tobacco growing in Europe, which is the aim of this provision, will not have the slightest effect on the overall quantities of tobacco used by the European tobacco industry, given that the European share of the supply (approximately 30% of the total) will immediately be replaced by imports from countries outside the European Union, at the expense of European producers.
The MEPs from the Panhellenic Socialist Party feel that illnesses caused by smoking cannot be combated through ineffectual measures which are merely empty gestures that pander to the hypocrisy of those who have concentrated health care for European citizens on a single point of dubious efficacy.
At the forthcoming European Summit in Gothenburg, the Fifteen will most probably demonstrate once again that they are unable to build a democratic and social Europe.
Entrenched in its inability to sustain a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, Europe will continue to stand by and watch the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people without being able to enforce UN Resolutions 242 and 338 or insist that the settlements are dismantled.
A few months ahead of the introduction of the euro, Europe will prove equally unable to intervene to prevent the dictatorship of the markets, letting transnational trusts like Marks & Spencer or Danone dismiss thousands of employees while amassing profits of several million euros.
We need European legislation that prohibits market-based dismissals, just as we need to introduce a tax on capital movements and to abolish tax havens.
What is more, however, following the failure of the Treaty of Nice, the Fifteen will continue to promote a Europe that is geared entirely to liberalism by continuing to privatise the public services and calling the systems of social protection into question.
Ireland' s recent rejection of this treaty shows, once again, that Europe cannot be built without the consent of its people.
We need to hold referendums on the future of Europe and we need to review and amend the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We urgently need to reduce the democratic deficit between the citizens and their representatives.
In Gothenburg, the future of Europe will be played out not in palaces turned into bunkers but on the streets, with the progressive forces.
. (NL) There is a big difference between the Europe the leaders want and the Europe the public wants.
The leaders want centralisation, greater uniformity, liberalisation, cuts in spending and a massive display of power.
The citizens want democracy, a small-scale approach, protection, social welfare and the right to diversity.
Whenever the people of a European Union Member State have the chance to express their views on further European integration, it turns out that about half the voters reject that development.
It has already happened in France and Denmark, and now it has happened again in Ireland.
The same thing will happen in Sweden and the United Kingdom in the next few years.
Last week, 54% of Irish voters rejected the proposals put forward at the Nice Summit at the end of 2000.
Not because they have anything against the people of Eastern Europe, but probably because, for example, they understandably do not like the idea of being caught up in NATO' s military ventures.
Quite rightly, a number of the motions for a resolution tabled regarding the forthcoming Gothenburg Summit press for a stronger environmental policy, a social Europe and respect for the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia.
But basically, they still come from the top down and they represent the wrong Europe
. (IT) After years of exasperating stagnation, the Union has, for some months, been progressing at an increasingly frenetic rate with which the citizens cannot keep up.
Indeed, it is difficult for them to follow all the stages which have characterised the development of the Union recently: the signing of the Treaty of Nice against the backdrop of the general discontent and the urban guerrilla warfare sparked off by the anti-globalisation movements, the 'Convention' which drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the 'fundamentalists' who want to incorporate it into a European Constitution, the proposals currently being discussed to use the 'convention' method again for the institutional reforms and so on and so forth
These are all steps which are difficult for the citizens to follow.
They cannot understand why progress is speeding up in some matters while it is infuriatingly slow in the issues that affect them directly: indeed, the absence of a European economic project, continuing unemployment, the likely weakness of the euro and lack of food safety are only some of the many issues which concern and perplex the citizens.
We would like to see the current elements of the Community acquis implemented first, and then a broader debate held with the citizens of the Union in order to clear up doubts and allay fears before we move on to new institutional phases.
This is why we have abstained in the vote.
.
(FI) Besides the fact that I voted for the communication on the Gothenburg European Council meeting, I would like to state the following as my explanation of vote:
For the first time, environmental issues are the main issue before the European Council this week in Gothenburg.
The strategy of sustainable development will create a real content for the Union' s policy, particularly by uniting the economy, employment and the environment.
This is an important step in the development of the EU in becoming a responsible player also in international cooperation, a good example of which is the visible defence of the Kyoto Agreement.
It must be ensured that the strategy for sustainable development will not be overshadowed by other issues at the summit.
In Gothenburg, the leaders of the EU must do their utmost to change the negative decision on Kyoto made by the US.
As the US National Academy of Sciences agrees on the necessity of the agreement, the Bush administration should not have a problem returning to the ranks of responsible states.
Serious consideration must be given to the Irish decision to vote against ratification of the Treaty of Nice.
We must reassess the way the Union works and increase openness.
When, according to researchers in the field, not even the Heads of State who took part in the negotiations are fully aware of the consequences of the Treaty of Nice, we might ask ourselves whether it is possible to reach a sensible decision on this issue at all.
Every support must now be given to an open preparation model as the forthcoming reform of the Union gets underway.
Citizens must be able to follow what is happening in the Union and the institutional reform cannot be made an exception to this principle.
The reactions to the result of the Irish referendum of many leading European figures who were directly involved in drafting the Treaty of Nice or who are now playing up to it sycophantically make it quite clear that the type of Europe depicted in that treaty is based on total lack of respect for the people of Europe.
In a sign of complete disregard for the dignity of the people, even before knowing the final result of the vote in which the Irish people expressed their views, Commissioner Verheugen dared to make the peremptory statement in relation to Ljubljana that an 'Irish veto' would in no way prevent the enlargement of the European Union as provided for in the Treaty of Nice.
Still on the subject of commissioners, the sight of Mr Barnier shamelessly pretending to speak for the Irish people and learnedly explaining to the readers of Le Figaro on 11 June the three reasons for the Irish 'no' vote, which, according to him, have nothing to do with the Treaty of Nice, reflects the same total disregard for the sovereignty of nations.
The Irish, who very scrupulously respect their Constitution, are the only Europeans to have had the privilege of being able to express an opinion on Nice in the most democratic way possible, i.e. by referendum. That meant they had the benefit of a real national debate on the content and implications of that treaty.
Nonetheless, Mr Barnier declared that 'the Treaty of Nice itself was not at issue in the Irish vote' ...
Mr VÃ©drine, caught up in the system after initially opposing the draft treaty, now rises pathetically to its defence, accusing the Irish of having succumbed to a kind of withdrawal instinct.
Mr Moscovici is broadening the debate by welcoming the absence of a referendum in France: he dismissed this eminently democratic procedure by which the sovereign people are asked to state their views as a 'pretext offering the coalition of 'noes' an opportunity to speak out against Europe' .
As for the Foreign Ministers' Council, since 11 June it has dismissed any possibility of renegotiating the Treaty of Nice to take account of the clearly expressed wishes of the Irish people.
This kind of stance very much gives the image of a Europe that despises its own peoples and is resolutely opposed to democracy; a Europe that is being built in a deliberately abstruse manner so as to be immune to the wishes or scrutiny of the people.
To pretend now that the Irish 'no' to Nice prevents enlargement is a nonsense.
It is the Treaty of Nice that creates the problem here.
On the contrary, thanks to the Irish vote, it is now possible, as Philippe de Villiers has proposed, to proceed with enlargement without confiscating national sovereignties. This can be done on the one hand by abandoning the supranational part of the treaty and including its annexed provisions on enlargement in future accession treaties, and on the other hand by enabling the candidate countries to join the European Union immediately, without the need for a supplementary treaty, by offering them accession to the intergovernmental part of the treaty as it stands.
I have voted against paragraphs 30 and 31 of the resolution ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg.
As I have stated many times before, I am against a common European defence capability and increased military expenditure.
However, I share the view expressed in paragraph 32.
. Madam President, I very much look forward to the outcome of the GÃ¶teborg European Council.
It marks the end of an impressive presidency by the Swedish Government and I congratulate my Swedish colleagues.
The GÃ¶teborg meeting of the Heads of State and Government will primarily be about enlargement.
The most important issue for this summit is to achieve a breakthrough in the enlargement negotiations.
The challenge for Europe in the 1980s was to build a single market.
The challenge in the 1990s was to create a single currency.
The challenge at the beginning of this millennium is to enlarge the EU in a way that creates stability, peace and prosperity for all.
Enlargement is crucial for increasing trade, employment and prosperity for all, for helping to improve environmental standards and reducing cross-border pollution, for promoting effective cooperation in the fight against crime and drugs, for improving minority rights, and for enhancing peace, democracy and stability in Europe.
This is an important message to take to our citizens in the European Union, who should be aware of the advantages and consequences of enlargement.
I very much hope that this Summit also makes strong progress on the issue of the environment.
Environmental issues are a top priority for our citizens across the European Union.
We need to prioritise limiting climate changes and take clear leadership in global cooperation.
We also need to agree on working towards concrete goals for the use of clean energy sources, a sustainable transport system, tackling threats to public health and improving our use of natural resources.
To make Europe truly a people's Europe, we must "green up" our act and look closely at an innovative strategy for sustainable development.
Furthermore, we must tell people about the biggest challenge currently facing the European Union and its citizens, namely enlargement.
For far too long we have not told them this story, and it is high time we let them know.
After all, it is a good story to tell.
Recommendation for second reading by Mr Davies (A5-0187/2001)
Madam President, I was happy to vote for the directive on ozone.
As we know, ozone, in itself, is activated oxygen: a healthy thing.
What, I regret to say, is not healthy is destroying part of the protective layer of ozone which is in the air, causing an increase in radiation from the sun and the climate change that we all fear.
If this should happen, as we are well aware, that would be harmful - as it already is - to all the citizens but, especially, since it is mainly a question of the air we breathe, to the elderly, many of whom suffer from respiratory problems.
I therefore hope that the European Union will genuinely continue to work to combat air pollution.
Madam President, Mr Fatuzzo rightly referred to the risks of ozone to older people, but I would like to speak of young people.
For it is young people who are the main victims.
In fact, as you are well aware, if we do nothing about the greenhouse effect and the hole in the ozone layer it is the young, the new generations, who will be most at risk.
So I too welcome this directive and I hope that young Europeans will indeed derive real benefit from it.
That, at least, is what we hope and what we wanted to express through our vote.
Recommendation for second reading by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez (A5-0179/2001)
Madam President, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez has tabled a document which seeks to protect the European Union's forests against fire and pollution.
Many pensioners and elderly people who are members of the Pensioners' Party, of which I have the honour of being the representative to Parliament, tell me that they have free time and would like to be useful, to do something to help society.
Therefore, I propose to Parliament that the next guidelines laid down on this subject should provide for elderly volunteers who are available to be used to go into the forests and woods and to act as watchmen in order to prevent fires, particularly those fires started maliciously which are a scourge on the whole of our verdant Europe.
Madam President, it is our young people who spend most time in our forests, going camping, doing summer courses, taking part in boy scout ventures: out of our entire population they are the ones who have the most contact with the European forests.
What is more, our community service volunteers carry out forestry operations precisely in order to restore an ecosystem which is in danger of being lost or, at any rate, spoilt.
I am speaking on behalf of a great many young people who are members of and vote for the Radical Party, and I say to them that this is an important area of activity for Europe, and I see this directive, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez' report, as supporting young people's endeavours.
Harbour report (A5-0202/2001)
Madam President, it would be difficult to deny that the people who spend most time watching television - one of the objectives of the Mr Harbour's report - are the elderly.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that, with this directive, the European Union is starting to realise that it needs to do something about the programmes broadcast on television as well.
I feel that it would be appropriate if, without introducing unwanted censorship, cultural programmes were also to be made which would be educational for viewers and serve the community as a whole, so that we had something to watch other than violent films and spectacles which do nothing but destroy the values that the elderly still have but which young people, I regret to say, have lost.
Madam President, it may well be that the issue concerns the elderly as well, but it is extremely important in terms of young people and, above all, children.
We know how many children watch television and how often they watch it alone, without parental supervision, without, that is, the filter provided by the family, or maybe not the family, given that the statistics show that many children are born out of wedlock.
From this point of view, therefore, the Harbour report is important, and I am saying this precisely on behalf of the young people of our continent, on behalf of the many young people who approach us and tell us to concern ourselves with broadcasts - not to mention the conflicts of interests and monopolies which have been discussed so often in recent days - and I would add that it is important precisely for young people and children that the European Union legislates on this matter.
Lulling report (A5-0181/2001)
Madam President, the explanatory statement on page 11 of Mrs Lulling's report declares that the information required from the companies who draw up these statistics must include information on the pension funds to which the employees of the company subscribe.
However, I regret to say that the attached form, which I have read, does not contain the most important, useful, relevant question that these companies should be asked.
What is the question that must be asked regarding these companies' pension funds?
It is this, of course, Madam President: are the pensioners drawing pensions from these funds satisfied with their pensions?
Because, if not, something needs to change.
Madam President, who is it that deals with statistics in the companies?
Usually young graduates, young people who have been taken on in these companies and who come from universities that indeed teach statistics.
The part of Mrs Lulling's report which relates to young people is therefore important.
I cannot stress this enough and I would like to say that we voted for the text.
Torres Marques report (A5-0149/2001)
Madam President, this report tackles the issue of simplifying invoices.
Here too, at last, is an attempt to improve the regulation of electronic signatures on invoices.
I am for the use of electronic signatures, but I feel that we should work towards introducing them in votes where a signature is required as well.
As you know, there are national referendums, and there are proposals for national legislation which are signed by the citizens.
They have to be signed by a certain number of people, for example 500 thousand citizens.
They could sign these directly democratic requests - these referendums and proposals for national legislation - electronically as well.
This would be a sign of greater democracy in the nations of Europe.
Madam President, I agree fully with what Mr Fatuzzo has said.
We Radicals are also fighting in Italy for the use of electronic signatures to be extended and authorised, in view of the catastrophic performance at the last Italian elections, in which voting continued until 5 o'clock in the morning in some centres whereas the elections should have closed at 10 o'clock at night.
I would also stress that it is precisely these young research scientists, who have taken over the world in recent years with new technologies - consider the average age of Java or even Microsoft programmers and of the creators of all these new technologies - who have ensured that the world of young people is the first to be concerned with the development of information technology and applied technologies.
In this respect, I can only congratulate the rapporteur on this report, for the subject is of great interest to many young people who vote for the Radical Party.
Miller report (A5-0194/2001)
. I wholeheartedly support this report by my Socialist colleague Helena Torres Marques which aims to ease the administrative burden on businesses trading across countries.
It replaces 15 different national rules governing VAT invoices with one simple set of rules.
This demonstrates yet again Europe's commitment to create an environment for entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish across the EU.
Different rules for VAT invoices in EU Member States often hinder many businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies.
Not only does this proposal replace national rules for VAT invoices with one set of rules, but it also covers electronic invoicing and there is provision for the use of advanced electronic signatures.
By introducing uniform measures in business transactions across Europe, small companies will gain confidence in trading, not just across Britain, but right across the European Single Market.
The Single Market is essential for jobs in the North West of Britain.
Nearly 40% of small and medium-sized business enterprises in the region have trading links with other EU Member States.
As a member of the European Single Market, they will have access to over 370 million potential customers - over 6 times more than in Britain alone.
I and my Labour colleagues are determined to make the Single Market work for British business.
By giving businesses from Bury to Blackburn the confidence to reach into these markets, this measure will contribute to this aim and will increase trade, growth and employment across the North West.
Madam President, I abstained in the vote on this document.
It is an abstention which expresses my desire for what is a dream for many European workers to become reality.
This document enables those who so desire - and that is a good thing - to have the right as employees of the European Commission to retire at 50 years old, providing that they have paid 10 years of contributions, and to receive an allowance of 60% of their last basic salary.
Of course, I am happy for them, but I would prefer it - and this is why I abstained - if we could say the same thing to all the workers of Europe as well, who, in all our States, are told, "You will have to work until you are 65 or 70 years old and for at least 30, 35 or 40 years, and the most you will be able receive is 40 or 50% of your retirement pension".
Madam President, Mr Miller's report is important primarily as regards the entry of many young people at the bottom grade, who leave the world of studying for the world of work and become part of the European civil service in the Community.
It is therefore on these young officials that I wish to focus, for this progress towards the future pension mentioned by Mr Fatuzzo is, of course, linked to a career which starts at the youngest age at which is possible to join the Union's staff.
And it is of these young officials that I was thinking when I voted for the Miller report, voting for an improvement, in the context of the Kinnock reform, in the terms and conditions of the officials and other employees of the European Union as well.
Of course we are in favour of allowing officials and temporary servants of the political groups to take early retirement, if they so wish, under the terms set out in the proposal.
But at the same time we cannot endorse the justification for these measures, namely to create an additional 1254 posts without incurring any additional expenditure.
We cannot help feeling suspicious about the way these posts are to be filled, given that it will be mainly by 'redeployment' and 'rationalisation' rather than recruitment.
And the fact that the expected 600 departures will be offset by only 258 new recruits certainly implies that the authors of this proposal are looking mainly to increase the workload on the remaining staff.
That is why we abstained on this report.
Brok report (A5-0207/2001)
Madam President, I am extremely happy that progress is being made in the dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and the ASEM States, that is Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, which also concern other very important groups of States in the area such as India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand.
I voted for this cooperation, but I call - and I am very happy to do so in this explanation of vote - upon the representatives of the European Union and these States to decide together, in these agreements, exchanges and meetings, upon the best way to tackle and resolve the problems of the elderly people of Europe and of the Far East.
Madam President, Mr Dupuis was initially the rapporteur of this report but, unfortunately, he had to give up because his approach - which was, in my opinion, in line with Parliament's recommendations and rightly focused on the serious violations of human rights in those areas, in certain countries in particular - was not taken up by the committee responsible.
We Radicals therefore abstained in the vote on a text with which we partly disagreed, precisely because it originated from a proposal by Mr Dupuis.
Having said that, Madam President, if there is an area, a context in which the dimension of young people is essential, it is the new recruits of Asia: it is they who may be able to take over from the old generation of Mandarins, those many elderly people who are unfortunately in command of these countries which are often run by dictatorships.
I place my trust in those young people and I hope that the European Union will do the same.
Make way for the young people of those countries!
Fourtou report (A5-0186/2001)
The resolution tabled on the relations between the states of the European Union and Asia (the 'ASEM process' ) has one positive aspect.
It confirms that the importance formally attached to human and democratic rights must not remain a dead letter, that the progress achieved (or not) in this field must be assessed at regular intervals and that political consequences must be drawn from these findings.
It also calls for strengthening the inter-parliamentary process, so that the governments and heads of enterprise do not have a monopoly over the Asia-Europe 'dialogue', by involving the elected institutions.
All this could help us strengthen the impact of independent and cooperative intervention by the social movements and the citizens of Europe and Asia.
Yet the resolution also has a very negative aspect.
Paragraph 26, which called for respect for the ILO agreements on trade union rights and workers' rights, has been deleted.
'Migratory flows' are once again associated, in the same sentence, with 'transnational crime' and 'terrorism' .
The resolution also wants to impose, as a 'priority' , respect for the 'world trade order' , in other words, submission to the dictatorship of the WTO and neo-liberal dogmas.
In that spirit, it highlights the 'central role' that is to be devolved to the 'Asian-Europe Business Forum' .
I therefore abstain on this resolution.
Madam President, I am, of course, in favour of banning the use of silicone in breast implants.
Last week, Madam President - if you will pardon this aside - I mentioned this document to my daughter, Cristina, who, moreover, was a runner-up in the Miss Italy competition, and I said to her: "I am totally against the use of silicone implants, particularly for women.
You don't use them, do you?"
"What are you saying?" she replied.
"I would never use silicone breast implants because I have absolutely no need of them.
Are you saying I have to come to Strasbourg to inform all the MEPs to whom you will relate this conversation that I am fine just as I am, au naturel, without any operations?"
And that is why I did not bring her to Strasbourg with my mother, my sister and my wife.
If I may say so, Madam President, it is our loss, for, in addition to being very beautiful, Mr Fatuzzo's daughter is also very nice and her absence is therefore a great loss to this Chamber or, at any rate, to Parliament.
By way of conclusion, Madam President, I would like to thank you for putting up with this little aside and say that, as far as silicone breast implants are concerned, if there is one category for which it is imperative that we introduce preventive measures to combat the risks engendered by breast implants - the sometimes negative effects of which in the field of health are, in spite of everything, still not well-known - it is precisely the category of young girls who, at 15 or 16 years old maybe, compare themselves with the women they see on various television programmes and attempt to improve their appearance by having, even at that tender age, a breast implant operation.
In this sense, therefore, the category of young people is particularly concerned, and the text we have adopted today must be addressed first and foremost to them.
. The Greens/EFA Group welcomes this report by Mrs Fourtou on Silicone Implants as a step forward in aiming to improve both the availability of information to those considering such implants and in the follow-up of the potential impact on their health.
This report is also valuable in that it stems directly from the action of citizens bringing the issue to Parliament' s Committee on Petitions - an opportunity available to anyone in the EU where they have concerns about EU legislation and its implementation, or the lack of such legislation.
The petitioners were people concerned, often directly, about the harmful impact of silicone implants for their health.
They spoke movingly to the Committee, research was commissioned via STOA, and this report reflects the outcome.
My Group welcomes the recommendation for further, more specific research.
We also welcome the recommendation for a minimum age for such surgical intervention.
It is of great concern to us that many young women feel the need to resort to cosmetic surgery in the search for a more perfect body in order to feel that they fit in to society, rather than society being willing to readily accept people, whatever their size and shape.
There is a need in a number of member states for cosmetic surgery, particularly that offered privately, to be effectively regulated and for all patients to be given full information.
The patient register is an important proposal as it will help in future research but also to reach women who may be felt to be at risk in the event of any future problem with a particular implant.
I trust that the Commission communication will include the recommendations of this House.
. (NL) Manufacturers have found a market amongst women who have had to have a breast removed after contracting breast cancer.
By using silicones it is possible to improve their physical appearance.
The problem is that after five years, half these breast prostheses start to leak and after 20 years, it is over 95%.
Toxins enter the women' s bodies and can cause inflammation, attack the auto-immune system and damage the connective tissue.
In the circumstances, it is better to stop using the silicone implants and to focus on developing alternatives.
France has now banned the implants, but other Member States are wavering and indecisive.
I agree with those who submitted the petitions that silicone breast implants should not be used until they have been proved not to be harmful.
The rapporteur' s solution, which is to improve information and registration, is certainly a step in the right direction in that it might reduce the number of victims, but it is inadequate because it means that there will be more victims even in the future.
It is still vital to give women better protection against the manufacturers and make sure they do not sacrifice their health for the sake of appearance.
I have voted against the proposal.
The European Parliament has once again failed to establish the limits of the EU' s responsibilities and the Member States' areas of competence.
The EU must concentrate on its core areas and main tasks.
This focus should be even clearer since the Irish people' s rejection of the Treaty of Nice in a referendum on 7 June.
The report before us concerns silicon implants, with proposals for rules, regulations, an age limit of 18 for breast implants for cosmetic reasons and the establishment of a European patient register.
It should be clear that this is not an issue to be decided at European level and that it has nothing to do with the main task of the European cooperation project, i.e. to promote peace in our part of the world.
If nobody else wishes to speak, the sitting is suspended.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Working time in mobile road-transport activities
The next item is the recommendation by Mr Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (A5-0196/2001), for second reading on the Council Common Position for adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on the organisation of the working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities [5919/1/2001 - C5-0134/2001 - 1998/0319(COD)].
Mr President, our ongoing work on working time goes back to the 1993 Directive, which excluded approximately six million workers in total, some 5 million of whom were working in the various transport sectors.
Last year's overhaul of the directive brought all rail workers, non-mobile workers in the other transport sectors, offshore workers and doctors in training under the directive's scope.
Furthermore, separate agreements have been reached in the maritime and aviation sectors.
This proposal on road transport thus seeks to close one of the last remaining gaps, but even so it will not cover all drivers.
As it stands, it will only apply to workers covered by Regulation No 3820/85 and will therefore leave out a number of categories of workers, including workers driving vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes, regular urban transport drivers, taxi drivers and drivers of vehicles carrying no more than nine passengers.
Amendment No 5, from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, seeks an early revision of the regulation in order to include these workers.
Even more serious, however, is the possibility left open in the common position, namely that the self-employed might be permanently excluded from this directive.
The original 1993 directive applies to employees, but this proposal has two legal bases: Article 137 covers occupational health and safety, while Article 71 covers operational safety.
It therefore applies to the self-employed, and rightly so.
We cannot exclude the self-employed.
If it is dangerous to a driver's health and safety, and to road safety more generally, for an employed driver to work long hours, is it not just as dangerous for a self-employed worker?
The answer to that, of course, is that it must be.
When a lorry fills your rear-view mirror, are you going to wonder whether that driver is employed and rested, or self-employed and potentially tired and dangerous?
So inclusion of all drivers is important, both on occupational health and safety grounds and on operational safety grounds.
But there is also a third important element: that of ensuring fair competition between the various modes of transport.
The rail sector is currently covered by the 1993 directive, but road is not covered by anything approaching a similar regime.
If we are serious about promoting a transfer of freight traffic from road to rail, with all of the environmental benefits that this can bring, then this too is a very important consideration.
My proposed compromise on this point is the same as the Commission's revised opinion following our first reading.
In Amendment No 4, I propose an extra three-year transition for the self-employed, and then their automatic inclusion.
However, even this poses difficulties.
Even a temporary exclusion might open up the possibility of imaginative new forms of false self-employment and of collective arrangements being dismantled by unscrupulous employers.
That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has also proposed a tighter definition of what a self-employed driver actually is in Amendment No 10.
Those not meeting the criteria listed therein would be subject to the same rights and obligations under the directive as employees.
These are some of the important points in the proposal, but others include the definitions of working time and stand-by duty.
The common position is so vague on these issues that there is little point in trying to limit working time on that basis.
We have, therefore, proposed a return to the definition in the Commission's revised opinion in Amendment No 6.
In Amendment No 15 we propose that the reference period for calculating the average 48-hour week be limited to arrangements set in place as a result of collective agreements.
I proposed to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that a driver should receive prior notice of commencement of a period of availability 24 hours in advance.
That did not get the support I would have liked in committee, and I would therefore recommend to the House that the compromise proposed by Mrs Lynne in Amendment No 24 of 12 hours' prior notice should be supported.
In Amendment No 14 I propose that night work be limited to 8 hours with a possible temporary extension to 10 hours, so long as the 8-hour average is achieved over a reference period to be agreed after consultation with the social partners.
The human being is not a nocturnal animal and research demonstrates that the risks of accidents to health and safety are highest as a result of night work.
Therefore, that is also an important point.
In conclusion, the key element is that of the inclusion of the self-employed.
I hope transport ministers will be persuaded to agree to it, otherwise this whole package might be rejected.
They would be to blame if that were to occur, and I hope we can work together to make sure that we put this piece of the jigsaw puzzle in place as soon as possible.
Mr President, we support this directive.
I will not deny that there was a lengthy debate about specific points.
The most important bone of contention in our group was the inclusion of the self-employed.
The majority of the group supported that view, but even so, unlike the discussions at first reading, where the Commission and Parliament agreed that the self-employed should be included, the debate was much more difficult this time.
However, the majority of the group was, as I said, in favour of including the self-employed.
Why?
Firstly because the self-employed, like any other workers, are obviously entitled to health and safety at work.
Secondly, competition.
It is not right for businesses, whether independent or working with employees, to compete with each other on working hours, as is the case with the Common Position of the Council and the Commission.
A third reason - probably the matter on which the public is rightly most sensitive - is that many regrettable accidents occur, very often due to the fact that people have to work far too many hours and there is too little control. What is more, the control is made even more difficult by tachographs being tampered with.
This has a human cost, whether to tourists travelling south or motorists forced off the road by a lorry driver who has fallen asleep at the wheel.
I believe it is our duty to adopt a regulation on this at European level.
That does not mean it is not still open to discussion.
The PPE-DE Group will not be supporting two of the points.
Firstly, according to the text discussed in the Commission, employees are to be informed twelve hours or a specified number of hours beforehand and before the end of the previous shift of the start and length of their period of availability.
We shall not be supporting that because we believe that the unpredictability of traffic flows makes it really too difficult to organise.
The second point is that according to Amendment No 8, employers should count the time a non-driving worker spends sitting next to the driver whilst the vehicle is in motion as working hours.
We agree with the Commission that that should continue to be counted as a period of availability and not as working hours.
Mr President, Commissioner, I will start by saying that our Group warmly supports all the arguments and all the amendments which the rapporteur, Mr Hughes, has produced for this second reading.
I am going to take this opportunity to highlight the problem of independent workers, because I believe that the good intentions on the health and safety of mobile workers, which the Commission and the Council are boasting of, may have horrendous effects if obstacles continue to be placed in the way of including independent workers in the Directive.
It is a fact, ladies and gentlemen, and not an opinion, that the three basic principles put forward to justify the need for the Directive - the health and safety of workers, road safety and fair competition - are mere words if we exclude independent workers.
It could even be said that the health and safety of the majority of workers in countries such as mine, who are self-employed, are not of the least concern to us if we exclude them from this Directive.
The Council has the opportunity to avoid responsibility for situations such as those which arise in my country, where more than 400 drivers lose their lives every year, without distinguishing between self-employed and salaried workers.
This figure is increasing by 20% per year.
Why are we only going to take account of the risk facing a minority of these drivers?
'Are the self-employed not people?' , as Mrs Smet asked.
Of course they are.
Why forget about the majority?
Do those drivers and citizens who use the roads not face identical risks?
Let us be serious.
If we really want road safety and the health and safety of workers, it makes little difference whether they are self-employed or salaried.
Independent workers are not another race.
In fact, they have more work to do than the salaried workers.
They have to look after their lorries, their businesses, they have to load and unload, adding these tasks to their maximum hours, while salaried workers deduct all of this from their maximum hours.
As if this argument were not enough, ladies and gentlemen, and if we want to consider the question of free competition, of fair competition, please bear in mind that salaried drivers are going to spend fewer hours driving, the lorries they drive are going to make shorter daily trips and they will arrive later at their destinations.
How competitive are those companies going to be in comparison with those companies whose conditions are much tougher and much less economically burdensome?
So our conclusion is that excluding self-employed workers is going to have horrendous effects for these workers and also for the sector.
For all of these reasons, we urge the Council to add to the effort that it has already made and include independent workers, if it truly - and this is not pure rhetoric - wishes to protect the health and safety of all drivers, increase road safety, promote fair competition at Community level and not destroy the sector.
It should do so if it wants to protect jobs and companies and, if it wants, in summary, the directive that we deserve in the 21st Century.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberal group is not very happy with the rapporteur' s proposals.
Firstly, because they contain legislation which is not workable in practice and harms the competitiveness of self-employed drivers.
Secondly, because compliance with the rules cannot be monitored or enforced.
They are therefore unnecessary, and the liberal group is always opposed to such legislation.
Thirdly, there is sufficient national legislation. Even the Common Position is giving this due consideration.
And if there is any legislation required at all, then the majority of my group are satisfied with the common position.
The transport sector consists of a few major businesses, and their employees must be given sound working conditions.
It is in the interest of the internal market that a European framework be created for that purpose.
But the transport sector also consists of many small, self-employed drivers.
They are independent businesses with one or two lorries which service a vital segment of the market.
They must be able to do their work, their businesses must be profitable and their services competitive, and they must not be bogged down by unnecessary red-tape and legislation.
One of our major objections is therefore to the proposal that self-employed drivers will need to comply with this legislation in three years' time.
It would be preferable to see what the proposals bring and only then to consider whether self-employed drivers should adopt this framework or whether separate regulation is required.
As for night work, we agree on the times as described in national legislation, for they offer plenty of flexibility.
However, the period of availability is creating problems for us. Here too, we would like to take a pragmatic approach.
Drivers often face unforeseen hold-ups, as a result of which they need to have more frequent breaks to eat, for example.
There are other reasons for long delays.
If all that were to be included in working time, the driver would very soon reach the maximum limit, as a result of which productivity would decline unnecessarily. That has little to do with health and safety.
Finally, the definition of working time is far too detailed.
Here too, the liberal group has chosen to subscribe to the common position.
You will gather from my speech that there are a few additional aspects which I have not mentioned.
I cannot explain those rules to the voter.
The liberal group will be voting against the relevant amendments and in favour of the common position.
Mr President, Mr Hughes, Commissioner, in my view, this directive on the organisation of the working time of drivers is of strategic importance.
Many overlook the fact that we are dealing with a road-transport sector which is highly fragmented and under pressure from shippers: there are many small businesses and a few large ones.
Those large ones employ staff and the small ones do not.
Against the background of liberalisation and cabotage, we are dealing with an international issue which requires international solutions.
The price competition is cut-throat, not only in the road-transport sector but also between the different modalities.
That was mentioned a moment ago.
This results in, inter alia, the subcontracting of both wheels (lorries) and drivers on a large scale.
This also leads to cowboy pricing, if I can refer to it that way.
One might say - and this is not the first time I am saying this - that the sector is diseased up to a certain point.
This also leads to a social rat race and to the evasion of social duties. It affects working times and working conditions and puts pressure on wages.
The sector is repeatedly up to new tricks.
That would not be the first one.
We have already closed the Willy Betz loophole.
We now have to face the fact that more drivers are becoming self-employed, and the pseudo self-employed in particular have a role to play.
This whole development is detrimental to the sector, the environment (for cheap transport generates more transport), safety and society.
For that reason, we believe that this gap must be closed.
We have already closed the Willy Betz loophole for Eastern European drivers by means of licensing.
In this case, we will close the loopholes not only by involving the pseudo self-employed, but also the self-employed as far as driving times are concerned.
In other words, we very much applaud the fact that everyone, both the employed and self-employed, must remain within those 48 hours.
In addition, I believe the entire definition of pseudo self-employed to be of major strategic importance, and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this very sound approach.
The codecision procedure requires our Parliament to form a united front during the negotiations.
Mr President, my group shares the same opinion as most other groups, i.e. that this is a good report and that it is high time we had working time regulations which also apply to road transport.
This has been a relatively long time coming.
Last time we discussed additional groups - at that time it was a question of doctors and a number of other groups - there was a similar discussion, but drivers were not included.
It is very good that this category is now being covered.
Our group also believes that it is obviously necessary to put employees and drivers on an equal footing.
We are fairly sure that if this is not done, less scrupulous haulage companies will organise themselves in such a way as to be able to exploit technically self-employed drivers who are in fact a kind of employee.
We do not want this sort of cheating in the industry.
Our group has tabled two amendments.
We will support all of Mr Hughes' proposals, but on one point we would like to proceed a little faster.
We believe that the transposition period of three years is unnecessary.
Firstly, the industry has known for a long time that changes would be introduced, so they have had time to adapt.
Secondly, there is a point of view which has been under-emphasised, namely regard for other road-users.
It can be said that the requirement for a transposition period is one way of taking the industry into account, but it certainly gives no regard to other road-users.
Mr Hughes also admitted that the new regulations might lead to considerable problems, even with a transposition period.
We therefore believe that it is as well to bite the bullet and implement the provisions without a transposition period.
This is particularly important with regard to regulations on working time concerning night work and other activities which may represent a danger to road safety.
We support the proposal as it stands, with Amendments 25 and 26 at the end, requiring the transposition period to be removed from the proposal.
Mr President, overall, we feel that the rapporteur's good work deals exhaustively with the issue.
However, we would like to comment on the proposal regarding the definite inclusion of the self-employed.
We feel that it would be appropriate to include the self-employed in the new directive from the start.
The Council's caution on the matter is quite understandable, but we nevertheless feel that instructing the Commission to assess, subsequently and with no time restriction, the consequences of excluding the self-employed today, would serve merely to postpone the realisation that it is necessary to include them.
In fact, it is not just the issue of second drivers which needs to be addressed more exhaustively - it is, moreover, dealt with in Member States' national contract legislation - but above all that of self-employed drivers, including those who have only one vehicle or, in any case, consistently drive one of the vehicles they possess.
There are various different causes which have a bearing on the matter.
Often, when a self-employed driver purchases a vehicle, he is bound to pay for it in somewhat burdensome instalments. In order to meet the payments, he is forced to increase his workload.
Another contributing cause is the just-in-time method which companies, having usually reduced their storage capacities, adopt in order to maintain continuous production, a method, that is, which requires them to produce a continual, regular supply of materials to be worked upon.
Often, the combination of these two causes leads self-employed workers to neglect their health, not to take sufficient rest periods for their safety and, consequently, to create the conditions for potential harm to their or others' safety.
Apart from anything else, definitively regulating the working hours of self-employed drivers as well is certainly a way of consolidating conditions of fair competition over the entire sector on Community territory and, at the same time, increasing the necessary safety measures.
Mr President, Mrs Smet referred to the fact that a majority in the PPE-DE Group were in favour of including the self-employed.
I am sure that is true.
But I am sure she would also agree that there is a significant minority who take a completely opposite view.
This morning I chaired a press conference here on the subject of burdens on business.
I was joined on the platform by colleagues from Austria, Finland and Sweden - Members from other countries would have come if they could have - who much shared the views which I will now share with the House.
Since the publication of the Hughes report, I have been personally bombarded with complaints from the UK Removers' Association, the Confederation of Passenger Transport, the Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association and the International Road Transport Union, as well as small local haulage companies and self-employed lorry drivers.
They are united in their horror at amendments that would put UK operators out of business, and in their amazement that these proposals are coming from a UK MEP.
There is no evidence that self-employed lorry drivers, who rely on their own health and, on the safety of their vehicles for their day-to-day business existence, are in need of more EU legislation to make them more safe.
There is no evidence that Member States, when they agreed the common position, were unmindful of their health and safety responsibilities.
There is no requirement on Parliament to tighten up this legislation now.
The rapporteur's amendments would lead to lower earnings for professional drivers, increase road congestion and pollution and raise transport costs.
Given that UK hauliers are already paying the highest fuel taxes in the world, these proposals would be the last straw for many in the UK road haulage industry.
They also show no understanding of the needs of the industry, or its employees.
These last three sentences are not my words.
They are the words of the UK Road Haulage Association.
UK Conservative MEPs will be rejecting all the Hughes amendments.
We shall not be alone.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regulated working times mean better protection for workers.
There is hardly a sector in which this is more pertinent than the transport sector.
I should like to reiterate the objective of this directive.
Article 1 states that the purpose of the directive is to provide better protection for the safety and health of drivers, improve road safety and bring about more harmonised conditions of competition.
I think that the common position does not do this justice; in fact, it even contains a number of inherent contradictions.
Our rapporteur has made proposals which make a sensible contribution to transport policy and environmental policy over and above this.
I should like to raise three points on which we disagree with the Council. The most important point - as already mentioned - is to include self-employed drivers.
You are wrong, Mr Bushill-Matthews, to say that self-employed drivers and haulage companies are all opposed to Stephen Hughes' proposal.
A whole series of companies has readily recognised that the competition will be ruinous if self-employed drivers are not included. Allow me to reiterate the consequences: if the one-third of the 3.5 million truck drivers who are self-employed are excluded, we shall see thousands of drivers turned into unwilling, bogus self-employed drivers overnight.
I cannot believe that they will agree to this.
The second point on which we disagree is night work: we should remember that most serious accidents on European roads are caused not by technical faults but by overtired drivers, which is why we think that eight hours is long enough at the wheel.
My third point concerns standby duty, i.e. the time during which drivers must be ready to take up work.
We think that flexible working times should be in the interest of both sides, i.e. the employer or haulier and the employee, which is why we feel that a day's notice is a sensible solution.
However, Mrs Smet, this calls for intelligent logistics.
We cannot simply allow the current method, the current practice of shifting stock on to the road at the expense of the truck drivers' standby duty, to continue.
We need a reasonable, new, practical solution and I think that is precisely what Stephen Hughes gives us in his report.
Mr President, I congratulate Stephen Hughes on his report.
I believe that we have to have a level playing field for hauliers across the EU, because they travel across borders all the time.
We are very concerned that some hauliers will be able to undercut their counterparts from other Member States if we do not pass this directive.
Consequently, it is also important that we include self-employed workers.
I know that my colleague said that the ELDR Group was against including self-employed workers, but in actual fact we were rather split on this and a sizeable minority of us actually believe that self-employed workers should be included.
I believe that they should be included for several reasons, but the main one is again that they can undercut the other hauliers, and this will have tremendous health and safety implications.
I am also afraid that some of the more unscrupulous employers will make those hauliers self-employed just to get round this legislation.
That will lead to not only more deaths on the road, but to health problems for the hauliers themselves.
I would like to also draw attention to the need that Stephen Hughes talked about of giving drivers an appropriate length of time before they take out a load.
I know that Mr Hughes was talking about a 24 hour period.
I put forward the compromise amendment of 12 hours' notice before the load was taken out and am very pleased that he has agreed to that amendment.
It is only right that hauliers should be allowed some time to sleep, particularly before going on long journeys.
I sincerely hope we are going to vote for this directive and include self-employed workers.
It is a step in the right direction towards providing health and safety not only for the hauliers, but for other road users as well.
Mr President, the aims of this report on improving road safety and guaranteeing minimum standards of health and safety for all road transport drivers are obviously worthwhile, but these goals need to be related to reality, for example their impact in peripheral and remote areas such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
I have received many letters expressing a degree of alarm about the possible consequences of this proposal.
For example, a haulage company in Arran, not the most remote of Scotland's islands, pointed out that many hours are spent on ferries to and from the mainland.
This is an issue which may adversely affect tourist travel to, as well as from, areas like Scotland.
A coach operator in Glasgow is of the view that if the Hughes proposals are fully implemented, mainland European coach operators may regard Scotland as a destination too far.
In the case of Scotland's Western and Northern Isles, two or three ferry crossings may be required before reaching Scotland's mainland, often landing in areas very remote from the ultimate destination.
The report's conclusion also refers to achieving a level playing field with other transport sectors already covered.
The reality, though, in much of rural and island Scotland is that no alternative to road transport exists.
Indeed, a former Shetland Islands MEP was fond of pointing out that the nearest mainline railway station to Shetland is in fact Bergen.
Scotland's road transport sector is already being penalised financially by the UK government through punitive taxation on fuel.
Some aspects of this working time proposal potentially threaten the already fragile viability of road transport.
Therefore I cannot fully support the more restrictive proposals in this report.
Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking Stephen Hughes for the work he has done on this report.
It has been a very difficult task and, excuse the pun, a difficult road for him to travel down.
The overall aim of the report is to raise awareness with regard to health and safety and to prevent unfair competition.
In his report, Stephen has mentioned his concerns with regard to the common position; I share some of those concerns.
There are areas that are open to improvement.
However, I also expressed concerns with regard to some of the amendments adopted by the committee and to some of the stances taken within the committee.
As already mentioned by some of my colleagues and, in particular, my Scottish colleague, peripheral areas of Europe would be more adversely affected than others by these restrictions.
For instance, in Ireland 98% of what is manufactured is transported by road.
We have a fast growing economy.
It depends on a flexible and innovative transport industry.
The principle was clearly established in 1993 that directives are to avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal restrictions which would affect these kind of undertakings.
We must try to reduce the number of vehicles on our roads, but there is no guarantee that this directive would do that.
In fact, according to information available from studies carried out by the Irish road hauliers' association it would increase the number of vehicles on the road and would neither reduce congestion nor lessen environmental damage.
The working time directive as proposed by the Council could result in higher costs for companies.
Some of the amendments put forward by the rapporteur, such as Amendment No 6, are too prescriptive, while others such as Amendment No 14, are too restrictive.
Amendment No 17 would impose additional obligations on Member States and would be difficult to implement.
In Amendment No 19 there is a call for harmonisation of penalties.
This is not something we should agree with.
This matter should be left to the Member States because otherwise, as has already been seen, there would be differences in implementation of the penalties.
Finally, under Recital 14 certain conditions with regard to the average working week are not being implemented.
What we are seeking is decreased administrative burdens, a more balanced proposal and fairness for all.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work and efforts made in achieving a recommendation for second reading which is balanced and flexible and which may lead to the success of a conciliation which will probably not be easy.
Neither is it easy to achieve the general objective of organising working time for people who carry out professional mobile road transport activities, because it is necessary to take account of the health and safety of drivers, as well as road safety and, therefore, collective safety.
And because another objective must be to prevent unfair competition.
I believe that the Directive must include self-employed workers.
Article 31 of the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights says, 'Every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity' .
And self-employed are workers in every sense of the definition.
And the second paragraph of this Article says, 'Every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave' .
I believe that the text, in the terms in which it provides for inclusion, is intended to achieve both the elimination of unfair competition and the granting of a prudent time limit for the self-employed to adapt to the new situation and to ensure their protection.
At the same time, the prudence of the time limit is not going to encourage companies to dismantle themselves and resort to pseudo self-employment.
In summary, I believe that the recommendation must guide us and contribute to creating a more just and transparent society, where it is difficult for unfair competition to take place, and where due attention is paid to the health, safety and dignity of workers whether they be self-employed or salaried.
Mr President, I welcome the Hughes report and the reasonable balance that he has achieved.
It is a tribute to his political skill.
Apart from alcohol, I think fatigue is probably the biggest killer on our roads and it is also true to say that if I were employed as a truck driver, I would not want my job undermined by a self-employed driver who would be willing to work 18 hours a day.
Nor, if I was a self-employed driver and wanted to strike a fair balance between my working life and my family life, would I want someone undermining my position by being able to work 18 hours a day.
It is pointless to argue that a self-employed driver might be less fatigued than an employed driver.
From my own personal experience, the reverse is in fact true.
A self-employed driver has many more tasks to carry out and is more likely to be fatigued when first taking the wheel, never mind having worked 10 or 12 hours in the day, so I would strongly support this report and welcome the compromises that Stephen Hughes has reached.
It is also important to tighten up the definition of "self-employed".
We have seen too much abuse of this loose definition of "self-employed" in other areas of work.
Our responsibility is to find a balance between the needs of employed and self-employed drivers and the community at large, so as to ensure that the latter can go about its business safely.
They look to us to provide and guarantee safety and to ensure that employed and self-employed drivers are protected by the law from being driven into bad health and, perhaps, an early death from overwork.
Mr President, the organisation of the working hours of road transport workers affects the working conditions of these workers and also the efficiency of logistics.
The area of application of the directive is the most essential question in this whole matter.
The compromise achieved in the Council leaves self-employed hauliers outside the scope of the directive.
In my opinion Parliament should also approve this compromise.
Self-employed hauliers must not be subjected to artificial regulations limiting their total working hours. This would lead to an increase in bureaucracy and make it more difficult for small businesses to operate.
It would also interfere with self-employed people' s use of their free time in a way which would be impossible to monitor.
The issue has no bearing on road safety because the driving time of independent self-employed hauliers is already regulated under other rules.
Secondly, I would like to mention the further limitation of working hours in terms of night work.
This would increase traffic jams, weaken road safety and increase costs.
Mr President, the central issue of this legislative proposal is the inclusion of self-employed workers.
The rapporteur proposes a transitional period of three years for the automatic inclusion of self-employed workers in the scope of this directive, which is a sensible and balanced approach and which warrants our support.
The common position adopted by the Council, which excludes self-employed drivers and does not even guarantee that they will be covered by the organisation of working time that it is claiming to be instituting, would have the following consequences: it would put the objectives of the common transport policy at risk, it would not promote road safety and greater equality in conditions of competition and would deny adequate protection for the health and safety of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities.
This proposal therefore represents an acceptable balance between the economic aspects, road safety and workers' health.
The truth is that, if adopted, it will contribute not only to reducing the level of road accidents associated with excessive working hours, but also to establishing more healthy competition between self-employed drivers and employed drivers, which will enable us to combat the phenomenon of the pseudo self-employed, which discredits the rules of fair competition in this sector.
With regard to the maximum working time at night, especially bearing in mind the situation of peripheral Member States such as Portugal, the solution adopted by the Council is more appropriate, which stipulates ten hours in every twenty-four hours.
Drivers in these Member States are forced to make longer journeys to reach the major centres of production and consumption.
The only way in which we can reduce driving time is by making use of the night, when the traffic is less intense.
Reducing the driving time to eight hours would, therefore, unjustifiably increase the competitive disadvantage that drivers from these countries face in relation to hauliers from the more centrally located Member States.
Mr President, I should firstly like to thank Mr Hughes for carrying out this difficult task and for the way in which he has done that.
I believe that his amendments are largely based on, and are in line with, the Commission proposals, except for the two which Mrs Smet mentioned a moment ago.
But I should also like to thank the Commissioner in particular for the courage she has shown in bringing this common position about, for that was a very complicated task.
Many governments were opposed to it, and the fact that we are here at all is thanks to her tenacity.
In that respect, she has achieved more than her predecessor.
I hope we will bear this in mind when we deal with other matters too.
I should also like to thank Mrs Sanders-ten Holte. She has given a truly brilliant, nineteenth-century, liberal account, which would not look out of place as an annexe to Dickens' Christmas Carol.
I believe that his novel was also about whether one should work on Christmas Day.
This is now given fresh relevance.
I believe it is important that a common position has been reached.
It is also vital for us to negotiate on a few points in the common position which are inadequate, particularly the issue of the self-employed.
In my view, we have not found the ultimate solution, but we are at least opening up the path for negotiations.
Those who claim that we should adopt the common position without question are disempowering this Parliament.
Surely they can understand that.
Those who claim that current legislation is good enough, should read up on the accidents, especially accidents involving buses.
Anyone opposed to those amendments should, next time there is a major accident involving a bus, be very aware of the damage they cause with such opinions to the effect that absolutely nothing should be done on this score.
It is not acceptable that this rather dangerous sector should be the only sector to be excluded from the Working Times Directive.
That is the reason for my group to at least support sound amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to start by quoting the early German Romantic Novalis.
As perhaps the first visionary of our present concept of a liberal and peaceful Europe, he coined the following expression about 200 years ago in his widely acclaimed treatise "Christendom or Europe": "Everything is good, but not necessarily all the time, not necessarily everywhere and not necessarily for all of the people."
He was quite right.
This insight is something we come up against almost every day in the European decision-making process.
Extended to self-employed drivers, the directive regulating the working time of persons occupied in mobile road-transport activities under discussion today is a perfectly typical example.
From the point of view of small and medium-sized enterprises, and especially self-employed drivers, this directive, with its limit values on average, accurately-defined maximum working times, minimum breaks and rest periods and its provisions on night work, is an example of politics exerting an inadmissible and unnecessary influence on working times for which these drivers alone are responsible.
From their point of view, it is even a compelling, authoritarian obstacle which stands in contradiction to the principles of a market economy and should therefore be rejected.
However, social and competition policy and road safety experts take a different view.
When it comes to more and more frequent shock headlines such as: "Tired truck driver ploughs into carefully parked broken down car" and the need to avoid bogus self-employment and the unfair competition which it engenders, this directive is long overdue.
Improved health protection and safety in the workplace for employees in the road haulage industry also deserves a mention.
For me, as an ardent supporter of a social market economy, my motto is: people first, the economy second.
So I would recommend that we tighten up the common position in the interests of everyone, including those of us who use the roads as pedestrians.
Mr President, today is a great day for road haulage contractors.
As all the speakers have said, this is a step towards making their job less stressful and more humane, and this is thanks to Mr Hughes.
However, why is it that we do not use the Hughes procedure for the Hughes report?
That said, let us get to the point.
Hudson Bay, 40 years ago, it is cold and foggy.
The Andrea Doria is approaching New York.
Sadly, the helmsman and the officer of the watch, maybe a little sleepy because they have been working too long at a stretch, cause the Andrea Doria to sink, tragically.
It may be that, if they had had shorter working hours, this would not have happened.
We do not want our lorries and motor vehicles to go the same way as the Andrea Doria.
We have remembered a great Italian, Andrea Doria, a Genoan, born in Genoa like me. Let us now remember another great Italian, Galileo Galilei.
Why?
Because we are going to put the satellite system Galileo into orbit, and it will have to be able to track, monitor and observe the time European road haulage contractors spend on the road.
Thank you very much, Mr Fatuzzo, for sharing this significant observation with us, and if you mention Galileo Galilei and such like, could I make you aware of the transport problems which the Flying Dutchman faced?
You have no right to reply.
I now give the floor to the Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio.
Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hughes, and all the members of Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as well as the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for the work they have done.
As you know, this directive has a special significance for me.
In fact, at the end of 1998 the Commission presented its first proposal aimed at introducing common rules applicable to all professional drivers and, since then, this Directive has followed a complicated and tortuous path and has been in deadlock within the Council throughout that time.
In 2000, a modification of the general directive on the organisation of certain aspects of working time was adopted, Directive 93/104/EC, in order to incorporate mobile and non-mobile workers in the transport sector.
However, it should be pointed out that despite this modification mobile workers are only covered in a series of areas, in particular the average weekly 48 working hours, annual holidays, health controls of nocturnal workers and the guarantee of sufficient rest time.
For this reason, to maintain and defend the proposed directive under discussion still makes total sense.
Having realised how difficult it was for work to progress in the Council and out of concern to take a step forward, although it was not the ideal step, at the end of 2000 I presented an amended proposal for a directive which, as you know, provided for the automatic inclusion in the long term, specifically after 3 years, of self-employed drivers.
I fully agree with what has been said here, since the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport is concerned with regulating the activity time of drivers outside driving time, for safety reasons.
A driver' s degree of tiredness does not depend on whether he is self-employed or on a salary.
Please have no doubt that that is my position.
Therefore, knowing the difficulties, I proposed a text to the Council and Parliament in which that aspect was modified, with a three-year transition period for the incorporation of self-employed drivers, but with that incorporation taking place automatically.
There is no need to remind you of the long discussions in Council, which ended with a common position on a compromise accepted by all the States, all the delegations present, and which, of course, I myself accept on behalf of the Commission.
In this respect, I would like to say that I believe that, while not perfect, it is a step forward.
It should be pointed out that, in the arguments of the delegation of the different countries of the European Union, of the ministers, there is one factor which is true and that it is the considerable difficulty of genuinely controlling self-employed drivers.
And, although self-employed drivers are excluded, it is a step forward.
It is a compromise which I have accepted, although I do not like it, and I would like to make this very clear.
Ladies and gentlemen, you must understand that I am always faithful to my commitments and I will therefore honour this one. I will not be able to support a series of amendments that you are proposing, although I would like to because I fully agree with them, but I have a commitment to the Council.
This does not mean that, when the conciliation takes place, as I believe it will - because I doubt that the Council will reach a compromise leading to the automatic inclusion of self-employed workers, as I think it should - I will not use all my resources to try to find a solution to unblock the situation which is no doubt going to come about now.
I will refer to a series of amendments, which will be listed specifically tomorrow, which I cannot accept at the moment, although I agree with their content.
I can accept Amendments Nos 7, 11, 14 and 16, which include ideas which appeared in the modified proposed Directive and do not exactly form part of the compromise agreed in the Council and which I believe improve the overall content of the Directive.
