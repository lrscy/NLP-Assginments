Nevertheless my personal opinion is that we should give a clear signal in Bonn that we are ready to set 2020 targets, but that more work is needed on what those targets should be.
Such a signal is critical if the EU wants to maintain its leadership role within the coalition for renewable energy and in the field of global sustainable development in general.
The targets set for 2020 are also necessary to give certainty to the fledgling renewable energy industry within the EU and, in particular, to the financial sector.
This will help achieve current and future targets.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the International Conference on Renewable Energy and this resolution, which we will vote on next, respond to a need and a general concern to increase energy sources which are clean and sustainable over time.
The European Union has made considerable progress, but much remains to be done.
Three years ago, this Parliament approved the Directive on the promotion of renewable electricity sources and, since then, there has been a spectacular increase in the use of such electricity sources.
The European Union brings together the majority of the worldâs installed capacity.
In 2001, there was 17Â 000 megawatts of wind power installed. Today this figure has doubled.
This is just one example of a long list of successes which allow us to export innovative technologies respectful of the environment to other countries.
From now on, we will need to achieve greater efficiency which contributes to better management of energy resources.
In this regard, I believe that the directives on energy efficiency in buildings and cogeneration will play an important role, as well as the new intelligent energy plan for Europe.
I would like the 20% referred to in the motion for a resolution to be achieved, but the method that can contribute most to achieving it is unquestionably improving energy efficiency.
The consumption of fuel for transport generates emissions of polluting gases, the immediate effects of which are suffered in the large urban centres.
Therefore, the directive for the promotion of biofuels, approved last year, is another of Commissioner de Palacioâs commitments to renewable energies with a view to reducing emissions into the atmosphere.
We are already seeing some cities incorporating transport systems using biodiesel, bioethanol and hydrogen.
In some cases they are experimental projects, but in others this technology is a reality within our transport systems.
These fuels can also be used in mixtures with other conventional fuels in normal cars and, as if this were not enough, hybrid vehicles which operate conventionally and electrically and are the most fuel-efficient are already being marketed.
The next step must be technology for the large-scale use of hydrogen.
The Commission has already opened a wide debate on this energy vector which will allow us to use forms of transport without emissions.
The current legislature is coming to an end, but I am sure that hydrogen will be one of the great subjects of debate in the coming months and all these initiatives can contribute to achieving the most ambitious objectives for renewable energies and, ultimately, for the environment.
At a time when OPEC has just approved a reduction in oil production, I would like to end today by calling on the Member States to demonstrate sufficient will to promote these renewable technologies which do not pollute and which come from sources which nature provides us with in abundance, since this will benefit everybody.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the International Conference for Renewable Energies is to be held in Bonn at the beginning of June.
The German Federal Chancellor had announced this conference at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.
I regard this conference as a truly important result of this summit, as you yourself, Commissioner, have just said.
I do think that it was particularly those who had been in Johannesburg who were extremely disappointed by what came out of it with regard to renewable energies.
Even if, as you just said, we can now welcome the Johannesburg coalitionâs first successes, it had not been possible to achieve the goals we had set ourselves there at the time, even though the European Union really did make very serious and very concerted efforts.
As I see it, this makes it extraordinarily important that this conference in Bonn should be a success.
You referred, Commissioner, to the European preparatory conference in Berlin, which was held in January, attended by over 650 participants from 45 countries, and made its expectations very clear â not only as regards what it expected of the Bonn conference, but also of the European Union and its policies.
I think the way in which the European Union has conceived its strategy for the development of renewable energies has been positively exemplary, envisaging the doubling of the share of energy production from renewable sources to 12% â in the case of the electricity sector to 22.1% â by 2010.
You mentioned our market penetration campaign and our legislation to promote electricity and biofuels.
It is important to note that we are currently engaged in using the eco-design directive and energy services to build up efficiency, but what is now vital is that we press on with this strategy and step it up.
I do not actually need to remind you what this is about â the climate change problem, finite resources, the need to reduce our dependence on imports, the creation of jobs in this area.
I think it is, in the first place, important that we should look beyond 2010 and â although this is where I disagree with you, Commissioner â to set ourselves a new objective.
The fact is that the Berlin conference did not merely call for a study; it also made it quite plain in its concluding resolutions that 20% was a desirable target for 2020, and you can see that our compromise resolution expects no less than that, namely that the Commission and the Council should have that as their goal and that policies should be framed with it in mind.
What will in future be important in terms of a more intensive approach will be the devising of new measures to this end.
Although you have expressed doubts about this, we can see that it is, under certain circumstances, possible to achieve the 22.1% we have set ourselves in the electricity sector; we learn this in particular from the countries with a system of central dispatch.
It is impossible, or almost impossible, to achieve this in heating and refrigeration, so this is where it will be important to add to EU lawmaking if the overall target of doubling is to be achieved, but also to integrate renewable energies in many of the European Unionâs other policy areas, such as structural policy, regional policy, perhaps in the Mediterranean and certainly in development cooperation.
We know that three billion people around the world are obliged to live without access to electricity, and it is quite crucial in terms of the poverty reduction that we should back something that offers real opportunities of doing this, that being decentralised systems using renewable energies.
It is for that reason that our resolution makes it very clear that it is necessary to provide for the appropriate measures, and that means that institutions providing funding â such as, among others, the European Investment Bank â must give priority to renewable energies and to energy efficiency.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having only two minutes available to me, I would like to start by saying that I wholeheartedly endorse the arguments that MrsÂ Rothe has put forward over the last five minutes.
I will, however, make some observations by way of adding nuances.
The need to protect the climate and the environment means that renewable energies, which will reduce our dependence on oil and gas, are the form of energy for the twenty-first century; without them, though, even with the development strategy, billions of the worldâs people will have no future.
It is of course a good thing that they will also enable us to create jobs in Europe.
I have heard this week that Mr Kerry, the Democrat candidate for the American presidency, has announced that the USA, too, intends to derive 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, and this represents a gigantic boom for European industry, as we are the leaders in renewable energy technology, and this will benefit European industry too.
If the EU is to create security for investment in the energy sector and in others, then it needs long-term climate protection goals, with renewable sources producing at least 60% of energy by 2050 and at least 20% by 2020.
Today, we have less of a problem with renewable energies themselves â in which we are ahead of the field â than with a strategy for efficiency, in which we lag behind China.
Yesterday, in the Council, the possibility of coming to an early agreement on the Eco-Design Directive evaporated, as we are no longer able to make âwin-winâ directives of that sort palatable to the Council, or perhaps also because there is too much lobbying on the part of industry.
The resolution, which is supported by all the political groups, also makes it plain that the European Investment Bank must play a higher-profile role.
As things stand today, not even 10% of its loans are made to support renewable energies; as they are the energies of the future, that is another area in which political pressure needs to be exerted.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it looks very much as if the Kyoto Protocol will not necessarily enter into force.
Nevertheless, under international law the Kyoto Protocol will be binding on its signatories for several years.
During this time it cannot be altered, meaning the Kyoto process will remain much too static.
Climate change, however, is a real threat, and for that reason the action taken to resist it should be seen as tough and dynamic.
One way is to analyse the EUâs former policies, which in most sectors have already successfully made economic growth independent of any increase in emissions.
This has come about when the actions have decentralised, forming a variety of effective policies that create a dynamic, and even positive side effects for the environment and society.
These should now be strengthened and applied to other sectors.
Above all, this should now be applied globally.
The Bonn conference will be the first step.
The United Nations environment programmes should be granted the authority they need and resistance to climate change should be split up into areas of action to promote energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy and clean technology.
This would also create the dynamic needed for change to take place.
Such an approach would also give the United States of America and Russia a new opportunity to be involved and participate in action to reduce greenhouse gases.
Within the framework of the UN clear global structures should be created for the carbon economy and a price for carbon dioxide established, while at the same time there is vigorous promotion of market-based incentives to cut emissions.
Similarly, the incredible rate at which emissions are increasing in China and India must be cut within the framework of the UN.
Keeping to the Kyoto targets is vital, but it should be possible to quickly acknowledge the adverse effects of the Kyoto process and control them. Otherwise the agreement will go against the aims of sustainable development.
The EU has shown great courage as a pioneer, but one also has to have courage to admit oneâs mistakes, if any have been made.
With Kyoto it would seem that the biggest mistake concerns carbon leakage, which threatens to come into existence, when production switches to countries unaffected by the Kyoto targets.
âThe polluter paysâ principle is thus changing to the âthe polluter is paidâ practice.
Furthermore, with renewable energy sources there is a danger of slogans going to our heads and of us not being very realistic.
The investment in research into the promotion of renewables is already excessive, and Parliament is again prepared to increase its minimum share.
Most renewables still come from large hydroelectric power stations, and people are not ready to add more.
You cannot push on a cord; you have to pull it, as the Finnish saying goes.
Investment in research will not help any more, but global demand would.
That is why we must do our best at Bonn to draw peopleâs attention to the issue of global demand.
Â Â  â Mr President, you may well be surprised to hear me say that, in 25 yearsâ time, we will be able to derive every bit as much energy from a cubic centimetre of silicon as from a cubic centimetre of uranium, but that is the case â it surprised me, too â and it highlights the enormous potential latent in renewable energies.
My second comment has to do with the Bonn conference; I would like to suggest that we in this House should also send a delegation to represent us at it, as a whole array of legislatures from around the world will be doing.
It would be a disgrace for the European Parliament not to have a visible presence there in the shape of a group of MEPs with an official mandate.
Thirdly, let me say that, in the resolution â to which MrsÂ Rothe very rightly referred â the term âpoverty reductionâ occurs twice.
I see it as extremely important that we should make the connection between climate policy, energy policy and poverty reduction.
For example, the instrument for doing this â or at least one of those that are suitable â is decentralised energy supply systems using renewable energies and another instrument that we are at present discussing in this House, that is, emissions trading, what is termed the Linking Directive.
We can be grateful to the Commission for having, some time ago, brought out a very interesting brochure in which it set out the means that could be employed in this way to benefit the renewable energy sector in the Mediterranean region alone.
The figures quoted in it are extraordinarily high.
I think this is an instrument of which we could make much more use.
After all, we have to finance renewable energies, and we all know that they do not come cheap.
My final observation must be that what rather worries me about renewable energies is that they are currently going through an upward phase.
They are on everyoneâs lips, renewable energies get good write-ups in the press, and rightly so too.
Who knows, though, what will happen in a couple of yearsâ time, when the costs go up?
Will they be just as acceptable, or will we perhaps come to the conclusion that you can have too much of a good thing, and decide cut back a bit?
To do so would be extraordinarily dangerous, for it would inhibit continuity in a sector that forms part of our industrial policy.
What this boils down to is that we need continuity, and the small- and medium-sized enterprises that have invested in renewable energy sources need security.
Yes, costs are falling, but they are, nonetheless, relatively high.
I am perfectly familiar with the debates in my own country about the costs of renewable energies.
In Germany alone, it is estimated that they will cost us between EURÂ 4 billion and EURÂ 5 billion in a couple of yearsâ time.
It may well indeed be that many will see this as a pain barrier through which they do not want to go.
I just want to warn that continuity should be maintained rather than broken if those who invest in them today are to have security.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was present at the meeting in Johannesburg.
I both experienced and shared the disappointment that the EU delegation, above all, felt about the fact that we did not get further with the establishing a global objective for renewable energy.
We turned the meeting to as best account as we could achieve at the time.
I myself have taken a very active interest in bringing together those who wish to work with clear goals and dates in the matter of how to achieve a greater proportion of renewable energy.
The impending meeting in Bonn will, of course, be of great significance.
Above all, we will be able to share experience and knowledge there on how we can best support the development of renewable energy by political means.
During todayâs debate we have heard some of the best arguments for why this is necessary, including the argument regarding climate change.
MrÂ Turmes listed all our convincing arguments in favour of the need to invest in renewable energy.
We have discussed some of the most important tools.
I am the first to admit that, by explaining in Bonn that we are prepared to think slightly more long term, that is to say up to 2020, and that we wish to set such a goal, we should be sending out an important signal.
In the enlarged European Union, we will, however, need a little more time to discuss in more detail how this goal should be established and at what level it should be set.
I wish to state that there is a misunderstanding among some of the Members regarding the current situation relating to the Kyoto Protocol.
The situation is not as a number of people think, that is that we have a complete stalemate.
All the countries that have now ratified the Kyoto Protocol are in fact doing very important and practical work to implement the Protocol.
This is because most of these countries, particularly the poor ones, are already affected by climate change.
They realise that the effects of climate change will only get worse if they do not deal with the problem now.
Important work has therefore already been got under way.
We are not alone in taking action.
All over the world, people have begun to realise that the threat of climate change is so great that we need to take action right away.
The assertion that renewable energy could become more expensive is wrong.
On the contrary, it will become cheaper.
Think of the development regarding fossil fuels.
We have seen just recently how expensive oil has become.
It will become more profitable to invest in renewable energy.
This is especially true if we also take the fossil fuel subsidies out of the equation.
We should also be completely clear about the fact that the market for renewable energy already represents great economic value.
It is European companies that are today responsible for 90% of the world market in equipment.
We are very competitive, a fact that has created thousands of jobs in Europe.
This development will continue.
Wind energy alone has increased from 5GW (gigawatts) in 1997 to 27GW in 2003.
Huge development is taking place in this sector.
It is not at all the case that this area is standing still, or that not enough is happening.
An enormous amount is happening, and the potential is fantastic.
We must make use of these facts as arguments during our meeting in Bonn.
We must make sure that, in the future too, we are world leaders in the area of renewable energy.
This is something from which we shall all gain.
Â Â  Mr Posselt has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  â Mr President, I will be very brief, but this is important.
Firstly, I wish to protest against the dropping of todayâs debates on matters of topical and urgent importance, Tuesdayâs question times and the debate on the cultural capital of Europe, even though enough time was available for them.
Secondly, I wish to make a personal statement on behalf of what has been called the Friday Club.
I am grateful to the Members who are present for doing their duty right into the evening.
They used to do it right through to Friday lunchtime, until that was no longer possible.
It is monstrous that there should be someone in this House who is attempting to make criminals of these Members, of all people, who are performing their duties in an exemplary manner.
I will be working here this evening on behalf of those whom I represent, and will be doing so until tomorrow lunchtime.
That I affirm; I believe it to be our duty.
I rejoice to see all those here who are doing their duty rather than going about defaming and discrediting this House.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Posselt.
We take very good note of your commitment to parliamentary work and to the electors.
To end this debate, I have received 5 motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The vote will take place in a few minutes time.(2)
Â Â  â Mr President, if you had had to be driven around this week by the so-called car service, I am sure you too would be boiling over with rage.
What goes on in the depths of this House, particularly in the evenings, is a scandal.
A group of us had to wait, in gusts of wind, up to 40 minutes for a car from the so-called car service.
I am not blaming the drivers, who do a quite outstanding job of work, but responsibility for this must surely rest with some official or other, some manager in the administration, who took 17 cars out of service for this week.
For how much longer are we MEPs supposed to put up with this intolerable humiliation by officials of this House?
I ask you to ensure that the service is organised on more MEP-friendly lines without delay.
If you want an example of a good car service, then let me, as a German Member, advise you to look to Berlin, where the car service really is worthy of the name and provides a service for the Membersâ benefit.
Â Â  Mr Knolle, we take good note of what you say.
We will look towards Berlin and, above all, towards this Parliament.
I can assure you that the Bureau has taken note of these problems and we have no doubt that they will be resolved appropriately.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the vote on:
(1)
Â Â  Parliament has come to the end of its agenda.(1)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 1 April 2004.
Â Â  It is my sad duty today to mark the cowardly murder at the hands of terrorists in Iraq of the Italian citizen, Mr Fabrizio Quattrocchi.
I want to say, on behalf of the European Parliament, that we unreservedly condemn this despicable crime and we express our feelings of deepest sympathy and condolence to the family of the victim and to the Italian people and government.
We appeal from this House to the kidnappers â in so many places now in Iraq â immediately to free all hostages still in captivity.
This is not serving the ends of handing Iraq back to the Iraqi people in terms sustainable for any of the parties involved.
I ask you please to observe a minute's silence.
Â Â  â Mr President unspecified allegations of misconduct made about me and about some of my colleagues are appearing in the German press.
This is something we have already discussed in this House.
Unfortunately, it is not my work to which these reports refer; instead, there are only allegations to the effect that there is something objectionable about my behaviour, but as I am unable to ascertain what I am being accused of, I ask you, Mr President, to investigate further.
It is also stated in the German media that you are to meet a certain Member this week and that the Member in question will then hand over certain lists to you.
If this is the case, Mr President, I ask you to find out at once whether there is anything of which my colleagues or I might be accused.
If there is, then I ask that you forward all the documents, at once, to the European Court of Justice or to the Court of Auditors and to OLAF.
It would of course be good of you to inform those against whom the media are making what are really very nasty, dirty and unpleasant accusations, of what precisely they are being accused â that is, of whether they have been bad at their jobs or have broken the law.
Â Â  Mrs Roth-Behrendt, I find it extremely unfortunate that you should have to defend yourself, as someone with very good standing in this House, precisely with regard to what you are elected to do and the leadership you give in your committee and in so many different aspects of the work of this House.
As you will know from my statement at the last part-session, I have invited a Member of this House, who has been prominent in the German-speaking print and broadcast media, to forward to me whatever specific allegations there are so that I can fulfil my duty of care to this institution and to its Members and their reputation.
I have as yet received nothing in writing.
I have had no telephone call, no e-mail, and although I too am informed via the press of various intentions, no one has had the courtesy to inform me personally of what those are.
You speak of meetings that are not in fact on my work schedule because no one has requested such meetings.
I regret to say that, in these circumstances, it becomes impossible for the House, and for me in respect of my duty of care both to the House and to its Members, to act in any reasonable or fair way when, as far as I can understand, all we have are significant yet unsubstantiated general allegations concerning the Rules of Procedure, as distinct from allegations concerning persons whose responsibility it is to follow those Rules.
I would appeal, as I did last month, to those who have evidence of any wrongdoings to provide me with evidence, to release me to do my duty before this House, its Members and the European public.
Please stop boxing in the shadows: come out into the open and let me deal transparently with substantive and transparent allegations.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am very grateful to you for what you have just said.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt spoke on the substance of the allegations of misuse of funds by Members of this House, and then you made your own contribution.
I just want to remind the House of how these accusations came to be made over the past three years; the Member to whom reference has been made used a concealed camera to spy on Members as they went about their work.
In so doing, he violated all the rules of honesty, trust and collegiality.
I cannot see the European Parliament meekly accepting this sort of thing without a word of criticism.
It is not individuals who suffer, but the House as a whole, when this sort of espionage is used to investigate the work we do.
I would ask you to condemn this unequivocally in the interests of all Members of this House.
Â Â  The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 15 April 2004 has been distributed.
Are there any comments?(1)
Â Â  MrÂ President, I refer to the Boogerd-Quaak report for which, moreover, the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has been convened today for 7 p.m.
Before Easter, MrÂ President, I wrote to you to submit a series of points that, from a procedural and regulatory point of view, do not seem to me to be in line with our Rules of Procedure.
I cited your responsibility as President, pursuant to RuleÂ 19(2) on checking the conformity of reports with our Rules of Procedure.
Specifically â and here I am also speaking on behalf of MrÂ Gemelli, who could not be here today but who I know wrote to you last week â the Committee on Petitions was not even consulted, that is to say it was not asked for an opinion on the report.
We are clear about the lack of a legal basis and yet we have a genuinely unique situation whereby significant reference is being made, in this report, to a study document drawn up by a third party not authorised according to the standard procedures for our Parliament.
It is a document which, moreover, claims to be entirely provisional since the situation has only been examined in eight out of 25 countries and since the comparisons that are due to be carried out at the end of June have not been completed.
This is why, MrÂ President, I wonder how this report can be debated in this sitting and I ask you, therefore, to refer it back to the competent committee in order that the Committee on Petitions can make its substantial contribution.
I would like to mention that this is not a responsibility of the House.
Checking the appropriateness according to the Rules of Procedure is the responsibility of the person presiding over the institution, and is not in any way subject to a majority vote.
You understand that at the basis of democracy, and even more so for a Parliament that is the ultimate embodiment of democracy, it is inconceivable that obligations provided for by the Rules of Procedure should be avoided by using majority voting.
Â Â  Thank you for your comments, MrÂ PodestÃ .
You will be aware from our meeting of the Conference of Presidents last week â which you attended â that I have asked the services to undertake to review your very detailed correspondence with me regarding the Rules of Procedure and their application.
Since my arrival here today â a journey which always takes some time, in spite of early departure â I have not had the opportunity to see a note on this matter that has been prepared for the meeting of the relevant committee this evening.
I am not in a position at this moment to give a ruling on admissibility.
However, the initial advice I have received â before the services have had an opportunity to study your lengthy letter to me in depth â seems to suggest that the report may be admissible, although there are elements that need to be looked at carefully.
We have asked the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to meet this evening to consider the issues raised by the Rules-related observations you have made, and to consider around 350 amendments.
I want to make it perfectly clear that under the Rules we do not have time this week to take a report with that number of amendments.
That is why I for one want the committee to meet and consider the issue.
If I have understood correctly, you have asked for a referral back to committee and therefore a removal of this item from the agenda.
If that is indeed your request then I will take one speaker for and one against and we would then have a vote.
However, Mr PodestÃ , if you are prepared to wait for the committee to meet this evening to consider the question as it relates to the Rules and admissibility, and to consider the question of the number of amendments, then we could proceed to invite our colleagues on the committee to discuss those issues later today.
Mr PodestÃ , do you now wish to make a request to refer back, or are you satisfied that this should be dealt with today in committee?
Â Â  I agree with you, MrÂ President.
I believe that it is appropriate for the committee to consider the issue, but above all â and I am also saying this on behalf of my colleague MrÂ Gemelli â for replies to be given based on your assessment, MrÂ President, on the strength of the details that the services will provide you with.
Â Â  I shall do that in writing once I have received definitive advice.
I must compliment you on your thorough understanding of our Rules of Procedure: it is so much more thorough than my own knowledge and thus I am badly in need of advice on this matter!
Â Â  MrÂ President, given that you will have to carry out this important check, my request is that this is done with the utmost respect for the wishes of the competent committee; indeed we have already had huge problems concerning the tabling office, not least over a report â by my colleague MrÂ Voggenhuber â which is to be debated soon.
On the issue of discretion and of the admissibility of subjects, I therefore genuinely appeal to you to carefully consider the political will expressed by the committee responsible, after a complicated debate.
I would also like to say that, as far as the number of amendments is concerned, the great majority of these come from one political group: I therefore wonder whether this political group is resorting to stonewalling, something that we will deal with today.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have to say that I was, as rapporteur, extremely surprised at the 350 amendments in the plenary meeting, whereas we in the committee had an excellent discussion with far fewer amendments than there are now.
Nevertheless, I have read the amendments and this evening, we in the relevant committee will see what we can do with them all and make sure that an opinion is brought before Parliament.
I am, however, extremely taken aback by the fact that we in the plenary meeting appear to be doing the work now that has not been done in the relevant committee.
I should also like to note that there is Europe-wide support for the content of this report.
If you feel that there are sections that do not comply with the Rules of Procedure, then I should like to hear from you, in which case we can still, if necessary, withdraw the sections concerned.
This is, in principle, an excellent report, at least according to its supporters and detractors in the media world.
I therefore fail to understand why we should withdraw it now for reasons of this kind.
I should like to have this issue resolved and heard beforehand.
Â Â  Several other colleagues have asked to speak but I do not want to replace the work the committee will do on our behalf this evening.
If any additional points of procedure arise from the committee's work this evening, we will have to deal with them later.
I would now like to close on this issue and assure the rapporteur and the committee that they will be the first in this House to receive whatever advice is available to me regarding the Rules of Procedure in respect of this matter.
We will evaluate the advice of the committee as to how we should proceed.
For now, then, let us refer the work to the committee for its meeting tonight and see what emerges from that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to wind up the discussion on the Boogerd-Quaak report.
This is not about the committeeâs political assessment or otherwise; the question is whether or not the Rules of Procedure have been breached.
Since freedom of expression is a significant matter, which is very important to us, we would like this matter to be dealt with seriously and for it to continue to be debated.
I therefore believe â and I am, of course, speaking on behalf of my group â that the report should be referred back to committee.
Â Â  Mr Fiori, I thought that we were simply inviting the committee to look again at the Boogerd-Quaak report.
If, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, you insist formally to refer the report back to committee, I can take one speaker for and one against and we could have a vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the claims made by MrÂ PodestÃ  and MrÂ Fiori seem to me to be totally unfounded.
They claim that the Rules of Procedure have been breached because the Committee on Petitions did not give its opinion.
This is a completely unfounded allegation.
The same Committee on Petitions sent us the first petition pursuant to ArticleÂ 7 of the Treaty so that we could look into it.
The Conference of Presidents authorised the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to draw up this initiative report: it is a political report and not a legislative one.
We were sent two further petitions for information, but we are not deciding on these.
We decide independently and the committees to be consulted were determined by the Conference of Presidents, which called on the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to carry out this report.
It said, âDraw up this report and listen to committees x, y and z,â not the Committee on Petitions.
At most this will be about withdrawing approval of these petitions that were sent inappropriately but no mistake has been made in terms of the Rules of Procedure; and I believe that the Presidency could assess this without needing to refer anything back to committee.
The Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was simply appointed, pursuant to RuleÂ 130a of the Rules of Procedure, to check something that is obvious: to see if a tenth of committee Members support each of the 330 amendments tabled with the intention of stonewalling.
Clearly, since they were tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the amendments will have the support of a tenth of the Members and, therefore, having carried out this check, we will have fulfilled the task given to us by the President.
Â Â  Mr Fiori, I have been looking at Rule 144 on referral back to committee.
Let me explain that you are within your rights to move a referral back to committee, but I should have been notified 24 hours in advance.
That was not the case, so you have forfeited that right today.
If you wish, you have the right to move referral back when we come to vote on the report, if indeed we get there this week, and if the committee prepares the way tonight.
So you do not lose the opportunity to refer the report back, but you have forfeited it at this particular time.
The committee will meet at 7 p.m. this evening and will hopefully bring some light, as well as some heat, to the matter when we return to it.
I have received a request from the GUE/NGL Group to include on Tuesday's agenda the report (A5-0274/2004) by Mrs Eriksson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the consequences of the sex industry in the European Union.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President.
I understand that the Conference of Presidents has decided to remove this report, previously considered by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities.
This was at the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who argued dishonestly that the report should be referred back to committee.
The committee has had its last meeting and, since I am not standing again, a referral would sound the death knell for this own-initiative report.
The report deals with the demand side of such issues as trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation.
If Parliament does not discuss the report and place that aspect in context, I do not see the reason for discussing sexual exploitation at all.
I therefore call for the report to be returned to the agenda as previously planned pursuant to Rule 111 of the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to support Mrs Erikssonâs request for three reasons.
Firstly, as she has said, this is our last chance to examine this report.
If it does not appear on this sessionâs agenda, it will lapse.
The second reason is that it has given rise to a considerable amount of work in committee.
We are all aware that it has been the subject of many disagreements, but the committee has succeeded in finding a compromise.
Everything is therefore ready and I think that it is only fair to ensure that all the work which has been done receives a favourable outcome.
Finally, this is a social issue which is very sensitive in many countries.
We may be in favour of this report, we may be against it, or we may want to amend it, but I believe that the worst thing we could do would be to give the impression that we are unwilling to deal with this subject.
That is why, Mr President, I should like to insist, on behalf of our group, even though I am aware that the agenda is relatively crowded, that this question should be included in the agenda for this part-session.
Â Â  â Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that, much as we could endorse a lot of what is in it, this report is, as a whole, unbalanced; parts of it make no sense and contradict each other, and everything is repeated time and time again.
I do ask most earnestly that we should distance ourselves from this report and, in the autumn, get back to the important things it contains, which, I believe, merit really in-depth, serious and proper consideration.
â I have received a request from the PPE-DE Group for a Commission statement on Eurostat, with motions for resolution, to be included in the joint debate on the 2002 discharges.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have, over many weeks and months, been devoting our attention to Eurostat, and you will be well aware that a substantial number of us here in this House even wanted to go as far as to state that it had no confidence in the Commission.
Although I have always been opposed to a vote of no confidence in the Commission, this House does have a legitimate interest in hearing what the Commission has to say on the subject and how it assesses what went on at Eurostat.
Our listening to the Commissionâs statement, and our discussion of it, is a sign of fairness, openness and transparency.
Â Â  â Mr President, politicians are always extremely adept, when elections are in the offing, at finding ways of putting Parliamentâs procedures to work in the service of their own election campaigns.
Let me remind Mr Poettering that we will, as part of tomorrowâs discharge debate, be discussing a report by a member of his group, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, which contains a whole passage on Eurostat.
I would also like to remind him that all of us in this House do of course expect the Commission to comment on it tomorrow.
I do not think it makes any sense to impose on Parliament a procedure that is intended solely to promote harmony within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats after the British Tories failed to get enough signatures for a motion of no confidence in the Commission.
Many of the tricks that are used to provide grist to the mills of the election campaigns are too obvious not to be noticed, and, having noticed them, we have to vote against them.

I have received a request from the Verts/ALE Group for Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this session is particularly complicated but unfortunately the world is also complicated.
Our role as the âeye of the international communityâ means that we must be thereand opine on the bloody events that are taking place in the Middle East, because the European Union, represented by its Member States, is not capable of doing so incisively and forcefully enough.
We are calling for this statement on the Middle East to be put on the agenda, because we want to know how the Council and the Commission will act in a situation in which â and there is no doubt about this â there are governments that continue to pour oil on the fire in order to influence this conflict.
I would also like to draw your attention, MrÂ President, to the fact that we recently adopted a resolution on this matter, and one paragraph in particular in which we call on the Council and the Commission to take into consideration the possibility of acting to enforce ArticleÂ 2 of the Association Agreement with Israel, if the latter continues to carry out the policy of extrajudicial killings.
We believe that, at this point in time, it is worth opening a debate in Parliament and making a decision, but above all it is worth hearing what the Commission and Council have to say to us.
Â Â  â Mr President, I think this does indeed represent a very significant change in, or clarification of, the American position, and a position of this sort can indeed drive a new wedge between the United States and Europe.
That is why it is important that the issue should be discussed.
If it is argued that there is too little time available, then it could, of course, be combined with discussion of trans-Atlantic relations, in which the Middle East presents a major political problem.
The fact that there are, of course, others is no excuse; if it really comes to it, it could be discussed along with trans-Atlantic relations, although this is an important issue and any statement would have to address it separately.
As you know, we will have debates on Cyprus and transatlantic relations that day.
Those debates may run over into Question Time.
I should like to signal that, because Cyprus needs a space on our agenda.
Indeed, apart from the Middle East there are many transatlantic issues that also need their space.
So I point out to you that exceptionally, on this occasion â and I extend my apologies to Mr Posselt in advance, as well as to Mr Puerta, our Vice-President who keeps telling us not to do these things â we may run over into Question Time.(3)
Â Â  On April 14 2004 I received a letter from Mr Gargani, in his role as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in which, at the request of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, he informed me that the Legal Affairs Committee recommends the introduction before the European Court of Justice of a request for an opinion in order for the Court to examine whether the object of an agreement between the European Union and the United States for the treatment and transfer of data â PNR â is compatible with the Treaty, and to establish whether the content of the agreement could put at risk the fundamental right to data protection accorded by the Treaty and by various European directives.
As you know, the House will discuss the Boogerd-Quaak report on the EC-USA agreement on PNR issues tomorrow evening.
I do not wish to have that debate now.
The reason I wish to consult the House at this moment is that our Rules of Procedure are clear: if I follow the advice of the Legal Affairs Committee, I act as a kind of postman through whom the request passes to the Court of Justice.
It seems to me, given the issues involved, that it would be useful for me to benefit from the advice and guidance of the House.
Therefore, under the Rules of Procedure, I had thought it better to pause for thought and to raise the matter at the opening of business today to hear a brief statement from the Commission and from the Groups, and then to ask the Groups tomorrow at midday to advise me as to whether to proceed in bringing the matter before the Court.
I ask Commissioner Bolkestein, who has been waiting here patiently as we arranged our business, to give a brief announcement concerning this aspect of the matter.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this much-debated subject.
The question that has been put to the Commission is a precise one: is the Commission prepared to withdraw its proposal to the Council to conclude an international agreement with the United States of America on the processing and transfer of passenger name record data by air carriers to the US?
The context in which this question is asked is also clear.
If the Commission does not indicate its willingness to follow Parliament's wish expressed in its Resolution of 31 March â namely to replace the present 'light' agreement and adequacy finding with a more substantive international agreement â Parliament will vote to seek an opinion from the European Court of Justice on the legality of the agreement currently before the House.
The Commission is grateful for this opportunity to state its position in advance of the vote.
In this context, I understand that Parliament seeks answers from the Commission on two issues.
Firstly, Parliament wishes to know whether or not the proposed international agreement modifies the Data Protection Directive as far as data exchange with the United States is concerned, and, therefore, whether or not the agreement is well founded as far as both the protection of fundamental rights and the European Parliament's prerogatives are concerned.
Secondly, Parliament wants the Commission to clarify the situation regarding data transfers by the United States to third country governments.
On the first point, the Commission does not consider that the international agreement amends the Data Protection Directive and, therefore, there is no ground for basing it on the second subparagraph of Article 300(3) of the Treaty.
If the agreement had amended the directive, the Commission would have proposed a different legal basis for the agreement and would have sought the assent of Parliament. But, I repeat, in our view, the agreement does not amend the directive.
The agreement leaves the protection afforded by the directive unchanged; in particular the proportionality requirement and the need for personal data to be processed fairly and lawfully.
However, the international agreement is necessary to ensure a legitimate basis for air carriers and computer reservation systems to process the PNR data as asked for by the United States, insofar as they are covered by the adequacy finding.
Beyond that, the international agreement contains a number of important guarantees for the European Union; notably US commitments regarding non-discrimination and reciprocity and a joint EU-US review of the implementation of the agreement.
With regard to the second point concerning transfers to third countries, this is a new issue which came up in our talks with the United States only relatively recently.
It concerns the safeguards that apply to the sharing by the United States of PNR data with law enforcement authorities in third countries.
As I drew to the attention of the House in my statement of 29 March, the Commission is still holding discussions with the United States on this point.
In fact they have been continuing today and will continue further.
I understand that the House would welcome further information on this point.
In particular, the rapporteur raised the question of whether the Commission had come to a firm conclusion that there is adequate protection or whether these further talks meant that this question remained open.
Our discussions with the United States on third country transfers have not yet been concluded.
As I said earlier, they have been going on today and may continue tomorrow morning.
Therefore, I cannot inform Parliament at this moment of the outcome in the required detail.
Currently, Director-General Alex Schaub of the Directorate General for the Internal Market is, with his staff, negotiating this issue with the American side.
These talks are not designed to bring about any changes in the documents you have seen, but rather to clarify how the undertakings will be applied in the case of the transfer of PNR data to other countries.
They will seek to ensure, in particular, that the purpose limitation agreed in paragraph 3 of the undertakings is respected, even when data is passed on to third countries.
Of course, the Commission is pushing the United States for guarantees that are as strong as possible.
This issue will be discussed at the meeting of the College of Commissioners tomorrow afternoon.
My colleague Chris Patten will be addressing this House tomorrow evening on the international agreement.
He will inform the House on the outcome of the discussions with the United States, and of any relevant developments.
It seems to me, therefore, that it would be best for MrÂ Patten to inform the House following the Commission meeting tomorrow afternoon and then for the House to decide as it thinks best.
Â Â  I would now like to hear the Groups' assessments on the matter of referral to the Court.
This may well be informed by what the Commissioner has just said, but I should like to remind you that the full debate on PNR will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, where this issue of an appeal to the European Court of Justice is concerned, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is being entirely pragmatic in its approach.
What concerns us is that failure to come to the sort of agreement that the Commissioner has described will lead to a great deal of inconvenience for EU citizens travelling to the USA.
If the Americans do not get by this route the information they require, they will obtain it by other means, whether this involves questioning at the border, mandatory visas or interviews in Consulates-General.
Secondly, if we do not get this agreement, our citizens will be in no better a legal position as regards data protection; indeed, they will be in a worse one, because we will have no influence whatever on what the Americans do with the data they obtain.
With this in mind, we are grateful to the Commission for its efforts, and have, as a group, expressed our opposition to an appeal to the Court of Justice not only in the course of the debate in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also in the resolution of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Â Â  MrÂ President, for more than a year, a majority in this Parliament â although the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are of the opposite opinion â has claimed that it is a serious violation of the fundamental right of European citizens to data protection to demand that all European airlines are obliged to process European citizensâ data contained in their computerised reservation systems as requested by the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and in line with US legislation.
On top of that, there is not even any US legislation since no US law exists to protect private data.
We are therefore obliged to process our data, the data of our citizens, as requested by an administrative body of a third country.
We therefore want an international agreement that grants rights.
This controversy has been going on for a year and the Commission, even now, repeatedly says that the directive has not been amended, but on this basis it has been breached.
This is the opinion of the majority of Parliament.
This is why we are calling for a preliminary decision by the Court of Justice.
I do not even believe that we need wait for further news tomorrow because, I reiterate, we have carried on for a year or more.
The only way to solve the matter â as to if it is true or if it is not true that a right in the Treaty has been breached â is to ask the Court of Justice for a ruling in advance, before signing the agreement, so that we do not end up nullifying an agreement that has already been drawn up, since this would damage relations.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to congratulate the Commission, and Commissioner Bolkestein in particular, on his efforts to try to reach agreement with the United States on such a difficult matter.
My Group regrets that he has not been more successful in persuading the United States to respect our concerns about data privacy.
My Group cannot agree on the choice of legal basis.
While, as Mr Bolkestein says, the agreement does not formally amend our data protection directive, it clearly amends the law as it applies to European Community citizens by making us subject to US law in this area, and the absence of protection in US law is precisely our concern.
There is a huge democratic deficit when the Commission comes forward with a proposal like this and does not give either the European Parliament or national parliaments the chance to say yes or no.
Now, as Mr Bolkestein informs us, that the information being passed to the United States' authorities may be passed on to third country authorities, we should be seriously concerned.
There have been three debates and votes in this House on the matter.
Three committees have examined it and all recommended a referral to the Court of Justice.
My Group does not seek a dispute with the Commission.
We have asked the Commission to withdraw this proposal and to try to negotiate with the Americans and present to us and the US Congress a full-blown international agreement to cover these issues so that we can effectively fight terrorism together while respecting our commitments to data privacy.
We would prefer the Commission to do that, but if the Commission cannot do it, perhaps at least at its meeting tomorrow the Commission could agree to take the initiative in referring the matter to the Court of Justice to decide whether there is adequacy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I do not want to repeat all the things that my fellow Members who spoke before me have already expressed very well.
On many occasions, the Commission has said that this is the best agreement that it could extract from the United States Government, but it must be said that, the more debates we have, the worse the situation gets for European citizens.
Indeed, today we know that this agreement not only implies a violation of the Treaties, but even the possibility that these data will be transferred to a third country and will be processed by them, which thus made it more difficult to get the debate on the first part of the agreement under way.
As has already been said, this Parliament has often said that it is against this agreement.
Of course, it has not specifically voted on resorting to the Court of Justice but this, in my opinion, is a necessary consequence.
We are therefore calling for Parliament to be able to take the opinion of a third, much respected and authoritative authority, such as the Court of Justice, and thus be able to freely decide whether to say yes or no to this agreement.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not wish to repeat what has already been said either, since my group endorses what MrÂ Watson, MrsÂ Paciotti and MrÂ DiÂ LelloÂ Finuoli said.
We agree that we should continue along our path, because I do not believe that CommissionerÂ Bolkesteinâs words are satisfactory and, indeed, I am also a little surprised by his lack of consideration for a vote, so unusual for Parliament, such as the one which took place at the last part-session.
It is indisputable, CommissionerÂ Bolkestein, that by not entering into a real international agreement with the United States, the Commission has chosen to bypass Parliamentâs opinion.
The fact that you have opted for soft law instead of a real agreement already speaks volumes about the Commissionâs intentions to exclude democratic control of this agreement, and I find this particularly worrying.
We do not seek a dispute with you â if, however, you are determined to force it on us then we will have no option but to fight it â but we believe that it is extremely important to seek the opinion of the Court of Justice.
Your announcement, Commissioner, was not enough to prevent us doing so and we think that this stand will also be useful for the Commission so that, in the future, it will not commit these mistakes at the expense of the citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have to say that I am not very happy about the Commissionerâs remark that there is no violation of Regulation 95/46.
Paragraph 4 of the agreement itself states that all data of European passengers will be processed according to US constitutional requirements.
One of the laws in the United States that should apply is the Privacy Act, but this Act does not apply to people from third countries, to name but one example.
Article 6 of the agreement states that there will be reciprocity insofar as feasible and that it shall be strictly applied.
I do not want to have the debate now, but I can easily give you another ten examples of things that are not right and are, in my view, a violation of our privacy legislation.
For that reason alone, we should put this matter to the Court.
In the previous debate, the Commissioner said, with regard to the passing on of data to third parties, that âwe are still in negotiation with the United Statesâ.
I heard this correctly last time and also this time round.
It is surely too crazy for words that I as rapporteur have to submit to this House a report on adequacy finding,while the Commission itself still holds the view that the whole matter was inadequate.
This is something I really do want to bring in to the debate.
I should like to thank all those Members who have spoken out in favour of recourse to the Court.
I think that the question to the Court, as to whether we can conclude international agreements in which both Parliament and the American Congress are placed offside, is a very interesting one indeed.
In consultations with members of the Congress, I have been given to understand that, should such an agreement be put to the American Congress, it would never agree to it.
We in this House should now also demonstrate that we know how to stand up for our citizens and not be put under pressure by anybody.
We are alone in being able to do this.
I am therefore hopeful that Parliament will follow the line taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Â Â  . Mr President, we have, of course, already debated in depth all aspects of the agreement with the United States on the treatment of the personal data of passengers travelling to that country from EU territory.
The request for the prior opinion of the Court of Justice, as Mr Lehne, from my own political group has quite rightly said, will only postpone the signing of the agreement and leave a legal vacuum in place in relation to the treatment of personal data by the US authorities, seriously prejudicing the European public and the air carriers themselves.
It is not, therefore, necessary to repeat our position, which is already well known.
We also believe, naturally, that this agreement can be improved but also that the fight against terrorism and cooperation with third countries in the field, with the United States in this case, is a priority for the European Union.
Furthermore, Mr President, we need the agreement now and, in any event, there will always be the possibility of referring the matter to the Court of Justice at a later date.
I would also like, Mr President, to take up Commissioner Bolkesteinâs proposal that we listen to what Commissioner Patten says to us tomorrow afternoon with regard to the agreement and delay the vote scheduled for tomorrow morning.
I would ask that this request be considered, since I believe it to be very reasonable, and, in any event, I would ask that the vote we were going to hold tomorrow on prior referral to the Court of Justice be delayed until the day after tomorrow, when we have heard the Commissionâs speech.
Â Â  I thank all colleagues who have contributed to that exchange of views. A number of you have remarked how several different committees and resolutions over recent weeks and months have indicated the probability of going to the Court of Justice, of which I have been aware as I have keenly followed the issue.
However, the event which triggered the referral to the Court was the letter of last Wednesday afternoon, which I received from Mr Gargani on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
This is the first time I have had the duty and opportunity, as President, to look into the question.
In light of the exchange of views, I propose that we proceed to the debate in substance tomorrow.
We will hear what Commissioner Patten has to say, along with the opinions of different colleagues.
In the light of all the available information, the vote will take place at noon on Wednesday.
That brings us to within 24 hours of our ultimate deadline in terms of our right to refer to the Court, so we are still working within the time limits that apply here.
Because of the volume of business this week, we have added an extra sitting tonight.
I suggest that those colleagues who wish to make a 'one-minute speech' submit what they wanted to say in writing, and I will try to follow up on their comments.
For anyone who insists on speaking, the Rules provide that the item can be taken later in the sitting.
I therefore propose to take the item at the end of business this evening, rather than at this stage.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0227/2004) by Johannes Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on respect for and promotion of the values on which the Union is based.
Â Â  . â Thank you, Mr President; ladies and gentlemen, it may perhaps be said that the earlier debates on Mrs Boogerd-Quaakâs reports on the freedom of the media and the exchange of airline passenger information have dramatically demonstrated how important it is to prepare for crises in good time, how difficult it actually can be to defend our Unionâs core values when under great pressure and in crisis situations, and how important it is that we should arrive at common principles and procedures.
That is why I am glad that the committee accepted by an overwhelming majority the report on respect for, and promotion of, the values on which the Union is based, which I am presenting to you today.
In doing this, Members belonging to all the political groups signalled their unanimous determination to defend fundamental values and the Unionâs principles of democracy and of the rule of law, values against which international terrorism has declared itself to be targeted, but which can lead to conflict in combating that same terrorism, that are also jeopardised by rising xenophobia, by racism and anti-Semitism in Europe, as well as by political extremism.
It makes no sense to close your eyes to it; I believe instead that the times demand that we prepare ourselves for it.
I am grateful to the Commission for, by its communication, making an essential contribution to the dialogue between the institutions and to close cooperation between them, which I regard as indispensable where the application of Article 7(1) and (2) is concerned.
Although the rapporteur and the committee both had criticisms to make of the Commission communication, I do believe that we have, today, been able to make a number of proposals as to how this position might be further developed.
It appeared both to me and to the committee that a higher level of protection than that proposed by the Commission was indispensable, especially in drawing a distinction between a clear risk under Article 7(1) and a serious breach, as was, in our view, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution.
Although the acceptance of this by all the institutions and the governments of the Member States does not make it binding in law, it is binding in a political sense, so that decisions taken by reference to Article 7 are discretionary and political, and can therefore be taken only on the basis of it and in full accord with it.
The committee was rather disconcerted â as indeed was I myself â by the lack of appreciation of Parliamentâs particular responsibilities, which are virtually absent from the Commission communication.
According to Article 7(1) Parliament possesses the power of initiative, and both paragraphs accord it the right of approval.
What this means is that whether or not the criteria and principles that Parliament chooses for this procedure are actually recognised by other institutions as well will be a quite essential consideration.
In my report, I originally proposed an interinstitutional agreement to embed these principles and make them binding on the other institutions, but I wholly accept the committeeâs decision to initiate an interinstitutional dialogue on this.
The report proposes very definite principles, which I hope are also forward-looking, and these are meant to deal with the qualms and misgivings felt by Members of the House, and also by other committees.
The principle of confidence states that it is for our Member States, through their constitutions and institutions, to take active steps to defend the fundamental rights and values of the Union against breaches and the risk thereof; we are also persuaded that they must also be willing and able to do so.
This House reiterates and affirms that it has this confidence.
Secondly, with regard to the principle of plurality of opinion on the basis of democracy and the rule of law, we reaffirm Parliamentâs intention that Article 7 must never be used as an instrument of political opposition.
The principle of equality also applies, despite the widespread misgivings about it, and it is intended that it should be embedded, in other words, that Member States should be treated equally, irrespective of their size, their contribution to the Budget, or the length of time they have been Member States.
I will conclude by saying that I attach particular importance to the principle of openness.
Although neither I nor anyone else here wants things to go that far, this procedure will, if it does so, give rise to major tensions.
The debates at the start of this session showed us how very difficult it will be, in a state of emergency, to implement such a procedure with confidence, wisdom, and fairness.
It is my belief that, in the event of such a procedure, Parliament would need a great deal of public credibility and so, contrary to what the Commission proposes, it is not a separate procedure that such circumstances require, but the absolute openness of all procedures, which the possibility of sanctions makes all the more necessary.
That, Mr President, brings me to my conclusion.
Parliament believes that the sanctions issue must indeed be addressed, and that it cannot be the subject of speculation, so that nowhere â whether outside the EU or within it â can there be even the least doubt about this Unionâs determination to use all the means available to it in the defence of fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report which replies to the Commission's communication on Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union.
In that communication, which was addressed to the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission aimed to provide a framework for analysis of the conditions for the application of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union in order to initiate a dialogue with the other two institutions responsible for implementing this important provision.
The Commission is pleased with the favourable reaction of Parliament to the principle of this Commission initiative.
Fundamental rights and the rule of law are the foundations of the European Union and a significant departure by any Member State from these values threatens to call into question the common values upon which the Union was built.
For this reason, the Commission's communication underlined prevention as a means of obviating the need to resort to Article 7 or, in any event, to impose the penalties provided for by this Article.
Evidently, penalties should still be resorted to if necessary â let us be clear on this particular point.
As the draft resolution rightly stressed, the Union must first and foremost have confidence in Member States and their own institutions, for example the constitutional courts.
However, as part of a preventive approach it is undoubtedly necessary, as has in fact been requested by Parliament, for the Union to monitor respect for fundamental rights, and for independent European expertise to be developed in this area.
As you are aware, we have put in place a network of independent experts which my colleague Mr Vitorino commented on at length at the last part-session during the debate on fundamental rights in the Union.
Prevention also requires cooperation between institutions and the Member States, dialogue with citizens and information and education of the public.
A point meriting particular attention, and with which the Commission fully concurs, is the reference to the principles that must be respected when considering whether to enforce Article 7.
These are the trust that should govern the EU's relationship with its Member States, the respect for pluralism, the principle of the equality of the Member States and the principle of the transparency of the decisions taken under Article 7.
I note also that the report considers that the role of the Vienna Monitoring Centre could be revised with a view to providing 'independent and objective scrutiny on a broader basis'.
This is in line with the European Council's decision in December 2003 to extend the Centre's mandate to convert it into an Agency for Fundamental Rights, which is supported by the Commission.
I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that the Commission is currently studying ways of implementing the preparatory activities of the NGO support programme in the new Member States, in the areas of respect for the law, democracy and fundamental rights, in line with Parliament's wishes.
This confirms the shared determination of the Commission and Parliament to encourage civil society to take action to support fundamental rights based on a preventive, positive and constructive approach.
To conclude, the Commission welcomes the recognition of the importance of interinstitutional dialogue regarding the launch of the Article 7 mechanism.
As I said before, this is in line with the aim of the Commission's communication, which was to institute a dialogue with the two institutions in order to develop a common approach.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and point out that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and on behalf of a fellow Member who has not been able to speak.
There can be no question that the PPE-DE Group has always defended the fundamental rights and values that we in the European Union represent.
The European Union promoted by the founding fathers in the 1950s was not intended to be an economic union, but a union based on certain fundamental values which we must guarantee, as the rapporteur has said.
My group largely supports his report, although several amendments have been tabled, but we will vote in favour of the proposal the rapporteur has made in this report.
I am delighted that in Nice some of these values were incorporated into the constitution and that provision was made for establishing a mechanism under the terms of Article 7 in order to guarantee that values are respected within the European Union.
I come from a country which has been attacked by terrorists over the last 30 years, and which, furthermore, was savagely attacked on 11 March, and, as the rapporteur has said in his speech, terrorism can only be tackled by means of more values, more democracy and more fundamental rights and the European Union must, therefore, be capable of guaranteeing respect for these values within the Union, in order more effectively to combat terrorism, attacks on our values and attacks on European values.
I would like to say finally â in relation to the rapporteur's report â that we share the principles expressed in it â trust, priority, equality and publicity â which can allow us to make progress on establishing a mechanism which prevents certain States from failing to respect the values which are so important to defend in the European Union, and in this very Parliament more than anywhere else.
We also support his proposal to establish an interinstitutional mechanism to promote dialogue between Parliament and the Council as from the next legislature.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on whose behalf I have the honour of speaking, also thanks the rapporteur for a very important report, one that is a key element in making the European Union a democracy capable of defending itself.
In both Conventions â both that on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that on the Constitution â our group was very active in contending that the EU is not merely an economic community, but also a community of values, one whose foundations have been laid over centuries, and one that is willing to defend democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law throughout its territory.
This Union of ours is a great thing, extending from Estonia to Portugal, and we have to ask ourselves what holds it together.
It certainly is not the market that constitutes Europe, but rather the sense of solidarity derived from our values.
Such is Europe, such is our identity â and that we must not lose.
We do of course need a mechanism to guarantee the maintenance of these values.
The public would find it incomprehensible if a Member State were to get out of hand without the EU doing anything about it.
We do not, of course, want to interfere in a stateâs internal affairs â we are a Union with a great deal of pluralism and much diversity â but, when there is evidence of clear risks and of long-standing breaches of these values and principles, that is the time for the EU to act.
I am very glad to hear the Commissioner say that such action may even involve sanctions.
Cutting off funds from Brussels, not to mention withdrawal of the entitlement to participate in decision-making bodies, is of course the sharpest weapon one can use, but we have to make clear our willingness to introduce it if necessary.
I see Parliament as having a particular role to play in this, and that has been emphasised in the report, for which let me reiterate our thanks to Mr Voggenhuber.
Â Â  â Mr President, exactly seven years have passed, and still neither the Council nor the Commission have proved themselves capable of devising a procedure to implement Article 7, an article once trumpeted abroad, at the time of the Treaty of Amsterdam, as a vital policy innovation in the EU Treaty.
The lack of definite procedural rules, though, means that the paper asserting the values of the EU has to be patient.
Without such a procedure, the whole article remains a paper tiger.
Such a situation is not exactly calculated to make the European Union more credible in the eyes of its citizens; you are all aware to what a depth that credibility has fallen in all our Member States.
Putting it politely, I have to say that I am disturbed by the Commission communication that this report takes as its starting point.
It is extremely disturbing that the Commission quite obviously does not want to impose penalties on Member States in the event of serious breaches of the Treaties.
It evidently wants to fool us into believing that everything in our garden is lovely and is going to stay that way.
What else can it mean when the Commission, on page 14 of its communication, states bluntly â and I quote â that âit will not be necessary to apply penalties pursuant to Article 7(3) of the Union Treaty and Article 309 of the EC Treatyâ?
Such an absolution of responsibility would markedly diminish our own high expectations of our shared values and, ultimately, the standard of protection for fundamental rights and values in the EU.
It also reminds one of the oft-used repressive phrase to the effect that what is not allowed cannot happen.
Even more serious is the Commissionâs ostrich-like and nonchalant attitude to the protection of fundamental rights in time of war, and this is where the real scandal lies.
The real scandal is the way in which the Commission virtually serves up fundamental rights in the EU in time of war on a silver platter.
Let me quote from page 8 of the Commission communication: âOn the contrary, a serious breach presupposes that the danger should have become a concrete fact.â
Purely hypothetically, the adoption of a law abrogating procedural safeguards in time of war would be a clear risk.
Actually using such a law, on the other hand, would be a serious breach.
That really is something to be savoured; the Commission regards a law, in a Member State, abrogating fundamental rights, as no more than a clear risk rather than as a serious breach, without even mentioning the possibility of penalties.
No, this is not on.
This represents a point beyond which Parliament cannot allow the Commission to persist in going against the flow of fundamental rights, and so I am glad that Parliament has taken the initiative, in the shape of the Voggenhuber report, so that now, seven years after Amsterdam, something is at last being done.
In relation to this, I have proposed a number of amendments aimed at making the draft text more precise.
In particular, these relate to the obligation placed on the EU by the Conventionâs draft constitutional treaty, in its Article 3(4) in Part I and in Article 193(1) in Part III, to abide by international law, and I think that the Iraq war, which was contrary to international law, and all the misery inflicted on that country by the occupying forces, is evidence of the need for further tightening up of the reportâs motion for a resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, the Voggenhuber report and the Commission communication on which it is based demonstrate only too well how Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union can become an infernal machine enabling the Union, in the name of preventing or penalising real or alleged violations of fundamental rights, to subject Member States to greater external supervision.
In other words we are seeing in outline the development of a central disciplinary system which will be able to impose on national democracies extensive or arbitrary definitions of their obligations.
Paragraph 3 of the report gives a good example of this when it suggests that States which tolerate, and I quote, âa climate or social conditions in which individualsâŠ feel threatenedâ could be condemned.
This sort of definition can go a very long way, particularly since Article 7 applies not only to the rights provided by the Union, which may be increased in future by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also to purely national competences, as the Commission communication clearly explains.
Paradoxically, therefore, there is a risk that in the name of respecting human rights a highly undemocratic multilateral surveillance system will be set up.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has delivered a very negative opinion on the report and it is right to do so.
I took a similar line in the minority opinion which I expressed following the vote by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Voggenhuber has just laid stress on the principle of openness, and I would just like to make a few brief observations on it.
Let me say, while we are on this subject, that I well recall the arbitrary treatment meted out to my own country, Austria, in relation to what we are talking about.
The Austrian Socialists, who have for some time now been calling themselves Social Democrats, were fully involved in the underhand manoeuvres that were going on at the time.
I also have very precise recollections of a telephone call from the then Austrian Chancellor, Viktor Klima, a Socialist, who was fully in the know and told me that all he demanded of me was that nothing should get out.
Never again must principles of this sort be applied in this fashion, whether in party politics or in affairs of State, for without transparency there is no democracy.
It is precisely for this reason that tracing the course of these events and making them accessible to the public is so very important.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- report (A5-0191/2004) by Evelyne Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws ('the regulation on consumer protection cooperation');
- second report (A5-0224/2004) by Joachim Wuermeling, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning credit for consumers;
and
- report (A5-0188/2004) by Fiorella Ghilardotti, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the Internal Market and amending Directives 84/450/EEC, 97/7/EC and 98/27/EC (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive).
Â Â  . Mr President, just a year ago this Parliament adopted its resolution on the Commission's new consumer policy strategy for the next five years.
We are discussing today three key proposals within the context of that strategy.
I am particularly pleased that Parliament has decided to discuss them jointly, as all three pursue the objective of boosting consumer confidence in the internal market.
Consumer purchases represent close to 60% of the EU's GDP.
A loss of consumer confidence â even by a small amount â can have significant repercussions for our economy and collective wealth.
Last month, at the spring European Council, the Heads of State and Government took stock of our pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda, which aims to boost the competitiveness of our economy.
It would be no exaggeration to say that there is definitely room for improvement in this respect.
Consumer confidence is good for business and would contribute to boosting our competitiveness.
The European Union has come a long way in eliminating barriers in the single market.
In tearing down regulatory barriers we must, however, realise that consumers â the demand side of the market â are also confronted with barriers, namely confidence barriers.
Not addressing these confidence barriers would not only be irresponsible but also very damaging to the interests of consumers and businesses alike.
It would also put a heavy burden on our ability to meet our competitiveness objectives set out in the Lisbon Agenda.
The proposals we are discussing today will allow us to maximise the benefits of the single market for consumers.
I would like to thank the three rapporteurs from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their hard work on these proposals, as well as the rapporteurs from the committees providing opinions for their time and effort.
I turn first to the proposed regulation on enforcement cooperation.
It addresses what has always been the weak point in consumer protection: the effective application of the law.
In cross-border cases, problems increase because national enforcement mechanisms are not designed to deal with such cases.
Rogue traders who seek to cheat consumers have spotted this and are more prevalent in cross-border cases than in domestic ones, targeting consumers across borders through the post, by e-mail or via websites.
To deal with this, the proposed regulation sets up a network of public enforcement authorities, with at least one in each Member State.
The effect of the proposal will be that national authorities can cooperate quickly and effectively in tracking down rogue traders and stop them from harming consumers and legitimate businesses.
This regulation will send a strong message to European citizens, telling them that the EU is relevant to their day-to-day concerns and that they can have greater confidence in shopping throughout Europe.
I would like to thank Mrs Gebhardt and colleagues who worked with her towards a compromise agreement with the Council allowing for the adoption of the proposal in a single reading.
The compromise that was negotiated between the institutions ensures that enforcement authorities will at last have the necessary tools at their disposal genuinely to cooperate in cross-border cases.
At the same time, it respects the various traditions that exist among the different Member States, with some relying more on public enforcement and others relying more on private actions.
I am aware and indeed concerned that some of you would prefer the opinion of the lead committee, which is expressed in Amendment No 29, over the compromise solution contained in Amendment No 76, which has been worked out with the Council.
Pursuing this approach risks leading to prolonged discussions with the Council and to a second reading, further delaying the creation of an effective enforcement mechanism capable of dealing with rogue traders.
I see no reason why either our businesses or our consumers would in any way benefit from such a delay.
The amendments tabled and supported by some in no way enhance the effectiveness of the mechanism, neither do they present a meaningful contribution to safeguarding established national mechanisms and traditions.
I therefore urge all Members to stick to the compromise.
This is the last legislative part-session of this Parliament before the elections.
It is therefore also your final opportunity to ensure that when you have to inform your voters about precisely what you have done to further consumer interests and the enforcement of law, you have a tangible example to show them.
The second proposal on the table today is the proposed directive on consumer credit.
There is broad agreement that a new directive on consumer credit is both necessary and desirable.
The market and the products have evolved considerably since the mid-1980s and the existing directive is no longer adapted to new developments in the area of credit.
This new directive is necessary to allow the emergence of a real single market in consumer credit.
It is desirable in order to achieve a high level of consumer protection in line with the consumer policy action plan endorsed by the European Parliament.
This is the reason why I consider a full harmonisation approach the only means to really create a level playing field for lenders throughout the EU.
Many of you have called, and will call, for minimum harmonisation, allowing Member States to top up the rules at national level.
This would, however, mean maintaining differences between national legislations. It will continue to ensure that the credit market remains a domestic and local market, depriving consumers of all the advantages a single credit market could offer them.
It would not improve legal certainty for creditors and consumers contracting across borders.
It would not help to develop a genuine single market in consumer credit.
The full harmonisation approach will not lead to a lowering of consumer protection standards, as we have rightly chosen a high common level of protection as the starting point.
Moreover, I would stress that the harmonisation applies to only those areas actually covered by the directive.
In areas that fall outside the scope of the directive, Member States remain free to maintain their own national provisions.
Full harmonisation will improve the overall level of consumer protection in the EU and facilitate the provision of cross-border credit.
Last, but not least, I come to the framework directive on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices.
This proposal aims to put in place a high common level of consumer protection against unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices EU wide.
In doing so, it will stimulate consumer confidence and ensure that rogue practices can be addressed wherever in the EU they arise.
Just as importantly, it will reduce the barriers that prevent legitimate businesses from making the most of the internal market and reaching new consumers.
Both businesses and consumers will benefit from the security of having one set of rules rather than 15 or, from 1 May, 25.
Both business and consumers will therefore be better placed to take advantage of the enlarged internal market. This in turn will have a positive effect on the competitiveness of the EU economy as a whole.
I will leave it at that for the time being and look forward to hearing your views.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over and over again we hear of the underhand machinations of rapacious businessmen, in whose nets members of the public have been caught, but from which it is often possible to extricate them.
All the Member States have precautions in place to protect consumers, whether this is done using public authorities such as the UKâs Office of Fair Trading or Franceâs , or by such bodies as the Dutch or the in Germany.
All of them help if, for example, a letter lands on your doormat telling you that you have won a prize in a lottery, and that all you have to do to get it is to sign and post the form, so you do and off it goes.
A week later, you get goods you have not ordered, which you are told you have to pay for.
Alternatively, you fall for one of the slimming courses that are on offer â particularly frequently in young peopleâs magazines in recent times â the effectiveness of which is much exaggerated and whose side-effects are glossed over.
Perhaps you have been enticed by an offer that has turned out to involve âmodem jackingâ, in which a website offers you the chance to download music free of charge, you accept the offer, and, in the course of the process, you, the customer, without being aware of it, are cut off from your usual Internet Service Provider and attached to another one that is much more expensive.
Only later do you get the bill.
In most cases of fraud, the national authorities can provide help.
It is something like 20% of cases that matters become problematic, when the only known address is often a PO Box in a foreign country.
In such situations, good advice soon becomes invaluable.
This draft piece of legislation is of great importance in terms of dealing with cases such as these.
Legislation is also urgently needed, for problems are piling up, and we should not leave the public to their own devices.
That is why, as your rapporteur, I acceded to the wish of the Irish Presidency of the Council that the legislation should be adopted, if at all possible, in only one reading.
What is on the table is what has emerged from negotiations.
I also want to put on the record my thanks to the Commission for its active help in achieving this result.
This legislation is primarily concerned with mutual assistance in enforcing consumersâ rights, for which every Member State is to set up a public office to function as the point of contact for the authorities in other Member States, although I wish to stress that no Member State will be obliged to set up a new authority.
It is for the Member States to decide how to allocate the functions described in this Regulation to existing authorities.
This is not about creating bureaucracy, but about successfully putting a stop to the fraudulent schemes of a few rogue traders, who use cross-border businesses as a front.
To this end, public agencies can, by mutual agreement, delegate the handling of cases to non-governmental organisations, and this is the traditional practice in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.
I am working on the assumption that, in these states the norm will be for tasks to be handed over to time-tested bodies such as consumersâ associations or business self-regulators.
On that, I believe, depends my recommendation, as rapporteur, to my fellow-Members that they should vote to accept this compromise text.
The only exceptions I can envisage are where statutory bodies have to exchange particularly sensitive data, but we have made definite arrangements for that in this document.
By agreeing to this draft legislation, we can redeem a pledge given by all of us as MEPs, our pledge that we would commit ourselves to dealing with the publicâs concerns.
I hope that, tomorrow, we will do so with a resounding yes.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, honoured visitors, I would like to start by thanking most warmly all those who have played their part in drawing up this report, which is a very complex and comprehensive one.
We were, unfortunately, obliged to consider a Commission proposal that was not entirely consistently thought through, that was sloppily worded and had not taken account, above all, of the serious consequences it would have for consumers, for example on their access to credit.
We in the committee therefore had to propose extensive changes to this directive, achieving the sad record of 650 amendments to what have to date been 38 articles, but your concentrated collaboration means that it has now been possible to assemble all this into a genuinely consistent whole.
Nor must I let this opportunity go by without very warmly thanking Parliamentâs Bureau and the groupsâ secretariat, not to mention my own staff, for the endless hours they devoted to this project.
I can tell the House that what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wishes to do by means of this proposal is to send out three signals.
One carries the message that the European internal market needs the best possible consumer protection.
We will achieve this if we combine the European Unionâs minimum standards with the legislation of individual states, but if, on the other hand, we were to take the approach of harmonising everything or as much as possible, that would amount to only the minimum of protection for the consumer.
This is where I want to express my disagreement with what Commissioner Byrne had to say.
The fact is that I get the impression that what matters most of all to the Commission is that consumer law in this area should be completely centralised, with the European Union alone being entitled to do anything that has to do with consumer protection.
That would not, however, be objectively reasonable, as the national markets still differ to a large extent, and it is there that there must be a rapid and flexible response when improper business practices crop up.
Secondly, we are sending the message that financial markets need to be opened up to individual consumers too.
We want the standards of protection not only to enhance public confidence in commerce and in buying by mail order, but also to encourage the public to seek out offers throughout the internal market in order, eventually, to find credit on favourable terms.

Thirdly, we are signalling our opposition to over-regulation and bureaucracy, for there is, quite simply, no sense in deluging ordinary customers â responsible adults though they may be â with a flood of information that they cannot read, let alone understand; hence our proposal for clear technical information that will provide consumers with the key facts on their loans at a glance.
We also made it our concern to maintain access to credit facilities particularly for the man and woman in the street and for the vulnerable members of society.
It is these sectors of the population who need short-term loans simply to stay on top of day-to-day life.
The end result of the Commission proposal would have been that the only people who could get credit would be those who had no need of it.
There are two more specific points I would like to address briefly, and these are still subject to discussion between the groups.
The first has to do with the entitlement to early repayment.
One position on this is that this should generally be permitted, and without any additional costs being incurred, whilst the other is that consumers should be allowed to choose between fixed-term loans and those capable of being repaid early.
In view of the fact that we have still not yet come to an agreement on this, let me draw still closer to the Group of the Party of European Socialists; you will have seen that I have already tabled a compromise amendment, Amendment No 173, in which I propose that, where loans are taken out for a period of over three years, it should be possible to repay them at any time.
I would now like to add to that by combining it with Amendment No 96 as recommended by the committee, whose effect is to bring about a commensurate reduction in costs in this case.
Even though there are some points from todayâs debate that I wanted to mention, let me bring this speech to a close.
I see this package of reports â Mrs Gebhardtâs, Mrs Ghilardottiâs, and my own â as the culmination and conclusion of our legislative work in the field of consumer law.
We have always managed to discharge our responsibilities in a state of tension between the demands of the internal market and those of consumer protection, and what we have put before you I see as being a single piece of mature legislation.
Whatever our differences about the details, then, I hope that they will receive the general support of the House.
Â Â  . Mr President, CommissionerÂ Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive concerning unfair commercial practices takes over a large part of the Green Paper on consumer protection, referred to by the Commissioner in his report.
The reasons underlying the directive, which is designed to achieve higher consumer protection, are of an economic nature, and therefore relate to the completion and smooth operation of the internal market.
In order for these general economic goals to be achieved, it is necessary to have a consumer protection policy to create European consumer confidence and to give a fresh impetus to international and European commercial transactions.
The benefit of economic growth in the internal market ought to translate into both higher profits for businesses and higher protection and financial benefits for consumers.
Through a joint policy for consumers and the harmonisation of the internal market it will also be possible to achieve price convergence.
Conversely, unfair commercial practices lead to irrational financial behaviour in consumers, create distortions of competition and place barriers in the way of the proper functioning of the market.
To this end, I endorse the Commission's approach, which is based on harmonisation, on the principle of mutual recognition of the country of origin, on a general prohibition on unfair commercial practices, on the identifying of specific criteria and examples and on the fact that the scope of application is limited to a framework directive based on business-consumer relations.
The creation of a European legislative framework covering unfair commercial practices based on an appropriate level of harmonisation and aimed at clear and effective protection of consumers within the European Union will result in enhanced consumer confidence, an increase in international trade and will allow businesses to compete in a situation of legal clarity.
While endorsing the basic approach and the main objectives of the directive, Parliament is nevertheless tabling a raft of amendments which, in our opinion, make a series of definitions and options clearer and unequivocal.
In this regard, we have tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis, that is, a proposal to include, in addition to the legal basis proposed by the Commission in relation to the internal market, a legal basis based on Article 153 concerning consumer protection, so that we can reconcile the objective of harmonisation and mutual recognition of the internal market with the possibility for the Member States to maintain legislation which goes further to protect consumers.
In this way, I believe that we can respond to the fears of those who think that greater harmonisation could lead to downward levelling of consumer protection or entail a step backwards with regard to existing legislation in many Member States.
We also feel that it is important â with regard to the definition of consumers â to refer to a particular group of consumers, specifically vulnerable consumers who, as a result of various factors such as age, physical or mental abilities, their level of literacy or disability, need greater protection.
Again with reference to Article 2, in relation to the definitions, it is important to amend the definition of professional diligence and I will retable an amendment in plenary in this regard.
In essence, we support the Commissionâs approach to the regulation of misleading and aggressive practices but we stress, though, that the information which consumers must receive about unfair commercial practices and codes of conduct is an essential element.
Similarly we also think, in relation to codes of conduct, that the distinction between national and Community codes is slightly artificial, and we therefore point out the need to provide for appropriate, efficient mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the codes.
Another important point, which concerns the codes of conduct as a method of regulating and resolving disputes between businesses and consumers, is arbitration, which cannot and should not replace or prevent recourse to administrative bodies, but which could play an important part.
Therefore, as my fellow Members and CommissionerÂ Byrne also pointed out, adoption of this directive and tomorrowâs report is of the utmost importance both for the development of the internal market and for consumer protection.
I will conclude by thanking all my fellow Members who sought to improve this document and find a solution with their contributions.
In particular, I would like to thank MrsÂ Paciotti, who deputised for me for a time when I was absent owing to ill health, and did an outstanding job on my behalf.
Â Â  . Mr President, to speak for only one minute on a report which we have been concerned with for such a long time will be difficult.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your proposal; it provides a basis to work on.
Happily, this Parliament will separate after working on that basis.
You know that we support the ambitious concept with which you began, that of total harmonisation, but we can see how difficult it will be to push through.
Perhaps we should do more work around that concept, in order to achieve real consumer protection, which is what we are interested in.
As for the clarity and efficacy of this text, it seems to us that what Parliament is actually proposing on the subject of harmonised rates is a useful path to follow.
We retain only one rate, the overall effective annual rate.
That will make things much simpler for everybody.
Let us bear in mind, however, that consumer goods are goods for which credit is a particular kind of credit, inasmuch as, as soon as that credit is contracted, the goods are no longer the subject of credit but rather, in a way, of a debt, since the goods lose their value as soon as they are purchased.
There are two points to which my attention has been drawn in particular, Commissioner, and, of course, these concern the scope of this directive.
As you are aware, practices and conventions vary within the European Union, so that between mortgage credits, between personal loans, and between credits allocated there are very different balances from one Member State to another, and we have to face up to the reality of the mechanisms and risks of dumping which exist as a result of different national practices.
Clearly, if you remove mortgage credits from this directive and move them to another directive you will be opening up the field to the banks, which will take advantage of mortgage credits to attack other consumer credit markets.
I do not think that that is the objective sought by this directive which should, first and foremost, protect all forms of consumer credit.
Â Â  . Mr President, strengthening consumer confidence is indeed essential to the development of the internal market, as you, Commissioner, have pointed out.
Yet that confidence is based on consumersâ ability to conclude, without incurring any legal or economic risk, all kinds of commercial transactions, in particular by means of new electronic trading procedures.
The systems for preventing and penalising infringements of consumer laws currently in force in Member States generally function in the context of national markets, but are unsuitable for use at Community level.
This deficiency obviously works to the advantage of unscrupulous operators, to the detriment of consumers and honest traders.
We can, therefore, only welcome the Commissionâs initiative, which consists in setting up a network of authorities which are able to cooperate with one another in order to rid the internal market of dubious practices, although I, for one, would have preferred us to opt for a network that would be completely public in nature, along the lines of the committeeâs original proposal.
Bearing in mind the need to take into account the diversity of Community practices and the urgent need to make this instrument available, however, I believe it is reasonable to adopt the compromise which has been achieved, in particular thanks to the work of our rapporteur.
I would therefore like to express the hope that a real spirit of mutual assistance will prevail in the cooperation between Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to say how pleased we are that Mrs Ghilardotti has recovered and is with us today.
This is a debate about people and our concerns for them.
I would like to say, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, that we very much support what the rapporteur has said on unfair commercial practices, that is, that the principle of the vulnerable consumer must be accepted and recognised, that we must take into account disparities between national protection rules, that we must insist on a double legal basis and that the principle of optimum harmonisation should hold good for all three directives.
In my remaining seconds I would just say that I am very grateful indeed to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, on the issue of enforcement for accepting that each state should be allowed to decide how the regulation should be implemented by the public authorities, but according to Amendment No 76 it will be implemented by public authorities in alliance with, but not supplanted by, other public interests and by NGOs.
This is a good day for consumers and, despite the rather stunted debate we have had, we should shout that fact from the rooftops.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that we can complete this part-session with a debate on three important consumer matters is not only symbolic; it also provides us with the opportunity of re-emphasising our genuine desire to reinforce the human character of the internal market, and it also affords us the opportunity of clarifying that the internal market is also there for the consumer and that we want to, and must, boost consumer confidence.

As far as the framework directive is concerned, our groupâs guiding principle is that a high level of consumer protection is a prerequisite for the actual application of the principle of mutual recognition.
We accept the restriction of the scope in respect of the industry-consumer relation.
However, in order to clarify the connection between this framework directive and the competition-related aspects to everyone, we would still like to table amendments.
To our group, the average consumer remains the point of reference.
We accept that further amendments will be tabled, but these amendments may not go so far as to fundamentally depart from the option.
In addition, we remain adamant that it should explicitly be stated that the black lists of aggressive and misleading trade practices are exhaustive in character and that the directiveâs harmonisation objective may not be undermined.
If the black lists are amended, we believe this should be done by way of the codecision procedure.
We also remain convinced that a double legal basis for the framework directive is not justified, not necessary and surplus to requirements.
We will therefore follow the legal recommendation of our Legal Service and endorse the reasons that we have previously clarified in the various committees.
During this part-session, as in past ones, we have enacted much fine legislation on consumer protection, and it has only been thanks to Commission proposals that we have been able to do this.
I would therefore echo everyone who wants to thank the Commissioner today for the proposal we have received, for without the Commission proposals we would not have been able to do the work.
It is, of course, the case that, no matter how many fine laws we enact, legislation depends entirely on their effective implementation and enforcement.
That is why I am a great fan of the Commission proposal to develop a network of administrative bodies that are responsible for the application of all those fine consumer directives.
I very much welcome this Commission proposal.
I hope that the Members of this House will reconsider the amendments, because I know that there are people in our group who would very much regret it if we were to end up with a regulation that is all too bureaucratic and involving a great deal of red tape.
We would regard that as indefensible.
We should therefore ensure that we get a maximum number of votes to approve the proposal for a network.
We should ask the Council to reconsider the matter.
After all, it should not always be the case that we adapt to the Councilâs position.
We agree on a great many points.
We should, for once, ask the Council to adapt to Parliament and respect democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, Mrs McCarthy and I have tabled a total of 25 amendments to the proposal for a Directive on consumer credit, for which Mr Wuermeling is rapporteur.

As we know, there was an initial stage of indecision, during which the rapporteur thought that the directive was being modified in committee, which led this proposed directive being referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but, fortunately, we managed to resolve the issue and finally the rapporteur decided, in agreement with us, to present it once again with a series of amendments.
Our problem is lack of time.
This term of office is coming to an end.
During this term of office, Parliament has not been able to complete its examination of the proposed directive and we are limited to a first reading so that the next Parliament may have the opportunity to examine it in depth.
Our concern is naturally not to kill off consumer credit â which, for better or for worse, has become an essential part of our lives â and also to provide a guarantee that credit will not end up being a noose around the consumerâs neck.
Our amendments are of a different nature.
Some, for example, relate to the legal basis.
We believe it is important to introduce Article 153 as an additional legal basis in the field of consumer protection and, furthermore, we also believe it is important to point out certain elements in the definitions.
In the definitions and above all in the adherence to certain basic principles, such as, for example, the APR â Annual Percentage Rate â which is a concept we have developed here, and we must prevent it from being replaced by other criteria which are much more difficult to understand.
In conclusion, we hope that tomorrow's vote may lead to a directive which is clearer to the consumer and that on this basis the next Parliament can definitively approve this directive which is so important for all the European Union's consumers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioners, I should first like to mention the proposal on cooperation between consumer authorities, which is extremely welcome, and I think that the rapporteur has done an exceedingly good job.
It is both astonishing and depressing how much energy some Members have put into attempts to water this proposal down.
I cannot conceive of a situation in which everyone but the consumer has rights in the internal market.
That has been truly depressing, but I welcome this proposal, and hope that a large majority in Parliament will support the compromise proposal drawn up by MrsÂ Gebhardt.
On the subject of MrÂ Wuermelingâs report on credit for consumers, I must say that I welcome the fact that we are having the debate today and that we have managed to make a good deal of progress.
As previous speakers have said, improvements are needed, however, because otherwise there is a risk of the directives diluting the rights that consumers already have.
Earlier on, a speaker mentioned the actual annual percentage rate of charge, and in this case, too, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and I should like to see a broader definition.
The right to earlier repayment must also be improved.
I do not think that the rapporteurâs compromise proposal goes far enough in this respect.
As I often do in these debates, I should just like to mention the right to number portability in the telecommunications sector, which has given consumers important rights.
In my home country, costs have fallen by 7% over the past year, and I think that the right to repayment has been a significant contributory factor.
I also think that better information on credit cards is needed, and that the exclusions in some amendments are not really desirable.
Finally, in my opinion, joint and several liability is really needed in order to develop the internal market and afford consumers protection when new products are placed on the market.
I should also like to mention here something that happened in my home country.
A new low-cost company went bankrupt, and only those consumers who had paid by credit card had any kind of protection.
This also goes to show that this aspect is necessary for consumers when markets are developed.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to start from a local perspective.
Last Friday I visited Blantyre in my constituency to talk to an alliance of Credit Unions in that part of Scotland.
As the Commissioner will know very well, Credit Unions in some parts of the Union provide cheap and affordable types of safe credit to consumers through voluntary organisations carrying out voluntary effort in a non-profit way.
They were very concerned early on in the process that they may be caught in some of the technicality of this directive.
I am extremely grateful to Mr Wuermeling for the way in which, in Amendments Nos 4 and 62, he has sought to create an exemption for that kind of activity.
It is really very important and my constituents were very grateful to learn just how much had been done in that respect.
While there may be still issues among us about the exact balance between the consumer and the lender contained in the Wuermeling report, we are all agreed that it is vitally important to make safe the internal market so that there can be much wider trade, but not at the cost of unfairness to consumers.
I congratulate him genuinely on the work he has done.
While we will be supporting some amendments against him tomorrow, it will not be at the cost of backing the general project.
The same goes for Mrs Gebhardt's proposal.
We are talking about consumer rights.
No rights without remedies is a good old slogan and I think that the point of the new regulation of which the Commissioner and Mrs Gebhardt have spoken is very much to secure that there are adequate and forceful remedies for rights that we all support.
Likewise, if I may say to Mrs Ghilardotti, the idea that we should begin to develop a jurist prudence of fair-trading in the European Union is a grand one.
This will be done, of course, in a negative sense by generating a general duty not to trade unfairly.
I congratulate MrsÂ Ghilardotti for all the work she has done.
There may be one or two points of disagreement in the vote tomorrow, but the point is that we are all piloting the boat in the same direction.
Â Â  Mr President, for more than one and a half years, this Parliament has been working on the Commission proposal for the harmonisation of provisions on consumer credit.
That is, in our view, far too long, not least because the positions of the advisory committee were largely determined as early as before the summer of 2003.
It very much looks as if the European Commission, which proposes maximum harmonisation, has wrongly evaluated the political feasibility of this.
My group, on the other hand, endorses minimum harmonisation of consumer credit provisions, so that the acquired rights in the Member States remain in place.
One of the acquired rights in my country, the Netherlands, is that consumers are allowed to run up a short-term debt with a bank on their current account without any extensive contracts.
We call this being âin the redâ.
It is being proposed, with good reason, to delete paragraph 2c of Article 3 by means of Amendment No 52.
I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether he will be adopting this amendment.
Can existing practice of current-account credit remain in place under the new directive without any extra administrative steps?
Secondly, I should like to draw attention to the Commission proposal on unfair trade practices.
Article 4 of this proposal states that traders need only meet the requirements that apply in their home countries.
Consumers will find that incomprehensible; they want the protection that they enjoy in their own countries.
This article constitutes a huge stumbling block in terms of effective consumer protection.
Traders simply need to comply with the requirements applicable in the country where they introduce their products onto the market.
Our group has for that reason tabled Amendment No 95 to address this problem.
I hope that this will meet with approval from the House.
I should like to hear from the Commissioner here whether this amendment could also be adopted.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that this directive is necessary.
If one thing is clear it is that Directive 87/102/EEC no longer reflects the situation in the credit market.
We could say that all we Europeans are currently plagued by debt.
We therefore need a directive which prevents the impression being given, when consumers are offered credit, that we never have to return the money, for two reasons which I believe to be fundamental: firstly, in order to harmonise the conditions in which consumer credit is offered and, above all â and this, incidentally, is a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists â in order to guarantee consumers a high level of protection.
I regret that I do not have sufficient time to comment to the Commissioner on the amendments we consider essential in order to fulfil these two objectives at least.
I do hope, however, that some of my fellow Members can do so, because consumers must be protected in an age when it appears that credit is never going to be repaid.
We citizens do have to repay what we owe, but our debts are more than we can afford.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, consumer protection is an important objective and we need to prevent dishonest traders benefiting from the internal market in order to mislead citizens by offering them defective goods.
Moreover, dishonest traders take advantage of the new technologies provided by the information society, thereby undermining consumer confidence in -commerce.
These problems do not only closely concern consumers, but also businesses and the economy as a whole.
In order to protect consumers, therefore, we have to establish a body of clear, effective rules and also strengthen cooperation between national consumer protection authorities, by promoting information exchange and providing for the possibility for authorities approached by consumers to request the assistance of an authority from another country.
It is precisely this second, important objective which the proposal for a regulation being discussed and voted on by Parliament this week seeks to secure.
Current national systems are not capable of preventing and suppressing cross-border exploitation and existing informal networks face obstacles of a legal nature regarding, in particular, difficulties relating to the flow of information from one authority to another and even the lack of public consumer protection authorities in certain Member States.
Moreover, the regulation lays down precisely the Member Statesâ obligation to designate a public consumer protection authority, which will be part of a European network.
The authority of one Member State may request help from other members of the network in order to investigate possible infringements, to receive information and thereby to end exploitation by dishonest traders.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has provided some further guarantees in the proposal for a regulation, in order to avoid possible abuse of power by the national authorities, to protect confidential information held by businesses which is not strictly necessary to the investigation and to ensure that the requests for cooperation are reasonably justified and do not pointlessly impede traders.
The proposal for a regulation, moreover, provides for procedures which are at times a little cumbersome and onerous for consumers and the public administrations, and risk making the costs far higher than the loss or damage suffered by consumers.
This is why we oppose certain provisions laid down by the Council and the Commission which would greatly complicate the system, and if we have to adopt the regulation at its reading before enlargement, we shall ensure that it is reviewed, on the basis of experience gained, five years following its entry into force.
Â Â  Mr President, research carried out in the UK on consumer credit awareness has demonstrated very clearly that consumers need clear, consistent information to be able to make informed comparisons of the products on offer.
It is true that, owing to innovation and evolution, many of today's products offer the consumer more choice and flexibility, but many are difficult for consumers to understand: 56% of consumers in the UK did not understand the terms used in credit agreements, 77% find the language in advertising confusing and while 68% are aware that lenders do not calculate APR in the same way, they do not know how the system works and find it difficult to price one loan against another, which makes it difficult for them to shop around for the best deals.
More importantly, it also means that credit providers are under less pressure to keep their prices and offers competitive.
If this is the case in just one Member State, imagine what the situation is like across 25.
This is why the directive must provide maximum levels of consumer protection as regards advertising, information and rules on the calculation of APR and a high level of consumer protection and redress.
I would like to pinpoint two areas that the Commission should look at more seriously.
Firstly, joint and several liability.
In the UK, Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act provides for remedies and redress.
I understand what the Commissioner is saying: Member States can go further.
However, I do not want this directive to be used as an excuse for credit providers to opt out of the very high consumer protection that is already offered in other Member States.
Cooperatives and credit unions were also mentioned.
I am delighted that the rapporteur has taken on board the amendment drafted by Mr Crowley and myself.
It is true that credit unions provide a very important service in that they not only offer affordable loans, but also help the poorer elements of the community â the deprived and people on low income â to stay out of the clutches of loan sharks.
I fear that if the regulations proposed in this directive were to be applied those consumers in poorer areas would end up with no credit unions and no option but to turn to loan sharks.
The PSE voting list tomorrow will reflect our desire not only to see the opening-up of a consumer credit market in this area but also to achieve the highest possible level of consumer protection for consumers right across Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, it seems to me that this joint debate tonight is perhaps a fitting finale to the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in this mandate.
At the beginning of the mandate we also thought that with the advent of the euro and e-commerce these would deliver a double boost to Europe's economy and the internal market.
Sadly the realities have perhaps been more disappointing, particularly with regard to the participation of consumers in cross-border transactions.
There was an interesting report from the European Consumer Centres who are very much at the sharp end. This report was delivered on European Consumer Day this year.
Of 114 cross-border transactions only 75 actually resulted in a delivery.
There were problems with payment and problems with refunds.
This is hardly the safe, well-functioning market that we had in mind to create, nor have we got the level of confidence that we really need.
It seems that in various complimentary ways these three measures will help to improve matters.
The unfair commercial practices legislation should create that high level of consumer protection across the board.
With the measures it contains by way of codes to help with alternative dispute resolution, combined with proper enforcement through the enforcement directive, perhaps we will get the access to justice across the market that there ought to be for consumers.
Lastly, with regard to consumer credit, there should be a provision to make sure that consumers are backed up by the credit provider: this provision exists in my own country and others.
This should be extended across Europe; one of our amendments to this effect was adopted in committee.
It is aspirational for the future to deliver the consumer confidence that we really need to make the market work.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the short time available, I want to speak only on the Gebhardt report.
I appreciate the efforts that the rapporteur and the Commission have made in their desire to do the right thing in terms of cross-border cooperation.
Although the usefulness of this is not a matter of doubt, I do wonder whether the proposal put before us by the Irish presidency really does represent an acceptable position and whether we might be creating a bureaucratic monster.
Firstly, I think it is quite wrong that we should now, for the first time in the history of the European Unionâs lawmaking, be seeking to interfere in the Member Statesâ right to organise the way in which they, within their own borders, transpose regulations and directives.
In this instance, we prescribe that Member States may not transfer certain functions to private bodies, but that these functions must be performed by the authorities, and so that is precisely what we are doing â tampering with matters that are for the Member States to organise â which may well mean that the whole Regulation contravenes the Treaty.
My second worry is about the bureaucratic monstrosity of decision-making in the event of dispute.
This I can describe only as real-life satire.
The situation is that the Member State delegating the function has to consent to the Member State that accepts it entrusting the performance of the tasks to a private body.
If neither that, nor the re-examination of the criteria by mutual agreement, is possible, a comitology procedure is set in motion, in which the decision rests with the Commission, so people travel to Brussels from 25 national capitals in order to decide whether or not the matter can, under the directive or a regulation, be referred to private bodies.
I see that is quite disproportionate to the matter in hand.
We should respect the Member Statesâ exercise of their powers and acknowledge the efficient way in which they perform their functions.
I therefore propose that we should stick to what was decided by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The Council will do likewise when it has come to its senses.
Earlier on, Mrs Thyssen pointed out that we have no reason to give way on this; it is the Council that must give way to us, and then this can be adopted quickly, in one reading, but on the basis of the motion for a resolution produced by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rather than on the compromise proposed by the Irish presidency.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, my point concerns the Wuermeling report, the consumer credit directive.
I would like to expressly thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and the good cooperation between the committees.
He had a hard task because the Commissionâs draft was, to put it mildly, a bad one.
The Commissionâs proposal starts from false assumptions.
It plays the interests of consumers against those of the banks and in many cases it actually incites the one against the other, despite the fact that Europe needs more cooperation not recrimination, more seriousness instead of populist superficiality.
We say a clear yes to consumer protection, yes to greater transparency, yes to reciprocal information, yes to lower and upper limits for the applicability of the directive.
We say a clear no to more red tape for retail loans, no to making retail loans more expensive and no to the inclusion of overdrafts in this directive.
I hope that the draft Parliament has produced, based on the rapporteurâs proposals, does justice to the real intentions of this directive, which are to improve consumer protection while cutting bureaucracy, to provide greater transparency and to make for greater trust and mutual consideration, and that it will thereby promote consumer interests and cross-border borrowing.
I ask you all to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by Parliament and the rapporteur, because that is the only way to increase cooperation rather than conflict.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to restrict my remarks to Mr Wuermeling's report on consumer credit.
This is his second attempt to reach a compromise on the Consumer Credit Directive, Parliament having opposed many aspects of the proposed directive and referred it back to committee in November 2003.
This directive aims to harmonise laws, regulations and administrative procedures of the Member States concerning agreements covering credit granted to consumers and surety agreements entered into by consumers.
Having expressed my opposition to many aspects previously, I will be happy to support MrÂ Wuermeling's report provided the amendments on so-called 'responsible lending', the compulsory use of credit reference databases and the exemption for mortgages are all adopted, and provided the so-called credit union amendments, 4 and 61, are supported by this House.
The Credit Union movement in Ireland and the UK is unique.
Most financial institutions that lend money are in business to maximise profits.
Credit unions are different as they are owned and run by their members.
Each member on their boards and principal committees is a volunteer â there are 15Â 000 of them in my own country â as are the majority of their staff, except in the larger credit unions which have up to 2000 paid employees.
They are restricted from operating outside their local geographic area and provide mainly small amounts of credit for low-income members and for those in financial difficulty.
Through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service known as MABS in Ireland, they provide access to credit for individuals who are often seriously in debt and otherwise prey to illegal money lenders providing loans at impossibly high interest rates.
In my country, where we have less than four million inhabitants, there are 2.5 million members of credit unions with savings in excess of EUR 9 billion.
37% of loans issued by the credit unions are for EUR 750 or less.
The average loan is EUR 7000.
A total of EUR 5Â billion is out on loans at the moment.
Effective leadership for all our credit unions on the island of Ireland is provided by the Irish League of Credit Unions.
In conclusion, harmonisation is needed and welcomed to the extent that it respects the different range of financial products and the cultural differences in financial services in each Member State.
We need a balance here in protecting the consumer from the lender and the lender from the consumer.
Â Â  Mr President, as a number of colleagues have said as regards consumer credit, good regulation will stimulate the market, encourage consumer confidence and stimulate innovation and development across the single market.
The Commission's original proposal failed to do almost all these things, and MrÂ Wuermeling's report, which we warmly welcome, is a significant step in the right direction and a substantial improvement.
However, as a number of colleagues have said, consumer rights have to have proper enforcement mechanisms.
The other two proposals being discussed tonight have that link in common.
We warmly welcome Mrs Gebhardt's to achieve a compromise, which we will support because it is very important.
We have also made substantial progress in developing a workable proposal on the issue of unfair commercial practices, where enforcement is the key.
There is no point in having new rights for consumers unless they can be enforced.
Companies need to know where they stand in relation to their national legislation and they also need to be encouraged to adopt best practice through codes of conduct.
We have moved substantially in that direction.
The important proposal of mutual recognition is also absolutely essential to making everything work successfully.
In conclusion, this package is good for consumers and the internal market, and we will strongly support all three proposals.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank you for your valuable interventions on these three issues.
I know that there is much common ground between Parliament and the Commission.
Allow me to respond to some of the points that have been made during the course of the debate and to indicate the Commission's position on the key amendments.
Firstly, enforcement cooperation.
On this regulation the Commission can accept all the amendments tabled in the plenary by the rapporteur as they reflect the compromise reached with the Council towards a first reading adoption of the regulation.
Amendments that are not part of the compromise package are not supported by the Commission.
Prolonging discussions beyond the compromise reached with the Council will not bring material improvements to our capacity to better enforce consumer protection rules.
It would, however, provide rogue traders with more time to exploit the absence of effective cooperation between the enforcement authorities in the Member States.
The compromise represents a reasonable balance between the enforcement traditions of the Member States.
The most important question in these discussions has been the public nature of the network proposed.
The thinking behind the Commission's proposal was that only public authorities can deliver adequate guarantees on effectiveness and confidentiality.
In a minority of Member States effective enforcement is fulfilled by financing private consumer organisations to take action on behalf of the public interest.
Amendment No 76 successfully reconciles both traditions.
Those Member States with a strong tradition of private consumer bodies would be able to delegate a fair number of cross-border cases to them.
In the cases which involve confidential information or which require significant investigation, in other words the most serious rogues, a public authority will be lacking.
The reference to comitology was inserted at the request of those MEPs who support delegation by Member States.
For a Member State prevented by another Member State from delegating to a private body, it provides a useful opportunity to air grievances.
Amendment No 29, removing 8(2)(b) and 8(2)(c), will be completely unacceptable to Council and the Commission. Both have argued that 8(2) is a package and cannot be touched.
I therefore commend that particular approach to the House.
I am happy to be debating the Consumer Credit Directive here today.
It is now a little over 19 months since the Commission sent this proposal to Parliament, just a few weeks less than the gestation period of the elephant, and I suppose it is not surprising therefore that we have this weighty tome from the rapporteur.
I am sure the rapporteur will understand if I do not accept all of his amendments, although I am trying to adopt a compromise approach to his position and to his report.
Many of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and discussed today can be accepted by the Commission.
Some can be accepted partially or with limited changes.
I also note that more than 200 amendments were tabled for this plenary sitting which, together with the comments from the various speakers, demonstrates that opinions are very divided.
This reflects the divide in approach to consumer credit throughout the European Union.
I am nevertheless heartened by the fact that on the two principal objectives, namely ensuring a high level of protection and the creation of a genuine single market for consumer credit, there is a broad consensus.
Given the number of technical issues that have been raised, it would lead me too far astray to comment on all of them.
I will therefore focus on some of the main issues.
I wish to reiterate that full harmonisation will not lead to a reduction in the level of consumer protection.
Full harmonisation will apply to the areas for which the directive provides for such harmonisation, namely those areas most relevant to the operation of the single market.
The Commission is willing to consider excluding areas from the scope of the proposal that would not affect the single market.
For these areas, Member States can maintain their national provisions.
Credit intermediaries should only be submitted to national supervision. Registration requirements would no longer be foreseen.
Provisions already covered by existing legislation can in general be deleted; for instance, provisions on door-step selling.
The same applies to matters covered by national civil law, such as the provisions on repossession and sanctions.
However, as I said before, this directive also aims at guaranteeing a high level of protection for consumers in the area of credit.
I cannot, therefore, accept amendments that would lead to a reduction in the level of consumer protection.
Regarding small loans or overdrafts, it is possible to submit credit unions to a lighter regime principally based on the provision of information.
I am always interested to hear Sir Neil MacCormick tell the stories of his constituents and his recent experience in his constituency.
I am sure he would be happy to hear that I have been invited to my own home town of Monasterevin in County Kildare, a small country town, to open a credit union within the next couple of weeks, where I will be emphasising these points.
On mortgages, the Commission recognises that there are a number of important practical and legal problems, principally related to the fact that such loans are secured by a mortgage on immovable property.
We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that increasingly consumer spending and consumer credit arrangements are financed through loans secured by a mortgage on immovable property through so-called equity release mechanisms.
The legal issues surrounding such contracts are indeed complicated, but the risks associated with consumers putting up their family home as collateral for consumer spending merit the attention of regulators and consumer protection provisions are warranted.
Questions surrounding mortgage-backed credit are being discussed in the forum group on mortgage credit which is due to present a preliminary report in June 2004.
The Commission will also take account of the discussions of this group in formulating its revised proposal.
In this respect I also wish to note that the Commission is ready to accept the ceiling proposed.
Credits for amounts above this ceiling would fall outside the scope of the directive.
Typically, credits for such amounts typically are secured by a mortgage.
Concerns have been expressed about the fact that the Commission's proposed regime on joint and several liability will lead to a significant reduction of protection in a number of Member States.
The Commission confirms that this is not the intention and believes the directive should not undermine the relevant national regimes.
Regarding the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices, I am pleased to say that the Commission can accept many of the amendments proposed in MrsÂ Ghilardotti's report, subject to minor changes in some cases.
I will therefore focus on the areas where the main difficulties arise.
Under the proposal any practice which is misleading or aggressive automatically meets the criteria for unfair practice under the general prohibition.
The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 32 because this would require the tests of the general prohibition to be reapplied to misleading or aggressive practices.
This would reduce legal certainty.
Amendment No 58 is also not acceptable because it will break the connection between the Article on aggressive practices and the tests in the general prohibition.
The Commission is prepared to adjust the specification of the benchmark consumer which would be used to assess the impact of commercial practices.
Following our consultation we have taken a measured approach to the disclosure of information.
The proposal focuses on the essential information which, if not given to consumers, or apparent from the context, is likely to mislead.
While some of the proposed adjustments are acceptable, others would upset this balance either by removing key information or by adding extra requirements which would impose costs without bringing any real benefits to consumers.
Amendments Nos 46 and 49 to 57 are therefore not acceptable.
The measures in the Annex have been selected because they are not in all circumstances unfair and so can be prohibited up front.
But they are arrived at by applying the tests of the general clause and must fall within the scope of the proposal.
I am also against the idea of a double legal base which some people have proposed.
I know that some speakers hope for the inclusion of Article 153.
However ArticleÂ 153(1), makes a cross-reference to Article 95, which is the legal base for this piece of legislation, and Article 153(4) refers to legislation which can only be used in areas where you have minimum harmonisation.
That is not our ambition.
I therefore urge Parliament to follow the draft and to follow the advice of Parliament's Legal Service which, I understand, is of the same view as me.
In conclusion, I only referred to a number of specific amendments or themes.
A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments on the three reports discussed in this joint debate is being made available to Parliament's secretariat and I trust this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for the joint debate.(1)
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0260/2004) by Mr Robert William Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on maximum residue levels of pesticides in products of plant and animal origin (COM(2003) 117 â C5-0108/2003 â 2003/0052(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President,I am very happy to have the opportunity to discuss this proposal with you and I would like to thank the rapporteurs â Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Sturdy in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy â for the time and effort they have put into forging agreements on the text.
This proposal concerns the setting of MRLs: maximum residue levels for pesticides in food and feed.
It is a delicate subject, since I do not know of anybody who actively wishes to have pesticides residues in their food.
However, in modern agriculture they are an unavoidable by-product of agricultural production methods.
Our duty here is to set out a legal and administrative framework whereby consumers are protected from unacceptable levels of residues whilst at the same time permitting trade in agricultural commodities.
It is important to note that this legislation is not designed to regulate the use of pesticides and I do not wish to enter into discussions on the broader subject of pesticide use here today.
That is covered by Council Directive 91/414/EEC on the marketing and use of pesticides, on which the Commission will be bringing forward amendment proposals at the end of this year.
Let us look, rather, at the proposal before us.
This proposal has several objectives.
First, it aims to simplify.
It went through a SLIM exercise with stakeholders in 2000 and 2001, and it consolidates and replaces four existing directives and replaces them with a single regulation.
Second, it aims to achieve, at a stroke, harmonisation of MRLs across the Community.
We have been setting MRLs at Community level since 1976, and have still not even reached the halfway stage.
This means that for most substances and commodities, 15 and soon 25 different national sets of rules apply.
This is hardly compatible with the single market.
By introducing the possibility of temporary Community MRLs, we can harmonise everything in a short time, pending the outcomes of evaluations of active substances under Directive 91/414/EEC.
Third, we will introduce a role for the European Food Safety Authority in the risk assessment of MRLs.
Fourth, we will introduce clear and transparent procedures for all interested parties in the setting or modification of MRLs.
Fifth, by introducing the concept of a default 'zero tolerance' MRL, we propose a solution for residues of the 400 substances we have already taken off the market, of which we do not want to see any residues in food.
Some of these are unacceptable substances; many are substances which industry did not want to support in the 91/414/EEC evaluation programme and for which we have no information one way or the other.
Finally, we aim to strengthen provisions on monitoring and control measures.
These are the main objectives covered by the proposal, which I hope can enter into force by 2006, 30 years after our first efforts in this area, during which we have seen major changes in science, in trade, in politics and in consumer protection.
I commend this proposal to you as a major advance in consumer protection and I look forward to the forthcoming discussion.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commissioner has beaten me to it and said virtually everything I had planned to say.
He and I are very much in agreement on this matter.
Before I start, I wish to add to what the Commissioner said about the Food Safety Authority, which is of fundamental importance.
It is a plea to this Parliament and to the Commission and everyone concerned that there should be sufficient funding to ensure that the Food Safety Authority can do its job.
The committee felt very strongly about that.
I fully welcome the proposals on harmonisation of maximum residue levels in foodstuffs throughout the European Union.
For too long there have been variations from country to country.
As the Commissioner said, it is very important that a product consumed in one country should be just as safe in another country.
It is to this end that I have worked closely with the Commission and the Council.
I would also like to add my thanks to Mr El Khadraoui, the Socialist shadow rapporteur, because we managed to table a number of compromise amendments which, with his help and help from other Groups, have alleviated some of the problems, because there were a number of disagreements.
As I said, my aim was to produce something that would not only lead to safety, but would also be workable and sets workable standards.
As the Commissioner said, I have taken a lot from Directive 91/414/EEC, which covers plant protection products, and I wish to add to that.
I am sure that the committee will â as far as possible, as we resubmit amendments â feel that they are important for the functioning of this legislation.
I said that we are resubmitting some: we are not resubmitting all the amendments that failed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, because it was rather pointless.
I will now go through the amendments we are resubmitting so that colleagues will understand why we are resubmitting them.
Amendments Nos 74 to 78, which deal with temporary MRLs, bring the legislation more into line with Directive 91/414/EEC.
I feel certain that we have managed to do this in a way that does not compromise public health, because public health is the precise aim of this piece of legislation.
Amendment No 74 explains why temporary MRLs are needed.
Producers have four years from inclusion of full product dossiers for re-registration.
Amendment No 77 deals with the practicalities; the four-year procedure will be used only when Member States request it, and then it will depend upon them showing the necessary research on the product.
This amendment fell by three votes in committee, but, if Parliament were to adopt it, it would really add something to the legislation.
Regarding amendments resubmitted by colleagues, Amendment No 67, concerning the setting of MRLs, covers vulnerable groups.
We are all aware that vulnerable groups need protecting, but again existing legislation covers that and therefore there is little point in agreeing on that amendment, even though I am sure my colleagues will disagree with that.
At no time would Parliament ever take out legislation that supported that.
Amendment No 69 concerns integrated pest management.
There is no such thing as a set of standards on integrated pest management.
There are, however, different types of farming, and therefore it would be misleading to say that it favours non-chemical methods, because agriculture is agriculture.
No farmer â and I speak as a farmer â wants to use chemicals unnecessarily.
I would add one last point that is of particular importance.
One of the amendments tabled by MrÂ Lannoye concerns import tolerances.
This is of particular importance because my brain tells me that we should not accept this amendment.
My farmer's heart, however, tells me that we should, because it is a legal way of stopping imports into the European Union.
I shall use my common sense and recommend that we vote against Mr Lannoye's amendment.
My final point is addressed to the Commissioner: for those who have food, there are many problems; for those who do not, there is only one.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Sturdy for the good cooperation, which has enabled us to reach important compromises on a number of crucial points.
Much as I welcome harmonised, simpler and more uniform legislation in the field of pesticide residues, it would be even better if we could seize the opportunity to increase consumer protection.
Half of our fresh food contains pesticide residues, and there are increasingly more cases of various residues â up to 14 no less â in one product.
That is why, when MRLs are laid down, more account is taken of vulnerable groups by introducing additional safety factors and by introducing aggregated parameters for additives or synergetic effects.
In this connection, we have asked that MRLs be stipulated on the basis of best agricultural practices, particularly integrated agricultural methods involving the lowest possible dosage and spray frequencies.
Not only should MRLs be laid down in a different way, but also more and better residue research should be carried out.
Financial penalties when MRLs are exceeded should make their enforcement more effective.
Finally, I think that consumers are entitled to information about ingredients, and so they are entitled to know to how many pesticide residues they are exposed.
Measures of this kind contribute to healthier food of a higher quality for everyone.
Â Â  Mr President, I should also like to congratulate Mr Sturdy on his report.
We have made a good few improvements: we have stronger rules for residue and we have better definitions of good agricultural practices.
It was interesting to hear what the Commission said in relation to modern agriculture that these residues are an unavoidable factor.
However, looking at what has been proposed, we are saying that priority should be given to non-chemical crop management, which everybody should welcome.
With regard to aggregate MRLs, if, for example, there are two or three different pesticides, but they are all below the MRLs, the combination should say that they should not be on the market.
That is the same logic that we have been pushing for years in relation to drinking water.
We are glad to see that this has now been accepted.
There are lots of pesticides, but no proper analysis is available.
If there is no valid lab analysis and no detection methods available then the pesticides have to be taken off the market.
Authorisation must be withdrawn on these.
If new scientific evidence reveals a risk, the same should apply.
Some of the amendments we tabled in committee asked for zero tolerance for imported products.
These were rejected as the majority thought it was necessary to give specific MRLs for imported products that are not grown in the EU, such as tropical fruits.
We have tabled this amendment again.
I say to Mr Sturdy that the purpose of this amendment from Mr Lannoye is not about stopping imports but about protecting consumers.
With regard to the amendment asking for temporary MRLs to be set at the lowest level of those suggested, it was not voted on in committee because it was supposed to be included in the compromise.
We have tabled some amendments again.
We hope we can get support for them because they would improve the overall end result.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my appreciation for Mr Sturdy, for his work and for his willingness to compromise.
Permitted residue levels for crop protection products differ to a considerable degree from one Member State to another, and that is why it is a good idea to lay down maximum residue levels.
To us, however, the amendments to the text are essential indeed.
The Commission proposal focuses far too little on the protection of consumers and far too much on that of agricultural interests.
