I see this report as representing a good compromise on this difficult issue.
It is evident not least from the number of Members present in the House that this is a highly technical piece of legislation, but I believe it is one that will do a great deal for Europeâs competitiveness, both internal and external.
This is a sensitive area, and one that calls for watertight legislation.
There must, of course, be compromises; one that MrÂ Doorn mentioned has to do with rotation.
It is, in essence, right that external rotation should go; the Member States have an alternative to it.
Some of them can retain the external rotation that they had before.
My basic instinct is to say that the Member States should not be allowed to require external rotation, as I do not believe that it encourages competition.
As my speaking time is limited, I would like to concentrate on Commissioner McCreevyâs proposal for a study into the likely effects of limited liability on the auditing firmsâ internal market.
The introduction of limited liability would give Europe a definite advantage as a business location, and so I am glad that Commissioner McCreevy has agreed to this study, which needs to be completed soon, that is to say, by the end of 2006.
A whole array of solutions is available to those Member States that specify a limit on liability; there is, for example, proportional liability, upper limits or a combination of the two.
What this House wants from the Commission is for the Member States to be able to take their own decisions on liability, and for us in Europe to end up with rules that are harmonious rather than harmonised.
So, as Mr Doorn has said everything that needs to be said about comitology and I agree with him, I will thank you for your attention and express the hope that the directive gets through.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that the proposal on auditing is a good example of cooperation amongst the different groups in the European Parliament and between Parliament and the other institutions: the Council and the Commission.
The rapporteur has worked hard to involve us in the drawing up of the text and in his meetings with the Council and the Commission, so that this proposal may contribute to the homogenisation of European legislation in such an important field as auditing, which has caused so much concern amongst the public following the Enron and Parmalat scandals.
In any event, it will be a minimal framework, for the time being maintaining the competence of the States in areas where they have greater capacity, experience and proximity for the purposes of carrying out inspections.
Of the most controversial points in the European Commissionâs proposal, I would like to place the emphasis on the rotation of firms, auditors and partners, with a view to reducing the possibility of conflicts of interest between the auditors and the audited.
After much effort we have managed to open the way to the rotation of firms, and not just of partners, by allowing each State to adopt the rotation of auditing firms, that is to say, external rotation, as an alternative.
Amendments have been accepted in the field of independence.
I hope that they are shown to be useful in the future, since they guarantee the confidence that the markets require.
The proposal maintains the same responsibility for auditors as for other professionals.
I believe that equality of treatment and the security of citizens and clients should be guaranteed in this field.
Nevertheless, I will confess that I have doubts about the capacity of the new legislation to stimulate an increase in the number of large auditing companies, thereby preventing the problems relating to the oligopoly characterising the sector, to which the Commissioner has referred.
The Enron case put an end to Arthur Andersen and only four of the so-called big five were left.
A further scandal leading to a loss of confidence in another large auditing firm could be fatal, not just for the company affected, but also for the stability of the system.
From the outset, therefore, I have argued that it should not all be left to the auditing firms to control themselves and that we should support control by public authorities, since not only is the viability of a company at stake, but also the health of the financial system.
I would like once again to congratulate Mr Doorn.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Auditors Directive will help to restore the confidence in year-end results and the operation of the markets that has been shattered by various scandals over various years.
It might well give investors greater security â the security they once enjoyed â and make European businesses more competitive.
If one compares the main points from the opinion I drafted for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the final version that MrÂ Doorn, the rapporteur, presented us with after the troika negotiations, one sees that they overlap to a great degree, for example as regards rotation, the costs incurred by small and medium-sized businesses, and liability.
I welcome the proposal that the Commission should produce a study on the liability issue by the end of 2006, and I agree with what Mr Schwab had to say about this.
I would have liked to hear a more positive message in relation to two other important matters, those being the establishment of an audit committee and the provision of additional non-audit services.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gave an enthusiastic welcome to the requirement that audit committees be set up and endorsed the Commissionâs thinking.
Taken as a whole, Mr Doornâs report is a step in the right direction, and I am grateful to him for the work he has done as rapporteur.
The vote we are about to hold is crucial to the successful completion of the fast-track procedure, and so the markets will soon get the signal they have been eagerly awaiting.
I am also glad that Mr Doorn, in his report, addresses the issue of comitology, although I would expect the date for the sunset clause to be 1 January rather than 1 April 2008.
It strikes me, though, that it will be difficult to accept the proposed approach to implementing International Standards on Auditing, known as IAS or ISA.
Here, too, Parliament must hold fast to its right of callback.
Although Mrs Wallis, my groupâs shadow rapporteur on the lead Committee, recommends that we approve this report, I myself will be abstaining from voting by reason of the reservations I have already adduced.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of my speech is above all to emphasise, without rhetoric or clichÃ©s, the important work that MrÂ Doorn has done; moreover, as I said in committee and will repeat here, the work he has done is, in my opinion, intelligent, balanced and far-sighted.
I believe that the directive is really important, because the problem of market security exists, as the scandals that have come to light have highlighted even more.
For some time there has been a need for a directive like the one that we are putting forward, which is proving to be a success at first reading and establishes the balance that we have reached in Parliament.
There are new guarantees for savers, on whom, as with consumers, we must focus our main attention, since the financial relationship between banks, issues and savers remains a fundamental factor in maintaining a countryâs social stability.
I also thank the rapporteur for the intelligent solution put forward for the rotation of auditing firms.
My country is very much in favour of that solution and very pleased with it â I speak from my own experience, of course, but I believe other countries will have come to the same conclusion.
That is another point on which we must acknowledge the balance achieved by MrÂ Doorn and his colleagues.
The agreement on enforcement measures gives a measure of just how important Parliament can and must be in finding that tricky operational balance that the directive requires.
To conclude, I agree with all the positive assessments that have been made; I am very pleased to state in formal terms that the report has been worthwhile, and the rapporteur and I put it to this House.
Â Â  Mr President, when we first discussed the issue of corporate governance following the high-level group's report, it was in the context of Enron and the WorldCom scandals.
Experts from the EU accounting industry said that 'it could never happen in Europe', but then we had Parmalat, which had an audit committee â as did Enron â made up of eminent independent professors.
The problem was that they did not show any independence of mind in challenging culpable business partners and the executive board.
Prescriptive audit committees were never the answer under this proposal, which is more about changing audit culture and practice.
Thanks to the pragmatism of our rapporteur, Bert Doorn, and good cooperation with the Commission and Presidency, we now have a flexible EU instrument that will raise the quality and consistency of audits across Europe while also respecting the good domestic company law provisions already in place.
A principles-based threats and safeguards approach will lead to a much more effective and robust EU regime.
This will prove much better than the Sarbanes-Oxley rules-based system which may make it easier to lock someone up but does not improve the ethics, independence and public supervision of auditing structures.
It was sensible to remove the prescriptive obligation for mandatory audit committees and replace it with a proposal to assign those functions to a body that meets audit standards and objectives and can implement the requirements in a transparent way.
I also welcome compromises around the issue of audit partner rotation and the issue of non-audit work.
However, we have to deal with the issue of comitology.
The Commission and successive Presidencies, including the United Kingdom Presidency, have stepped up their efforts to achieve better regulation by improving the quality of EU laws and transposition and implementation.
Parliament has to be involved in this better regulation agenda and must have the right as co-legislator to ensure that the expert laws voted through this House can be scrutinised and monitored.
It also has a role in transposition and implementation.
I welcome the initiative by the Presidency and the offers to take forward the reform of the 1999 comitology procedures to ensure we can play a role in the better regulation and regulatory process, and I look forward to amendments to be put forward by Parliament being accepted in this area so that we can genuinely can play our role in the cooperation process.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of this matterâs relevance to the competitiveness of European industry, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has devoted a great deal of attention to it.
It is important particularly to those companies quoted on stock exchanges that ownership rights should be given the highest priority when the auditors are appointed.
It is here, in particular, that national sensitivities come into play.
There is also, of course, the question of costs to be considered.
These can be enormous, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses that seek a stock exchange quotation, take the necessary steps and endeavour to be as transparent as they are required to be, and so I urge that limited liability be discussed with the insurers, so that the auditors can act with the necessary responsibility.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, a series of recent scandals has dented the confidence of consumers and investors.
I could mention events concerning Enron or Parmalat, for example.
The magnitude of these scandals was alarming, and they involved various kinds of fraud.
The European Commissionâs initiative constitutes a welcome response to the situation.
The Commissionâs draft on statutory audits is the result of many years of preparation and incorporates recommendations made in 2000 and 2002.
This directive is to replace the 1984 eighth directive concerning statutory auditors, which only contains the principles of accreditation of auditors, but does not refer to the audit procedure, supervision or external quality control.
The new draft directive defines the duties of statutory auditors clearly and lays down certain ethical principles. The aim is to ensure the professionalism and independence of statutory auditors, which implies their honesty, professional competence, trustworthiness, professional secrecy and overall responsibility.
The Commissionâs proposal on the principle of rotation of firms and partners is yet another contentious issue to be added to the list of those that have given rise to strong opinions.
In general, the principle of rotation deserves support, as it ensures independence and encourages an objective assessment.
The negative aspects of rotation are additional costs, loss of knowâhow, and the consequent risk of errors.
Audit firms should be changed at least every seven years, and the break between contracts should last at least two years.
Every effort should be made to ensure healthy competition, reduce the risk of fraud and provide high quality services.
The procedures presented in the report seem to represent a balanced and sensible response to the need to guarantee both the quality of audits and the independence of auditors.
In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that we should be aiming to restore confidence to the market, and also to strengthen shareholdersâ rights, so as to make investments safer and European businesses more competitive.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contributions and for their great work in getting this very important Directive dealt with.
At the outset I probably should have declared that in my past life I was an auditor and I still pay an annual subscription to the Irish Institute of Chartered Accountants, even though, as I have said to many people, I would not like to be too reliant on any set of accounts I would now prepare for anybody.
I suppose I should have said that at the outset.
Mr Doorn and others raised the question of audit reliability and personally I take a great interest in this particular area.
I have urged my services to treat this issue with great urgency.
The study will be commissioned shortly so that we should be ready to put forward our findings before the end of 2006.
That is our intention and hopefully it will be possible to adhere to that timetable with some ease.
The question was also raised about audit committees.
Audit committees are often necessary to help auditors keep their backs straight against possible pressure from management.
The European Parliament and the Council support the view that as much leeway as possible should be left to the Member States of the EU to invent their own system for audit committees of listed companies as long as they perform all the functions listed in our Directive.
We have been flexible here to accommodate these concerns as far as possible.
Perhaps, as Mrs McCarthy said, you can have to best rules-based system in the world, or at least think you have the best rules-based system in the world, but it will never prevent a scandal or fraud if more than two people collude in trying to ensure that some fraudulent activity takes place; no matter whether or not we have a rules-based system â and remember, they had a rules-based system in the United States for some time and it did not prevent any of the scandals on that side of the Atlantic, and nor of course will an absolutely principles-based system either.
No auditing procedures in the world and no internal control mechanisms put in place will be able to 100% guarantee that fraud or financial wrongdoing will never take place.
However, it should, after the shortest possible period of time, allow people to find out exactly what is going on.
It is very important for business and for everybody that people have confidence in the auditing profession, confidence in the independence of auditors, in the type of standards that they adhere to and in the ethics of the profession.
I am afraid that I would have to accept, as an erstwhile member of that profession, that the scandals of recent years have undermined the public's confidence in the auditing and accounting profession.
I think that goes without saying and it is the job of the profession to make sure that confidence is restored and that the various changes that have been made, both within the profession and now by the European institutions, as well as what hopefully the Members States will do, will give people greater cause to believe that the standards of the auditing profession are as high as we can make them.
Again as I have said, the question of comitology was raised as it was in the previous debate, and I repeat that the proposal to suspend it after two years, except for Article 26, is acceptable to the Commission in this particular Directive.
I thank the Members for their detailed contributions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the protocol setting out the tuna fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on fishing off the Comoros for the period from 1Â January 2005 to 31Â December 2010 [COM(2005)0187 C6-0154/2005 2005/0092(CNS)] (A6-0260/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, before outlining the Commission's position on this dossier, let me first thank the Committee on Fisheries and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, for her excellent work carried out within the very tight deadlines.
I am happy to be able to present to you the draft proposal for the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the tuna fishing opportunities and financial contribution under the EEC-Comoros Agreement.
As the honourable Members know, the Community has a longstanding relation with the Comoros in the fisheries area.
The first fisheries agreement with the country dates back to 1988.
Although it is the smallest tuna agreement, it is of importance due to the strategic location of this fishery in the Indian Ocean as well as for the fishing possibilities obtained.
The new Protocol, which was initialled on 24Â November 2004, covers a 6-year period from 1Â January 2005 to 31Â December 2010.
The protocol grants fishing opportunities for 40Â tuna seiners and 17Â surface longliners and has a financial contribution of EUR 390Â 000 per year.
The agreement is one that is of mutual benefit to both parties and contains a number of new elements including the following. Firstly, an exclusivity clause, which prohibits the existence of private licences or other private arrangements outside the scope of the Agreement.
Secondly, a VMS requirement to reinforce checks on vessels operating in Comorian waters.
Thirdly, the social clause applicable to local seamen signed on by Community vessels.
Fourthly, rules on taking on board observers and, fifthly, adjustment of the share-out of the cost of the Agreement between the Community and shipowners from a ratio of EUR 75/25 per tonne to EUR 65/35 per tonne, which is already applied in other tuna agreements in the Pacific.
This increase of the shipowners' share of the cost will gradually be applied to all tuna agreements in the Community as was called for in the reform of the common fisheries policy.
I believe that these new elements introduced in dialogue with the Comoros authorities and according to the principles set out in the new Fisheries Partnership Agreements will ensure that the Comoros Agreement contributes to responsible and sustainable fisheries in the Comoros.
This work includes the establishment of annual and multi-annual objectives, the distribution of the part of the financial compensation â 60%, the aims to be attained and criteria and procedures in order to allow for an evaluation of the yearly results obtained in accordance with Article 7 of the Protocol.
Let me now turn to the amendments.
On Amendment 1, the Commission is of the opinion that this is not necessary, given that the procedure for the adoption of the new Framework Agreement â the Fisheries Partnership Agreement â will soon be launched.
On Amendments 2, 3 and 5, the Commission is entirely in agreement with their spirit.
However, the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information in line with both the current inter-institutional arrangements and in particular with the Framework Agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the Commission considers that these amendments are not necessary.
On Amendment 4, may I recall the basic Community provisions concerning the mandate of the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Community.
The Council has authorised the Commission to negotiate fisheries agreements and arrangements between the Community and the Comoros.
Against this background, the periodic renewal does not require a new mandate each time.
Amendment 6 cannot be accepted by the Commission.
The Commission has established a constant dialogue with the industry within the framework of a special sectoral group.
This group meets on a regular basis and discusses upcoming negotiations and any other technical issues.
In addition, experts from Member States are invited to be present during the negotiations of a fisheries agreement or protocol.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sure that this House, like the Committee on Fisheries, will support the signing of this Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and the Comoros, which follows on from previous protocols and which will enable 57 Community vessels to fish until 2010.
This agreement also represents a further step in the new model of association agreements intended to promote even greater cooperation and greater involvement in the development of the third countryâs fisheries sector.
Nevertheless, while we support the principles behind this model, we must insist that it is far from clear.
Firstly, it is the first one to reach Parliament in which, unilaterally and without any request from the third country, the Commission has decided to raise the sum paid by shipowners per tonne fished from EUR 25 to 35, that is to say by 40%, and without having consulted them.
The Commission defends itself by saying that the rise was anticipated in the conclusions of the 2004 Council of Ministers, but what we all deduced from those conclusions was that there would be a gradual increase in these payments, when in reality there has been a rather brutal rise by decree.
This Parliament, like the sector, finds itself faced with a policy, carried out by the Commissionâs negotiators quite independently, and without giving us the opportunity to examine those decisions more than fleetingly, and the protocol reaches our committee â increasingly late by the way â signed and sealed.
Our Institution does not believe that this situation of obscurantism should continue.
I therefore propose in my report that shipowners now be allowed to attend joint committees so that they can at least be informed in real time of what is being prepared for them.
As far as Parliament is concerned, I would like to take this opportunity to ask once again â and this time I am addressing the Council, which is not present â for a member of the Committee on Fisheries to be present in the negotiations as an observer.
We genuinely do not understand why it objects, since an observer cannot interfere in the decision-making, but if we were to be present, we would be better informed, which cannot do any harm, unless the negotiators have something to hide.
Equally serious, from a budgetary point of view this time, is the fact that, contrary to the Councilâs conclusions, some of these agreements, such as the one we are dealing with today, are not respecting the obligatory differentiation between what is paid in return for fishing opportunities and what is paid as development aid.
From the point of view of budgetary transparency, this situation is unacceptable.
Furthermore, the Commission is clearly aware of it and has admitted to the Committee on Fisheries that it is failing to comply with this obligation.
However, it is not giving the slightest indication of what has led it to do so, at least in this case.
Finally, Mr President, for the sake of the necessary simplification and following an admirable period of patience on the part of this Parliament, the time has come to demand that the Commission present its model for regional agreements and, in particular, the tuna type of agreement.
As we know, the tuna fleet is requesting fishing licences from each country of the area so that it can follow schools of tuna that cross the different fishing grounds.
This currently obliges it to take on a significant number of seamen from each of the countries, which turns each vessel into a miniature United Nations, sometimes causing insurmountable problems with languages, customs, traditions and also space, not to mention cost.
This is a totally absurd situation, as is the uncertainty over some of the more practical aspects, such as the actual definition of a tide or, for example, the mechanics of electronic transmissions.
It may be understandable that negotiators do not take account of these details, but if we put ourselves in the shoes of a skipper for a moment, we will realise that, at the end of the day, his main concerns are administrative and personnel issues rather than the fishing itself.
Mr President, while calling, naturally, for the approval of this agreement, which is essential to the European supply of tuna and to the fisheries sector of the Comoros, I would like account to be taken of the comments I have made here.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner Borg, I would just like to start by re-emphasising that fisheries policy, which is of course so important in the European Union, is a classic example of the need to reconcile economic interests and the needs of the environment.
The European Union has set itself the goal of protecting fish stocks and helping them to recover, while at the same time avoiding overfishing and promoting the economic interests of the fish industry.
If that is to be achieved, though, transparency is of the very essence, and it is with that in mind that the Committee on Budgets has tabled the two amendments to which I want to devote this speech.
This agreement is due to expire in 2010, and the crucial issue in relation to it is whether, as it is a new one, there really will be an ex-post evaluation and whether that evaluation will then be forwarded to this House in good time before new arrangements are made and a new Agreement negotiated.
This House is insistent that it be properly and punctually notified when the data of this ex-post evaluation are available, and so what I would like from you, Commissioner Borg, is a quite unambiguous undertaking that this House will indeed be so informed and will receive the data from any such ex-post evaluation within the proper deadlines.
By the same token, we are fed up with the situation in which proposals for agreements reach this House months after fishing has already commenced.
I also expect from you a clear statement as to whether you will change this practice and start notifying and informing this House in good time.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank both rapporteurs, whose report I have read with much interest.
Tuna is a much-loved, healthy fish, packed with the Omega 3 fish oil that is so important.
What is important is for the tuna species to survive fisheries so that future fishermen will be able to catch tuna and future consumers will be able to enjoy it.
The content of the fisheries agreements is of vital importance to European fisheries, the developing countries and particularly also to the fish.
Although, as a new member on the Committee on Fisheries, I missed the debates on the Comoros, I would nevertheless like to make two points.
The first one pertains to fair fish and real partnerships.
The agreement follows an arrangement that was very profitable for the European Union.
For every euro that was invested, the European Union earned EUR 5.7 back.
Unfortunately, the same could not be said about the Comoros, a poverty-stricken country.
I am therefore a little surprised at Mrs Fragaâs disapproval of the fishermenâs and the EUâs contributions increasing.
It was a very profitable arrangement, after all.
Only by striking real partnerships, rather than by unilateral financial benefit, can development cooperation, fisheries and scientific research become more cohesive.
I am right behind the Committee on Development when it says that it would like to spend fishery funds on local fishermen.
I would like to see more detailed specifications about local people being employed on the boats.
Secondly, with regard to sustainable fish, consumers must be given the opportunity of buying sustainable fish, sustainable tuna, certified by MSE or a similar body.
Sustainable fish is, above all else, fish that is not being over-fished.
For that purpose, we require certain data, and close monitoring and inspection must also be in place.
Article 7 of the Protocol stipulates that the EU should help ensure the future sustainability of tuna fishing.
I have a few questions.
Can the Commissioner assure me that âin futureâ means as soon as possible?
What action will you be taking in order to ensure in the short term that Indo-Pacific tuna is also sustainable tuna?
What capacities must the Government of the Comoros develop in order to be able to guarantee sustainable tuna fishing, and what support is the European Union offering in this respect?
Sustainable fish is also fish without the bycatch of threatened fish species.
Sharks, turtles and dolphins run the risk of being circled and caught.
Bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna are threatened species that are caught in the same nets.
Are you aware, Commissioner, of the quantities of bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna that are to be found in the Comoros region?
When will the results of the studies which the European Union has commissioned be published and what level of support is the European Union giving to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commissionâs Working Party on Bycatch?
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Comoros is a long way from here, and what we are doing there is happening secretly.
It does not reach the debate here at home.
If, however, the TV pictures from Comoros were to reach our living rooms, Parliament would never approve this agreement.
We buy up the fishing rights from the government, but those from whom we are really taking the fish, that is to say the fishermen in the villages, have no influence and seldom receive adequate compensation.
Neither national parliaments nor the European Parliament has any influence worth mentioning, but is presented with a .
Only ten months after the agreement has begun are we given a chance to express our opinion.
This Parliament has demanded change on many occasions.
It is time to take back democratic control over these agreements, which have more to do with old-fashioned colonialism than with modern trade and democracy.
I therefore welcome the proposal that more information be obtained.
I would thank the Commission for the increased co-funding from those who make use of the agreement, so that there is less of a burden on our taxpayers, but I regret the fact that the agreement is being extended to include several tonnes per year.
I believe that the partner countryâs small-scale fishing communities must be given the right of veto over the agreements.
My group will vote against this agreement, which favours EU fishermen at the expense of poorer colleagues in the South.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EUâs fisheries agreements with third countries have been exposed to extensive criticism by more than one organisation working on development issues, including Swedenâs Committee for International Development Cooperation (Sida).
The agreements have certainly been reformed, but criticism of the present partnership agreements is fully justified.
The Comoros has a strategic position and, according to the rapporteur, a fisheries agreement with this island republic would therefore supplement the EUâs present agreements with third countries.
It is, in other words, the EUâs narrow interests that are to be protected, rather than what might be thought of as the interests of the indigent Comoran fishermen.
The EU exploits its assumption of power in order to secure short-term economic interests.
The tuna fish agreement with the Comoros is not especially extensive, but the issue of fisheries agreements is important on principle.
It would be only right for the costs of the fisheries agreements to be imposed in full on those parties who choose to make use of them.
Why should European taxpayers pay for fisheries agreements that favour the fleets of just a few EU countries?
The rapporteur believes that shipowners pay too much for these agreements.
The June List believes that this should not be an issue for the EU and that the agreements should not be paid for at all using EU resources.
The UK Presidency and the Commission have stated that development issues in Africa are a policy area to be given priority.
There is, however, limited will seriously to reform the EUâs counterproductive agricultural, trade and fisheries policy.
The ambition seems to be to increase aid without doing anything about the structural problems that make it difficult for the developing countries to escape from poverty.
Â Â  Mr President, previous speakers have not even bothered to visit the countries with which we sign fisheries agreements; I have done so: I have been in the Comoros, I have lived amongst its people, I have seen how they live and I have seen the importance of this Agreement to the economic development of these islands.
I therefore believe that we should not be talking nonsense before knowing what we are talking about.
I entirely agree with the rapporteur on this issue.
I believe that this is an important Agreement for us and for the population of the Comoros and I therefore approve of its wording.
The Agreement helps to maintain the stability of the sector here and contributes to the development of those countries.
We have moved on from the first exclusively commercial agreements to agreements by means of which we are helping those countries to develop.
The current structure of the agreements assists the development of these countries.
We could probably do more if the fishermen and the shipowners were to participate more.
The Committee on Fisheriesâ proposals in this regard are reasonable and we fully support them; they would help us to avoid bureaucratic procedures.
We also need a general policy with regard to the whole of this area of the Indian Ocean, in which, although our presence in terms of seiners is significant, the general presence of the European Union is very small compared to the fishing of these resources by Asian countries such as Taiwan, Japan or the Republic of Korea, who are exploiting those resources at the expense of the population.
The European Unionâs volume of fishing is very moderate and I naturally agree with the rapporteurâs complaint that there is a kind of discrimination, by virtue of which, in the agreements with the south, it is the fishermen who have to pay, while in the case of the agreements with the north, this increase in payments that they now want to impose on us is not happening.
In any event, the Agreement is important for us and for the countries of this area and I would naturally like this approach to be taken with regard to other aspects.
There could perhaps be reasons for opposing it in view of the considerations I have expressed, but I believe that the European Union is obliged to continue developing this type of relationship.
These countries, and the Comoros in particular, desperately require our presence.
The Comoros are three small remote islands in the Indian Ocean, they are not really in any great strategic position, they are in the Mozambique Channel, their citizens suffer from every possible disease â dengue fever, malaria, yellow fever and others â and the great problem facing these islands is precisely the absence of the elements required for development.
I believe that the Fisheries Agreement is something that can and must help, provided that we involve our seamen and fishermen much more in the economic development of these islands, for their own benefit and also for the benefit of the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the speakers for their remarks.
I would like to comment on a number of points, beginning with the one raised by Mrs Fraga concerning licence fees.
The rebalancing of costs is not something which is new.
If one looks at the evolution of this since the mid-1980s, one finds that until the mid-1990s the share ratio was 80:20.
Then, from the mid 1990s up to the present day, the share ratio changed to 75:25.
We are introducing a new sharing of costs of 65:35.
I can say that the Commission's decision to increase the tuna fee paid by shipowners is justified in several respects, including the need to increase the financial responsibility of EC shipowners and guarantee a fair contribution for the coastal state.
As indicated in the Council's conclusions of July 2004, this contribution must be fair, balanced and non-discriminatory.
The 35:65 share is already applied in all the tuna agreements concluded in the Pacific, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Member States concerned did not object to this.
By the time of the renewal of the EC-Seychelles Protocol last September the Commission had already announced to the Council's external group that it intended to adopt the 35:65 ratio.
During negotiations, the Seychelles asked the Commission to delay this change in order to avoid distortion of competition with the Tanzania Agreement, which is soon to enter into force and under the initial phase of which the applicable ratio will still be 25:75.
The EC/Seychelles agreement therefore maintained the 25:75 ratio, but a formula was agreed under which the transition to the 35:65 ratio will take effect in the near future.
Harmonisation of the 35:65 ratio in other fisheries agreements will be introduced in 2006.
The same 35:65 ratio will be introduced in the other fisheries agreements in the area, those with Mauritius and Madagascar, which will be negotiated in 2006.
In addition, the Commission intends to hold a meeting with the tuna sector by the end of 2005, to discuss all relevant issues.
I also underline and repeat that there is constant dialogue with the sector, within the framework of the special sectoral group, and I will see to it that this dialogue is further intensified.
I will also see what can be done to minimise as far as possible the delays in making payments to third parties.
On the point raised by Mrs Corbey, may I point out that all agreements are undertaken further to an assessment of the health of fish stocks.
Let me cite the recent Morocco agreement, where the Commission showed how seriously it takes its obligations by first undertaking a scientific assessment, in accordance with the new policy for the fisheries partnership agreements.
The agreement was then targeted on what one may term 'the excess stock'.
In other words, the fish that can be caught sustainably, beyond what local fishermen can themselves catch.
So the agreement only covers that excess stock of fish within the limits of sustainability.
This policy is being adopted and applied to all fishery partnership agreements.
I thank Mr Schlyter for his support with regard to the rebalancing of the costs.
I also thank Mr Medina Ortega for his support with regard to the new partnership agreement on fisheries and I will see to it that everything is done to limit unnecessary red tape.
I would also like to thank him for the insights stemming from his direct experience of fisheries in the Comoros and the Indian Ocean.
In reply to Mrs Goudin, this agreement envisages a development segment under which the Union not only benefits from fishing rights but is obliged to assist in the fisheries sector of the Comoros.
This is a new element of the partnership agreements which is being introduced to all agreements with third countries.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by MrÂ Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (14203/2004 â C6-0200/2004 â 2000/0238(CNS)) (A6-0222/2005).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, you all know the position: the directive on asylum procedures has been the subject of negotiations in the Council for over four years; the outcome therefore reflects a fragile compromise among the Member States of the Union.
I have to be frank and say that it is a compromise that certainly does not rise to great heights of ambition.
I am well aware of the concerns expressed in the report, and in part I share them.
I therefore thank the rapporteur for the work he has done, even though the difficulties that we have encountered and the fact that the directive still does not aim very high are further good reasons â and I really mean no paradox in this â for Parliament to approve the report today and to make this complex procedure continue until the directive enters into force.
In my view, there are, first of all, excellent methodological reasons for adopting the report.
Indeed, if the directive enters into force, any subsequent proposal on this topic will have to go through the system of qualified majority voting, not unanimity any more, and it will have to go through the codecision procedure involving the Council and Parliament.
That means that, once the first stage is over with the approval of this directive, we shall have the prospect of Parliament having a codecision vote in the subsequent stages, which I consider to be about the substance.
I am hopeful that we will achieve this result as soon as possible, just as soon as we approve the directive.
Then there are reasons regarding future prospects.
Shifting the procedure from unanimity to qualified majority and from Parliament merely giving its opinion to codecision will allow us to achieve something that for me, perhaps, and I think for many others, is even more important: achieving a common European asylum system by 2010, involving not just the procedures any more, but the substance, the difference in concrete terms between European action and action just by the Member States.
Then there are other reasons, concerning content, which again justify your voting in favour.
The directive is certainly just a first step, but you will all recall the Tampere Council several years ago when it was actually decided that Europeâs asylum strategy would be a step-by-step strategy, that is to say the procedure and the substance would not be put into effect at the same time together, but would proceed in stages.
This is just a first step, I have to admit, but this first step will make a great difference, ladies and gentlemen.
Today, I think I can say that we have more than 20 different systems for the procedures themselves.
I will not say 25, but it is nearly that many.
A number of concerns remain, as expressed by this Parliament and by the Commission, and also by me personally and in public, about the need to harmonise the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.
With the directive, we shall have a common procedure and minimum standards across Europe and, most of all, I would say, we shall give the Court of Justice the power to apply and interpret them.
As you well know, the case law of the Court of Justice is often highly advanced in its interpretation.
We shall also then give the Commission the opportunity to enforce the common rules.
These opportunities do not exist today and, in my opinion, they will make a considerable difference.
If, on the other hand, we were to stop today, if this step-by-step approach were not to go ahead, some of us would certainly continue to call for the text to be improved.
I have to be frank, though: the Council is unlikely, highly unlikely, to reopen substantive talks after five years of negotiations.
As a result, should the Council not intervene, there will be demands and there will probably be growing concerns, but that European strategy on the subject â procedures today and substance and legislation on asylum tomorrow â will not get under way.
That is why, if we balance the advantages of a text that is not perfect against the serious dangers of a void in European legislation, which worries us even more, I strongly hope that this Parliament can adopt the report and issue a favourable opinion.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, what we are to vote on today is nothing less than one of the building blocks of the European Union.
The European Union arose from the ruins of the Second World War, and its success is founded upon the lessons that we have learned from the experience of global war, of National Socialism and the dictatorships of the last century, not least in Eastern Europe, all of which obliged many Europeans, in order to save their own lives, to leave their homes and seek refuge in foreign countries.
Today, people come to Europe seeking refuge from calamity and persecution.
None of them have left their homelands lightly, for in fleeing they often take their lives in their hands. Their dream of a life in safety often ends, though, in reception centres where conditions are sometimes appalling, and then they are sent back to an allegedly safe country, such as Libya, without their individual situations being assessed.
Are we trying to rid ourselves of every burden and responsibility as soon as possible?
I get the impression that we, in Fortress Europe, are less interested in protecting the refugees than in doing the opposite and protecting ourselves from them.
How, though, are we to discharge our historic responsibility if we do not give refugees an adequate opportunity to explain their reasons for coming here?
How are we to be credible in defending European values if we deny those seeking protection access to legal processes?
That there is the fear of asylum being abused is not a matter of doubt, but we must not allow that to induce us to betray our values.
What is needed are common European minimum standards for the treatment of refugees, founded upon the rule of law and upon international conventions and obligations under international law such as the Geneva Convention on Refugees.
The Council presented us with its proposal for this directive, for consultation purposes, only in November 2004, having already taken its decision.
One might call this âuncooperative cooperationâ, and it is something that we reject outright.
What the Council has now presented us with is also a long way removed from the objectives formulated at Tampere in 1999, and one consequence of that is that the majority of us in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the advisory committees have come to the conclusion that the directive falls short of all expectations in that it makes no significant progress towards harmonisation, in that there are too many instances in which the Member States are allowed to retain their own legal arrangements.
There are in particular a number of points that give great concern as regards respect for internationally-recognised human rights and the principles of the law as it applies to refugees, and so we have proposed a number of vitally important amendments.
For a start, we reject the concept, set out in Article 35a, of what are termed âsuper-safe third countriesâ, that is in itself an outstanding achievement in terms of global philosophy, favouring instead a modification of the concept of âsafe third countriesâ in Article 27, which, it is important to note, we want to be applicable only if the third state has ratified, and complies with, the Geneva Convention and other international human rights treaties, adhering in particular to the principle of non-refoulement provided for in the Geneva Convention on Refugees.
The person seeking asylum must have the opportunity to set out the reasons why his or her safety cannot be guaranteed in the âsafe third countryâ or in his or her safe country of origin.
Secondly, we want to reinforce the asylum seekerâs right to an effective legal remedy in accordance with ArticleÂ 38.
Thirdly, we call for the rights of children to be reinforced.
Following on from the statement in the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that every person under the age of 18 is to be regarded as a child, we have all â irrespective of our group allegiances â agreed that all relevant articles of the directive should be modified in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Fourthly, no asylum seeker should be arrested until such time as it is demonstrated that his or her incarceration is necessary, appropriate, and in line with the standards laid down in the international conventions.
Asylum seekers should be detained only in institutions that are clearly distinguishable from prisons, and must be guaranteed access to proper legal advice, to properly trained and unbiased interpreters and to qualified medical personnel.
Under no circumstances must unaccompanied children be interned as immigrants, nor must vulnerable persons such as victims of torture, traumatised persons, or persons with mental or physical handicaps, for whom the authorities should endeavour to find alternatives to internment.
The report that I have presented, which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, offers the opportunity to create Europeâs first body of asylum law, and a balanced and fair one too.
Fear of Islamic terrorism and crime must not be used as a misguided excuse for a backwards-looking asylum policy.
If we abandon the heart of asylum policy, we jeopardise human rights and take an axe to the pillars supporting that community of values that is the European Union.
Fear is a poor basis for decision-making and hypocrisy is a reprehensible thing in politics.
Human rights and human lives are at stake here, and neither we nor anyone else must forget that.
I am very pleased about Commissioner Frattiniâs concession.
I hope that those who decided, perhaps some considerable time ago, that they were going to vote against the report, will now reconsider their position.
I again urge you to vote to adopt my report, which we also need for next yearâs negotiations with the Council.
I urge you to vote in favour of it for the good of all, and, not least, in remembrance of all those Europeans who were forced into exile by war, ethnic cleansing and persecution.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of a common European right of asylum â as resolved by the Tampere European Council in October 1999 â is very much to be welcomed, although the Council proposal, as amended, is so singularly inadequate that, if the directive were to be implemented unamended in the Member States, protection for refugees in Europe would be reduced to almost nothing.
One danger arising from the planned introduction of a minimum common list of what are termed âsafe third countriesâ is the major one that the Member States will return asylum-seekers to countries of origin that are regarded as âsafe third countriesâ without either the reasons for these individuals having become refugees being heard or their entitlement to asylum being examined.
It is for that reason that I, in the opinion I drafted on the report for the Committee on Development, attach particular importance to the European Parliament being fully involved in all future decisions affecting the common list.
The inclusion or deletion from a minimum common list of states that can be â or cannot be â regarded as safe third countries must not be a matter for the Council or the Commission alone.
This is demanded in the report on which we are to vote, as are improved protection for children and minors and the rules relating to the Member Statesâ obligation to inform refugees of their rights and obligations in a language that they understand.
The report includes a number of very important amendments aimed at ensuring that no Member State can deport asylum seekers or return them to areas where their life or freedom would be at risk by reason of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or their holding particular political views.
I ask my fellow-Members of this House to give the report their backing.
If we are to secure the protection of refugees in Europe, this report will make a great difference, as it will also to the position of the people concerned in the Member States.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Frattini said, this has been a lengthy process.
The first proposal was tabled five years ago; in 2001, Parliament tabled over one hundred amendments in the Watson report; the Council spent two years in negotiations and finally arrived at the general approach in April 2004.
I was very disappointed that the European Parliament was only consulted after the Council had reached a political agreement, which means that, in practice, the Council will now pay no attention to this debate; the Councilâs absence from the Chamber sums up perfectly its attitude to this debate.
The fact is, as Mr Frattini said, the directive is an important one.
This first step towards setting a European asylum system in motion is one we must take as a matter of urgency, and this proposal for a directive is the first legally binding instrument dealing with the asylum process.
We must set up common asylum arrangements so that we can manage migratory flows in the most effective and fairest way possible, both for immigrants and for the host societies.
This must, moreover, be done without breaching the 1951 Geneva Convention, with particular regard to the principle of , whereby no State will return such people to countries or territories in which their lives or freedoms will be endangered.
That being said, we must take on board the fact that the Member States wish to combat the abuse of asylum systems by economic migrants.
I should like to commend the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, on his work.
I supported many of his amendments, and similarly most of my proposals were incorporated, with regard to humanitarian issues and the protection of asylum seekersâ rights, the need for rapid and effective procedures, detention conditions and the protection of minors and others who may be vulnerable.
We disagree, however, on two key points, namely the disappearance of the lists of safe countries, which already existed in some Member States, and the scrapping of the concept of the âsuper-safeâ country.
We therefore ask for separate voting on several amendments.
The concept of âsuper-safeâ country certainly applies to European third countries, such as Switzerland, which uphold very high standards of human rights and refugee protection.
This concept was a success when it was implemented in Germany; there was a reduction in the number of cases of abuse and in the number of people seeking asylum.
Some people believed that this solution contravened the Geneva Convention and that it breached the principle of This is why we consulted Parliamentâs legal service, which has just issued an opinion stating that we were right, and that the safe countries solution is fully compatible with the international obligations to which we are bound.
We also reintroduced an amendment that was not adopted in committee, which proposes that an effective system should be in place whereby the asylum seeker will always have the right to appeal a decision and to await the subsequent decision in the country in which he applied for asylum.
If these amendments are adopted, I feel that we will have a report that matches our responsibilities, and the Council would do well to follow our lead.
If we keep the amendments contained in the initial version, I fear that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will not be able to lend its backing to the report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I am, of course, keen, first of all, to thank our rapporteur for his work.
We must support him so that the European Parliament might express a forceful opinion on this crucial issue.
The report, which is extremely well-balanced, is a good text upon which to base the drafting of an asylum and immigration policy.
The European Parliament must maintain a strong position in the drafting of this policy.
On the eve of the transition to the codecision stage in the area of asylum policy, I call on the Council to restore good faith among the European institutions by demonstrating that it is ready to listen to the European Parliament.
As it stands, the Councilâs text does not, in fact, really allow harmonisation of the asylum policies to take place at European level.
On the contrary, it grants the Member States too many possible derogations and exceptions.
Furthermore, these derogations prevent us from attaining a good common denominator; it is, rather, the case that the lowest common denominator is given precedence: the levelling down of the asylum policy in Europe.
Above all, we wish to point out that Europe is truly a land of asylum and that we must protect this humanitarian tradition.
Europeâs asylum policy must first guarantee a high level of protection to people seeking asylum, by enhancing their fundamental rights.
Are we only aware of just how lucky we all are to have been born in Europe?
Well, the principle of so-called âsuper safeâ third countries is unacceptable, since it is a violation of asylum seekersâ rights.
Everyone has the right to make an individual request and to have his or her request individually assessed.
A person can very easily be persecuted in a country that, on the surface of it, is safe.
History has provided us with sufficient evidence of that, if only in the 20th century.
The safe country principle can be very dangerous if it is not strictly controlled and, consequently, it would be unacceptable to end up with 25 different lists.
Parliament must also carry out a leading role in the drafting of this list, and we owe it to ourselves to ensure that this right is observed.
What do we want?
We are calling for peopleâs dignity to be respected.
Let us remember that Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights relates to the right to dignity.
Go and visit the refugee detention centres in various Member States and you will be enlightened.
Go and visit them and you will be appalled that people could treat refugees in such a fashion.
You will be filled with shame, as I was.
We must rectify the flaws in the asylum policy.
We must protect the refugees.
We must also address our people in order to explain to them, and thus to make them understand, the hardship that literally forces these refugees to make their way to Europe.
Â Â  .
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job.
For once, I am in total agreement with him: fear is a bad adviser.
Our guiding principle must be that the European Union, as an area without internal borders, must find a common and effective way of managing its external borders.
The development of a common asylum and immigration policy forms an integral part of this.
Despite the fact, though, that Member States have expressed this ambition themselves, it is with only the greatest of difficulty that this policy is getting off the ground.
Under pressure from public opinion, for which, in fact, national governments and parliaments are often to blame themselves, most Member States are currently adopting their own asylum and migration policy that is as closed off as possible, even though a change to the asylum and migration policy in one Member State has a direct impact on the migration waves and policy developments in the others.
As the also rapporteur indicated, the drawback of a working method such as this is that the political refugee entitled to asylum appears to be at risk of being pushed aside.
In the public debate, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants are increasingly lumped together, and, if we are not careful, the terrorists against whom we must fight will be joining them there in the foreseeable future.
This trend has to be broken as quickly as possible, and that is why a European approach is necessary.
This afternoon, this House will be voting on the proposal for a directive concerning minimum standards in the Member States for granting or withdrawing refugee status.
The proposal is of little interest; it is in fact no more than a collection of policies that apply in the 25 Member States.
It is disappointing that there is hardly any sign of harmonisation.
It has already been noted that the European Parliament has only advisory powers with regard to the proposal.
Advice may be very useful, but it can, above all, also be ignored, and that is exactly what the Council will do.
However, as soon as the final vote has been taken on this report and the directive thereby enters into effect, the European Parliament will acquire codecision in the areas of asylum and immigration, which means that the Council will no longer take decisions by unanimous, but by majority, vote.
This amendment to the decision-making procedure is vital, as is the need to adopt common asylum and immigration policy in the short term.
In order that we may send out a powerful political message to the Council, I would urge the Members belonging to the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats), particularly Mr Coelho, but also those of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to opt for the most viable compromise and thus refrain from voting against this report.
My group has demonstrated its willingness to do this.
There is one area that remains difficult for us, namely the concept of the supersafe countries, but I would be very surprised if a majority were to be found for that this afternoon.
A powerful political signal from this House is what is needed to demonstrate that we, across the political divide, dare fight for a speedy, balanced European approach to the asylum and immigration issue.
Our visit to Lampedusa last week confirmed for me the need to do this.
The directive is merely a first step, displaying little ambition so far, but a first step all the same, the importance of which we should not underestimate.
I should like to finish off by saying that, quite honestly, the fact that the Council is not represented here at the moment, cannot, in my view, be reconciled with the priorities that it set forth before, which is something that I deeply regret.
Â Â  . Mr President, I agree with virtually everything the previous speaker said, although the voting intentions of my political group have been misinterpreted, which I will come to in a moment.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, who has had an extremely difficult task in trying to improve the deeply flawed document received from the Council, which some of us see as an affront to human rights and to those seeking sanctuary.
I find it very depressing that this 'fragile compromise', as it was described, was the best anyone could come up with.
It simply encapsulates a lot of what Member States are already doing.
Reference has already been made to the concept of super-safe third countries and indeed safe third countries.
My political group has a major problem with this.
At the moment the British Government, for example, is prepared to send asylum seekers back to Iraq, Congo, Zimbabwe and Afghanistan.
Some of us are dealing at the moment with the case in which not only is someone being returned to Iran, but his British Christian wife is going with him, with the government paying her fare.
That is all very generous.
There are many in this House who do not believe any of those countries to be safe.
Therefore the minimum that we want, if we are to accept this flawed concept of safe third countries, is a unified list decided under codecision with Parliament, which would be a step towards a common asylum policy.
We are deeply concerned at the implications for non-refoulement, particularly as we are also witnessing an attack on Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with the issue of not returning people to a situation in which they might face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.
We welcome the amendment from the rapporteur and Mrs Roure that keeps open the possibility of testing the human rights dimension of this in the courts.
The committee's amendments have strengthened the text quite considerably.
There is much greater emphasis, for example, on the rights of children and procedures for the vulnerable.
There is much greater clarity as regards the need for adequate legal representation and an individual interview, which assumes even greater importance in the context of the single asylum procedure currently under consideration.
We also welcome the commitment to adequate interpretation.
Everyone in this House knows how important skilled interpreters are.
However, our lives are not dependent on them, whereas quality of interpretation can be absolutely crucial to an asylum seeker's future.
The issue of detention is an extremely vexed subject, to put it mildly.
However, arbitrary detention with no possibility of appeal is totally unacceptable.
We believe, therefore, that the committee has done a good job in tightening the legal requirements surrounding this and making it clear that detention is not imprisonment when you have been accused of no crime.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as others of my fellow Members have done, I too should like to thank my friend and colleague MrÂ Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler for the serious work he has performed and for the difficult attempt to put together a report on which we can all agree.
Unfortunately, the Council has already made up its mind, and we take note of that, as we do of its absence here today, and it will most probably take no account of any suggestions emanating from Parliament.
I think that the Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler report improves the directive put before us, particularly in that it deletes the part about super-safe countries and increases the margin for appeal against any refusal.
Some major unresolved issues still remain, however, which we cannot sidestep.
I am thinking in particular of the role of consular authorities, who should not be allowed to meet asylum seekers under any circumstances.
There remains the issue that asylum seekers should not be held in detention centres.
We have just visited Lampedusa and seen how the mixing of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants generates barbaric relations inside detention centres.
In our opinion, these people should not be held in the same places; indeed, we believe that asylum seekers should never be shut up at all.
If it is absolutely necessary, steps must be taken to ensure that they are not held in the same places and in any case not for six months.
In addition, we are concerned about the use made in the report of the safe third country concept, about the criteria for defining a safe third country, and also about how the list of such countries will be drawn up.
To us this is an extremely important point: by definition, a safe third country obviates case-by-case assessment, in that we delegate our responsibility to another country that is considered safe according to rather flexible criteria.
Asylum is not a concession: it is Europeâs moral and political duty and a right for men and women who are being persecuted or are fleeing from wars.
Which are these safe countries?
According to the criteria, even Morocco or Belarus, for instance, could be considered safe countries, places that we have chosen to consider privileged partners, and this also results in a process of externalising the Unionâs borders.
I believe that safe third countries and the concept of safe third countries endanger the lives of asylum seekers, and that is something that we must not allow.
I also believe that Parliament has too little control; codecision will only apply when modifying the list of safe third countries.
MrÂ Frattini says that the report has been arranged step by step.
In my view, this step has not been bold enough: we could have aspired to and demanded much more.
The harmonisation that we have produced is probably such that it even makes some national legislations worse.
Â Â  .
Mr President, today, we are debating refugee status; in a world in which millions of people are on the run, we are fortunate enough to be able to discuss their status.
Let it be clear that talking about refugees from our position cannot, and indeed should not, be without any consequences.
It is our duty to treat refugees kindly and fairly.
One and a half weeks ago, it became painfully clear once again how little prepared we in the European Union are to provide clarity and transparency in respect of refugee treatment.
I fear that Lampedusa is no exception.
An even-handed and fair European asylum policy can only exist if the Member States are open about the way they treat their refugees.
The amendments that have been tabled to Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rflerâs report show no evidence of any priorities having been set.
If this Parliament had wanted to express clear requests, we would have been better off sticking to the main points.
Instead, alongside the Councilâs political agreement, this House has produced a very extensive document.
In a consultation procedure, there is little scope for re-writing a Council proposal.
I would like to make two important points.
This proposal makes it possible for an application for asylum to be rejected on the basis of a combination of different exceptions.
Member States are apparently not prepared to allow their own exceptions to be discussed in order to reach an even-handed directive, and that is unacceptable.
Moreover, there are insufficient guarantees in the directive to accompany the accelerated procedure.
There is a lack of both clear criteria and sufficient guarantees that this procedure will not be at the expense of the fairness of the normal procedure.
One important point is what the Council intends to do with Parliamentâs amendments; it is very regrettable that the Council is not present to set that out in detail, which is what I would like it to do.
Commissioner Frattini doubts whether the Council is prepared to adopt any amendments from Parliament.
It should be possible, though, to enter into a dialogue with the Council on a limited number of points that we regard as essential.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to compliment the Council on its absence.
I see that as symptomatic of the extent to which this Parliament is taken into account.
Alas, poor us!
Ladies and gentlemen, while I agree with the rapporteur in calling for greater cooperation among the institutions and in considering that Parliament should always be consulted before the Council comes to any kind of agreement, I should, however, like to express my disappointment at the contents of the report.
In the document, the rapporteur laments the lack of significant progress in terms of harmonisation, but he does not take into account the different perceptions that countries can have about the immigration problem.
When I speak of immigration, I deliberately call it a problem: there is no denying that the so-called fringe countries of the European Union suffer most from veritable assaults by immigrants, who sometimes arrive with good intentions, admittedly, but are none the less illegal.
In the absence of a Community immigration policy, one that is both intelligent and practical, I consider it fair for the Member States to reserve the right to examine only those applications that are considered serious and possibly to reject them.
Some Members, however, insist on wanting to consider immigration to be a non-Community problem; they imagine that the individual Member States should bear the exorbitant costs that these waves of migration involve.
Some amendments that go against the Council proposals have been adopted.
The definition of âsafe third countryâ has in effect been eliminated, preventing Member States from rejecting applicants deemed unsuitable even if they come from countries considered to observe freedoms and human rights.
If this Parliament â perhaps because it is too politically correct â wishes to ignore the fact that immigrants, especially those who come through my own country, Italy, get into Europe and almost always end up committing crimes and jeopardising the safety of our citizens, then perhaps it would be better to have the courage to say that each country should regulate itself as it sees fit, that is to say with 20 different kinds of legislation.
In that case, however, the Left should not go on about a united Europe: they are the only ones being hypocritical; we on the right are certainly not!
Â Â  â Mr President, there was no Portuguese translation at any time during the speech by the last speaker.
I therefore understood nothing of what the speaker said.
I should like to ask the Bureau to ensure that the translation service works in such a way that we can follow every debate in its entirety.
Â Â  I am sorry to hear this.
The relevant services will be informed, to ensure interpretation can be received.
Â Â  Mr President, we need to understand that the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, and indeed the additional 1967 Protocol, were originally drawn up to guarantee the reception of European political refugees from the Communist dictatorships in the former Eastern Bloc.
It therefore goes without saying that these instruments are wholly inappropriate to offer an answer to the current asylum problems, particularly the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are coming to Europe from all over the world in search not only of refuge but also of economic fortune and prosperity.
It is therefore right and proper that we should look for an answer to this problem in the shape of a common European refugee policy, and I would certainly endorse the drafting of a list of safe countries, even if this was a first step and even if â subsidiarity being properly understood â it was left to the individual Member States to use additional lists.
This can, however, only be a first step.
A real solution to the problems can only be arrived at once we have the courage to decide that the reception of asylum seekers should take place on the relevant asylum seekersâ continent, and preferably in the regions, of origin, and no longer, therefore, in Europe.
This reception must, contrary to what has been repeated here , be done in closed and very strictly controlled centres; only those who, following a strict and proper examination, are recognised as refugees can then be received in third countries, possibly also within the European Union.
That is the only way to drastically reduce the number of bogus asylum applications and combat human trafficking.
Moreover, this is also the only way of reconciling our citizens, whom we represent, in our own countries, with the need to receive genuine asylum seekers.
Since unfortunately, the asylum concept has become more or less synonymous with deception and social fraud, rightly so, for which we can certainly have human understanding, we should not be politically responsible or indeed, be a political accomplice.
For the time being, though, we lack the political will or courage to adopt such bold and necessary policy, certainly with regard to everything that this entails, such as, for example, the refusal of development aid to countries that refuse to conclude repatriation agreements for bogus asylum seekers.
The present report is, unfortunately, an illustration of this political unwillingness, given the fact that it weakens already meek and timid Council proposals even further, and it is for those reasons that we will, with regret, be unable to endorse this report.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as long as we are among the most secure regions of the world, people who suffer persecution in their own countries will come to us, and it goes without saying that we should try to help them.
It is an humanitarian obligation incumbent on us not only as individual states, but also as a European Union, and the fact that that Unionâs internal borders are open makes it important that we at least lay down a minimum standard for asylum procedures, with it made clear not only to asylum-seekers but also to the host countries what prior conditions apply, what form the procedures take, and how long they should take.
It is also a matter of humanitarian obligation that procedures should be transparent and quick, and that they should treat people with dignity, and this is an obligation that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes very seriously, as is evident from the amendments tabled by our shadow rapporteur Mr Coelho â which the Committee accepted â in contrast to the approach taken by the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, which does nothing to help us meet our humanitarian obligations.
The fact is that what matters is not that we should accept as many people as possible, but that we should offer a safe haven to those who are persecuted in their own country and for whom Europe is their only possible place of refuge.
At the same time, we must be clear in our own minds about the evident fact that the right of asylum is also misused, and so, in order to make room for people who really are persecuted, we have to deter manifestly unfounded applications.
Using a list of safe third countries helps to do this.
Practice in Germany has shown this to be a sensible and workable arrangement, although it must be noted that inclusion in the list of safe third countries is conditional upon acceptance and implementation of both the Geneva Convention on Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights â a high standard that we have set for ourselves.
It is this concept of safe third countries and safe countries of origin that the rapporteur rejects, with the consequence that, for example, neither Canada nor Norway nor Switzerland are regarded as safe countries for asylum-seekers.
I have to tell him that they should be included in any procedure, and, while our Green and Socialist Members reject Bulgaria and Romania as safe states, they nonetheless want them to accede to the EU in a few monthsâ time.
That is inherently contradictory.
Moreover, in the original version of his report, MrÂ Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler went as far as to demand that criminals for whom an arrest warrant had been issued should be granted asylum before they were arrested.
He also, citing cultural sensitivities, rejected the fingerprinting of asylum-seekers, even though that is often the only way to positively identify those who have arrived without papers, and that would make it virtually impossible to determine whether a person had applied for asylum in more than one Member State.
To Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler I have to say that the adoption of his report in its present form would, in my view, be a disservice to many serious applicants for asylum.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to express my congratulations to Mr Wolfgang Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler on his report.
Why does the Council insist on there being super safe countries when we ourselves recognise that some of them do not comply with basic principles of law and that this would also result in the repatriation of refugees?
Why does the Council insist that each Member State should be allowed to have its own list of safe countries and why does it persist in refusing a common list, with the result that each country includes its friends and âcustomersâ, even if other Member States do not trust them?
Why does the Council insist on ignoring the Convention on the Rights of the Child and persist in discriminating against 17-year-olds?
Is it perhaps because the rate of refugees is increasing or perhaps because we have a deluge on the European borders?
No, it is not, because refugee applications have fallen recently.
Unfortunately, as the rapporteur said, the problem is the fear which exists in certain countries from terrorist attacks and the fear created in other countries by unemployment or the violation of social protection networks.
Fear seeks scapegoats and the easy scapegoats are the persecuted of this world.
Of course, Europe is not only a geographical and economic continent; it is also a humanitarian continent.
We have the same obligation to protect our geographical borders as we do to protect our humanitarian borders.
We have brought our light to the planet.
The international conventions we talk about here bear the stamp of European humanitarianism and we cannot, on the basis of fear, insecurity and even sometimes racism, attack and violate our own humanitarian borders.
So congratulations once again to the rapporteur; I am sure that his report will fare well.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteur for his report and for the unambiguous stance he has adopted.
What this House is doing today is an expression of its innate responsibility for the defence of human rights, and not just of any old right, but of what is perhaps the most ancient human right known to man, the right of asylum, which can be seen as derived from the laws of hospitality, and which was, to the most ancient of human cultures, sacrosanct.
If we are to scrutinise these decisions, we need to look into the mirror of history.
If the defence of human dignity can be threatened by fears and public moods, it is scarcely to our credit and does not say much for our courage and strength.
The Council consults Parliament, so let it be said in the plainest of language what we are dealing with here: interference with fundamental rights, the police, and the laws of Member States, and none of it with any parliamentary legitimacy.
No wonder people in this EU of ours are putting up resistance, howling with outrage at the democratic deficit, the gaps in fundamental rights and in the monitoring of what goes on.
To what kind of pass has Europe come?
How it is possible for fundamental rights to be interfered with without Parliament having any say in what is decided?
The Council consults us, yet it itself is not present; the Council wants to listen to Parliament, and yet it is not here!
Why, though, should it be?
The fact is that the Council is consulting us only after it has already concluded an agreement, only after its members have done a deal among themselves.
Heads of Government are not in the least aware of the fact that it goes against our culture for ministers of the interior, ministers with responsibility for the police, to make laws for themselves, to interfere with fundamental rights, to make the most difficult decisions about the balance between security and human rights without reference to Parliament.
We are, admittedly, being consulted, but the Council is not here.
The object of this initiative by the Council is to put Europe beyond the reach of refugees, to make a mockery of the right of asylum and to make it, in essence, null and void.
That is the state we are in.
Â Â  â Mr President, the directive on minimum standards for granting refugee status being debated today also revises and abolishes legislatively any protection which existed for refugees on the basis of the Geneva Convention and the Dublin II Regulation.
Of course, the Council has already agreed and, from one point of view, the debate being held here is entirely cosmetic.
The directive follows on from the overall anti-refugee policy of the European Union because, as you know, the percentage of applicants granted refugee status has plummeted in the European Union over recent years.
In Greece, for example, it is less than 1% of applicants and last year the number of asylum applications plummeted.
Maintaining the concept of a safe to super safe third country, which means repatriation to it without the application being examined, refusing in practice the right to asylum and imprisoning immigrants pending a decision by the authorities demonstrate the European Unionâs indifference.
A great deal has been said about the humanitarianism of the European Union.
It is hugely ironic: on the one hand you unleash wars and plunder countries in the developing world and, on the other hand, you pretend that you pity the victims of this policy.
We consider that the amendments by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with the exception of the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, are gratuitously critical of the directive in that, to all intents and purposes, they accept the basic anti-refugee approach.
The only democratic proposal is to withdraw the directive.
Â Â  Mr President, although it is hard to imagine from the relative comfort and security of a western European country like Ireland, globally persecution is more widespread than ever.
We have only to think of the political persecution in Burma, the economic persecution in East Timor, the religious persecution in Indonesia, Malaysia and Korea and the persecution of mothers and fathers in China for conceiving an unauthorised child and the added persecution if it is a girl child.
There is the persecution of disabled people in some communist countries and the persecution based on tribal origin in the Sudan.
Billions of people live under the threat of persecution.
When that threat moves closer and they must escape, we must receive them.
It is a human imperative, but also a deeply ingrained cultural imperative in Europe.
From the earliest times many of us learned the story of St Joseph taking the child and his mother to Egypt because King Herod planned to kill him.
This report highlights the need for real effective guidelines and standards for refugees.
I understand this need well.
I have lobbied for genuine refugees in my own country, largely unsuccessfully.
I think particularly of two Ukrainian doctors who narrowly escaped death after exposing a government-licensed trade in human tissue obtained from aborted but living 20-week-old foetal babies.
Those doctors â a consultant oncologist and a paediatrician â who sacrificed their whole careers for their courageous action, have been in Ireland for over a year in an overcrowded hostel with no certainty that they will not be sent back to persecution and death.
Our response in Ireland, from what I know of other EU countries, tends to be slow and ungenerous.
In the face of genuine asylum-seeking, this is not good enough.
Regardless of third countries, can we even call our own EU countries safe countries?
We should not automatically presume.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, I am very much in favour of respecting human dignity and international conventions and therefore giving due consideration to every request for asylum.
I am also in favour of granting asylum to asylum seekers that meet the necessary conditions, and denying it to those who fail to do so.
Particular care should be taken when children are involved.
It should also be borne in mind, however, that there are few genuine asylum seekers.
For instance, I have encountered many asylum seekers in Belgium, but none of them really met the relevant conditions.
Indeed, genuine political activists tend to be reluctant to leave their country of origin because they feel they have a lot to do there.
Ninety per cent of the problem of asylum actually involves hidden immigration, the underlying reasons for which are not always economic.
They tend to be psychological and humanitarian.
Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest we admit these immigrants, but that we also recognise them for what they are.
A clear distinction should be drawn between asylum and immigration, to allow us to deal more appropriately with requests for political asylum and to control immigration more effectively.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make two general remarks and three more detailed observations.
My first general remark is that I myself was an official participant in the Tampere European Council in October 1999, exactly six years ago.
There we drew up the 10 Tampere milestones to show how we could make progress in these matters, for example.
Unfortunately, progress has been very slow.
My second remark concerns the Constitution, which Franco Frattini was also involved in drafting.
It is regrettable to hear how those who opposed the Constitution here in Parliament would at the same time like a firmer policy on asylum.
These go hand in hand, and I personally, at least, hope that the Constitution comes into effect in some form or another as soon as possible.
Next, I wish to make three detailed observations.
Firstly, this is the only part of the Common European Asylum System, adopted back in 1999, which has not been decided upon.
I do not believe it is right to sulk about whether the European Parliament was listened to or not.
What is most important is that this programme should now be carried out.
My second observation concerns the list of safe countries.
It is my opinion that a list of safe countries at EU level is vitally important and a very sensible idea.
A list of this kind is necessary, and it is fine if, after the directive has come into effect, these decisions are taken by a qualified majority.
Finally, I wish to express my support for the rapporteur.
He is worried that a negative decision on asylum might be enforced even if the time for making an appeal is still not over.
Obviously, this cannot be allowed to happen.
For that reason, I support the rapporteur on this point.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done and the Commission for this proposal, which we consider an honest attempt to harmonise the treatment of asylum seekers across the European Union.
This proposal is benefiting today from the European Parliamentâs contribution and efforts, so that we can realign ourselves with the spirit of the Tampere Council, which has been mentioned several times today, and also so as to overthrow the primacy of fear as the only political element, the only criterion for action in our policies on immigration and the right to asylum.
Now, however, it is important to oversee the implementation of the directive as amended and to ensure that it really does become the new Europe-wide legislation that is implemented in all our countries.
Above all, with regard to the new definition of a safe third country, we must avoid â if I may say so, Mr President â certain fanciful interpretations that we have heard today from the benches on the right: a safe third country for us means adopting a European list of safe countries, and adopting it under the responsibility of Parliament as a party in the codecision procedure.
Objective, precise conditions are needed: precisely the opposite of what is happening today.
Thousands of migrants leave Lampedusa to be expelled and sent to Libya, which is anything but a safe country, MrsÂ Klamt; and when people are sent from the United Kingdom to Iraq, they are going to a country that is anything but a safe third country.
It is also a case of changing the function of Parliament.
Today we are not offering the Council a polite suggestion; instead, we are calling for clear, strict and responsible rules.
To conclude, I believe that the basic problem is to make the Council and all the European institutions understand that Europe today cannot simply look after itself, but that it must instead look after the rights of those who are now suffering the violence of war and the humiliation of persecution.
In view of all that, we must ask ourselves whether the problem is that we receive the asylum applications or rather whether the problem is the war and persecution from which those refugees are fleeing.
Even before we put it to the European institutions, that is a question that we should put to our own consciences.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly thanking the rapporteur for his report, which I am sure we can support unreservedly.
Where human rights are concerned, it is important that the European Union should function as a role model for other states outside it, yet resolutions such as these all too readily jeopardise them.
How, in future, are we to compel other states to comply with international law on asylum if we no longer take it seriously within the European Union?
I find it a matter of concern that the President-in-Office of the Council, the British Home Secretary, Mr Clarke, at the meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Newcastle on 9 September, argued that the European Convention on Human Rights might need to be reinterpreted.
He would like to be able to deport preachers of hatred and terrorists â who are, admittedly, frightening presences on the contemporary scene â even if they face torture or the death penalty in their country of origin.
This I regard as no more and no less than a flagrant disregard of international asylum law.
It is quite clear to me, and to my group, that the âsuper-safe third countriesâ rule is unacceptable.
Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler has already referred to this, and I endorse his criticism of it.
It is obvious that the Council needs to make improvements here.
Â Â  Mr President, the consistent asylum policies adopted by Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland have enabled these countries to deter innumerable people who would never have had any right to asylum from undertaking a dangerous journey and to thereby deal a severe blow to the people-traffickers.
A policy of speeding up procedures and of rigorous deportations has made it possible for them to reduce the flood of asylum-seekers by up to 50% and to save millions that would have been spent on pointless casework.
They are nevertheless adhering strictly to the definition of refugees as laid down in international conventions and, by so doing, have even managed to increase the numbers whose claims are being recognised.
On the one hand, this prevents the exploitation of the social security system; on the other, the effect was to make the proceedings more humane and welcoming for genuine refugees and enabled them to be speedily integrated by means of obligatory courses on the countryâs language and customs, essential in making a new start in a new home.
If we want to wipe out Europeâs people-trafficking industry, which is a cause of suffering and unending misery, if we want to prevent those granted asylum from being drawn into the criminal milieu and to help those refugees who have not come to us for economic reasons alone, applications for asylum without a genuine need for asylum being demonstrated are simply no longer acceptable.
As for whether this report constitutes a step in the right direction, that is, in my view, a matter of doubt.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is right that the European Union takes concrete steps towards a common policy regarding immigration and asylum which includes clear provisions regarding the repatriation of illegal immigrants.
Until now as we can see in Malta's case, the countries of Southern Europe, have been left to fend for themselves, and consequently they are facing a national crisis.
However, to develop a common policy, we must not look only at the obligations which each country has to face, but we must also see how the burden can be shared.
Unfortunately, Europe is still far from the situation where the burden of this problem can be shared equally between everyone and there are countries who are carrying a much heavier load than they can actually carry.
And let us be realistic, the burden must not be carried only by European countries, but it should be carried also by the countries from which the migrants originate, as well as transit countries, such as Libya.
What can be done in order that countries of origin, especially those considered âsafe countriesâ would cooperate?
What can be done so that a transit country such as Libya, fulfils its obligations also by, amongst other things, entering into a repatriation agreement?
These are the questions which we should also be asking.
Especially, we should address this subject, Mr President, in a holistic way, especially when deciding which countries should be considered 'safe' or 'super-safe'.
I say âYesâ for a common European policy, but a policy of solidarity where the burden is shared equally, and a policy which is coherent and insistent with third countries, so that they too should burden their responsibility.
I finish off with a comment about the role of Parliament.
We must be careful, because if this Parliament imposes on the Member States burdens which are too heavy, then we should not be surprised if the Council ignores us.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, for a constructive report.
It is important for us all to work towards the same goal: that the EU should, in the long run, conduct a policy on refugees and asylum that is the same for everyone everywhere.
Rules concerning safe or very safe countries give rise to a disturbing and unclear legal picture and lead to refugees being treated differently in different countries.
My own country, Sweden, does not apply general rules or the concepts of âsafe countries of originâ and âsafe third countriesâ.
Instead, we see all refugees as individuals and consider each of them on an individual basis.
A Member State can then assess refugeesâ individual histories and their need to have their reasons considered.
A country may be safe for a group, collectively, but be impossible for an individual or family to return to, precisely because the person or people concerned may have been politically active in union work or belong to a non-governmental organisation engaged in activities that incur disapproval.
I naturally also view with unease the fact that, in both international contexts and the EU, childrenâs and young peopleâs age of majority is tampered with.
No one is grown up at the age of 16, either in these or in other cases.
I hope that, with the help of this report, we shall make some headway in the process that, in time, should provide us with a common policy on refugees and asylum in the EU.
That is what people in the EU want us to do because they want to see the EU as a single entity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to join with previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur.
The aim of the directive we are debating is to establish a simple, clear, effective and humanitarian system for dealing with refugees in the European Union according to a common set of minimum standards.
The system must also respect human rights.
This directive is certainly needed, because not all Member States of the European Union have in place national systems for dealing with refugees.
Immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees are a problem for the Union as a whole.
All the Member States are affected, regardless of the number of refugees they have to deal with.
A refugee who files an application in Poland is not simply a problem for Poland.
That refugee should be a concern for countries a long way away from Poland, because he or she is likely to relocate.
Consequently, issues and policies pertaining to refugees have a European dimension and should be dealt with at European level.
I believe we have fallen into a trap as we discuss this directive.
We have allowed ourselves to be swayed by our natural fear of terrorism, which might actually be more of an obsession.
We cannot allow ourselves to perceive every refugee as a potential terrorist.
It is important to keep the right balance between our normal justified fears for our own security on the one hand, and traditional European hospitality on the other.
Another comment I would like to make is that the European Parliament cannot remain on the sidelines as the policy on asylum is developed.
I was surprised to note today that it has fallen to the European Parliament to call for compliance with international law.
We would like to point out to the House that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is not being complied with, and in addition, the 1967 Additional Protocol has not been implemented.
These shortcomings could be remedied if the relevant amendments are accepted at the vote.
The House should support this directive, because it will serve as a kind of safety valve Europe sorely needs.
Millions of refugees are eagerly awaiting it, and we could help these people by ensuring minimum standards and fair treatment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who have spoken.
I have taken good note of their comments.
There are certainly non-negotiable values in Europe: protecting the life and dignity of every person is an institutional and, above all, a moral duty of ours, and in that respect I thank the rapporteur for having emphasised that and also other speakers for having repeated it clearly.
I believe that the European Union should acknowledge and uphold this basic right for anyone who is truly fleeing persecution or war, but I mean truly fleeing.
There is in fact another very clear point, mentioned by MrsÂ Klamt, amongst others: it is important to avoid abuse; it is important to distinguish clearly between those who are true refugees and are actually fleeing, and those who are economic migrants instead.
It is a matter of credibility.
The European strategy requires precise laws and sure means of enforcing them.
That is the only way in which we can give a truly shared and sharable response both to those who would have fear prevail and to those who would have the duty of giving a welcome prevail.
Both extremes can, I believe, find common ground if we give ourselves transparent laws and clear rules for implementing them, with no more grey areas between what is allowed and what is not.
That is why the directive can and must enter into force as soon as possible.
In that way, ladies and gentlemen, we shall be able to avoid retaining those legislative differences between Member States that often result in differential treatment for people who are in the same situation.
That, too, is a serious violation, when someone in one Member State is in the same situation as someone else in another Member State but is treated differently.
It is a serious injustice, which the directive can in some way reduce and eliminate.
That is why a Europe-wide measure is needed, and I fully agree with that, even though, as many of you have realistically pointed out, it is difficult to imagine that the Council will fully reopen the debate on points of substance.
Many of you â I will mention MrÂ Fava and MrsÂ Lambert in particular â have brought up a very important issue: the European list of safe countries.
Well, I am aware that there are problems with the legal basis, and I know that the Council is making a forceful case for having only the consultation procedure apply when the list is drawn up.
Regardless of the formal legal bases for drawing up the list of safe countries, I believe â and I am personally in favour of this â that it is essential to work with Parliament.
There are formal legal issues with the legal basis, but there are also substantive political issues.
I will mention a variety of subjects: the Agency for Fundamental Rights, the data retention question â in other words, topics on which I have proposed that this Parliament should work within a substantive political, interinstitutional agreement, whatever the formal legal bases.
Therefore, why should we not also explore the possibility of the Council and Parliament working together on a subject that is clearly sensitive, as MrÂ Coelho said as well?
I frankly agree with many of the comments that have been made: it is difficult to imagine that the Council will now, after four years of negotiations, simply drop the list of safe countries idea.
Let us try, then, to give it what I see as a political boost that will involve Parliament much more than Parliament has been involved up to now!
For these reasons I conclude by hoping once more that you will vote for the directive, since voting for it would mean giving substance to that idea of European solidarity that MrÂ Busuttil has just recalled: European solidarity means sharing responsibilities and also burdens, and it means standing up to the opinions of those who would like to have exclusively national approaches.
In my view, Parliament has a chance to give a political response of that kind.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the EU-US Wine Agreement.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity to address here the question of the EuropeanÂ Union-United States Wine Agreement, which was initialled in Washington on 14Â September. It will be submitted to Council for final approval in the coming weeks.
This is only a first phase agreement. It is the result of many years of bilateral negotiations, during which the United States was granted and renewed specific authorisations on wine-making practices, certification and labelling rules, completely 'for free'.
These never-ending negotiations affected the trading environment in a negative way.
The United States left the International Wine Organisation in 2001 and created the World Wine Trade Group.
Besides that, since the Community revised its labelling rules in 2002 with the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002, the United States has been one of the most critical WTO members, questioning the WTO-compatibility of all these rules.
Another example of negative trade relations was the adoption by Congress in NovemberÂ 2004 of certification requirements for imported wines, except for countries with which the United States had a wine agreement.
Community exports to the United States amounted to almost EURÂ 2Â billion in 2004, which is about 40% of our wine exports.
The United States only exports EURÂ 415 million to the European Union.
Considering, therefore, the importance of the United States market for the European Union, the evolution of our trade relations over recent years and the situation in the Community wine sector, it is my view that this first phase agreement is a very positive one for our wine sector.
This deal will secure what is our biggest export market in terms of both value and volume.
I welcome the agreement, since it will help consolidate and improve our trading relations with the United States.
It may also facilitate a non-polemical and substantial dialogue with the members of the New World Wine Group.
In addition, this first phase agreement contains some provisions that clearly benefit the Community.
There is now official recognition by the United States of our wine geographical indications, which will be protected under their labelling rules.
There are the 17 European wine names, such as port, sherry and champagne, which are currently considered as semi-generic in the United States.
We have agreed that their use will be limited in the United States and that they will change their legal status to restrict them to wines originating in the Community in future.
The present situation will be frozen, but there will be no further negative impact from the agreement.
We cannot underestimate the fact that the explicit recognition of these names as Community wines will benefit Community wine-makers and traders.
We will also be exempted from the 2004 United States certification requirements. Not only for wines covered by the agreement, but also for wines which contain less than 7% alcohol, which was an issue of interest to many of the wine-producing Member States.
And let us not forget that, without the present agreement, we would have faced heavy certification requirements for our 2005 vintage.
I can assure you that all these requirements would have been very costly for our export sector.
I wish to highlight two other very important points.
Under this agreement, the United States and the European Union agree to resolve bilateral issues through informal bilateral consultations, rather than through formal dispute settlement mechanisms.
This is an important declaration, as it represents a peace clause and will allow further constructive discussions to be held.
Given that this is only a first phase agreement, it was key to have some clear perspectives for the second and more ambitious phase.
We have obtained a clear commitment to start the negotiations for the second phase not later than 90 days after the entry into force of the first phase.
The United States ultimately agreed to spell out more clearly in a joint declaration the issues that should be part of these second phase negotiations.
These include important issues for us, such as the future of the 'ex' semi-generics, geographical indications, the use of traditional expressions, wines not covered by the agreement, wine-making practices, certification and the creation of a joint committee.
Lastly, I have heard some criticism to the effect that the Commission has granted the United States mutual recognition of its wine-making practices.
This is not at all the case.
We will continue to accept United States wine-making practices currently covered by Community authorisations.
We will also accept existing United States wine-making practices not covered by the present Community derogations.
However, it will only be possible for the United States to export those wines after the status of the 17Â semi-generic United States names has been changed.
New wine-making practices will be analysed and only accepted in the Community if no objections are raised.
This is not mutual recognition.
Because the United States is our most important trade partner in the wine sector, I consider this first phase agreement a very important one for European wine-makers and exporters.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her statement on this issue.
Our group has two points of view on this subject, and I do not propose to mince my words in setting them out.
The fact is that the Commission has acted â to say the least â shamelessly and unacceptably in making these concessions in the EU-US Wine Agreement, and that I say, as a Member for one of the oldest vine-growing regions in Germany, also on behalf of the vine-growers of the Moselle.
You yourself stressed the obvious need for a trade agreement with unambiguous rules, and the negotiations have also been going on too long already, but what we need is an agreement with fair conditions for both parties.
This document, with its long and vague deadlines and, worst of all, the concession of unconditional mutual recognition of oenological processes in wine-making, is a slap in the face for all the efforts the European Union and its Members have put in to legislation on vine products.
The Commissioner said that there is a need for further discussions, yet we have negotiated for so long that I have to ask why we are putting off such important decisions.
The production and manufacturing of wine in Europe is subject to clearly defined conditions.
Adding water to it is something we see is unthinkable and which the consumer would not stand for.
Are we now to accept that the Americans may add water to wine up to 7%?
Modern methods involving the breaking-down of wine into its individual components are a workable proposition these days, but are we, by way of mutual recognition, to accept that it can be put together industrially and any old how?
We have no need of synthetic wine!
Wine is diverse, its diversity a manifestation of nature itself, owing its character to climate and vintage.
Is the Commission not aware of the likely effect of such a concession, which affects future agreements, on negotiations within the WTO?
The âmost favoured nationâ principle laid down by the WTO means that, later on, the same concessions will have to be made to other states.
The International Wine Institute is endeavouring to find a globally valid definition of wine, and this is being taken .
Commissioner Fischer Boel also mentioned another organisation.
The USA has left the OIV.
Does that mean that the OIV has in some sense gone bust?
Yet what we insist we need â the protection of geographical indications of origin without the specification of a date â is simply being put off for ever and a day.
Champagne comes from Champagne, Rhine wine is grown on the Rhine, and Moselle on the Moselle â not somewhere in America.
If we want fair trade, then such descriptions must be banned now rather than at some unspecified date.
Even maintaining the current status quo strikes me as going too far.
What I want the Commission to tell me is in what sense the negotiations around this agreement can be described as a success; as I see it, all we have done is to make concessions, and too many of them at that.
I feel â and let me say on behalf of the many winemaking families at present bringing their harvest home from the vineyards, we feel â that a deal has been done to sell us down the river.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking you for presenting the proposal for an agreement and for the clarifications which it was absolutely necessary to give the European Parliament.
This is a difficult agreement which, I think, was fairly complex, meaning that we all need more clarification.
On the other hand, you too need to take account of our proposals and concerns in connection with this agreement.
This agreement might indeed be considered as one of the most long-winded international sectoral trade agreements, given that issues have been pending since 1983.
Over the last 20 years, the European Union, as you quite rightly said, has constantly granted the USA derogations relating to wine-making practices and the labelling of American wines imported into the Community.
This agreement will, first of all, smooth trade relations between the USA and the European Union: the USA exempt the European Union from their new certification requirements and undertake to endeavour to resolve possible differences through bilateral consultations rather than, as was previously the case, through dispute settlement mechanisms.
However, we should not forget that, for the time being, this is only a first phase agreement, what we might call an emergency solution, and that important trade matters are pending which the Commissioner must take into account in the ruthless negotiations now beginning.
First, protected names are not adequately safeguarded, it would appear, in the agreement, while the recognition given to the wine-making practices of the USA, allowing 7% water to be added or for wines to be matured with wood shavings in the barrel, which are not of course a health hazard, jeopardises the reputation of wine as a quality product.
Secondly, this recognition of the lax wine-making practices of the USA will act as a precedent for imports from other countries.
Consequently, in the second phase, the question of wine-making and maturing practices will need to be addressed responsibly, in order to create a stable reference framework.
Thirdly, traditional names are being threatened and the role of the International Wine Organisation is being questioned.
Fourthly, the procedure to safeguard recognition of the 17 names in Annex 2 needs to be speeded up, so that all protected European names are strictly protected by the American authorities.
Fifthly, the creation of an international register of protected geographical indications needs to be promoted within the framework of WTO negotiations and this objective needs to be integrated into the top priorities of the European Union.
Commissioner, one major cycle is closing but another is beginning and perhaps now the Commission's efforts should be stepped up within the framework of the second round of negotiations with the USA and the forthcoming review of the common organisation of the market for wine, so as to create the best possible conditions with respect to the production and quality of and the trade in the product.
You are in the eye of the storm and I wish you .
Parliament and its comments will, I think, help in this direction.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by expressing my â our â congratulations on your success in achieving this interim result in the negotiations with the United States.
This is an important trade project, accounting for EURÂ 2.3 billion, but the trading relationship involves two different systems, with different approaches to production and marketing, and so cooperation is not easy.
It is for that reason that this agreement can be regarded as no more than a first step, a first phase agreement, and I am glad that you have described it in those terms.
In the past, we accepted many derogations for the Americans; the trading relationship made that necessary.
What matters now, though, is that our rules on labelling should be enforced, and we also see it as significant that the USA is ready and willing to resolve all bilateral issues through consultation rather than through the WTOâs dispute settlement procedures, but what is surely most important to us Europeans is that geographical indications of origin should enjoy in the United States the protection that they deserve, in return for which we â for the time being â are prepared to accept the Americansâ winemaking practices.

That may be a bitter pill, but we have to swallow it; its effect will be only temporary and the labelling rules â which will result in greater freedom for what we hope are emancipated consumers â will help it go down.
Nevertheless, in the second stage of negotiations, the Commission must go further and press for the improved protection of intellectual property in winemaking, an area in which we Europeans have led the world in establishing worldwide standards, and so we should not relax our efforts on this point; we also suggest that the Commission should push for a WTO-wide register of geographical descriptions of origin, something that both the speakers before me mentioned.

To sum up, this agreement may not be brilliant, but it is a first, and an important step, and you, Commissioner, have done the right thing.
The next step must now be taken hand in hand with the reform of the market organisation for wine, to which we all look forward eagerly.
We can take pride in our European wine.
It is esteemed and enjoyed the world over.
We enjoy a global advantage in wine production, and we need to maintain it by further improving the protection of intellectual property.
We wish you, Commissioner, much success in doing this.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, for our part, we refuse to be taken in in the ways mentioned by our fellow Member.
I would like first of all to emphasise a procedural issue.
This debate has been hurriedly organised, following the signing of an agreement â even if it is a first phase â by the Commission.
Furthermore, the Council is not here, although it is the institution that ultimately has the agreement in its hands.
I believe, therefore, that we are not working in a serious fashion and that the opinion of MEPs is not being taken into consideration, as it ought to be.
With regard to the content, while this agreement works in the favour of the traders and merchants who exert a great deal of pressure to get ahead, it clearly does not, in any way, serve the interests of either the producers of registered designation of origin wines or of consumers.
Today, the situation is extremely confused.
What you have set out, Commissioner, does not correspond to the information we have from another source.
A state of deep concern is emerging on the ground.
How much confidence will European consumers have in the labelling, in the labels that are in danger of being considerably undermined by this type of agreement?
Furthermore, you are considerably weakening the principles that the European Union has always upheld with regard to geographical indications.
What is currently taking place with regard to wine, and which is, in our view, unacceptable, is in danger of subsequently taking place with regard to a whole host of other products.
For our part, we want two things to happen.
On the one hand, that the Council does its job and clearly states what remit has been given to the Commission regarding this issue.
On the other hand, that the European Union takes a far greater stand on ensuring that the registered designations of origin are observed, on wine-making practices and on protecting sectors that are genuinely vital to the existence of our territories and to a great number of rural territories throughout the European Union, and that it fights to protect this quality and these designated origins.
Otherwise, if we embark on the WTO negotiations by giving up from the outset, I very much fear that we will lose ground time and time again in the weeks to come.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it is well known that the wine sector is going through a difficult time, not least in Portugal where there are increasing numbers of good wines that are having trouble competing in the marketplace.
This situation is exacerbated by the increase in third-country imports, which has had a highly detrimental effect on farmers and wine-growing regions.
This first wine agreement with the United States, the fruit of 20 years of bilateral negotiations, is an important one and yet it also raises concerns.
In light of the massive concessions given to the United States, this agreement appears to have been brokered more because of the ongoing negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, than for the purpose of defending the interests of EU wine producers.
We also believe that the scope of the negotiations must be broadened internationally.
Furthermore, as regards the United States, Mrs Fischer-Boel must explain fully how she intends to guarantee the interests of wine producers from regions of Europe in which wine production is crucial to economic development.
With regard to both labelled designations of origin and traditional wine-making practices in Europe, this is what must be done if the quality of wine is to be maintained and consumers are to be protected.
When we checked the detail and listened to your explanations, we became very concerned as regards the guarantees that must be given to our farmers and to the regions concerned.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent European Union-United States agreement is only a first step â and certainly an inadequate and insufficient one â towards the international recognition and safeguarding of protected traditional names.
It was time to change course after the harmful effects of the infamous Regulation (EC) No 316/2004, which effectively authorised producers in non-EU countries to make improper use of protected traditional names, thus causing enormous damage to quality wine production, both in Italy and, of course, in Europe as a whole.
Commissioner Fischer Boel also stated in this Chamber that the agreement protects European names and will safeguard the European Unionâs largest export market.
There is no doubt that those are the aims to be achieved; doubt remains, however, as to whether the agreement is the right basis on which to achieve such aims.
It is indeed true that the US Administration will put a bill before Congress to change the status and limit the use of 17 European names currently considered semi-generic in the United States, but it is also true that the United States will still be able to use 14 Community traditional names, although subject to certain conditions and for a limited period of time.
In fact, the hoary question of the ongoing misuse of names has still not been settled once and for all.
On the other hand, the United States has undertaken to accept the basic principles of the Communityâs labelling rules and will seek to resolve any bilateral issues relating to the wine trade through informal bilateral consultations rather than through dispute settlement mechanisms.
What is the most worrying concession made by the European Union?
Well, under the agreement, the European Union recognises the wine-making practices of US wine producers.
Substantially, what that means is that the EU can import wine diluted with 7% of added water or flavoured with wood chips, practices that our producers, of course, are absolutely forbidden to use.
That will result in a serious threat to wines of excellence and a major upset in the wine market.
Although we have succeeded in providing a certain stability for wine exports to the United States, not least through the easing of procedures, we have at all events gone too far on wine-making practices and we do not yet have sufficient guarantees regarding the misuse of protected names.
MrÂ President, the agreement includes the commitment that negotiations for an even more thorough agreement will start 90 days after it enters into force.
In this regard, we ask that the talks focus on the effective protection of traditional names.
We believe that, during the talks, the Commission should above all try to obtain a final commitment from the US authorities to put an end to the illicit use in the United States of geographical indications protected by Community legislation within two years at most.
I shall conclude by pointing out that the agreement and the extraordinary derogation for US imports could be used by other WTO member states to claim similar treatment, thus opening the floodgates to imports of dubious origin and composition.
Faced with this situation, the European Union must take action with more vigorous measures in order to defend its production of traditional quality wines.
We should make a fresh start by actually repealing Regulation (EC) No 316/2004, which liberalised the use of protected traditional names, thus creating unfair competition and misleading consumers as to the origin and quality of products.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I speak on behalf of all my people.
Firstly, on behalf of the wine growers from the Languedoc-Roussillon region who have been making wine for 2Â 000 years â since the days of the Roman Empire and not for a century like California â and who make wine like people make love, like people cultivate love for what is handsome and what is beautiful.
I also speak on behalf of all the wine growers from France, Spain, Rioja, Hungary, Tokay â the wine of kings, the king of wines â Italy, Greece and the entire Mediterranean area, where wine is part of civilisation, an art of the gods.
Yet you, with your agreement, you are reducing the wine that is the product of civilisation to an industrial product for marketing.
Your Munich Agreement of the wine industry changes the definition of wine and the nature of wine.
It is no longer a natural creation that is the fruit of the fermentation process, but a chemical product.
You accept the United Statesâ chemical â and not wine-making â practices.
You accept a Coca Cola-type of wine made with water plus ingredients, sugar, colourings and wood.
It is like the United States wanting to change MrsÂ FischerÂ Boel into an inauthentic, 7%-dilutable commissioner.
You can understand, therefore, why the United States does not want labels: because it obviously does not want the chemical substances to be included on them.
Soon, the REACH Directive will be applied to wine.
What is more, you are allowing the theft of 17 designations, on the pretext that they are semi-generic.
Champagne, why, that is insignificant; Chablis, that is not at all significant; Sauternes, even less so!
You are giving the rubber stamp to fraud and counterfeiting.
For five years, the United States will be able to use bogus chÃ¢teaux and bogus Clos wines in exchange for the peace clause.
It is like what happened with the Uruguay Round negotiations, it is like what happened with oleaginous fruits: the thief agrees not to drag the cheated wine growers under the nose of the WTO policeman.
This had already been done before for the agreement with South Africa and, at the WTO, of course, the producers of Chilean, Australian and California wine, and of all the wines from the Pacific, are going to revolt and claim this precedent for themselves.
Commissioner, I come from a region that invented the great revolts in the 1950s.
Well, the wine growers from the Languedoc region will say ânoâ to you.
They will revolt and they may, for that matter, come to the Commission in Brussels.
They have been able to rouse the whole of southern France, and they will have no difficulty in saying ânoâ to you as violently as is necessary, because you are attacking them and you are attacking a civilisation.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, although our esteemed visitors in the galleries are most welcome and ought of course to share in the liveliness of the debate, I would ask them to bear in mind that â following the practice of parliaments all over the world â we ask the listeners in the galleries not to applaud.
Only the Members may do that.
You may, however, nod energetically, provided this is not audible.
I thank the visitors in the galleries for their understanding and warmly welcome them.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, if I were to be banished to a desert island, in the farthest ocean, which would be the Pacific, and someone were to ask me which European agricultural products I would like to take with me, I would say, apart from bread, two bottles.
One of those bottles would contain wine, and the other olive oil.
And since I am from La Rioja, the wine would naturally be a Rioja, which has an international reputation and whose renown and prestige are due to an ancient wine-making culture.
Since before the Roman invasion, vines were being cultivated in La Rioja and wine was being produced.
Our wine is therefore produced by means of extremely ancient production methods which guarantee the high quality of the product.
I therefore believe that the Agreement reached with the United States could lead to a profound change to our wine-making culture, which would not always work to our advantage, because, fortunately or unfortunately, the commercial success of our wines has always been linked to a production method that conforms rigorously to the most purist definitions of the wine.
The definitive authorisation of the import of wines treated by means of dubious wine-making practices that are very different to ours could jeopardise our own wine-making culture, upon which â I would insist â the commercial success of our products has always been based.
How long can the European Union go on prohibiting the use of flakes in the maturing of wine or the addition of water, if we are allowing wines produced by means of these practices to be imported?
It is clear that the chapter on wine-making processes will be one of the sticking points to which particular attention will be paid in the forthcoming reform of the COM in wine, because the agreement that the European Commission has just reached with the United States will, I fear, have repercussions which will go beyond trade with that country.
My region, La Rioja, is lucky enough to benefit from good protection in the United Statesâ market, but the same cannot be said for other Community designations such as Burgundy, Port and Sherry and MÃ¡laga wine, which are still considered by that country to be âsemi-genericâ.
The agreement reached does not contain a firm commitment from the United States to cease misappropriating these descriptions.
I would therefore like us to call upon the Commission to include the creation of an international register of geographical indications and designations of origin amongst the main priorities of the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.
The current negotiations in the World Trade Organisation offer a golden opportunity which we must not waste.
The Commission should also urge the United States, on a bilateral basis, to stop using names protected in the European Union within the maximum period of two years mentioned in the recent wine Agreement.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that after twenty years of contacts between the European Union and the United States, the first agreement has been reached.
But we see this just as a starting point and not something with which we should be content.
I agree with the majority of what has been said in this Parliament and, above all, I hope that the Commission will take good note because I have not heard a single person say that they are satisfied with this agreement.
These first agreements do not guarantee effective protection for European designations of origin.
However, they do leave the Community market open to United States wines produced according to wine-making practices not authorised in the European Union, such as watering.
It is going to be difficult for our wines, produced according to traditional methods and high-quality criteria, to compete with others produced by means of much cheaper industrial processes.
My country, Spain, is disappointed by this first agreement and we hope that the second phase will be far more convincing.
Amongst many other things, we are particularly worried about the issue of semi-generic designations; we believe that it is they who have lost out most.
It is true that the United States have committed themselves to not using typical European designations, but only for wine that they export to third countries.
They can therefore continue to use the same descriptions that they have been using to date in their own territory, with the added complication that United States legislation views descriptions from my region, such as âSherryâ and âMÃ¡lagaâ, as semi-generic and not designations of origin.
The second phase of the negotiations will begin shortly; we call on this Parliament to defend the geographical indications more firmly in those negotiations, to which end we must open up a debate on the future of semi-generic terms.
We need to hold a dialogue on traditional terminology, certifications and wine-making practices and, in particular, it is necessary to create a joint committee for wine-making issues.
In order to work better in the future than we have until now, this Parliament is prepared to work with the Commission; we are going to adopt a resolution which we must take into account so that what has been happening to us until now does not continue.
It would also be desirable for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to produce an initiative report so that what has happened does not happen again and so that this Parliamentâs opinion is taken into account in order to try to save the European wine-making sector.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the challenges of the wine market are huge.
The United States remains a key market for the European Union with 60Â million wine drinkers and an average level of consumption that has grown from 8 to 13 litres per inhabitant per year over the last ten years.
Last year, the volume of the US market increased by 5.6%.
France is ranked third among exporters to the United States, behind Italy and Australia.
In this context, we must welcome the agreement on wines which has been made between the European Union and the United States and which concludes the first phase of negotiations that were begun 20 years ago.
Using blackmail, the United States threatened to subject European exporters to an onerous certification procedure.
This autumnâs therefore, would have been first in line.
It would have been subjected to additional analysis and certification checks.
This agreement has also enabled progress to be made in the area of wine-making practices.
European producers, however, consider these control standards to be insufficient.
They oppose practices such as flavouring, which is aimed at infusing wine with the taste of fruits.
The changing way in which we define wine is at stake.
They also emphasise the protection of geographical designations.
Commissioner, it is necessary, therefore, in the second phase of negotiation, to ensure that the commitments undertaken by the US authorities are observed: to cease using semi-generic terms, such as Burgundy, Chablis, Champagne and Port, and to improve the level of protection of geographical indications, as well as improving labelling.
In this global wine market, which is often controlled by the large US wine traders, the type of vine has become a brand name.
I am not against the globalisation of the wine market, but I am against copies. I am against the standardisation of flavour: I do not want a McDonalds-style Chardonnay wine.
Wine goes hand-in-hand with cuisine; it is the mark of the region where it was produced, it carries the flavour of the cultivated soil and it is the symbol of festivity and of living together.
The diversity of the designations reflects the diversity of the wines, our cultural diversity.
Mutual recognition of the geographical indications, that is to say the designation of the soil from which the wine is produced, will contribute to preserving our respective cultural identities, to boosting our trade with the United States but, above all, to encouraging European wine growers who, for years, have constantly improved the quality of their production in order to satisfy our demands, and serve our enjoyment, as consumers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the agreement between the European Union and the United States on trade in wines, which was initialled by the European Commission on 14Â September following 20 years of negotiations, divides opinions.
There are the European operators for whom this agreement will safeguard their exports to the United States, which is their most important market, with exports valued at EURÂ 1.6 billion.
They believe that this agreement will also enable a climate of confidence to be restored in the sector and trade to flow smoothly, provided, of course, that a prompt start is made to negotiations for a second phase of the bilateral agreement and for defining common positions in the multilateral negotiations, particularly in Hong Kong with regard to aspects related to intellectual property.
Yet there are the other operators too, in particular the European wine growers, including my colleague, MrsÂ Klass, to whom, moreover, we owe the initiative behind this debate, and for that I offer her my thanks.
She has expressed very competently the concerns which, as chairman of this Parliamentâs âWine, tradition, qualityâ intergroup, I share to a very large extent.
According to these concerns, this agreement is in danger of further aggravating the crisis that is currently hitting the wine-producing sector and, in the long term, of destroying once and for all the individual nature of European wines, which are characterised by their traditional roots in the soil and by natural and quite specific wine-making practices.
As political men and women, we know that we often have to water down our wine, but please, not the wine that we drink.
Mutual recognition of the wine-making practices on both sides of the Atlantic poses a problem â my fellow Members have spoken at great length about it â all the more so because some of these practices used by European wine growers are also banned by the WTO.
I hope that you are not going to propose that we change that state of affairs when you make proposals for reforming the common organisation of the wine market.
Being traditionally attached to production models in keeping with their environment and subject to an arsenal of stringent Community regulations, European wine growers, who are anxious to deliver quality products, are in danger of ending up in a situation of unfair competition if the United Statesâs practices are accepted, so much so that, in the long run, they will find themselves forced to abandon their ancestral practices which have, over hundreds of years, created the individual nature of Europeâs wine-making sector.
Therefore, Commissioner, it would be wise to pull out all the stops in order to protect this sector, which is undoubtedly fragile from being subjected to a large number of varying factors such as the climate but which has always been at the centre of European culture.
It is therefore a question of continuing to defend and promote our wine-making practices; it is a question of supporting the quality-focused efforts of our producers, in particular at the WTO, and, finally, of agreeing on a definition that restricts the production models that are unacceptable and that give rise, as I have already said, to a kind of competition that is detrimental to our quality products.
The use of geographical indications is a further issue that unquestionably creates a problem.
This subject has been provoking controversy around the negotiating table for a long time now.
I took part in a seminar in Washington on this matter.
We maintain good relations, in fact, with our colleagues from the US Congress, whom we are trying to convince about the validity of our arguments.
Yet they wanted us to buy back â to pay in order to buy back â our designations of origin.
I held the view that the reasoning was, nonetheless, slightly odd.
I come from Luxembourg, where the Moselle river flows, and the wine from the Moselle valley, while it can be produced in Germany, Luxembourg or France, is emphatically not, as far as I am aware, produced in California.
I believe, therefore, that there should be an end to the costs and, Commissioner, that it is crucial to protect our designations and to implement, once and for all, a system for registering geographical indications within the WTO.
We hope that you will vigorously defend this point of view in Hong Kong, because it is a question of the future of quality products and of Europeâs wine-making culture.
Â Â  â Mr President, wine production in Europe is not merely a matter of applying techniques learnt in a laboratory or in marketing handbooks to the agronomy sector.
As earlier speakers have said, winemaking culture and wine production are an integral part of the cultural heritage of a number of European regions and have been part of their history stretching back centuries.
I should like to refer to just one example, which you will appreciate is very close to my heart, namely that of Port wine.
This wine is produced in the worldâs oldest specified region, created and regulated long before the American colonies had even thought of coming together to form sovereign states.
On the steep slopes of the River Douro in Northern Portugal, successive generations have for centuries sculpted the mountains with their bare hands and miraculously transformed the stones of a desolate landscape into a scene of extraordinary beauty, which is now classified as a world heritage site.
This does not hide the fact that I am well aware of the importance of concluding the agreement with the United States.
I am aware of the profound impact that European exports have had on that country and of the delicate negotiating framework within which this problem has dragged on for many years.
Pragmatism at the negotiating table must not be allowed to undermine the need to enshrine basic rules for protecting our designations of origin and geographical indications.
Under no circumstances must the Commission neglect the issue of protecting semi-generic names in the US internal market.
A specific date must be set for the signing of a final commitment.
The next phase of the negotiations must get underway without delay so that the 17 designations of origin in Annex II can be accorded recognition.
I sincerely hope that the disappointing outcome of this first phase of negotiations can be offset by the second round, which we hope to see concluded swiftly.
A fair and balanced agreement with the United States could be the positive sign that European winemaking, currently facing a number of tricky challenges, is urgently looking for.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am an MEP from the great Eastern France, a region that produces Burgundy, the wine of Alsace â Alsace, where we are today â and, of course, Champagne.
I have a duty, as an MEP who is, indeed, from the Champagne region, to inform you of the following observations, since the essence of todayâs debate is the start of the agreement you spoke of, Commissioner, and which you obviously wish to finalise.
While we too wish for it to be finalised, it is for the reasons that I am going to expand on.
There is an economic necessity underpinning all of this.
The US market, as has been pointed out several times since it was mentioned earlier, is extremely important for Europeans.
In this age of globalisation, however, I would like to focus my remarks on issues related to quality.
At international level, UNESCO regularly acknowledges a number of our sites of interest and buildings among the world heritage sites.
Well, European wines, particularly those produced around the Mediterranean, as was pointed out earlier, have established their pedigree throughout the centuries and millennia.
In an age when, at every important moment, when a peace agreement is signed, when a family party is celebrated, etc., it is wine and, moreover, quality wine that is consumed, quality must be recognised.
Yet, what has been taking place for some decades now?
We have been witnessing the spread of plantations throughout the world â in Chile, in Australia, in New Zealand â and, above all, and this is what is fuelling the debate this morning, an explosion of âCanada Dryâ.
People are reproducing wines left, right and centre throughout the world, quoting denominations on the labels that allude to the vine and the region in which the wines were produced â Champagne, Bordeaux, Porto, etc. â and they are trying to make consumers believe that, in the bottle they are buying, they have a wine whose origin and quality matches what the labelling would suggest.
Commissioner, this agreement that you are going to finalise in the weeks and months to come must prevent consumers throughout the world from feeling cheated and deceived.
We live in an age where the volume of counterfeit products is multiplying; we can see this taking place in the case of clothing items, with Lacoste, in the case of watches, with Rolex, and also, unfortunately, in the case of medicines.
It is quite normal, natural and necessary that consumers throughout the world should be certain that a bottle of wine bearing the words âwine of Alsaceâ, âBurgundyâ âChampagneâ or âPortâ does indeed contain the wine in question.
The quality of our world heritage is at stake, as are the interests of all our European wine producers.
Long live European wine!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for wanting to start the second phase.
You have talked about a first phase agreement on the issue, and you have talked about a second phase that will take into due consideration a number of factors that we wish to emphasise, regarding quality, wholesomeness, protection and tradition.
Commissioner, the European Union has always pursued a policy of quality in the wine sector by means of very specific and very selective rules on wine content and wine-making procedures.
How can we now ask our producers to comply with Community rules and the Communityâs quality policy if we then give third countries the chance to export to our market products that the Community itself forbids its own producers to make?
How can we ask our producers to compete on price with imports that benefit from production costs that are held down through the use of production practices that appreciably impair quality?
Quality above all means guaranteeing a wholesome product for the consumer: food safety is for us a priority that we have vigorously pursued and have regulated more than once; I refer to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and the special Food Safety Authority.
The positive effects of wine on human health are now well known: they depend not just on its organoleptic properties but on its hygienic and sanitary status as well.
The lack of any indication of origin of the wine, moreover, means that the consumer cannot identify it, and it also leads to difficulties for producers who incur extra costs in order to make a superior quality product.
It is our job to ensure that the wine on our tables â on the tables of European consumers â is both wholesome and good quality.
Our wine-making traditions, Commissioner, are no less important.
This morning we have invoked our ancient culture, our specialities and our territorial diversity.
In a word, it means ensuring that the geographical indications for our wines are respected and that our production in this sector thereby remains competitive.
I do not see sufficient protection for our geographical indications in this agreement; I do not find it consistent with the position that the European Union is advancing in the WTO negotiations; and I do not find in it that same firmness of resolve that you yourself, Commissioner, reaffirmed last week in the Council.
If we want to protect our indications in the Doha Round, we must do so, particularly through bilateral negotiations, without making any concessions.
The agreement does not respect our producers; it does not respect our consumers; it does not respect our market; and it does not respect the European Unionâs identity on the international stage.
It is not a case of closing the market â far from it â but of ensuring fair, undistorted competition, in which both product quality and consumer protection really can prevail.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union-United States wine agreement provides a stable legal framework for our trading relations and is therefore a worthwhile step forwards.
I am pleased to tell Commissioner Fischer Boel that I acknowledge its merits.
Like many other Members of this House, I consider it essential that in phase two the Commission does not lose sight of the priorities for the Community market, which are to ensure definitive results regarding the protection of denominations of origin and regarding the restrictions to be placed on the recognition of wine-making practices.
I believe my fellow Membersâ concerns on this matter are justified and I trust that, through close dialogue with Parliament, the Commission will press for these objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are all agreed that wine is among agricultureâs most elegant products.
Some 265Â million hectolitres of wine are produced every year, two-thirds of them in Europe.
The Wine Agreement between the EU and the USA is first to be concluded with the object of securing this important market for sales from the EU.
The intention is that this agreement should dispel the legal uncertainty that has marked this trading relationship for many years, and it was designed to benefit producers on both sides of the Atlantic.
The conclusion of this first agreement is meant to create the conditions for future close cooperation with the USA in the wine sector and protect designations of origin in the EU.
The Commissioner herself described this agreement as an important first step, and said that it is still not without faults.
Like the other Members, I am much obliged to her for this statement.
The European Union is doing something it has never done before by agreeing to the principle of the unconditional recognition of oenological processes.
The Member States had hitherto always argued that there should be what they termed an international code of definitions for wine and the processes involved in its manufacture.
It is for that reason that I believe doing this puts a question mark against the continued existence of the international organisation, the OIV.
As far as the protection of European designations of geographical origin is concerned, the concessions made in this agreement go too far.
They affect all those regions that base their quality systems on designations of origin or traditional terminology.
While there is no doubt that we need a trade agreement with the USA, what we need is an agreement with unambiguous legal provisions that do not undermine existing European law and requirements and offer a secure future to our European high-quality wines.
There is to be another round of negotiations once the first agreement has been in force for ninety days.
I believe that this approach is absolutely right, proper and necessary, and I hope that the decisions taken then will make it possible for us to withdraw the criticisms we have expressed today.
All the best, Commissioner!
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mrs Klass and Mrs Herranz Garcia for bringing this subject to the Chamber so promptly, thus giving it the importance it deserves.
Wine is one of the products that is facing increased international competition as a result of the globalisation and liberalisation of the markets.
Wine is one of the few success stories that we can enjoy in Europe.
Our designations of origin are the fruit of centuries of tradition and form part of a culture for which wine is one of the major flag-bearers.
At this point, it is worth mentioning the Doha Declaration and the WTO General Council statement of 31Â JulyÂ 2004 in Geneva, which introduced the concept of ânon-trade concernsâ.
These aspects, which one might call non-quantitative, must be taken on board in any agreement, including this agreement with the United States, a country that imports 40% of our wine exports.
If so, they should guarantee that when the negotiations are over we can rest assured that the door will not be left ajar for future restrictions in other negotiations with third countries, either on a bilateral basis, or with the WTO.
For there to be a fair agreement, it is not enough simply to liberalise.
Rules on quality must be put in place, because our designations of wine origin represent what is referred to as intellectual property, something that requires protection in the same way as copyright.
This first agreement was concluded, in my view, with little transparency and with Parliament somewhat pushed aside.
We therefore need to know what the United States actually accepts in terms of our wines with designation of origin.
For example, from what I have read in the newspapers, we do not know whether or not Madeira wine and Port wine are included among those that the United States accepts as designations of origin.
We are prepared to make some concessions and adjustments to winemaking practices, but we cannot accept the idea that our designations of origin, which are genuine intellectual property and which characterise our culture even more than trade, are not respected in full.
To conclude, I therefore feel that if an agreement is necessary â and I accept the need for one â then such an agreement must not be at any cost, and especially not at the cost of our traditions and our culture when it comes to designations of origin.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the only reason I can imagine for your self-satisfaction with the signature of this Agreement is the fact that it has brought to an end twenty years of negotiations and that the United States absorb 40% of the external market in our wines.
Nevertheless, Commissioner, in the first phase, the United States have achieved 100% of their wishes and we have left Europeâs interests for the second phase.
Our adversary in the negotiation has once again been paid in advance.
Furthermore, Commissioner, we have lost our main weapon in this contest.
The main weapon available to us if we were not to accept the wine-making practices of the United States was, precisely, that our designations of origin should be recognised, and we have lost that weapon.
We have paid and we have ended up without the weapon which could have provided us with ammunition with which to defend our interests.
Furthermore, we are running the risk that, from now on, certain Community producers may also call for greater flexibility in the Community rules on wine-making practices, which could lead to unwanted changes and put an end to our ancient wine-making culture for good.
Commissioner, I am also thinking of certain designations that are so emblematic in my country, such as Sherry or MÃ¡laga.
What will happen to them?
What is going to happen during the second phase of the negotiation?
For all of these reasons, I believe that it is rather shameful that the European Union should surrender to the United Statesâ wishes as a result of threats.
They have threatened us with closing our markets and we have given in. And we have not achieved what we really wanted: to defend our designations of origin once and for all.
I believe, Commissioner, that we must be firmer in our negotiations, that we must learn from others and not pay in advance, and above all, that we must not pay with the money of the European producers.
Â Â  Before I call the Commissioner, perhaps I might be permitted a personal comment.
I have been a Member of this House for some time, and rarely have I experienced such an interesting and committed debate, but it is one that I also regard as an example of Europeanisation and globalisation.
Only a few years ago, when we spoke in terms of âusâ, each of us meant his or her own nation, and, even so, we had exactly the same problems with mutual recognition, designations of origin, certification, and mandatory labelling.
All these things we once fought long and hard to secure for Europe, and now it seems that we have to do the same again for a global market that has shrunk.
The American Professor Jeremy Rifkin is quite right to say that Europeans are best equipped, by reason of these laborious experiences of things that the world is now having to get to grips with, to deal with these problems, for we have been through them already and know how they need to be addressed.
Now, Commissioner, we are all agog to learn how you propose to sort out the problems with wine.
Everyone present â including the spectators â knows how important wine is to their own winegrowers.
How, then, Commissioner, are we to solve these problems?
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very encouraged by all the contributions made on this very important issue.
As I mentioned in my statement, I welcome the conclusion of the first phase agreement on trade in wine between the European Community and the United States.
I welcome the conclusion of this agreement on trade between the European Community â which, as many of you have mentioned, is the birthplace of wine â and one of the leading countries in the New World Wine Trade Group.
I am convinced this development is positive not only for the Community and the United States, but also for the world at large. I am also convinced that the conclusion of this first phase agreement will pave the way for further discussions and cooperation with the United States in the wine sector, which is in the clear interest of the Community, and in particular its wine sector.
At the same time, I have taken note of all your remarks, which I will not underestimate.
The negotiations for the second phase, which as I mentioned previously will begin within 90 days of the entry into force of the agreement, will allow us to act on many of the remarks made today.
