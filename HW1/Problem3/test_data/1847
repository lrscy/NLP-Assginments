We must also involve the Arab States, which can, and today must, do much more from economic and political points of view.
In this regard, I would like to refer to the initiative of the Beirut peace plan, with a view to bringing Hamas closer to that plan as well, a plan that on other occasions has been called the âArab peace planâ, since I believe that may offer certain possibilities in terms of progressing in that direction.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at this point we must not forget that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict falls within the context of a serious crisis that affects the whole of the Middle East region.
We must work on the peace process, bearing in mind the positive role that the States of the region can play, but also bearing in mind the negative role that certain States can play, and certain negative influences and negative repercussions, such as the situation in Iraq or the situation in Iran.
Mr President, I shall draw to a close so that you do not have to ask me to stop.
The results of the elections in the occupied territories and in Israel have undoubtedly created a new situation.
I believe that the European Union must approach it on the basis of two principles which may apparently, but only apparently, seem contradictory: rigour and flexibility.
Why rigour?
In order to maintain the principles that have defined Europe's position since the Venice European Council of 1980, that is to say, respect for the rights of the Israeli and the Palestinian people, which must be consolidated in a negotiated solution, which leads â as I have said so many times and all of you have repeated â to the creation of an independent, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State living peacefully alongside Israel.
And flexibility, in order to adapt to the development of a reality on the ground which is going to change, which can be changeable, and to support any solutions that may allow progress to be made towards peace.
I would also like to address the Palestinian Government in a very direct way from this Chamber, which represents the heart of the European Union.
Hamas cannot change its past, but it can and must change its future.
I would like to say to the leaders of Hamas that if they decide that there is no place in that future for terror, for violence or for denying the reality of the State of Israel, the European Union will know how to respond appropriately, as it has always done.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think Mr Solana has already covered nearly everything, but let me add a few comments because the Commission is facing a very difficult period of profound and rapid change in the Middle East.
How we react and how the parties position themselves will have a determining influence on the prospects for moving towards what I hope will be a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
We have congratulated acting Prime Minister Olmert on Kadimaâs election victory.
This undoubtedly represents some shift in Israeli politics and we await with interest the outcome of the coalition negotiations currently taking place.
That will take some time.
Let me underline that we, as the European Union, stand ready to work with the next Israeli Government to promote security and peace, but for both Israelis and Palestinians alike.
I am convinced that the majority of the population in both countries profoundly desires a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict.
As for the European Unionâs bilateral relationship with Israel, our sincere wish is to reinforce a strong, balanced relationship between us, reflected in our Association Agreement and in our ENP Action Plan.
We want to continue the progress that already has been made in implementing the action plan in areas such as human rights, the protection of minorities, research and development, as well as economic integration.
There has been much speculation about the impact these elections will have on the prospects for peace, which MrÂ Solana has just tried to outline.
One might be tempted to believe that the election result broadly endorsed acting Prime Minister Olmertâs avowed intention to proceed with the establishment of permanent borders for Israel by 2010, following further disengagement from the occupied West Bank.
The question for us is how this will be done.
We strongly believe that Israelâs legitimate security concerns cannot be metÂ â and I would like to reiterate this on behalf of the CommissionÂ â through unilateral action or decisions imposed by force.
Only a negotiated settlement will be sustainable.
The European Union would only support changes to the pre-1967 borders that were agreed by consensus between the parties.
We support a two-state solution leading to a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side by side within secure and mutually recognised borders.
I think it is important to say again and again that we should underline to our Israeli partners the importance of refraining from any action that may prejudice final status negotiations.
The Commission expects the next Israeli Government to reaffirm its commitment to a negotiated solution by full implementation of the Quartetâs roadmap, and to show this in deeds as well as words.
But as ever, we have to work with both sides.
Just as we must be clear with the new Israeli Government, we also have to be very firm with the new Palestinian Government.
There can be no compromise on the Quartetâs principles â Mr Solana has just outlined them, we have mentioned them in the Council statement, we have also mentioned them in the Quartet.
We expect the new Palestinian GovernmentÂ â sworn in last weekÂ â to commit to the principles of non-violence, recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the roadmap, which then bind the Palestinian Authority to the fundamental principles of peace, democracy, respect for the rule of law and human rights.
Of course, we have heard quite a number of comments, some of which go further; but we have also seen some very slight signs of possible solutions, possible changes.
We are fully aware of the considerable economic and humanitarian needs of the PalestiniansÂ â and indeed we do not want to let them downÂ â and of the need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and extremism.
That is why the Commission has already mobilised over EURÂ 120Â million to help meet the basic needs of the Palestinians and to stabilise the finances of the caretaker government, which has just left office.
That is why we intend to continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid and assistance for basic human needs.
But, and I must repeat this because it will be the basis for what can be done, unless the new government complies with the Quartetâs conditions, there can be no âbusiness as usualâ.
Unless circumstances change, there will inevitably be an impact on assistance to the Palestinian Government, which the Commission is now reviewing in line with the Quartet statement.
In this regard, we are just preparing the next Council, where we will try to come up with lines of approach; we will not have full solutions, but we will try to move in the right direction.
So the onus is clearly on the Palestinian side, and on the new Israeli Government to act responsibly in fulfilling its obligations.
I firmly believe that both sides, especially the population, are tired of the conflict and desperate for peace, but it is up to their leaders to show responsibility and statesmanship as we move forward.
It is in their hands, and only in theirs, to put an end to the violence and despair that has blighted the lives of so many generations.
We are ready to work both within the European institutions and with the international community to make this possible, even in the most difficult circumstances.
Â Â  . Mr President, having heard the statements by the High Representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I believe that the terms of the always complex equation of war and peace in the Middle East are very clear: a coalition government in Israel, following the 28 March elections â the Commissioner has made a statement in which she said that we must move ahead with the development of the association between the European Union and Israel â and a government of a single hue, Hamas, in the occupied territories.
As Mr Solana has said, all of this comes within a context of positives and negatives.
Positive; the entry into force of the European Union-Lebanon Association Agreement on 1 April â the next meeting of the association council will take place over the coming days.
Negative; the situation in Iraq and in Iran, in relation to which we should really wait for the 30 day time limit that the United Nations Security has set for Iran to comply with the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency to elapse.
I believe that our political group has no option but decisively to support the Quartetâs decision to call upon the Hamas Government to renounce violence and to recognise the State of Israel, as well as the agreements signed by the Palestinian National Authority.
Within this context I would like to put three questions to Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
The first is whether, during the meeting of the Quartet on 30 March, they noted any dissent from Russia, in view of Hamas's visit to Moscow and the European Unionâs position on the Belarus elections.
Secondly, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, it is clear that the European Union must continue to provide humanitarian assistance, because the situation in the Gaza Strip is horrendous, and the number of people living in poverty has rocketed.
But what does the European Commission intend to do in order to ensure that that humanitarian aid is not used for the purposes of terrorist activities?
Finally, Mr Solana, we all understand the need to support the Palestinian National Authority, but, in a context such as this, is the Palestinian National Authority still relevant, when it comes to working with a government that has not recognised the agreements previously signed by that authority?
I shall end, Mr President, by saying that, this morning, the President of Malta has said that the European Unionâs voice must be the voice of reason, and I believe that both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have demonstrated very clearly that they are the voice of reason for the European Union, which must continue to work on this damaging Middle East conflict for the cause of non-violence, democracy, peace, harmony and reconciliation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the agitation that had preceded the Palestinian and Israeli elections is subsiding, and the situation is clearer.
We find ourselves faced with new parties, new actors and new difficulties, but perhaps also faced with hope.
Both the Palestinians and the Israelis want an end to the conflict and feel the urgent need to fight against poverty.
This equation is not bad after all, and if the European Union wants to play a part in it, then it must tackle three problems.
Firstly, it must support Palestine financially, and that includes not only the basic needs, but also the public services that are on the verge of collapse.
In Gaza, where 35% of workers are employed by the Palestinian Authority and where 75% of Palestinians live below the poverty line, famine is starting to become rife, employees are no longer being paid and, according to official sources, avian influenza could combine with human influenza and give rise to the dreaded pandemic.
This support for the public services cannot, however, take the form of support for an unofficial presidential administration that would set itself up more or less as an opposition force.
Secondly, the European Union must hold talks with Hamas, under certain conditions, certainly, but it must hold talks.
MrÂ Carter had already as good as said this back in January, and MrÂ Clinton recently affirmed it.
For all those who remember the many terrorist movements that have become respectable political parties, but also for all those who want peace and who respect the electoral choice of nearly half of the Palestinian population, it is vital that we begin talks and it is vital that we open negotiations.
Hamas is abiding by its truce, and its Foreign Affairs Minister has just, to everyoneâs surprise, I admit, half-opened a door by not excluding a two-State solution.
Let us seize this opportunity.
The idea of backtracking and of acknowledging the State of Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders is already, in itself, a negotiation, because it implies that Israel itself recognises this drawing from 1967.
Thirdly, the European Union must obtain a guarantee from the Israeli Government that the unilateral disengagement plan is only a plan B and not a plan A. It is true that it is more difficult to negotiate peace than to ensure a reasonable level of security for oneself by unilateral and forceful means.
If, however, the unilateral convergence plan turns into Israelâs secret programme, then that will mean not only the end of the road map and of any bilateral initiative, but also the end of any hopes of peace, and Europe will lose any credible influence it has in that part of the world.
There you have three problems requiring solutions, but I have seen that you have already grasped the main lines of action in relation to this.
Â Â  Mr President, the Palestinian and Israeli electorates have indeed dealt us a complicated hand.
Each electorate seems to have favoured a party that is determined to act unilaterally and declares that it will not recognise or negotiate with the other.
I am fully aware that there is a very important distinction between denial of a stateâs right to exist and refusal to recognise the legitimacy of a party that, until now, has not officially renounced the use of violence.
So, the situation looks pretty bleak.
But could it be that each electorate has given priority to internal concerns, to matters that influence their everyday lives?
Could it be that the Palestinians want an end to corruption, internal strife and administrative incompetence?
Could it be that the Israelis want better economic prospects, social protection and a more equitable system?
Could it be that each electorate voted in favour of what it saw as its own best interests, rather than against the other people?
If that is the case then there could be some hope.
If Hamas recognises Israel, continues to observe the ceasefire and does not resume violence; and if Israel engages in easing the many restrictions, guarantees real rights of defence to the hundreds of Palestinians held in administrative detention, and refrains from holding people indefinitely in such detention, both the new Palestinian and the future Israeli Governments might find themselves somehow able to work together, if only to keep life going.
I know it is a far cry from calls to revive the peace process, but maybe in the short term we can only hope for small steps in the right direction.
We send our best wishes to both sides.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, MrÂ Solana, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult being intelligent at the same time as having a line of action and it is also difficult being faced with negotiating partners who, on both sides, only want to hear part of the truth.
Thus, you have a Palestinian Government that wants unilaterally to define what constitutes Palestine and what must not constitute Israel, and an Israeli Government that wants unilaterally to define what constitutes Israel and what must not constitute the Palestinian State.
Under these circumstances, I believe that we need to look at actual examples.
Thus, if you take the problem of drinking water in that region â and MrsÂ de Keyser spoke about avian influenza â you cannot tackle the problem of drinking water or of avian influenza without negotiations being held between the Palestinian Government and the Israeli Government, because drinking water comes from the West Bank and goes to Israel.
It is the same water.
If the USDÂ 230Â million are not granted by the European Union, then there will be no drinking water either in Israel or in the West Bank.
Who wins?
No one!
Let us consider some examples: avian influenza.
If it affects Gaza, then it affects Israel.
You cannot stop it any more than the unilateral withdrawal from Israel could.
It is not possible.
Not even Israel can do that.
Circumstances therefore exist in which the European Union can force the governments to negotiate because their vital interests require this, and the environment is one such example.
Secondly, as regards the road map, why not make a quintet out of a quartet?
Let us include the Arab League, let us take the Quartet together with the Arab League and let us enter into negotiations by saying, âthe Arab League is present, so MrÂ Abbas and Israel will have to negotiate simultaneously with the Quartet and the Arab Leagueâ.
There might be some intelligent human beings who ban one or two Palestinian representatives from the Arab League delegation, and that would not be a bad thing.
Therefore, we can and we must be inventive, we must be intelligent and we must say things clearly.
The wall is not just a security measure, it is a territorial conquest, it is unilateral and it runs counter to all of the European Unionâs principles, just as the non-recognition of Israel ran counter to the European Unionâs principles.
They both run counter to the European Unionâs principles and this requires an explanation.
A wall built inside the 1967 borders is one thing; a wall as it stands today constitutes a territorial conquest, and that is something we cannot accept.
To conclude, allow me to say one thing: we must be very clear with both sides and make them fully aware that our principles are our principles.
In that way, we will be able to make them negotiate with each other.
I have one final remark to make about MrÂ Abbas: it is true that he was elected, but I, for my part, come from a country in which a certain MrÂ Chirac was elected on the strength of 82% of the vote, a man who, despite everything, now has the support of a very small proportion of the French population.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, MrÂ Solana, those with a sound knowledge of Israeli society assure us, in the wake of the elections, that the majority of the countryâs population are now resolved to accept, willingly or not, the idea that the occupation of the Palestinian territories is, in every respect, a deadlock that needs to be broken.
Unfortunately, the new Prime Minister is pursuing his predecessorâs strategy, namely unilateral separation on the basis of precluding the construction of a viable Palestinian State, on the one hand, and, for the time being, the oppression of the Palestinian people in an attempt to make them capitulate, on the other.
This policy is irresponsible.
Yesterday, the major Israeli daily, , quoted the United Nations in its headline âGaza is on the brink of disasterâ.
In Nablus, in the West Bank, young people under the age of 30 are no longer allowed to leave their town!
Kalandia, in the heart of the Palestinian Territory, has just been turned into a border terminal!
East Jerusalem is surrounded!
What is the meaning, then, of the proposal to negotiate with the Head of the Palestinian Authority whom, I might add, people are making every effort to discredit, as was the case during the recent in Jericho?
In this context, it is almost moving to see new peace initiatives emerge from Palestinian and Israeli society, such as that of the combatants for peace, which is due to be officially launched on Monday.
This initiative involves former officers of the Israeli army, who have joined forces with former combatants from Palestine and drawn from their respective experiences the common belief that the solution to the regionâs problems can only be political and based on the relevant United Nations resolutions from 1967 onwards.
We all pay tribute to the clear-sightedness and the courage of these women and men.
What do they expect of the European Union, though?
Aid alone is not enough: every nation needs freedom just as much as it needs bread.
The fact remains that, by causing the collapse of the last remnants of Palestineâs social, administrative and security structures, the withdrawal of aid, even on a partial and temporary basis, would rule out any hope of just peace for a long time yet.
More generally, what political role should Europe now play?
MrÂ Solana just mentioned the Venice European Council in 1980, which is a good point of reference.
A quarter of a century has, in fact, gone by since another key moment in the history of the Middle East, when we were able to assume our responsibilities.
We had, at that time, officially recognised the PLO and adopted the âtwo peoples, two statesâ principle.
In my view, the current situation calls for a further strong act on the part of Europe.
That act must be aimed at providing new and clear reference points leading to an outlook based on law and at restoring hope among the peace-keeping forces throughout the region.
It was in this spirit that I proposed the idea of making our own institution act as a catalyst: it could decide to hold its Conference of Presidents in East Jerusalem with the aim of sending a real message of peace to all of the key figures there.
Â Â  . Mr President, the power struggle between Hamas and al-Fatah in the Palestinian territories is coming to a head.
The violent events in Gaza over the past weekend speak for themselves in this respect, and the simultaneous occupations of various Palestinian ministries on the West Bank give little indication of there being any public authority or law and order.
How do the Council and the Commission think they can back out of their involvement that helps create this deep internal Palestinian division?
There is not exactly a serious spokesperson on the Palestinian side to match, under these circumstances, Mr Olmert, who has won a victory at the Israeli ballot box.
There should in any case not be any doubt in our minds that Hamas, as a terror movement, has disqualified itself.
Given the growing terror threat by infiltration of al-Qaeda cells in the Gaza Strip and by Iranian activities in close cooperation with Hezbollah in the south of Lebanon, this does not bode well for Israelâs safety.
How do the Council and the Commission assess the explosiveness of these threats and what are the steps they consider taking against Egypt and Lebanon, both of which have, after all, signed association agreements with the European Union?
Â Â  Mr President, following the resounding success of the terror movement Hamas in the Palestinian parliamentary elections, there was the risk that the Israeli electorate would react in an extreme manner, which they clearly did not, since it was the new Kadima party that won the elections.
Now that most of Israelâs voters have decided in favour of furthering the peace process, the question is, of course, âwhat next?â
Irrespective of how the new Israeli government is made up, the Hamas problem is here to stay.
Mr Solana says that it cannot be the intention that the new Palestinian Authority should fail.
That is true to some extent, of course, because the Palestinian elections were conducted fairly and democratically.
It is obvious, though, that the new Palestinian Authority should recognise Israelâs right to exist, observe all existing agreements, and refrain from using any violence.
That is the EUâs official position and I can only hope that we do not move away from it.
After all, the European Union is partly responsible for Hamasâ election victory.
We were too lax when it came to providing support to this Palestinian Authority, which we continued doing to an almost unlimited extent, even if we were perfectly aware of the problem of endemic corruption, even if we knew about the problem of some Palestinian school books stirring up hatred, even if we could never fully remove the doubt that no European tax money was used to fund terrorist action.
It follows that this whole new situation also presents the European Union with an opportunity to restore its own credibility.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr High Representative, during the elections in both Palestine and Israel, it was still clear to me, despite the different outcomes, that the great majority of citizens on both sides are moderate, and that they want peace and an end to violence.
It is important to reach an agreement that will stand up.
It must therefore be a negotiated agreement, because only negotiated agreements accepted by both sides can stand up.
It is important for us to contribute to this and, in particular, for the Quartet to have a greater presence in the region than previously, through their leaders, in order to provide the necessary security guarantees and encouragement.
In this context, it is clear to me that Palestine must be a viable state, and that we will therefore have to continue to provide humanitarian aid.
To what extent that can go through the autonomous authority remains to be seen.
When I read on Xinhua that the new Palestinian Foreign Minister has said, 'I hope that our dream of having an independent state on the entire territory of historical Palestine will be realised one day, and I am sure that there is no room for the State of Israel on this land', in times like these, that is not a good statement to hear.
Maybe that is a misquotation, but, if it is, in any event it needs to be corrected so that the process can carry on in the right direction.
It is abundantly clear that the renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist will continue to be two of the essential preconditions for good relations with a Palestinian government that wants our support â especially financial support.
We need to understand how important this task is: there is a correlation between peace in the region and world peace.
That is why we should help the new team to achieve a breakthrough in the new situation following the elections.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Solana, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, what we need to do is achieve peace, a fair peace and two viable States, and Hamas is making certain peaceful statements, suggesting that it accepts the process and â though still indirectly, in my view â that it recognises Israel.
As you know, its Minister of Foreign Affairs, alluding to peace based on a two State solution, addressed these words to Kofi Annan yesterday: âwe look forward to live in peace and security [âŠ] side by side with our neighbours in this sacred part of the world.â
The Finance Minister has said that Hamasâs intention is to increase ties with the West and also to reach an accommodation with Israel.
And I believe that the Prime Minister is recognising the Quartet when he says that: âOur government will be prepared to hold dialogue with the international quartet about the ways to end the conflict and install calm in the region.
Our government will spare no effort to reach a just peace in the regionâ.
I believe that it is the Unionâs duty to take this new reality into account and to lead a strategy that puts an end to the current deadlock, for the sake of two peoples, of two viable States and a fair peace.
Â Â  Mr President, the result of the Israeli elections gave the answer of the people in Israel.
All Knesset parties are committed to the peace process and the majority says yes to the convergence plan proposed by Mr Olmert, which sets out a two-state solution.
Regarding the Middle East peace process, I would like to say that looking at the Palestinian elections we must remember that democracy is not just about a free ballot box and not simply about the process.
We cannot define and approve âdemocracyâ as being a âterrorist government that was democratically electedâ, as in the Palestinian case.
Democracy is about EU values of peace and respect, not about wanting your neighbour to disappear from the worldâs map as Mr al-Zahar, the new Palestinian Foreign Minister, put it this week. He said: âI dream of hanging up a huge map of the world which does not show Israel on itâ.
The EU must demand that the PA Government renounces violence, recognises the State of Israel and the relevant agreements and commits to the roadmap, otherwise the EU should not legitimise Hamas in any way.
Now that it has no partner on the Palestinian side, Israel needs all our support to continue its commitment to the peace process.
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago American diplomats were forbidden to make contact with officials in any Palestinian Government agency controlled by Hamas.
At the same time, Canada suspended aid to the Palestinian Authority and President Bush stated that he would not agree to aid a Hamas-led government.
However, one has to understand that Hamas was elected in a free and fair election.
I welcome the recent statements made by Mr Haniyeh that his government would cooperate with Mr Abbas, which seems to transmit a softer image of Hamas.
Yesterday the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the same statement.
We must continue to endorse the Quartetâs statements that the new Palestinian Government needs to commit itself to the principles of non-violence, the recognition of Israel and the acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the roadmap.
We must never forget that suspending aid to the Palestinians would make it look as though we were directly punishing the Palestinian people for their choice, and subsequently we would increase their suffering.
The European Parliament has to contribute to all possible efforts to restore peace, not only between Israel and Palestine, but also in the wider Middle East region.
Â Â  Mr President, you introduced Mr Solana as the High Representative of the European Unionâs common foreign and security policy.
Which common foreign and security policy is that?
Perhaps it was the one contained in the proposed European Constitution so roundly rejected by the French and Dutch in last yearâs referendums, and which would be rejected by the British, if they were given the opportunity.
The European Unionâs common foreign and security policy has no legitimacy.
Mr Solana has no legitimacy as the EUâs de facto foreign minister.
Mr Solana speaks as though the European Union common foreign and security policy is an accomplished fact.
Again and again the EU assumes illegitimately the role and characteristics of a political state.
This is not a debate about how to solve the problems in the Middle East.
This is a debate about how to further an illegitimate United States of Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Solana, coincidentally, elections have taken place recently in several unsettled parts of the world such as Belarus, Ukraine, Palestine and Israel.
The European Union plays a key role in all those areas. This is to be welcomed, as the United States is no longer an objective player in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
MrÂ Solana, I believe you are charged with expressing the wishes of the Union as a whole and of all the political groups represented in this Chamber.
Israel has itself experienced what it is to be a stateless nation.
It created its state by force and should therefore set a good example by agreeing to the creation of the Palestinian State.
Only then should it demand that Hamas recognise the state of Israel.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am very pleased with the statements by the High Representative and the Commissioner.
By the way, you speak for the majority of this House and for the majority of Europe, and certain others need to accept that.
I am also very pleased about the emphasis placed on the need for a negotiated solution.
It is true that we need to negotiate, but that means that Hamas and Israel must also be prepared to do likewise.
Thinking about Gaza, Israel did not negotiate there.
Of course, we also need to explore the reasons why Hamas was elected.
For years, another government, namely Fatah's, was undermined, partly by its own fault â through corruption and other circumstances, for example â but also due to Israel's refusal to accept it as a negotiating partner.
Even following MrÂ Arafat's death, when MrÂ Abbas was President â and this was during the withdrawal from Gaza â it was not accepted.
It therefore takes two to negotiate, and both sides need to be willing.
Secondly, Israel's right to exist, in a peaceful climate and within reasonable borders, must obviously be recognised, but Israel must also accept, at least in principle, that the UN's resolution regarding its borders is right.
It is quite clear that corrections will still need to be made â we all know that, if we are realistic â but if even the principle is not accepted, there will be difficulties.
My third point is that we must do all we can to improve the situation in Gaza, including economically, so that Gaza is viable.
The withdrawal of troops alone cannot guarantee that.
Finally, we are deeply concerned at the developments in East Jerusalem.
Even though we welcome Kadima and the reasonableness of its members, when it comes to East Jerusalem they do not yet have the sense to acknowledge both that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that the Palestinians have a claim to East Jerusalem.
That should continue to be a clear policy within the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, coupled with the election of Hamas, the vote in Israel will have a defining influence on the prospects for peace in the Middle East.
The Israeli election was widely regarded as a referendum on unilateral action to establish permanent borders.
However, 25% of the vote clearly does not give Kadima such a mandate and, even if it could garner additional support in the Knesset, a unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank and the unilateral setting of borders not in accordance with the 1967 borders cannot be a solution.
Only a peaceful, negotiated settlement can address the legitimate and long-standing concerns of the roadmap process.
All parties must pursue a path of positive engagement, as set out by the Quartet, which includes talks with the new Palestinian Authority.
It is no easy thing to expect the international community to engage with those yet to renounce violence, but until that time comes, we have no alternative if we wish to move forward.
Give them an alternative to hopeless violence and a reason to rise to the challenge.
Alternatively, make their situation worse and they will simply dig in more.
If a constructive relationship with the EU and international pressure can bring Ariel Sharon from his early political career to the legacy he has given to Kadima, this surely proves that positive engagement can shift seemingly zero-sum mentalities.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, after three days of rain in the occupied territories, this wall, which, as all of you have said, is illegal, caused a build-up of water that swept away the bodies of two dead brothers at Bi'ilin.
Israeli soldiers prevented excavations to let out the water; the bombardment of northern Gaza has destroyed agricultural areas and killed civilians.
Nablus and Hebron are surrounded and incursions are being made there.
We have a great deal of responsibility, and we cannot keep on repeating the clichÃ© about two peoples and two states.
There are not two peoples and two states: there is one state and something in development, a territory that is being constantly torn apart, both by this illegal wall and by force.
Kadima and the Labour Party might represent an opportunity.
I am in favour of exploiting all opportunities, but not in silence: we have to ask, and ask forcefully.
For two years now Hamas has declared and observed a ceasefire, and has halted its activities.
Let us be extremely clear about this: for the last two years Hamas has not undertaken any activities, and must never do so again.
Let us not, however â as we have since 1980 â keep on repeating the line about two peoples and two states, while all the while bearing witness to what is, quite simply, the theft of Palestinian land.
We need to be active with regard to Hamas, but also with regard to Israel, so that it understands that the international community has meaning.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Hamas may well have put on sheepâs clothing, but beneath that sheepâs clothing the wolf can still sometimes be seen, if it is really true that, in the last few days, the Interior Minister, SaidÂ Siam, in moving away for the first time from a practice introduced by PresidentÂ Arafat to help secularise the country, has encouraged a visible sign of the Talibanisation of Palestine along Hamas lines, by allowing Palestinian policemen to grow their beards.
This goes against the previous policy of the Palestinian police, and is a means of showing full respect for the teaching attributed to Mohammed, which says that in order to distinguish yourself from the infidels you should let your beard grow and clip your moustache.
This is a process of Talibanisation, therefore, which is rather worrying at a time when, after the identification of a would-be Saudi suicide bomber, a genuine Al-Qaida presence has been found within the borders of the State of Israel.
Taken overall, this situation looks extremely worrying.
Nor can the statements made by ForeignÂ MinisterÂ al-Zahar, widely publicised by the international press, in which he gave hope of an open-minded attitude towards recognising Israel, and therefore the policy of two States, be seen as particularly encouraging or reassuring, given that only a few days before this same individual issued an incredible statement saying that his dream would be to hang on the walls of his home a fine map of the world on which the State of Israel did not appear.
The Talibanisation of Palestine is cause for concern. Europe must open its eyes to this very real danger.
Â Â  Mr President, faced with the government of Palestine being in the hands of the terrorist group Hamas and with its refusal to give up violence and to recognise Israel, it seems to me right and necessary that Israel should unilaterally make provision to define and defend its own borders.
To do otherwise would be to fail in providing security for its citizens and that must be the prime concern of any government.
I would therefore encourage Israel, whatever the international pressures, to be resolute and constant in this regard.
No good ever comes from pandering to terrorists or their political apologists and I hope that Israel, the EU and Mr Solana will not waver in following such a line and that they will not waver in insisting that the only way forward is for Hamas to give up violence and recognise Israel.
Â Â  â Mr Solana, Commissioner, out of all of the topics discussed here, I have focused on the words of Mr Solana, describing the situation in the Palestinian territories and in Israel.
We can derive two main facts from this description.
While Palestinians are governed by Hamas, an organisation that is unwilling to accept the basic principles of international law, the situation in Israel is different.
The elections there may yield a government that wants above all to address the social and economic issues that are viewed by all people living in democratic societies as the most important ones for the governments to resolve.
This notwithstanding, the European Union faces a daunting challenge.
The challenge is that, regardless of how we view Hamas â and I am sure that most of us view it as a terrorist organisation â you, in your capacity as our top representatives for external relations, must find a way of cooperating with the Hamas government.
As we progress down this road, I would ask only that you do not lose sight of the fact that all EU funds given in support of the Palestinians should remain subject to the condition that the Palestinian government respects the existence of Israel.
And I would also like to ask if you could find out from Mr Kofi Annan exactly what was said about the existence of Israel in the letter he received from the Palestinian foreign minister?
Â Â  â Mr President, the results of the recent elections in Israel basically legalised the strategy of the unilateral imposition of the terms of any resolution to the Palestine problem.
It is no coincidence that the political leadership in Israel makes more use of the word 'security' and far less use of the word 'peace', because peace requires negotiation and painful compromises.
Security, on the other hand, is linked to a unilateral determination of the final status of the borders, with maintaining the occupation of East Jerusalem, with the settlements on the West Bank and with the Wall of Shame.
I believe that Israel's strategic plan, strengthened by the new political situation in the Palestinian territories, is not creating conditions of peace.
It is not creating a viable Palestinian state.
On the contrary, it is helping to create a virtual state of unconnected areas without stable borders.
The European Union is right to lay down terms and conditions for Hamas.
However, we do not see the terms and conditions being laid down by the European Union for Israel, because Israel too is flouting the Oslo accords, because Israel too is flouting the terms of the roadmap.
Today, both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner broached the question of greater realism on the part of the European Union.
We need to continue in the same reliable vein if we are to be an effective European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Israeli Labour Party on entering into government.
They are socialists, they are our sister party and I welcome their manifesto commitment that âthe occupation erodes the moral fibre of Israeli societyâ, along with Amir Peretzâs Herzliya speech in support of respect for international borders.
Both provide very important commitments to the way forward.
I thank both the Commissioner and the High Representative for restating this afternoon Europeâs commitment to a negotiated, not unilateral, solution.
To the Commissioner, I repeat our private discussions that, whilst it is absolutely right for her to put conditions on European aid to the Palestinian Authority, I ask her to develop plans to avoid a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories if Hamas does not move as quickly as we all hope.
To Mr Solana, I ask him to consider how easy it was for the Rafah crossing â supposedly guaranteed by the EU â to be closed during the recent Israeli actions, together with the legality of Israel withholding customs payments to the Palestinian Authority, guaranteed under the Paris Agreement.
These are legal obligations to which the European Union and the Quartet have a duty to seek compliance.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make a few brief points.
First, on the three demands as outlined by MrÂ Solana, I support all three but I fear that they are incomplete.
I think that we should not only demand Hamasâs respect for existing agreements, including the recognition of the State of Israel; we should also demand Hamasâs full respect of democratic decision-making in Palestinian politics, of which this was a result.
We need to demand that Hamas does not touch the human rights of Palestinians.
Our full support should go to the Palestinian women that were demonstrating for their rights recently on International Womenâs Day.
Mr Solana said that Hamas cannot change the past, but it can change the future.
It was Ariel Sharon who once said that once you find yourself in power, your perspective on the world changes dramatically, and some world leaders have come out and described him as a man of peace.
We cannot exclude the possibility that Hamas will rise to the occasion.
I would not bet my last dime on it though.
We therefore need a long-term strategy.
It is my hope that the next time we see elections in Palestine, the Palestinian people will vote Hamas out and the only party that will be able to beat Hamas is al-Fatah.
The young generation of al-Fatah, meaning anyone under 50 for that matter, is calling for internal reform, and I think it is right to do so.
That generation has the potential to reconnect al-Fatah to the Palestinian street.
I stand in full support of its goals and I call on all my colleagues to look for ways to invest in this reform movement.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by making some observations.
Firstly, the demographic problem has been at the heart of the political debate; secondly, the Great Israel utopia is no more; thirdly, the social issue has been at the heart of the debate in Israel; and, fourthly, Hamas did not influence the elections in Israel.
Unconsciously, the Israelis have once and for all acknowledged the existence of two States.
It is now time for negotiation, but pressure must be brought to bear on Hamas so that it invalidates its Charter and finally recognises Israel as a valid negotiating partner.
Otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, there will be a unilateral policy on both sides.
Public opinion in the two countries is in favour of peace.
Europe must take advantage of this situation because it now has a crucial role to fulfil.
Europe has expectations riding on it and, as regards aid for the Palestinians, I repeat that Europe must continue to grant its aid, otherwise a disaster will ensue in Palestine.
Â Â  . Firstly, I should like to thank the many speakers here for their total support for our attempts to continue the peace process.
Even in this very difficult time we have to try to do everything we can.
However, the primary responsibility rests with the two parties and we â the international community â have to support them in following this path.
I reiterate that it has to be a negotiated â not a unilateral â solution and I think that has been made very clear.
We all agree that it is important for Hamas to respect the three conditions; it has to renounce violence, recognise the existence of the State of Israel and stand by existing agreements made by former governments.
It is also highly important that the international Quartet remain united.
This will not always be easy, but we will try to stay united as much as we can.
Secondly, humanitarian aid is absolutely necessary.
In past analyses we have seen that more or less half of our aid has gone to the various possibilities for humanitarian aid, not through the Palestinian Authority.
Therefore this aid will continue through the United Nations organisations and international organisations.
We will find ways to do that through NGOs but we will also have to review our position and find some alternative mechanisms.
We are working on this.
However, since this is a very difficult question, we will have to see precisely what we can do.
It also has to be made absolutely sure â and this is what we have to find out â that our aid will not go to the terrorists.
Therefore, we have to find the right balance, which is not easy.
Naturally, we also have to support Mahmoud Abbas. He is the interlocutor at present.
The possibility is there, so we have to try to reinforce his office as much as we can, but again, please be patient as we are still working on the details.
Russia has clearly stated that when it met Hamas, it kept within the framework of our Quartet statement of 30Â June.
The Russians said it was important to talk with Hamas in order to get it into the right line even before the government was formed.
Unfortunately, we have heard that Hamas has not fulfilled all the conditions, although here and there a few first steps have been taken.
Let me also say a few words on East Jerusalem.
We are particularly concerned about settlement activities and the construction of the separation barrier in and around East Jerusalem, which endangers the contiguity of a future Palestinian State and also threatens to vastly complicate the final status negotiations.
Any agreement on the cityâs status must be negotiated by the two parties and should not be pre-empted by new factors on the ground, as I said before.
Statements by the Council and by the Quartet have made that abundantly clear.
We are ready to assist the parties as appropriate, if requested.
The first step by Israel should be to end discrimination against Palestinians in the cities.
There are quite a number of these factors.
Concerning the separation barrier, the European Union has stated on numerous occasions that, while fully recognising the right of Israel to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks, it is particularly concerned by the route marked out for the separation barrier in the occupied West Bank, which significantly departs from the Green Line, unjustly confiscates Palestinian land and severely curtails movement and access.
We again call on Israel to stop and to reverse the construction of the separation barrier inside the occupied Palestinian territories, including in and around East Jerusalem.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to remind honourable Members of Parliament that something very important has taken place in these elections.
The elections in both Palestine and Israel have created a new political class.
The political parties that have dominated life in Israel and Palestine over the last 20 years have disappeared or have come very low in the polls.
New parties have appeared that were created only months ago.
New people have appeared as leaders.
What does that mean?
It probably means many things, but at least for us it should mean something new, so far as the leadership is concerned.
We have to invest some hope in this movement to see if we can take advantage of the situation to move the process forward.
I have the impression and the deep conviction that the result of these elections is a profound change in the social structure of both societies.
On the part of the Palestinians there is probably no desire to have a non-secular government.
I would very much like to insist on that.
I do not believe that the majority of people in Palestine voted for Hamas because they wanted a religious government at the head of the Palestinian Authority.
I believe they voted against other things that are more closely related to the tyrannies of not doing things properly, of corruption, of a lack of proper organisation.
We have to make the effort now to do our utmost to ensure that Palestine, which is probably the most secular part of the Middle East, does not revert to something that probably the majority of Palestinian people do not want.
But at the same time there have to be people in government who are able to produce the results that the majority of people want: social services, no corruption, democracy, etc. This is where we have to make our most important impact.
It is the same in Jerusalem, the same in Israel.
When you see that the Prime Minister is going to be Ehud Olmert and not Mr Sharon, it is really very impressive: what a profound change has taken place in such a short period of time.
The person who led Kadima and Likud, the party that has been running affairs in Jerusalem for more than 20 years, is now suffering in hospital.
There is a new party with a new leader whom nobody expected to be the leader today.
Now, does it open possibilities?
Let me believe that it opens possibilities. Are we going to use those possibilities?
I like to think that, yes, we are going to take advantage of those possibilities. When I talk to Mr Olmert, as I do frequently, I keep telling him unilateralism is not possible.
We have seen that already.
It was not possible to disengage from Gaza unilaterally.
In the end, they first had to call on the international community and then they had to call the Palestinian side, because it is impossible to unravel a situation which is so united and do it unilaterally.
Mr Cohn-Bendit said that it is terrible that avian flu may spread from Israel to Palestine.
There has been a statement today saying that we have to make sure that avian flu does not spread from one place to the other.
The same person did not say that poverty cannot spread from one to the other; that suffering cannot spread from one to the other.
Sometimes, it seems as though we are more concerned about the spread of avian flu and are not really concerned about the suffering, the misery and the tragedy that have existed there for years.
The peoples are separated by a barrier, which may not stop avian flu but may stop people going from one place to the other.
That is something really sad.
We have to be able to do both thingsÂ â to cooperate so that avian flu does not spread, and ensure that people can move, workers can move, and progress can be made, and I think that is much more important.
In 1980 we said something very important, which has been upheld.
Not long ago we said that we believe that the 1967 borders are the starting point for negotiations.
I would like to repeat that today in this Parliament.
We are ready to defend that; we are ready to accept changes to borders agreed by most peopleÂ â by both parties.
But we cannot imagine any other solution that does not take into consideration the premise that the negotiations have to start around the 1967 borders.
I should also like to say that everybody has to be given the opportunity to change.
Mr Cohn-Bendit has changed.
I have changed.
How many people in this chamber have changed?
And I think we have all changed for the better.
Why do we not think that people can change for the better?
Now we have to give this opportunity, but we have to be very tough until the moment they change.
We have to tell them that if they change they will have the opportunity to be part of the team.
But, if they do not change, unfortunately they will not be part of it.
As I said before, it is very difficult to change the past.
Nobody can change his past, only lighten his memories, as many people do.
In the future, yes, we can change.
We have to act to create the conditions so that people can behave differently in future.
I would like to see Hamas change and recognise Israel.
It is impossible to negotiate if you do not recognise that the other has a right to exist.
That has to be reciprocal too.
It is impossible to negotiate if you do not want to negotiate and at the same time you want to have a pistol in your pocket.
This is not negotiation.
That is the type of message we have to get across.
We also have to push for plurality in Palestinian society.
It has been the most secular society and continues to be secular, not subject to an imposed religious society as has been represented in some Hamas statements.
It is a very important point and we have to think about it for the first time.
A group that belongs to the Muslim Brothers has arrived in power democratically.
We have to think about this because it has happened in Palestine.
It may happen in other places, and we have to think about how we are we going to deal with it.
I should very much like these elements to be considered not only by think tanks, but also by political players in the European Union.
I have hope in my heart and I would like you to have hope in your hearts.
Together let us see whether we can fulfil the hopes that I am sure you have in your hearts.
Â Â  What has actually happened with the elections?
In my opinion, what has actually happened is that they have changed the plan of Sharon and his successor Olmert into elections, in the interest of further disengagement from the West Bank area, thereby preserving the religious identity of Israel.
Sharonâs legacy contains three tasks:
- the Palestinian side does not want to conclude a permanent treaty with Israel.
Abu Mazen would be willing to do it, but is unable to; HAMAS would be able to do it, but is unwilling,
- Israel should establish its borders unilaterally, de facto,
- the border should be established along the âdividingâ wall, including the large Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
This would mean a painful and radical withdrawal of approximately 70 thousand settlers.
If this step is taken, three separate cantons will be established, and we can be certain that this âsomethingâ would lead to a failed state.
This is where we, the EU, must make it clear to our Israeli friends that it is no longer in their interest to do this, because it will certainly lead to a further Palestinian revolt, and everybody knows what that means.
The Arab League has an interesting position in this issue: They would envisage peace based on the 1967 borders of Israel.
Perhaps we, too, should examine the negotiations on this basis, and see whether this is the road that leads to a secure peace in the future.
I am more and more convinced that the safety of Israel does not depend on keeping the settlements, but on resolving the conflict.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome of the most recent Israeli elections confirms that the road taken by PrimeÂ MinisterÂ Sharon towards a form of peace in the Middle East that is acceptable to both Palestinians and Israelis is the right one, partly because it is perhaps the only one possible.
The problem now consists in seeing whether the new Palestinian Government will be able to continue along this road in spite of Hamasâ victory in the last legislative elections.
The European Union must take steps to become the main actor in a peace process that has repeatedly seen the EU play a less than active part in the role of mediator, conferred on it via the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
Achieving a genuine form of peace in one of the most fragile areas of the global geopolitical landscape is possible only by means of genuine guarantees in terms of the security of the two countries and, therefore, by means of European political action that is not only capable of guaranteeing development and dialogue, but is also more resolute in condemning the terrorism and violence of those who, even today, want to wipe the State of Israel off the map.
Powers under the Community institutionsâ Common Foreign and Security Policy must live up to genuine expectations of enhanced negotiation for the purposes of ensuring that any dialogue is carried out properly and that the political and social rights of both populations are properly safeguarded.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the elections in Belarus.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has frequently discussed the issue of Belarus â unfortunately, with very good reason.
I would remind you that, immediately following the elections, you held a very serious and very convincing special debate on this matter, in which I also had the honour of participating.
The Council, too, has, of necessity, had Belarus on its agenda for some time now, because the country gives considerable cause for concern.
It is tragic, what the people of Belarus are now having to go through, and we must, today, express our solidarity with them.
I know that you are doing that, as are the Council and, of course, the Commission.
I should also like to join the President in welcoming MrÂ Milinkevich most warmly and to say how pleased I am that he is here for this debate.
I hope that he will draw further courage from the support that all the institutions of the European Union lend to him, his supporters and the brave men and women of Belarus.
I would remind you that the President of the European Council, ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel, spoke of MrÂ Milinkevich during this morning's debate, saying 'we owe him all conceivable political and economic support wherever it is required'.
I should like to emphasise that point here.
Even before the elections, the Council was deeply concerned with the situation in Belarus and had clearly warned the government, in particular President Lukashenko, not to trample on human rights, to respect the people's right and freedom of assembly and their right to demonstrate; it also pointed out, when a minister quite unbelievably threatened to treat demonstrators as terrorists, that the European Union would not accept that.
As we know, and as the OSCE/ODIHR observers established, the elections were not democratic.
This is most unfortunate, as I remember that some here had expressed the hope that the elections might form a turning point.
The European Union as a whole and the Council in particular can now essentially do two things: first, we must make it clear that we will not tolerate such behaviour.
We therefore need to take specific action against those responsible for these events.
The Council â and now the European Council too â has, in principle, decided to take appropriate action against those responsible for violations of human rights and of the rules of democracy in Belarus.
The Council is now preparing a decision that will realise and implement this.
A visa ban will be imposed on a number of people, including the president himself, as the European Council also specifically said in its declaration appended to the conclusions.
The Council is also examining the possibility of further action, whereby it must always be ensured â and I know that you agree with this â that any action taken must not harm the population.
We do not want to take any action that harms the people, and not those responsible.
That is why the second thing that the European Union can and must do â and the Council has already discussed this, too â is take specific action to help the population.
I am sure that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will make a detailed statement and list the specific measures that could be taken.
The Member States also have a duty, and I would say this quite clearly to all the Member States: when it comes to giving young people the opportunity to study in our countries, and when it comes to assisting civil society, then, alongside the European Union â and the Commission is taking specific action here â we, the Member States, also have to take quite specific action.
As ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel said this morning, a group of states, including Austria, has already decided to provide special grants for young people from Belarus, in order to give them the opportunity to travel to our countries, to see how democratic countries work, to learn, and to take the message home that the European Union supports them and has not forgotten them.
This message that we have not forgotten the people, that we want to help them and that we support them is also absolutely essential.
Finally, we must not grow tired of calling on the government to set at liberty those who have been imprisoned.
We must remind them that all that these people have done is to make use of one of their human rights, namely the right to demonstrate and to express their opinion freely.
The Council will continue to do this.
We will not leave the people of Belarus in the lurch and we will not rest until â as MrsÂ Plassnik said â Spring arrives in that country.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that it is a pleasure to see Mr Milinkevich here.
We had a meeting this morning, so the day started well, and I heard directly what is in the hearts of the Belarusian people.
Therefore, I think it was very important to have this discussion today, because we all have seen that the events in Minsk confirmed Mr Lukashenkoâs determination to win this election come what may.
I remember what Mr Milinkevich said to me today, that even if it seems that the elections were won by MrÂ Lukashenko, in reality the Belarusian people have won and Mr Lukashenko has started to lose the elections.
This is very important for the future.
Unfortunately, this was exactly what we had expected.
However, what was less expected was the degree to which the pluralistic forces were able to get together.
I express my admiration for their courage.
We hope that we will be able to continue to give as much support to the democratic forces as we can.
The OSCE/ODIHR official report concluded that the elections clearly failed to meet OSCE standards for democratic elections.
This was due in particular to the arbitrary use of state power and widespread detention, a disregard for the basic rights of freedom of assembly, association and expression, and problems with early voting, counting and tabulation processes.
It is clear that we all consider the elections to be fundamentally flawed.
We particularly deplore the refusal to admit registered OSCE and EU parliamentary observers, including Members of the European Parliament.
We have made this known.
We utterly condemn the violent suppression of protests and the detention of peaceful protesters, including Mr Kozulin, former Polish Ambassador MrÂ Maszkiewicz, and all the other unknown students, craftsmen and workers who took to the streets to demonstrate.
We fully support what the President-in-Office of the Council said â it is very important that we impose targeted sanctions that will not affect the population but will affect those responsible for the fraudulent elections.
We must see what can be done.
The Commission is involved in the preparations.
For the future, we must continue our support for civil society.
We must continue this strategy, because we want to stand by the people and work for their benefit.
However, at the same time, we do not want to work with the government â or at least, we want to work as little as we can with it.
In line with the Council conclusions, support for democratisation will continue through our different assistance tools.
We also have been working particularly on the media front, because we know that it is highly important that people take their own decisions.
The current TV and radio programmes supported by the EC make an important contribution to democratisation, but also to the EUâs visibility in Belarus, which we have discussed today.
There is still much to be done â improvements must be made â but we must continue with those projects.
I agree that we will have to see what we can do in looking for ways to support the students who were expelled from the universities.
Perhaps not at the next Council, but in the near future, we will establish programmes and the Commission, together with the Council, will certainly support them.
We have already been financing Vilnius University, because Minsk has been closed, and we have tried to give the young people a chance.
People-to-people contacts are most important in order to enhance the possibility of working together.
We must do everything against repression, on the one hand through declarations that we officially put out through the Council, and on the other hand by clearly speaking up in our meetings with the Russians, pointing out that we want a Belarus where human rights and the rule of law are respected.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is indeed the case that todayâs debate is in effect a continuation of the one held two weeks ago.
I would remind the House that on that occasion we passed our test of solidarity with the Belarusians with flying colours.
We reacted as was right and proper, condemning the repression and calling for those arrested and sentenced to be released.
Most importantly, we supported the demonstrators who were exercising their rights as citizens in October Square.
It is also significant that a fortnight ago the Commission, the Council and this House all spoke with one voice.
We should continue to do so with regard to Belarus.
The time for political statements is past, however, and it is now time for action.
Our diagnosis is complete and the treatment must now begin.
This means that the Council and the Commission must take a series of courageous decisions.
I am delighted that both MrÂ Winkler and CommissionerÂ Ferrero-Waldner have already mentioned some of these, but I would like to raise a few other issues.
Firstly, if we consider that the elections were undemocratic, it follows that MrÂ Lukashenko does not have a mandate to hold on to power for a third term.
This in turn implies that we must send out a clear call for the Presidential elections to be repeated, as the Belarusian opposition has long been demanding.
Secondly, the list of individuals banned from entering European Union territory should be extended considerably to include various categories of people responsible for violating human rights and freedoms.
Consequently, the list must include not only representatives of the local, regional and national administrations but also university Vice-Chancellors responsible for expelling students who demonstrated, and editors responsible for propaganda in favour of the regime.
Thirdly, visa policy on Belarusian citizens should be relaxed as soon as possible.
This would enable us to implement our principle of not isolating Belarusian society whilst isolating the leadership.
Belarusians need to be able to travel more easily and it is therefore essential for us to facilitate the visa process for them.
Fourthly, we must make our voice heard at international organisations such as the UN and the OSCE, and call for the release of political prisoners.
A Polish diplomat, MrÂ Maszkiewicz, is currently being held as a political prisoner in Minsk and I was glad the Commissioner mentioned him today.
I trust the Council will act quickly to ensure he is released at the earliest opportunity.
Fifthly, it is essential to put Belarus on the agenda for the next EU-Russia summit, because Russia is in a position to bring political and economic pressure to bear on Belarus and this could serve to relax the regime in that country.
For its part, the Union can put pressure on Russia to encourage it to exert its influence on Belarus in such a way.
The Council must ensure that the instruments at its disposal are used appropriately to this end.
Lastly, if the monopoly on information is to be broken, we certainly need to support radio stations and future television stations broadcasting to Belarus.
It is also important to act sensibly in this regard, however, and I therefore appeal for no more funds to be wasted supporting initiatives that do not reach the people of Belarus.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of my group, I too should like to extend a warm welcome to Mr Milinkevich, presidential candidate from Belarus, and, in fact, through him, to greet, and express my support to, the opposition and all dissidents in Belarus, particularly those who have been arrested and imprisoned.
It was already said two weeks ago that we cannot accept the outcome of the elections as the outcome of a free and democratic process.
Paraphrasing what the Commissioner said, I should like to add that Lukashenko did not win, but the people in Belarus were the losers.
That is an important conclusion to draw.
We also have to establish that Lukashenko cannot claim democratic legitimacy and that is why it is a good thing that the European Union has taken visible action.
By imposing a visa ban on him, we have given him the message that, as far as we are concerned, the sooner he goes, the better, and he can certainly not count on our recognition.
We do not want to see him, or talk to him again.
That is the first point I wanted to make.
I agree to the visa ban being extended to include other authorities and personalities in Belarus.
We must think carefully about how we can take this as far as we can, and we are awaiting suggestions from the Commission and Council to this effect.
We could also consider our options with regard to freezing assets in order to get to the governing elite in Belarus.
It is important to establish here today that we must hold firm to all the conclusions we drew after the elections in Belarus.
We must constantly follow the developments in that country.
I was involved in Belarus for five years myself, as predecessor of MrÂ Klich and chairman of the delegation.
Whilst the previous presidential elections were obviously rigged as well, attention for Belarus visibly dwindled after a couple of months.
We owe it to each other, as an institution but also as Parliament, to continue to focus our attention on that country without any let-up.
I was pleased with the Commissionerâs remark about the dialogue with Moscow.
I would also like to hear from MrÂ Winkler what his opinion is of the way in which we can add this item to the agenda in meetings with Russia, because â as I have already said â the congratulations by Mr Putin to Lukashenko were delivered incredibly promptly again.
It would be good, where further measures are concerned, to persuade the Commission and Council to think outside the box.
What can we come up with, in addition to existing instruments, to promote contacts between people here and people there?
For example, it is for us MEPs very difficult to travel to Belarus.
What specific, creative measures can we take in order to establish this human contact, the practical support for people in Belarus in one way or another?
I should like to finish off by saying that we must persevere and certainly not create the impression with MrÂ Milinkevich and his people that we will leave him in the lurch.
We must persist and focus as much attention as we muster in this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have to say, with all due respect â for I realise that the Council is already using relatively strong language as it is â that the statements disappoint me to some extent.
It is still unclear when, and in what way, the proposed sanctions and measures will actually be carried out by all Member States, including the Commission.
Extending the visa ban on government representatives is, of course, wonderful, but what to do with judges, police officials involved in ill-treatment, and suchlike?
Will a visa ban be imposed on them too?
What happened to the idea of launching, simultaneously and with immediate effect, a flexible policy with regard to cheap visas for the ordinary Belarusian citizens and particularly for students?
Or to the idea of freezing foreign assets, better gearing the financial programmes to the specific situations, supporting the independent press and so on and so forth?
When and in what way will something be done about this?
Ultimately, fine words will not get us very far.
It is wonderful when we express solidarity in words, but what we need is concrete action.
What I was looking forward to hear were dates, statistics, timeframes and hard facts.
Moreover, as MrÂ Wiersma pointed out a moment ago, Russiaâs role remains underexposed.
MrÂ Putin congratulated Lukashenko on his victory without as much as batting an eyelid.
He is also the man who keeps the wheels of industry oiled with his cheap supplies of raw materials.
At the end of April, we will know whether MrÂ Putin will continue to apply the bizarrely low gas prices to Belarus.
Everything will depend on the interest which Russia pursues in Beltransgas, the Belarusian company.
Economic gain is thus the objective.
I would once again like to urge the Council and the Commission to spell out clearly to Mr Putin what the EU stands for.
We must now crank up the pressure, not least in connection with the G8 energy summit to be held in St Petersburg in mid-July, but the Council is so far adopting an extremely cautious attitude.
I would therefore ask the Council whether it is scared that taking a clear stand might conflict with other priorities, such as its own supply of energy?
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by warmly welcoming, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, our guests from Belarus, MrÂ Milinkevich and MrÂ Viachorka.
Our group has the greatest respect for the achievements and the courage of the active opposition movement in Belarus.
Despite threats of violence, you protested against the election fraud in peaceful demonstrations.
We also believe that MrÂ Lukashenko no longer has any legal claim on power, and we admire the independence, calm and clarity with which you, MrÂ Milinkevich, dealt with the difficult situation in October Square and Kupala Park.
Many congratulations on this achievement!
We saw in the television reports how the peaceful demonstrators were brutally detained by the police.
For many of your supporters, arrest, imprisonment and expulsion from university were the results of simply exercising their right to free expression, a basic right that goes without saying in the countries of the European Union.
However, we believe that they are the new power in the country and can bring democracy and economic recovery to Belarus.
We hope that the spirit of freedom will stay alive in Belarus.
MrÂ Winkler, thank you for taking on board many of our requests.
When imposing the visa bans, though, please do not leave out those who detained the demonstrators in such a brutal way.
They must go on the list.
Please also remember â as others have already said â that MrÂ Putin supports MrÂ Lukashenko and that this fact must be a focus of discussions with Russia.
Â Â  MrÂ President, our political group believes that the election in Belarus was undemocratic.
A variety of methods was used to prevent the opposition from operating as they might reasonably have expected to.
The media is controlled by the Lukashenko regime.
All this is made clear in our motion for a resolution.
In this situation it is important for surrounding countries to have close contacts with democratic forces in Belarus, such as national movements and free trade unions.
The people of Belarus must not be isolated.
In spite of Lukashenkoâs antidemocratic methods, there is still significant grass-roots support for him.
This is partly due to the relative social equality and relatively high degree of social protection in the country.
However, social protection, which is of course a good thing, can never excuse restrictions on democratic freedoms and rights.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I too would like to warmly welcome MrÂ Milinkevich and MrÂ Viacorka to the House today.
It is my earnest hope that the day will come when you will be able to take your own seats in this Parliament, gentlemen.
We know full well what to think about MrÂ Lukashenkoâs dictatorship.
Europe no longer has any doubts or concerns regarding a policy of isolation, confrontation with the leadership and at the same time, openness to the Belarusian people.
Our noble plans will come to nothing, however, if we do not take on more political responsibility for the future of Belarus.
If we delegate too much of the responsibility for the process of change to Russia, our efforts will be in vain.
Democracy under Russian patronage is bound to be half-baked, just as it is in Russia itself.
Too much Russian involvement in the process of change will impede essential geopolitical changes in the region.
Political and economic stability cannot be achieved without changes of this nature and without genuine links between Belarus and Europe.
Accordingly, not only do we need instruments to provide immediate aid to the opposition, but we also need a broad political plan for a new Belarus, and we need it now.
Such a plan must allow for Belarus to take its rightful place in Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is worth remembering that strange though it may seem, the European Union and Poland do have a common border with Belarus.
In addition, Europe, Poland and Belarus share a common history and I trust a common future too.
This House has recently done a great deal to support the emerging Belarusian democracy.
MrÂ Milinkevich and MrÂ Viacorka who are present amongst us today believe that the dictatorâs end is nigh.
We should not wait for future elections.
Now is the time for us to help strike the against the system which is opposing democracy by force.
Belarusians are an exceptionally peaceful and patient people.
Democracy is developing amongst them only slowly, but when it does come about the European Union can be assured that Belarus will prove a trustworthy partner and guarantor of peace for many years to come.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to extend a warm welcome to MrÂ Milinkevich.
It is not only a great honour to have him here in our midst, but also very important that he should be here, for this is not only a moment of fear and threat, but also a unique moment of hope.
MrÂ Milinkevich spoke wise words on the 19th: the people of Belarus have lost their fear, and President Lukashenko is right to be fearful, for even the most armed dictator cannot stand up to the heroic courage of a people that will no longer be gagged.
We in Europe should now send the right signals.
That means that we must give priority to restricting the visa regime and freezing assets, and that we must also look into a different direction.
We must offer opportunities to students and to those people who cannot remain in Belarus.
We must ensure that they can study over here and be prepared here for a new and democratic Belarus.
Could I also ask you to consider a sanction in the area of arms exports that will hit the Belarusian President where it hurts?
The President extracts much of his funds from the arms export.
One to two billion annually, and a good deal of those funds serve to line the pockets of the President and his cronies.
In terms of arms exports, it may be a good idea to persuade Europe and its allies to take tough sanctions, also with a view to preventing the Presidentâs funds from growing any further, while this will not affect the people.
There is little we can do to prevent the arms exports from Belarus.
As chairman of this Houseâs delegation for relations with Russia, I should like to make one last observation.
Every country is entitled to favour certain candidates or certain governments.
That is also true of Russia, but what is unacceptable is that a member of the OSCE should simply ignore the conclusions of OSCE observers.
The OSCE has stated that the elections are neither free nor fair, and Russia cannot respond by saying that they are fair and by simply congratulating President Lukashenko.
It is therefore important that this should be added to the agenda of our meeting with Russia and also to that of the G8 summit.
It is all well and good that President Putin should urge President Lukashenko to prevent violence, but it is not enough, not by a long shot.
If Russia wishes to present itself as being a democratic country, then it must fall in with the community of values of Europe and uphold democracy and human rights.
Â Â  â Nobody here can doubt the undemocratic nature of MrÂ Lukashenkoâs government.
I too welcome MrÂ Milinkevich and join my colleagues in supporting the Belarus opposition.
However, verbal support alone will not suffice, and therefore I think we should take other measures as well.
Some measures can be taken by the Commission, some by the Council and some by us as Members of Parliament.
These measures must include ways of raising awareness amongst the Belarus people, since an informed civil society is one that is better able to see through important changes.
As an MEP from the Slovak Republic, a country that faced a similar situation over many long years in the past, I can certainly confirm that this is the case.
I also believe that it is necessary to consider the question of visa requirements very carefully, as we will certainly not be raising the awareness of the Belarus people if we prevent them from travelling to EU countries and seeing a different picture to the one portrayed by MrÂ Lukashenko via his media.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the general opinion within the European Union is that we have only limited possibilities for exerting pressure on MrÂ Lukashenkoâs regime, because the Union only plays a minor role in Belarusian politics and economics.
This is not the case at all.
In 2004 Belarus exported 10% less to the European Union than it did to Russia, but last year it already exported 12% more to the Union than it did to Russia.
Clearly, the European Union is becoming an increasingly significant factor in the Belarusian economy.
There are therefore good grounds for us to believe that we can really influence events in Belarus.
MrÂ Klich has already mentioned specific ways in which we could exert our influence.
I simply wish to make one point.
MrÂ Lukashenko has taken action to make it difficult for Belarusians to travel out of the country.
Additional charges have been imposed.
It is not easy for young people to travel abroad and obstacles are even placed in the way of people wishing to leave the country to obtain medical treatment.
In response, we need to do more than facilitation, and here I have in mind the criteria for granting visas.
We need to go much further.
We should reduce the financial resources threshold and the cost of visas.
We could even go as far as introducing free visas.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the need for us to change our approach.
With regard to financial support for Belarus, a number of obstacles should be removed.
I appeal to MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner to enlighten us about the nature of the formal obstacles preventing us from acting in a flexible manner, if indeed there are any such obstacles.
This House will help.
I shall leave you with a maxim, ladies and gentlemen.
As the English and Americans say, we should put our money where our mouth is.
Â Â  Mr President, as election means the presentation of alternatives, acknowledgement of them and afterwards a deliberate choice â the candidate who appears better is elected â it is not something for dictatorships.
The procedure of voting in circumstances eliminating de facto any free choice should not be called an election.
What happened recently in Belarus was only a vote, which, along with the counting of the votes, was in the hands of the government of the eternal incumbent.
He was not given any democratic legitimacy.
Who is Mr Lukashenko today?
He looks more and more like a governor appointed by the ruler of all Russia to undergo once more the well-known dishonest procedure of a fraudulent vote and to continue his experiences on the spot.
We have to state here that the new post-Soviet tri-electoral military union of consolidated dictatorships in Moscow, Minsk and Tashkent is not the way to a better future for the three states and nations.
We have seen the birth of a new democracy in Belarus as a European-linked, not Eurasian, country.
Therefore, as Russia itself now prefers post-Soviet authoritarian nationalism to any âorangeâ renovation there is a growing danger that Belarus will be forcibly merged with Putinist Russia, the basis for which was laid down in advance.
All the world is to be warned about it.
If we do not want Mr Milinkevich to disappear forever, as happened to leaders of the opposition in Belarus several years ago and as is going on in Chechnya every day, the resolution on Belarus sets out the right step, which is first to call on the UN to set up an international commission to investigate previous crimes of the terrorist regime in Belarus, so as to prevent new ones today.
Vincuk Viacorka is here today, temporarily released from jail.
But nobody knows what might happen there any day.
Â Â  â Â Our work in the immediate future must be characterised principally by persistence and insistence.
The Minsk regime hopes that, in time, the Belarus story will fade in importance in the international media.
They hope that Europeans will forget the agonies of this people, our brothers.
This must not happen, and we, as the European Parliament, have a duty to keep the memory of these events alive and to be the conscience that acts as a reminder even to the other European institutions so that no one forgets the cry of these people.
As I said during the last part-session, I am happy to note that attention is being given to my appeal to the effect that we should look after students sent away from their Universities because they took part in demonstrations and for whose education we have to provide in our country.
Moreover, we should go further.
I am also pleased that the proposal that assets be frozen has been accepted.
This is one of the proposals made by the Delegation for Relations with Belarus a long time ago, and I am sure that a look at the action plan we put forward more than a year ago would reveal more proposals.
Mr Milinkevich, we will never allow you to disappear.
Â Â  We are facing a complex situation after the presidential elections in Belarus.
We must be aware of the fact that having won the election, MrÂ Lukashenko feels that his position is secure.
In the following years, he will put even more effort into trying to consolidate his power.
In this respect we should remember a very important factor: the Russian connections, the close cooperation between the Lukashenko regime and the Russian Federation, and the dependence of the Lukashenko regime â and Belarus â on the Russians in the economic and energy sector.
Consequently, if the European Union is seeking an effective solution, one of the important things it should do is to include this topic in the agenda of the bilateral negotiations with Russia.
International pressure must also be increased.
In this respect, the NATO press release of 31 March deserves attention.
Not only MrÂ Lukashenko, but all representatives of his administration, too, must be isolated to the greatest extent possible.
The conditions of various grants must be made explicit and strictly checked, and we must consistently avoid becoming, even accidentally, participants or supporters of the success and consolidation of the Lukashenko regime.
One of our priorities is to provide the Belarusian democratic forces led by Mr Alexander Milinkevich, as well as the civic organisations, not only with moral support, but also with well-considered, concrete financial assistance.
Primarily, it is the Belarusian nation that needs to be woken up and informed â by television, radio, on the Internet and by other means â of the fact that this is not the face of true democracy, of a state founded on the rule of law.
Inviting two representatives of the Belarus opposition, Mr Alexander Milinkevich and Mr Vincuk Viachorka, who had been imprisoned, was an excellent initiative; let the dictatorial regime know that we all give our full support to our two guests.
I trust that you will all support the resolution proposal tabled before us.
Â Â  I support the position taken by MrÂ Winkler and MrsÂ Wallner and for my part would like to stress four points.
Firstly, as the elections in Belarus were unfair, then legally Lukashenko is not the President and cannot be afforded this title in any European Parliament documents.
Lukashenko should not be called President in this Chamber either.
Secondly, in order to fight the indoctrination of the Belarusian people being carried out by media, which is controlled by Lukashenko, television programmes have to be broadcasted continuously from Lithuania, Poland and even Ukraine to the whole territory of Belarus, not just part of it.
Television, not radio, has the greatest impact on people's consciousness.
Thirdly, we must use all means possible to strengthen the united Belarusian opposition.
And fourthly, we must constantly remind Russian President Putin that part of the reason why the Belarusian regime has not yet collapsed is that it is supported by Russia, and it is responsible for this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, 10 years ago a fine story by the Belarusian writer Vasil Bykov was published.
It was entitled In this work the author describes â symbolically, of course â how Belarus identifies with European civilisation, espousing a similar system of values and thus rejecting ideologies based on hatred.
On October Square, the Belarusian people demonstrated that they had recognised the blanket government propaganda spreading lies and fuelling untruths about Europe for what it was.
For a couple of days, that square became freedomâs bridgehead from which appeals went out to the Belarusian people urging them to assert their national identity.
In its efforts to rekindle national identity, the opposition was assisted by the creative talents of prominent figures from the world of Belarusian culture and literature.
I could mention Vasil Bykov, Uladzimir Arlov and Slawomir Adamowicz.
Even young people involved in contemporary pop culture lent their support.
It is therefore incumbent on us to debunk the myth generally accepted in Europe according to which Belarusians have been Rusified to such an extent that they have no interest in regaining their separate identity based on their own particular culture, language and national symbols.
What specific aid can the European Union provide for this purpose?
The EURÂ 2Â million the Commission has allocated to the free media is but a drop in the ocean.
It does not amount to much compared to the USDÂ 60Â million devoted this year alone by President Lukashenko to widespread propaganda, indoctrination and government media.
In addition to support for the free media and independent journalists, funds are needed for other purposes, and I shall mention just a few of these.
Aid should be provided for independent publishing houses publishing in the Belarusian language.
I have in mind not only support for political and research publications but also for Belarusian literature.
Scholarships should be made available for Belarusian researchers and for those engaged in the creative arts such as writers, poets and painters, so they can survive and continue their work.
There must also be scholarships for the students expelled from centres of higher education and for students who do not wish to go into the government system and become totally indoctrinated, choosing instead to attend private centres of higher education in Belarus or apply to European ones.
The only way to respond to regimes that imprison individuals simply for writing a poem is by providing extensive support for freedom of thought and creativity.
In conclusion, and with regard to determining the methods and entities for awarding financial aid to free Belarus, I urge the Commissioner to include in the relevant decision-making bodies people with a good knowledge and understanding of Belarus, its circumstances, problems, and national identity which I mentioned earlier.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, this House has once again sent out a strong message, and your contributions have shown something that I regard as quite vital, and for which I am grateful, namely that you support and acknowledge the efforts of the Commission and the Council.
It is important for the European Union to speak with one voice on this matter and to send the right signal.
The Council and, I am sure, the Commission, too, will continue to work to this end.
MrÂ Klich and others after him raised the issue of exerting influence on Russia.
I would remind you that the declaration appended to the European Council's conclusions already explicitly states that we need to find ways of getting our international partners, and in particular Belarus' other neighbours, involved in this debate.
There is absolutely no doubt that this matter obviously also needs to be raised with Russia, an important neighbour of Belarus.
You can be assured that the Council will not avoid this subject in its dealings with Russia â we have just had a debate on human rights, and there will be other opportunities for this.
We were also asked, hopefully rhetorically, whether we were afraid.
All I can say to that is no, we are not afraid.
We know full well what our values are, and we quite clearly stand up for them.
Many of you pointed out that the relaxation of visa rules must apply specifically and concretely to those people who we want to receive here and show how western democracy works.
That is, of course, inseparable from certain administrative issues.
We are working on it â we want to invite the right people and give them the opportunity to come here.
Conversely, it has also been demanded in the debate that we must put the right people, namely those responsible, on the visa ban list.
The distinction between the visa ban that was already in place before the elections and the current situation is that, previously, only officials were affected, whereas we are now doing exactly what many of you called for: we want to target the politicians responsible.
Somebody asked what the Council was going to do next week, on 10Â April: we will, to be quite specific, adopt such a list, and then there will be no further barriers to implementation.
The Council will also look into other possible sanctions and measures, in which connection we really must be very careful not to take any action that ultimately does the opposite of what we want to achieve.
We must not put people at unnecessary risk through our actions.
We want to protect them, including MrÂ Milinkevich, and we want to send a clear signal that we are on the side of the population and those people who are exercising their rights.
You can therefore be assured that the Council will continue to work very seriously and vigorously and very specifically on those measures that are ultimately of use and that achieve the goal for which we are all aiming, namely democratisation and the inclusion of this country in the EU's neighbourhood programmes.
That, at the end of the day, is what this is all about.
We must tell the people, and show them, that it is to their advantage for the conditions to be met, so that this country too, just like Ukraine and other countries, can be included in the European neighbourhood programme.
Another goal is for this country to join the Council of Europe, for it is the only one still not a member of it.
That is not possible at the moment, because only countries that are willing and able to respect the human rights laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights can join the Council of Europe.
The intention is that Belarus should, one day, be able to do that, and the Council will continue to work towards that goal.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think the key message here was that we would like to be able to include Belarus in the Neighbourhood Policy.
That is what we would like to do, with all the benefits for the population and the country.
Let me answer a few of those specific matters brought up again in the discussion.
Regarding Belarus, we are granting support to NGOs registered outside Belarus for activities benefiting Belarus through the EIDHR, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and that is not natural because, according to our rules, normally we can only work with NGOs inside the country, so we have tried to find a flexible solution.
That flexibility will be continued over the coming years.
An additional EURÂ 420Â 000 will soon be made available to NGOs located outside Belarus under the same instrument, and calls for proposals are there.
Our future assistance tools that will replace the EIDHR and decentralised cooperation for the next period under the financial perspectives will allow for assistance to be granted outside Belarus.
And we are currently finalising a proposal for our assistance strategy for the coming years.
The media project was mentioned.
It was very important to start with the media project that we financed.
We financed five components of the media: TV, radio, the internet, support for the independent written press and the training of journalists over the next 24 months.
We will have to continue with that.
The daily radio broadcasts and the weekly TV programmes for Belarus started in February and immediately â I would say, two weeks after we had signed the contract â we tried to do everything to make the population of Belarus aware of that.
Both the radio and TV components will keep providing independent, reliable and â we hope â very balanced information on Belarus, as well as on the EU, on the diversity of its 25Â Member countries, and on our relations with Belarus.
We, the Commission, will keep on developing synergies with other donors in the scope of this project, and radio programmes are now broadcast by a number of technical providers, via both FM and AM waves â I know that is another concern â and via the internet, which includes downloading options.
On the question of visa facilitation, we know that this is something that has been requested.
The general approach on visa facilitation that was adopted by the Council in December last year stated that, as opposed to readmission agreements, visa facilitation shall not be offered to third countries proactively.
Despite this general common position, we are looking for possibilities to facilitate people-to-people contacts between the European Union and Belarus through measures waiving visa fees on an basis.
It is not yet decided, but it is in the pipeline.
In that respect, the existing and measures under preparation already provide for the appropriate for Member States to hopefully waiver visa fees for visitors from Belarus.
Finally, on the question of students, we are very much inclined to facilitate access of Belarusian students to its universities.
We fully share the view expressed by many of you that students have to be helped, not least because they have been the platform, the basis and the bulk of those who have protested peacefully after the elections, but also because the cementing of democracy will rest very much on their shoulders.
Therefore we can facilitate access of the students to our universities, provided that all the Member States and the Commission pull their forces together and provided that we can find some sort of coordination between Member States and us, and I think the Commission would be ready to do that.
This will also require financial efforts, which we are ready to consider.
We have the Tempus and Erasmus programmes and, along with efforts made by the Member States, I think we can do a lot.
Finally, on Russia, as Mr Winkler has already said, Russia is always clearly a topic in political dialogue because we speak about our common neighbours.
These include the South Caucasus, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.
President Barroso spoke with vigour on 17Â March and reminded President Putin of our well-known position on democratisation but also warned that we would not accept violence on election day.
There was no bloodshed during the elections on election day, but Russia needs to be convinced that leaders other than President Lukashenko would not threaten the special relationship with Belarus.
You can be assured that we will try to go on working for you and with you on this issue.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  (Â The European Union attaches great importance to respect for human rights and the creation of democracy the world over.
It must, however, pay particular attention to events just beyond its borders.
Once again, Europeâs last dictatorship has provided a painful reminder of its sinister nature.
Fraudulent elections, persecution of political opponents, suppression of freedom of assembly and expression, such are the actions of the Belarusian regime.
We support the Belarusian opposition because it is fighting for something we take for granted, namely democracy and freedom.
It is also fighting for the nation's sovereignty, threatened by the dictator's sick ambitions that run counter to the interests of the nation.
We support the opposition not because we share its political views but because of the aims it is struggling to achieve.
We ought also to do everything in our power to make life difficult for the regime and for MrÂ Lukashenko.
People who do not respect values that are important to us ought not to be able to benefit from their application.
The dictator's supporters must realise they have no place in Europe.
Europe is for those who respect freedom, democracy and the rule of law.
MrÂ Milinkevich has said that the dictatorship will not last long and that change is in the air.
I most earnestly hope that he will be proved right, for the sake of the Belarusian nation and for the whole of Europe.
Let us hope that those who are fighting for freedom will draw strength from their optimism and succeed in overthrowing the tyrant.
Â Â  The next item is a statement by the Council and the Commission on the elections in Ukraine.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a difference!
Just a few minutes ago we were discussing the so-called 'elections' in a country where it is clear â as the international observers concluded â that they were neither free, fair nor democratic.
In contrast, we are now talking about a country where democratisation has made huge progress, and where the European Union has made a major contribution to that fact.
The parliamentary elections in Ukraine on 26 March were at the opposite end of the democratic spectrum to those in Belarus.
Apart from a few technical problems and shortcomings, they were free and fair, and gave the Ukrainian electorate the opportunity to cast their votes without hindrance, having been well informed by an active, open and fair election campaign observed by a free press.
The international observers agreed with this.
That is a great success for all of us â a success for Europe, for the European Union, for the OSCE and for the Council of Europe.
We take pleasure in noting that these elections were indeed conducted under the conditions we like to see.
The elections also showed that the people of Ukraine have assumed responsibility for democracy in their own country.
That is a milestone in the process of consolidating a democracy that started with the 'Orange Revolution'.
To me, the especially important thing is â and it is therefore convenient that the debates on Belarus and Ukraine have been held so close together â that the elections set a welcome new standard for elections throughout the region and are therefore an example for the region and for other countries in the Union.
There were technical problems and shortcomings, but not to an extent that should cause us concern.
We expect that the authorities will be able to solve these problems themselves, so that they will not reoccur at the next elections.
Unlike in the case of Belarus, the European Union is now in a position to press on with its efforts to strengthen its partnership with Ukraine.
This partnership is based on shared values that are expressed in the quality of the democracy and the reforms in Ukraine.
In this respect, the elections represented an important step and opened the way to consultations on a new, broader agreement with Ukraine, superseding the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
We are happy to support the new government in Ukraine in its efforts to push its reform agenda forward.
We will make our own contribution to ensuring that the programme continues to live and work within the framework of the neighbourhood policy and the action plan, and that Ukraine continues to make progress democratically â in this respect the country has already come a long way â and also economically, socially and politically.
We in the European Union want to help with that.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will be even briefer, because the President-in-Office has already said it all.
The elections were indeed free and fair, and we can really be delighted with that.
President Yushchenko set himself that target, and he certainly achieved it.
It now remains to be seen what sort of coalition will be created.
The coalition negotiations are in progress, and they are not easy, but it is important that we make it clear now that we will be happy to work with any coalition that wants to continue to work with the European Union and move in our direction.
It is very important for us to indicate right now that we will give Ukraine the option of a closer agreement, in which the issue of the WTO will play a particularly important role.
Once Ukraine is a member of the WTO, we can have a free trade area, which is absolutely vital for further progress in Ukraine.
That pretty much covers everything.
It goes without saying, though, that we want to continue to work with Ukraine as it approaches the European Union, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I was privileged to observe the 26Â March Ukrainian parliamentary election on behalf of this House and the delegation from my political group, the PPE-DE Group.
Those elections, in all our views, were held on the day in an exemplary fashion.
I formed the view, personally, that in many ways the elections were superior in design to those in my own country, the United Kingdom.
First of all Ukrainian officials demanded rigorous identity checks from all voters, something we do not do in Britain.
Secondly, the polling stations had transparent plastic, sealed ballot boxes, which were watched by official observers, as they filled up throughout the day, and were counted on the spot.
In my country the boxes are of black wood, no observers are allowed into the polling stations and our boxes are transported by officials, but with no observers, to a centralised counting point.
Furthermore, Ukraine has no postal votes, which have been implicated in my country, the United Kingdom, as subject to fraud.
The only minor problem we encountered, which reflected the large turnout of enthusiasm to participate in the election, was slight overcrowding in some polling stations.
I also welcome the long-term observer and media monitoring reports, which stated clearly that the entire campaign was conducted in a spirit of transparency and fair access to the media, both by the government and by the opposition parties.
I have always championed Ukraine as a modern European country that is entitled, in due course, under ArticleÂ 49 of the Treaty, to apply for EU membership.
That is still some way off, given the enlargement fatigue that has now set in and the fear of some Member States of offending Russia.
That does not represent the views of either my group or this Parliament.
Nevertheless, in the meantime, the European Union must collectively do more to recognise that Ukraine has demonstrated political maturity in fully respecting European norms of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
We must now reward that irreversible process.
A new government is being formed in Kiev, but I am confident that whatever its composition, it will remain committed to European integration.
That is why our resolution requests from the Council and the Commission that plans be made that go beyond the PCA formulation towards a free trade and visa-free travel area, particularly if Ukraine can shortly join the WTO.
Ideally that should take the form of an association agreement, although the Commission â and I have to say as ENP rapporteur, I might agree with this â might logically argue for an ENP neighbourhood agreement instead in the first instance.
Either way, Ukrainians must be brought closer to Europe, where they rightfully belong.
It is now clear to all of us that the enduring legacy of the Orange Revolution, namely a lasting democracy and free media, is intact for all to see.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, âtogether we are many, we will not be defeatedâ â this was the slogan under which the people of Ukraine gained their freedom 18Â months ago on Independence Square.
They won their battle for a better country.
On 26Â March, those same people, in that same country, 18Â months older and wiser, posed themselves the question as to how to win the peace.
Seventy per cent of Ukrainians went to the polls confident that none of the votes would be falsified and wasted.
That was the start of their battle for peace.
I was privileged to lead the European Parliamentâs representatives within the team of international observers.
These observers concluded that the elections were free and fair.
Ukrainian democracy passed its quality control test, thanks in part to the efforts of this House.
I should like to thank the representatives of all the political groups who participated in the observation mission and spent time in Ukraine recently.
We can rejoice in a job well done.
As to the political situation in Ukraine following the elections, only five groups are represented in the Parliament.
There was a ruthless purge of small and weak parties owing allegiance exclusively to their leaders.
MrÂ Yanukovych and the Party of the Regions won, but they are not trumpeting their victory from the rooftops.
The Orange Coalition led by MrsÂ Tymoshenko, MrÂ Yekhanurov and MrÂ Moroz gained over half the seats on the Supreme Council and will bear a heavy responsibility for past and future events in Ukraine.
The geographical and political divide in that country has deepened, although there tends to be little difference between the programmes of the various parties.
What of the future?
Ukraine needs a strong coalition and stable government.
It is to be hoped that any future coalition and new Ukrainian Government will not be based on historical reminiscences of events on Independence Square, but on a courageous reforming programme.
PresidentÂ Yushchenko has a particular role to play and duty to perform.
In addition to holding the Orange Coalition together, he needs to bring Ukrainians together to tackle the most urgent issues, namely a national reform programme.
The latter cannot be achieved by imposing the will of the majority on that of the minority.
The only way forward is by reaching an understanding with that minority.
Ukraineâs leaders must learn how to compromise and what cohabitation involves.
They must also understand that it is incumbent on them to reach agreement on certain issues, despite their differences.
The resolution before us reflects the consensus within the European Parliament on issues pertaining to Ukraine.
It also places obligations on all those who committed to ensuring progress in Ukraine, including the Members of this House and the European institutions.
Â Â  . â Having witnessed the previous Presidential elections and these most recent elections, I see welcome changes in Ukraine's democratisation process.
Openness of the election campaign, the transparent organisation of the election process itself, voter activity and goodwill â these were the overall conclusions of all international observers and Ukrainians themselves.
It is very important that the democracy process does not stop now.
There are certain things which cause concern: pandering to national sentiments, the high level of corruption, barriers to foreign investment, the abundance of oligarchs on the election lists and the domination of personalities, not election manifestos â these things are all a legacy of the Soviet period.
It is important that they do not get in the way of progressive processes.
Here above all our moral support is needed.
We need to share positive experiences as much as possible.
Countries like Lithuania, which have come from the same Soviet camp, are especially suited to this role.
Europe must increase opportunities for peopleâs cooperation in culture, education as well as simply cooperation between citizens.
We have to help Ukraine rejoin the European family.
A European Association Agreement would be a realistic way of lending a hand to Ukraine.
Â Â  â Mr President, what was the most important thing I noticed as an election observer in the Ukraine?
It was the total dedication with which many citizens exercised their right to vote freely, for which they had fought a year previously.
It was almost shocking to come back to Germany after these elections and to see how unimportant this right now is to Germans, and how few people really value it.
The conclusion I draw from this experience is that Europe can benefit enormously from this process in Ukraine.
We cannot continue with the 'business as usual' attitude that has crept into the relationship between the European Union and Ukraine just one year after the Orange Revolution.
I have the impression â and this is based partly on the writer Yuri Andrukhovych's stirring speech in Leipzig â that there is a risk that Kiev is losing hope in Europe.
That must not be allowed to happen.
Therefore, I would say to you, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, and to the Council: you must be more precise and more ambitious in the offers you make to Ukraine.
You must not allow the statement by the former Commissioner for Enlargement, MrÂ Verheugen, that there would still be no place for Ukraine in the European Union even in 20 years time, to stand.
Nobody in a position of responsibility in the European Union should make such dogmatic statements in public.
Â Â  . I fully support what the previous speaker just said.
I also urge the Commissioner to come up with a much stronger and more specific text concerning Ukraineâs future membership of the European Union.
It is hard to find a more joyful, convincing and heartening example of democracyâs success in the brief history of Europeâs new era.
In particular, the 70% of Ukrainians who exercised their right to vote, a right which was challenged and threatened all across that country only 18Â months ago, demonstrated to us the importance of democracy.
In the European Union we tend to treat democracy as something quite ordinary which does not need to be nurtured.
I should like to say that I believe it is entirely appropriate for the speakers taking the floor in this debate not to comment on the result of the elections in Ukraine and on the outcome of the vote by the Ukrainian nation.
When Members of this House became involved in the elections 18Â months ago, it was not to support particular candidates.
We were supporting the people of Ukraine as they asserted their right to express their will freely.
This right was respected in the latest elections and the people of Ukraine went to the polls.
They now need our support as they set off on their journey towards the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as stated by previous speakers, Ukraine is the European Unionâs nearest neighbour and it has become a parliamentary democracy.
Democracies take a long time to establish, however, and they need to be nurtured.
A healthy free market economy is one of the key characteristics of a democracy, and it is here that the greatest challenge facing our eastern neighbours lies.
Ukraine needs support and it needs to be assured that the Union will be open and welcoming towards it.
This means that we must support not only the values we hold dear but also the interests we have in common with Ukraine.
Firstly, Ukraine can support the Unionâs energy policy.
It has its own reserves of natural gas and the largest natural gas fields in Europe.
Oil and gas from the Caspian Sea can be transported to Europe through Ukraine without involving any other countries.
This requires joint investment in pipelines, assisted by the European Investment Bank, the Neighbourhood Policy and Trans-European networks.
Secondly, as Europe gradually opens up its economy to Ukraine, its common market in goods will become considerably larger.
Thirdly, Union investment in Ukraine could be particularly profitable because of Ukraineâs well-educated labour force and receptive market.
Fourthly, unlike other European countries, Ukraine does not have demographic problems.
Fifthly, an independent, democratic and full market Ukraine will stabilise the situation beyond Europeâs eastern border. It will also stimulate positive political and economic changes in neighbouring countries.
Allow me to reiterate that we must be concerned not only with the key values we defend but also with our interests.
It is important to promote them, and to enter into an Association Agreement with Ukraine as soon as possible.
The principle of free visas for Ukrainian citizens should also be adopted at the earliest opportunity.
Â Â  Mr President, 15 months ago, Ukraine fought for democracy, while this time round, it fought a democratic battle, and there is a world of difference in that.
It is a step forward, one that deserves our admiration and our greatest respect.
The European Union plays a key role in this.
That is exactly what the Commissionâs delegation in Kiev is doing, and, I might add, doing it in an expert manner.
This concrete aid from the Commission and the Member States must now be reinforced at bilateral level.
Those ties must now be strengthened in an ambitious manner.
There is some support for this, but not enough.
Where the European Union was too cowardly to actually condemn Putinâs attitude of unfeeling cynicism towards Belarus, we must now send out a positive sign to the Ukrainians to demonstrate to the Ukrainian people that their choice in favour of democracy also leads to concrete improvements in their day-to-day lives.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am sure the European Union does not regret its part in resolving the conflict in Ukraine several months ago.
It was thanks to the European Unionâs involvement that no blood was spilt in that country.
It was also thanks to the European Union that democracy began to develop in Ukraine, albeit slowly.
It is still there, however, and the recent elections have been a great success.
The question now arising is: what next?
What more can we do to help Ukraine?
MrÂ Winkler has just assured us that there is a will to do so.
I believe the Union must say quite clearly that Ukraine is entitled to join it.
It is high time for it to make a statement to this effect, although obviously the Union will have to set challenging and demanding criteria, and we can expect it to be a long time before Ukraine is able to comply with them.
Nonetheless, such a statement needs to be made, because only an offer of this nature will suffice to spur internal forces into action to develop democracy and the free market economy.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I had the opportunity to observe the parliamentary elections in Ukraine, where the atmosphere was very different from the passions provoked during the presidential elections.
This time elections were free and democratic, and the atmosphere was very similar to what we see in our own countries.
The elections were not, however, free of technical shortcomings.
Inaccuracies in the electoral rolls and the fact that the parliamentary elections were organised at the same time as various levels of local government elections made the voting process long and complicated.
Ukraine also ought to introduce a limit on pre-election campaign expenditure by the political parties, to limit possible corruption and ensure fair competition.
The comparatively low level of support from the people of Ukraine for the Orange Revolution forces can be explained by the fact that the pace of reform over the course of the year was insufficient.
It is interesting, however, that contrary to Russiaâs expectations pressure from Russia in connection with gas supplies and the blocking of exports from Ukraine directly fuelled support for the forces of democracy.
These forces are the only ones that can ensure that reforms continue.
On election night Yulia Timoshenko confirmed to us her willingness to form an orange coalition with the âOur Ukraineâ bloc, including the social democrats.
The European Union, for its part, should state that Ukraineâs attempts to become integrated into Europe are being assessed.
I would like to call on the Commission to provide Ukraine with all possible assistance to enable it to overcome its weak administrative capacity, fight corruption effectively and decrease the influence of the oligarchy in politics, to reform the legal system and thus reinforce democracy.
Â Â  It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ukraine for the fact that the elections, which took place on 26 March, were democratic, free, fair and satisfied international democratic standards.
This alone is a great victory for the people of Ukraine as they create a civil society, especially when one remembers the events of December 2004 which caused considerable concern and ended with democratic Presidential elections, and also the fact that over the past two years, Ukraine has achieved good results as it implements democratic reforms.
Now we can only hope that the coalition, in which the majority of citizens placed their trust during the elections, will be able to come to an agreement and form a coalition government to continue the democratic and market reforms which have already begun, and will consolidate democracy.
Soon after the elections Javier Solana stated that the EU intends to activate cooperation with Ukraine, to support political and economic reforms, which will guarantee the rule of law, and to consolidate market economy principles in the country, and I might also add, to support a more effective war on corruption and the shadow economy.
The EU, like the USA, supports and will continue to support Ukraine's aim to become a WTO Member and is striving to accelerate the country's admission to this organisation.
Ukraine must also carry out its own mission in the region.
By this I mean the solution of the Moldova-Transnistrian problem and in this task Ukraine deserves the support of the European Union.
According to the results of a sociological survey conducted last month in Ukraine, 42.9 per cent of Ukrainians support the country's membership in the EU, while US President Bush has stated that, and I quote, âthe USA is prepared to support Ukraine during the process of integration into the EU and NATOâ.
And how will the European Union itself respond to this?
How will we respond to the expectations of the Ukrainian people and their elected representatives?
Are we, the European Parliament, ready to have a constructive debate on Ukraine's European integration, or simply the European perspective?
I believe that once again the future will depend on the Ukrainian people's political will and determination, on their efforts, as no matter how we look at it, Ukraine is in Europe.
Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union states that all European countries have the right to become EU Members.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would just like to respond to a few questions.
Mr Tannock, I am deeply impressed by your report on the elections.
I would not go so far as to compare Ukraineâs election law with the law of our countries, as different countries have different election laws, but the important thing is that the elections in Ukraine were indeed fair and democratic and I think that is very important.
I was also very impressed by the election observers' report of the great enthusiasm.
In order to keep up this enthusiasm, and the faith in the European Union, we â the European Union, that is â must now take specific steps.
We are ready to do so.
I absolutely agree that it is not sensible to talk about specific timetables, but to avoid stumbling we need to take one step at a time, and not try to run before we can walk.
The next step is to develop greater cooperation.
There is a specific need for this, and the Council will do so in cooperation with the Commission.
We are doing this in order to help Ukraine to develop further and to implement the necessary reforms.
When MrÂ Kaminski said that it was not up to us to assess the elections and the parties, he was quite right. However, we can note with satisfaction that those who advocate a closer relationship with the European Union won and have the majority.
We should therefore hold out our hand to them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I, too, will keep my comments brief.
I should just like to assure you that we will certainly not let this become a matter of routine.
I am sorry that MrsÂ Harms has already left, because I should have liked to have said that to her personally.
It is precisely using this possibility of a deeper and stronger agreement that it will be achieved.
When one looks at what it all involves â quite apart from increased political dialogue â it primarily comes down to cooperation in legal matters and in the particularly important fields of justice and internal affairs.
Firstly, one thing that is particularly important to us, and which was mentioned during the debate, is the issue of energy policy, which, for all of us, is becoming an increasingly vital aspect of foreign policy.
Then there is the free trade agreement, to which I referred earlier.
There can therefore be no question of 'business as usual' in this field.
Secondly, as the Commissioner responsible for this field, I always made my statements extremely precise, perhaps too precise for some.
I should like to make this quite clear: as I have always said, the future cannot be prejudged.
At the moment, however, we are working through the neighbourhood policy, which does not provide for membership.
I cannot be any more precise.
That does not mean, though, that we will not continue to work with Ukraine with great verve and enthusiasm, as the President-in-Office said.
We are very pleased with these elections.
They represent a huge step forwards, and I am delighted that so many of you observed them and share this opinion with us.
Â Â  Six motions for resolutions(1) to wind up the debate have been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on measures to enhance road safety (SAFETY) and security measures in the transport sector, including the financing thereof (SECURITY).
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my gratitude to you for having the topic of road safety on the order of business for today.
As you know, making people in every European state even more aware of this issue than they already are is a particular concern of the Austrian Presidency, the intention being that this should lay another vital foundation stone for a common European road safety policy.
It was this that led the Presidency to call the informal meeting in Bregenz in Austria on 2 and 3 March, the object being to devote two whole days, at European level, to road safety to the exclusion of all else.
In the course of this meeting, and during numerous bilateral conversations, we succeeded in doing justice to the Austrian Presidency's slogan: âCrossing Borders in Road Safety â Creating a Trans-European Road Safety Cultureâ.
I am, then, very grateful to the Commission for its presentation of the mid-term review of the European Road Safety Action Programme, which was discussed during the informal meeting of transport ministers on 2 and 3 March, which I have already mentioned, and most recently at the Council of Transport Ministers on 27Â March in Brussels.
It is at this point that I would like to make an advance announcement to the effect that the Austrian Presidency also intends that the formal Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 9Â June should adopt final conclusions on road safety.
The European Road Safety Action Programme, which dates back to 2003 and aims to reduce by half the number of deaths in road traffic in the European Union by 2010, lays down EU-wide road safety targets for the period from 2003 to 2010, and includes 60 measures to be implemented across the EU, most of which are not legislative in character.
This constitutes a consistent reiteration of the priority of road safety, which had already been laid down in the 2001 White Paper on Transport.
Underpinning all these efforts towards road safety is the long-term determination that in future no more citizens of the EU should be killed or seriously injured in road accidents.
A great deal of joint effort is still required if we are to progress further towards this goal.
It is abundantly clear from the mid-term review of the EU Road Safety Action Programme, which Vice-President Barrot presented to the meeting I have already mentioned, that Europe may well be on the right road, but is still proceeding at too low a speed.
Let me mention just two or three striking figures, which MrÂ Barrot has already put before us.
The goal of having some 25Â 000 road traffic fatalities in 2010, lamentable though they would still be, might well be achieved if we were already making better progress.
If we were to extrapolate from what we have achieved so far, we would end up with a figure of 32Â 500.
We must step up all our efforts in order to achieve as far as possible the ambitious target we have set ourselves.
A successful transport policy rests on three essential pillars â people, vehicles and infrastructure, and, in the course of the meeting to which I have referred, we were able to discuss all three of them in detail.
What does give cause for concern â and this is something I particularly want to stress today â is the trend as regards the numbers of motorcycle and moped users killed.
They constitute the only category of road users among whom the number of deaths is increasing rather than decreasing.
If this trend is not stopped, there will, in 2010, be only half as many people killed on Europeâs roads, but one out of every three of them will be a motorcyclist, as against the present one in six.
Passing on to infrastructure, Europe must be aware of its responsibility for making suitable instruments available to infrastructure operators, for only if it does so will we succeed in minimising the risk to those who travel on our European road networks.
Where vehicles are concerned, it should be emphasised that modern e-safety technology can make a quite essential contribution to improving road safety.
E-safety technology is intended to ensure an intelligent link between man and machine and to enable drivers to free themselves from routine actions.
One of the things on which the informal Council in Bregenz (Austria) focussed was the subject of public awareness.
In Bregenz we had a very brief and concentrated opportunity to study and compare our European colleaguesâ activities in raising public awareness.
The evaluation of the various campaign activities showed that targeted awareness campaigns can in fact achieve a great deal.
We in Austria, too, have done a lot in this regard in the last few years, stirring people up, thinking or making people think and ultimately, and most importantly, getting people to change their behaviour in a way that makes for greater road safety and fewer road deaths, fewer people injured and seriously injured in road accidents.
We also agreed that a joint European awareness campaign on the subject could bring synergy effects and greater effectiveness.
On the basis of a poll, we found that the subjects of drunken driving and fatigue at the wheel should be tackled as a matter of priority.
I am pleased to say that the Commission promised to provide assistance, chiefly of an organisational nature and of course within the rules that apply, and suggested that the High Level Group on Road Safety could be asked to develop a proposal to that effect.
The Commissionâs intention of also introducing a âEuropean Road Safety Dayâ is also fully in line with our common objectives for enhancing road safety.
I am sure that an initiative of that kind will also help to create greater public awareness throughout Europe.
My special thanks are due here to Vice-President and Commissioner Jacques Barrot for his particular commitment.
Significant efforts have been made since 2001 to make Europeâs roads safer.
A number of legislative measures have been taken in both the technical and regulatory fields, for example provisions governing seat belts, the digital tachograph, driving and rest periods, the driving licence or rules for professional lorry drivers.
Initiatives such as CARS 21 or the European Road Safety Charter, which create awareness in European local authorities, regions, undertakings, associations etc., should also be mentioned here. Vice-President Barrotâs activities and initiatives, which include proposals already announced for daytime running lights, blind-spot mirrors and in the field of infrastructure, will help to make our roads safer at European level.
May I say in conclusion that if the problems in some Member States with a high level of transit traffic are even greater than the European average, then we should start where the figures are not falling very much or where fatalities are in some cases still rising, for every death on Europeâs roads is one such death too many.
I want to thank Parliament for the opportunity of speaking on this important topic of road safety today and I would like to say that we must not flag in our efforts to make Europeâs roads as safe as possible and thereby prevent much misery and grief.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Gorbach, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the agenda concerns two issues: road safety and security measures in the transport sector.
I should like to echo what MrÂ Gorbach said in his excellent speech and to thank him straightaway for his personal commitment to this great cause that is road safety.
Thank you, MrÂ Gorbach, for having placed this major problem of road safety at the heart of the Austrian Presidencyâs priorities.
Just as I, myself, had to do when I gave an account, after five years, of our assessment on the basis of the programme that the European Union had set itself in 2002, we must note that the countries comprising todayâs European Union saw 50Â 000 people die on the roads in 2001.
The common objective proposed in 2001 and updated today is not to exceed the figure of 25Â 000 deaths in 2010.
To save 25Â 000 lives!
What stage are we at with this?
In 2005, we still recorded 41Â 600 deaths.
That corresponds to a reduction of 17.5% in four years.
Considerable progress has been made in some Member States in particular, but it is not enough.
As you said, MrÂ Gorbach, the number of deaths in the Union is in danger of increasing to 32Â 500 in the year 2010 if we do not take it upon ourselves to give new impetus to this road safety policy.
Greater efforts are necessary, and the disparities between the Member States must be rectified.
The Austrian Presidency has enabled us to make progress with an agreement on the European driving licence, for which I should like to express my gratitude once again.
I would point out that this driving licence is accompanied by a licence for mopeds and a progressive licence for the most powerful motorcycles.
That should enable us to reduce the number of motorcycle deaths, which is increasing at an alarming rate.
Over and above this assessment and over and above the progress made during this Presidency, the Commission will present, in 2006, new initiatives to be included in the action plan that I will propose in the revised White Paper.
Firstly, a proposal for a directive on the management of road safety in the trans-European network.
It is not a question of us explaining how a road should be made safer, but of the European Union confirming, in each of the Member States, that a great deal of attention is paid to safety when a new road is built or an existing one is improved.
Secondly, a proposal for a directive that will enable cross-border legal action to be taken in the most serious cases of a violation of the highway code: speeding, drink driving and driving without wearing a seat belt.
It is not right that the perpetrator of a serious offence should escape punishment simply by crossing the border.
Finally, as you said, MrÂ Gorbach, we are going to close a loophole in the current legislation regarding the blind-spot mirrors fitted to existing heavy goods vehicles.
We are also endeavouring to make progress with the idea of a third âdaytimeâ running light.
Some Member States already want the opportunity to request this extra equipment for cars.
