For obvious reasons it was felt necessary to establish more ambitious targets in areas such as illegal immigration, border control, the European arrest warrant, asylum and police and judicial cooperation, amongst others.
Something that has also made a positive contribution to these developments, and I cannot deny this, is the dynamism of Commissioner Vitorino, who is responsible for these matters within the Commission and whom I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate.
We cannot forget, however, that these matters are of enormous political sensitivity.
We are invading the traditional sovereign borders of the Member States, a fact that cannot be ignored or played down.
Recent international events are a clear reminder that the European Union is still made up of sovereign States.
It is also the rights and the obligations of their citizens, however, that are at stake here and which must be acknowledged and defined with a sense of responsibility, in an attempt to respond to the needs imposed on us all by the complex current situation.
Mr President, in the short time I have left, I shall concentrate on the new terrorist threats, which require action at European level and solidarity at international level.
In fact, the way in which we approach terrorism these days is completely different to the approach pursued in the 1970s and 1980s.
We know that the terrorist threat today is hard to see and is underpinned by motives other than political ones.
As a rule, it acts illegitimately, I repeat, illegitimately, in the name of a given civilisation in the aim of setting this on a collision course with our own.
Today's form of terrorism is well known: it selects its targets according to the visibility of the results of its action, which incidentally makes all of us and our institutions possible targets.
We also know that it is extremely mobile and that it uses, as we all do, modern means of communication.
We know that its sources of funding are diverse and that this funding is often obtained under the guise of promoting respectable aims.
No less importantly, we know that it certainly has access to arms of mass destruction, especially chemical and biological weapons.
Against this backdrop, we must of course provide responses that go beyond the national sphere and even the spheres of action for justice and domestic security, which naturally highlights the importance of this debate of ours.
The presence of these new terrorist threats undeniably requires action at European level.
Unilateral national action is no longer sufficient to ensure that our populations are protected.
These new concerns do not mean, however, that we should indefinitely extend the rules of Community initiative and of qualified majority in this entire area.
We believe that these developments do not necessarily mean that the Union's procedures must all be produced or implemented in the same way.
I am sure that it will be possible to take decisions on issues of Justice and Home Affairs by simplifying the structure of the pillars, without this changing the balance of the necessary cooperation between governments and national authorities in conjunction with the system of joint management developed by the European Union.
Mr President, the annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice seems to be in large measure directed at the future and not the year 2002.
Baroness Ludford is using her question to press for the abolition of the third pillar, the implementation of the codecision procedure and the inclusion of the Charter in the new Treaty.
This would make decision-making in the Council more democratic and more structured, because there has been a jumble of initiatives from the Member States recently.
In addition to that, the legislative proposals of the Commission in the area of asylum and immigration are getting nowhere, because decision-making in the Council has come to a standstill.
The criticism is justified.
Part of the solution lies in a better treaty structure and the implementation of different decision-making procedures in certain areas.
But I am still convinced that fussing about the powers at European level will not by definition improve the situation very much.
Nor does a European constitution offer any added value.
It is a pity that Parliament does not direct its attention to specific points from 2002 and always continues to focus on questions of powers and idealistic ideas about a European state.
Following on from this, it remains for the Council to concern itself less with prestige and to spend more time on working to achieve results.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of today's debate, in the presence both of the Commissioner and the ambitious Council Presidency, to direct our attention to the potential influx of a massive number of refugees, triggered by a war in Iraq that we hope will not happen, but is nonetheless possible, and the related subject of the Refugee Fund, which was set up two years ago.
It makes it possible for us, in accordance with Article 6 of the Council Decision establishing the European Refugee Fund, to take special steps in the event of a mass influx of refugees.
What I now propose is that you, as representatives of the Commission and of the Council, make every conceivable preparation for such an eventuality, so that the Member States may not be left to their own devices, but may be supported in the manner provided for in Article 6.
You should be allocating up to 80% of the funds required, but this requires that you take the necessary precautions right now.
The Member States are to be urged to take the necessary precautions by appointing authorities to which the Commission may have recourse.
I am addressing both the Council and the Commission when I propose that consideration should be given to setting aside funds for eventual allocation to international aid organisations providing the relevant help on the spot, which should be the primary and most efficient form of aid.
I propose, thirdly, that you should not leave the Member States to deal with this potentially tragic situation on their own, but should, in advance of events, give consideration to spreading the load of dealing with the people involved, as we know that a few countries were obliged to shoulder most of the burdens resulting from the crisis in the Balkans.
We should be learning from our mistakes and preventing such a thing from recurring in future, so we should be preparing to apportion the people involved to individual Member States.
I would very much like to know how, and to what extent, you envisage acting upon these proposals.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason I am taking the floor in this debate is that I would like to make two basic observations on how this House cooperates.
Mr von Boetticher, in the few parts of his speech that were any good, pointed out that we will, in future, have to do more legislative work if we are to achieve what we want, that being the bringing within the Community sphere of more aspects of the European Union currently covered by policy on the area of freedom, security and justice.
In this sector, too, majority decision-making and the codecision procedure would have to be normative, with the Commission, rather than the Member States, having the right to initiate legislation.
Very good!
That is something I can only endorse.
If, however, that is how he thinks, then what is needed today is a sober inventory of the present situation, so that, if we want to overcome the challenges of the future, we are equipped to do so and able to fashion a policy that makes sense and will work.
So what is the situation today?
Commissioner Vitorino is thinking up something good.
By making proposals, he is discharging the obligations laid on him by the scoreboard that he announced after Tampere.
What he proposes goes too far for the Council, on the assumption that they actually read the stuff.
The proposals then end up in Parliament, and Parliament adds to them and forwards them to the Council.
What does the Council do?
It throws them in the waste-paper basket.
Such is the reality of the situation today.
Now, I do not want to tread on the Council's toes.
I am quite convinced that the Greek Presidency of the Council will read everything.
Do not take what I say too personally.
What we need in future, though, is a different way of making laws, one in which the balance between the three institutions involved is safeguarded.
This will involve all three bodies being willing to compromise.
The Commission must be willing to compromise, as indeed it is, as all of us who know Commissioner Vitorino can tell you, even if he has to put up with being given an unjustified battering in the German press by young and rather immature MEPs.
The Council's willingness to compromise is a matter of doubt, as the Council's policy is not - primarily, at any rate - guided by European standards, but by the demands of every single Member State's domestic policies.
That is wrong.
And thirdly, it is one of our institution's failings.
It is at this point that Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats should prick up their ears and listen.
I am now making them an offer, and this is the first time - but not, I hope, the last - that they will receive such an offer in this form.
Let us talk together, so that we are not always coming up with the minimum of consensus, but can get the legislative work done.
What are your demands, and what are ours?
Where are you prepared to give some ground on your position, and where are we prepared to give some ground on our own?
Where, then, can we achieve real compromises that make real law-making possible?
Business in this place has hitherto been conducted on the basis that anyone who is not on my side is against me, and that I will not vote with anyone who does not back up my position 100%, so this House ends up passing fortuitous texts by fortuitous majorities.
If we want to do real legislative work, then I invite you to discuss compromise, but you will then have to demonstrate your capacity for it.
This will involve you putting some of the hardliners in your ranks on the lead.
But, Mr von Boetticher and Mr Pirker, being made of the stuff you are, I am sure you will manage that.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the area of freedom, security and justice is something that many Members of this House still imagine to be a highly advanced position adopted by a European Union that offers its citizens the greatest possible degree of freedom and protection from the State.
It is not only in the last year that events have proved the opposite to be the case: repressive measures are enjoying a boom, with the European Union and its Member States forcing through controls on the EU's external borders no less than in its interior.
On top of that, there is increased monitoring of personal data and of free communication.
Biometric means are being used to evacuate privacy of any meaning.
Finally, the EU's racist character is enhanced still further by the many laws aimed at so-called 'foreigners', with the introduction of the Eurodac system and the development of the Schengen Information System representing only the tip of the iceberg.
This security means, then, the greatest possible security for the State, whereas freedom would require a quite different policy - some would call it a more mature one - backing effective data protection, the demolition of Fortress Europe and the repeal of all racist special laws, including those on the right to citizenship.
Such, though, is not the case.
What we are building here is a Union of state security, control and monitoring.
Baroness Ludford's Liberalism, does not, unfortunately, extend to addressing any of these points in her question.
Mr President, the President-in-Office has just reminded us that the Tampere Conclusions in the area of Freedom, Security, Justice and Home Affairs proclaimed in 1999 the principles of transparency and democratic control for the protection of citizens' human rights.
In the Kingdom of Spain on 13 February 1983, that is to say 20 years ago, Joseba Arregi, a Basque political prisoner, died under torture while he was in police custody.
That was 20 years ago tomorrow.
In 2002, 634 politically motivated people were arrested.
127 of them subsequently claimed in court that they had suffered ill treatment or torture.
Have the Council and the Commission received clear information about this issue from the Spanish Government?
Do the Council and the Commission consider that the transparency principle has been respected by the Spanish Government?
Last year the Spanish Government proposed the banning of several social organisations - media and cultural associations - that had denounced the political repression suffered by Basque dissidents.
Through a Spanish initiative, the European Union has drawn up a black list of associations and individuals accused of specific or tacit support for terrorism.
The accused have neither the legal means of defence nor effective access to the courts.
Do the Council and the Commission consider there to have been real enforcement of the democratic control principle with regard to Spain?
Will the Council and the Commission put forward a judicial instrument in the new texts being prepared for those included on the European Union's black list?
I would like to thank Baroness Ludford and express my recognition of the effort she has made in this important area.
Mr President, it revolts, disgusts and amazes me that the previous speaker has said what he has, after justifying and aiding murderers and enemies of freedom, democracy and Europe.
Mr President, I am not going to waste a single second - which is what he wants - so that I can defend what we have to defend: freedom, democracy and the area of freedom, security and justice.
They are the enemies of freedom, security and justice in Europe. This must be stated categorically.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the innovative aspect of what we are discussing here is that, at European Union level, we are providing protection for fundamental rights and for citizens' rights.
This protection, which is going to be enshrined in the new Treaty, is the fundamental condition for the success of the area of freedom, security and justice, and provides the foundation for the legitimisation of the Union.
In fact, only by strengthening the protection of the rights and principles enshrined in the Rule of Law can we create the conditions for greater trust between the Member States and make it possible to produce genuinely common policies.
Today, and following long delays, these policies are taking shape in the form of judicial, civil and criminal cooperation and are beginning to do so in the field of visas, asylum and immigration.
In the field of judicial cooperation, the European arrest warrant has opened up the way to direct cooperation between judges and has broken down barriers so that, amongst others, terrorists and murderers cannot find refuge in European territory for their criminal and violent activities.
Furthermore, we must not forget this Parliament's constant appeals in favour of protection and support for the victims of terrorism.
In the field of immigration and asylum, the progress made is not entirely satisfactory.
Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the time limits established at the Seville European Council are respected.
Any further delay would not only show a lack of solidarity between the Member States, but would also be a bad sign at a time when the Union is preparing for an historic enlargement.
How can we resolve amongst 25 something which we have not able to decide amongst 15?
Finally, a comment on the pointless complexity of the decision-making system within the area of freedom, security and justice.
Parliament reflected this situation, in which decisions were adapted within the first or the third pillar, in a resolution in 1999.
Today we are glad to discover that these same arguments have found consensus within the Convention charged with reforming the Treaties.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall, of course, begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Baroness Ludford, on the excellent report she has contributed to this debate.
This annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice provides Parliament with a new opportunity to express its dissatisfaction and frustration with regard to the paralysis affecting the third pillar as a result of the lack of political will on the part of the Member States, and despite the ongoing efforts of the Commission.
Important Commission initiatives, both before and after 11 September 2001, remain deadlocked in Council or are still waiting to be transposed or ratified by the Member States.
The States appear to wish to compensate for their inability to establish policies that will provide a structure for the area of freedom, security and justice by putting forward a torrent of proposals based on their right of initiative. As a rule, these proposals make a minuscule, if not counterproductive, contribution to the objectives that these States themselves have imposed on successive European summits.
We are seeing a procession of outlandish proposals, by which I mean proposals that are not part of any plan or form part of the Commission scoreboard.
These are arbitrary proposals of limited or no scope, incoherent, sometimes dictated by national political agendas, proposals that tend to turn the third pillar into a universe in chaos, continuously expanding in all directions - a legal and bureaucratic novel without full stops.
The European Parliament has the duty to condemn this impasse, which is the result of the political inability to date of the Council and the Member States to have brought into force a single measure on the package on combating terrorism that has been drawn up by the Commission or come originally from it and planned in its scoreboard.
The gulf between the discourse of political leaders, in particular, of government representatives, and this resulting in practical actions is reaching scandalous proportions in the field of fighting transnational crime.
Furthermore, in the areas covered by Title IV, we are still seeing a persistent imbalance, rightly condemned by the rapporteur, between the relative ease with which agreements are concluded on the repressive elements of controlling immigration and the ongoing inability to establish common policies in the field of asylum and regulating legal immigration, specifically in the field of civil rights and social integration.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate Commissioner AntÃ³nio Vitorino on his efficiency and hard work that have led to the progress made, which has been particularly noticeable in the last six months.
2002 was more positive than previous years and we saw a considerable number of initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs.
The proposals for a European arrest warrant and for a framework decision on terrorism that have already been referred to, for example, are proof of the Union's ability to implement the objectives set by the Treaty of Amsterdam when the need to act is combined with the will to do so.
Nevertheless, and despite the progress that has been made, as Baroness Ludford has already observed and as was also stated at Laeken, I quote, 'new boosts and new guidelines are needed to make good the delay seen in certain areas'.
On the one hand considerable progress has been made in stepping up cooperation between the agencies responsible for implementing the law on the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, on the European arrest warrant and on harmonising criminal and anti-terrorist legislation. On the other, much still remains to be done in order to achieve a practical and effective system for safeguarding citizens' rights.
It cannot be emphasised too much, as indeed Commissioner Vitorino emphasised, that it is crucial to maintain a balance between the three components of the same concept, which together constitute the area of freedom, security and justice.
In other words, there can be no security without freedom and justice.
Another source of regret, as various speakers have said today, is the excessively frequent use of the right of initiative by the Member States, who have increased the number of proposals that this Parliament has felt obliged to reject because they lack coherence, clarity and even usefulness and which were only guided by the requirements of national politics or to placate the media.
Furthermore, the imposition of matters pertaining to the first pillar and of means that fall under the third pillar has been an ongoing source of difficulties.
Decisions need to be taken, especially in areas such as data protection.
With regard to Europol and Eurojust, it is regrettable that there is still only an indirect democratic division of responsibility, which is fragmented and insufficiently limited.
To conclude, Mr President, the reduced level of democratic legitimacy that we are still seeing is also a matter of regret.
Parliament is rarely consulted and often on political agreements that have already been concluded in Council, which means that our contribution is an irrelevant and useless document.
Mr President, I must emphasise at the start of this second short statement that the views presented by the Members of the European Parliament here today have been extremely useful to the Council and to me personally as President-in-Office.
I imagine that this is what concerns the citizens of Europe.
The points made basically reflect what the citizens of Europe expect of us in the old and the new Europe.
In the Europe we are all now building together.
I noticed that many of the views highlighted the need for a balance between the measures taken, which of course need to be taken for the security of the citizens in Europe, and the need to protect citizens' rights and freedoms.
The points made by the honourable Members reinforced my own view that greater security must not mean cutting back and compromising on freedoms.
Besides, individual freedoms and human rights are elements of our European legal culture.
We must not shift the centre of gravity one way or the other, because security is clearly an inalienable right and a primordial right for every citizen; but nor must we shift the centre of gravity and risk cutting back or overlooking and compromising on human rights and freedoms.
I emphasised and I repeat that, during the course of the Greek Presidency, we shall be focusing on striking this necessary balance, which is also why, as I said in my statement, we have included specific issues to do with freedoms, including the freedoms of suspects and defendants, on the agenda for the informal Council.
And, by the way, the second item we shall of course be discussing at the informal Council is an issue which directly interests all of us at the moment: the future of Europe and the continuing debate on the future of Europe.
This debate will, I am sure, bring about something we are all hoping for: a stronger role for the European Parliament, so that it can make a more material contribution to the decisions taken.
I was also particularly interested in the honourable Members' comments that measures must be taken to guard borders at European level.
We all want to find a way of protecting, guarding and controlling Europe's borders, by which I mean the external borders of the European Union.
This applies especially to my country, which holds the Presidency for these six months and which has a special significance by reason of its geographical position and the particular configuration of its borders.
What I mean is we have a certain amount of experience here.
One of the topics being discussed, and which will continue to be discussed, is how to apportion the burden.
We need to find a way of apportioning the burden fairly at European level so that we can strengthen our border controls.
Obviously, we need to be able to prevent a mass influx of illegal immigrants, because mass illegal immigration makes things worse and creates even more problems within the European Union.
It even exacerbates the position of immigrants already in the European Union.
However, this does not mean that we should not pay greater attention to the rights of immigrants already in the European Union or that their rights are less important to us.
Europe already has decades of experience in admitting immigrants and it is time it did something to speed up its ability to integrate immigrants already in Europe smoothly and more quickly, by which I mean integrate them into the society of the host state.
I shall close with a brief reply to a question about whether there is a risk of a mass influx of refugees in the wake of possible events in Iraq.
There is, I think, a daily risk of a mass influx of refugees from countries outside the European Union and this is being discussed in the relevant committees.
I think that we need Community financial support and we need to spread the burden fairly, irrespective of what happens in Iraq.
Of course we all hope that developments will not result in situations which give rise to another mass influx of refugees arriving in the European Union.
In other words, we hope to maintain peace and not to have to face awkward situations which, as we all know, apart from any other adverse repercussions, give rise to waves of immigrants.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to this debate and, above all, Baroness Ludford for her excellent contribution.
I shall just address a few of the questions raised during the debate, starting with a remark by Mr Schulz.
We should all resist the temptation to reduce the debate on asylum and migration to a purely ideological debate.
It is indeed tempting and very easy to do this by using slogans to manipulate emotions.
However, if we reduce the debate to such positions, I wonder whether we are really addressing the dramatic problems that asylum and migration raise for thousands of people all over the world and especially in the European Union.
It might even be tempting to make the Commission the bad guy.
I am used to performing several roles, but this would be a new one for me.
However, the Commission has always tried to put forward the right balance between an efficient policy combating illegal migration and, at the same time, defining the grass roots of a proactive, positive policy on migration.
This is not for ideological reasons.
We believe that if we do not succeed in having a clear, transparent and coordinated policy on legal migration, we will not succeed in the fight against trafficking in human beings and illegal migration.
If I appear too generous, I would like to recall that the Commission put forward a proposal for a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings.
The Commission presented the action plan on illegal migration that was taken on board by the Council.
The Commission presented the action plan on external border controls that was taken on board by the Council.
The Commission presented the proposal on the return action plan.
The Commission made the proposal on a new Schengen information system.
The Commission proposed the creation of a visa database.
If this is being too generous, I admit that I have some differences with some Members regarding the notion of generosity.
When it comes to the new terrorist threat, as Mr QueirÃ³ has emphasised, we recognise that we are confronted with a phenomenon we know little about.
We are not yet at the stage of being prepared to face the new profile of the terrorist threat, not only as far as the possibility of terrorist attacks is concerned - and one must be prepared for whatever might happen in the near future, in the light of the evolution of international events - but also in terms of a key question you have raised: the financing of the terrorist networks.
Therefore I hope that during 2003, Member States will be able to make effective progress in achieving concrete results and adopt legislation to combat the financing of terrorism.
This should include not only the illegal financing of terrorism, but also the 'legal' financing of terrorism in the European Union, including offshore centres on its territory.
I would like to confirm to Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ that the Commission intends to set up a network of experts during spring 2003, thus following up the Brussels Declaration.
I now turn to the issue raised by Mr Coehlo.
Difficulties abound in dealing with certain specific and very sensitive issues because we have a split between the first and third pillars; data protection is a very good example of this.
We should emphasise that there is a clear sign from the European Convention that the values of freedom, security and justice cannot be held hostage by a schizophrenic division between pillars that is blocking us every day.
Finally, on the very important issue raised by Mr Pirker, I can guarantee that we are preparing for the possibility of a mass influx.
I do not want to anticipate the evolution of international events, but we have learned much from the experience in Kosovo.
We have the directive on temporary protection.
It has been transposed into national legislation by Sweden, Finland and Belgium, and other Member States already have provisions in their national legislation concerning sudden influxes of migrants and refugees.
Therefore, to deal with the most urgent situations we can mobilise, in the very short term, the reserve of the fund for European refugees.
My colleague, Commissioner Nielson, together with ECHO, and in close coordination with UNHCR, is looking at the possibility of supporting refugees in the region.
I hope that this time things will work much better, thanks to the progress that has been achieved as far as temporary protection is concerned.
I would like to pay my sincere respects to Parliament.
If we have problems in terms of progress during this year Parliament cannot be blamed for any kind of delay.
It has always given its opinions on time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held on 11 March.
The next item is the debate on 9 questions to the Council and the Commission on the harmful effects of unexploded ordnance (landmines and cluster bombs) and depleted uranium ammunition.
Mr President, on the eve of a potential conflict in Iraq - one that we hope can still be avoided - a debate on the use of anti-personnel mines and depleted uranium ammunition is of great topical interest.
After all it has been found that soldiers and civilians who came into contact with depleted uranium ammunition in earlier military conflicts, such as the Gulf War in 1991 and in Kosovo, later experienced serious health problems, what we call Gulf War sickness or Balkan syndrome.
They suffer from memory loss, chronic pain and fatigue, symptoms of paralysis and have an increased risk of cancer.
United Nations statistics, published in the renowned 'British Medical Journal', indicate that the incidence of cancer in southern Iraq increased sevenfold between 1989 and 1994.
Even the US Army Environmental Policy Institute has acknowledged the potentially very serious medical consequences of the use of depleted uranium.
Weapons and ammunition that harm the civilian population are in contravention of the Geneva Convention and the Convention on Conventional Weapons.
The second Convention is very explicit.
It imposes a prohibition or restriction on the use of certain conventional weapons that are deemed to cause excessive injury or that do not discriminate between military and civilian targets.
According to information leaked from the Pentagon, about 3 000 guided bombs were fired in the first wave of attacks in Iraq.
It seems very likely that the US will use ammunition with depleted uranium again.
Parliament must continue to warn of the potential dangers of the use of this type of ammunition.
There is an urgent need for an independent, scientific study of the effects of its use, not only on health but also on the environment.
We must have a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium while we wait for the results of such a study.
The European Union must play a pioneering role in this, just as it did in the campaign for a worldwide ban on antipersonnel mines, as was laid down in the Ottawa Convention.
And my questions, Mr President, concern that Convention, its ratification and application.
To be very explicit, I wanted to ask the Council exactly what actions are planned to ensure that as many Member States and candidate countries as possible sign this Convention.
You will understand that I would really like to hear from the current President-in-Office of the Council why Greece is actually waiting before signing this important Convention.
Finally, in anticipation of hopefully being able to avoid a possible international conflict, I urge the Council to make a clear statement guaranteeing that the Member States of the European Union will not use weapons that are banned under international law or are deemed to be illegal in this or any future armed conflict.
Mr President, I just wish to make a point of order.
There was no simultaneous interpretation into Portuguese during the last speech.
I would therefore ask you to have someone look into this matter.
Mr President, depleted uranium was largely used in the manufacture of shells and anti-tank ammunition, many of which were dumped during the Gulf War on Iraqi territory, but also in Bosnia and Kosovo.
On impact, the uranium is broken up into fine particles which are likely to be inhaled by human beings, or else they are dispersed into the environment where, owing to the effect of the wind, they can become suspended, and inhaled later.
These particles emit alpha-radioactivity, which is particularly aggressive towards living tissue.
Depleted uranium particles, once lodged inside an organism, may cause severe damage to the health not only of military personnel but of civilians as well.
It seems clear to me, therefore, that depleted uranium weapons and ammunition fall directly within the scope of the 1980 United Nations Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.
The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights came to this conclusion several years ago, yet so far no action has been taken to restrict or prohibit them.
Scientific uncertainty about their measurable effects on health is thus being used as an argument for doing nothing.
The precautionary principle, however, would seem to argue in favour of an additional protocol to the 1980 Convention, explicitly prohibiting these depleted uranium weapons.
This is what my group is seeking.
Last week we were in Iraq, and at the hospital in Basra we were shocked and saddened to see children suffering from cancer and congenital malformations.
The figures published by the University of Basra for the region are shocking.
Between 1990 and 2001, the rate of congenital malformations has been constantly rising, and has now increased sevenfold.
Scientists are quite logically blaming this on the fact that parents are contaminated with depleted uranium.
We do not have the right to allow such situations, which are the consequences of real war crimes, to proliferate.
Yet in Afghanistan, contrary to the official denials, even more powerful weapons were used, weapons equipped with a covering of depleted uranium or even natural uranium.
These were guided bombs or cruise missiles.
I believe that it is up to the European Union to take the initiative to halt the current escalation and to set targets with a view to the definitive prohibition of weapons which, like cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines, are morally unacceptable.
Mr President, it is, in my view, clearer than ever nowadays that there is a need for an international legal system, and it is also becoming ever clearer that, if an international legal system is to be developed that is viable and that applies to large as well as small countries, it is the EU that must play the decisive role and be the guarantor of large, as well as small, countries' complying with a set of international ground rules.
I therefore think it important also to get the Council and the Commission to follow up this very important matter of how best to emphasise to one's partners, and in any future situation, that to use anti-personnel mines, cluster bombs and depleted uranium is to use weapons that strike indiscriminately, that hit civilian as well as non-civilian targets, that hit the innocent as well as the guilty and that can be dormant for a long time and only make themselves felt perhaps years after a possible war is over.
These are weapons that are contrary to the provisions of the Geneva Convention on how we are to treat one another in the course of war.
I therefore think the Council and the Commission should understand that, firstly, we must prevent these types of war crime from being committed.
We must prevent these weapons being used in possible future conflicts and, clearly, we are all nowadays thinking of Iraq in this connection.
There are, however, other places too in which this could be relevant.
That was the first aspect.
The second is to follow up those crimes that have already been committed.
In that connection, I should also very much like to hear the Council's and the Commission's answers regarding how these crimes are to be followed up and how it is to be ensured that those who are responsible for using weapons in ways that constitute war crimes are dragged before the International War Crimes Tribunal and prosecuted, for it is not enough for us to have a set of ground rules.
We must also be prepared to apply them, and we must be prepared to apply the sanctions available to us at present.
It is the EU that must take this task upon itself. Otherwise, we shall end up in a world in which only the strong make the decisions, in which only the strong can do as they see fit and in which weak countries are entirely subject to the diktat of a stronger power.
I eagerly await the Council's and the Commission's answers.
Mr President, as we are all aware, dormant explosive devices, landmines and cluster bombs are among the weapons that can cause especially cruel injuries and mutilations.
Those of us who have been to countries in conflict will know the mutilations and wounds with which one is confronted there. I myself became familiar with these sights in Central America.
Parliament has, in various resolutions, insisted on the implementation of the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which banned the use of landmines.
It is with reference to this that I want to praise the Commission for the excellent work it has done, not only in the field of mine clearance, but also in educating people as to why landmines have to be banned.
Work is progressing at present on preparations for the next conference on the revision of the Ottawa Convention, which is to be held this September in Bangkok, by which time I very much hope that those European states that have not yet ratified the Ottawa Convention will have made good their omission.
I look forward to hearing what the President-in-Office of the Council will have to say in response to this question.
I think he might well be about to bring Parliament good news from Greece.
The worldwide campaign against landmines has already made great progress.
Considerable efforts are currently being made to get belligerent parties other than states to sign up to the Ottawa Convention.
This work is being undertaken by a non-governmental organisation - 'Appell de GenÃšve' - and I believe that we can rejoice that such work is being done by non-governmental organisations when state bodies cannot carry it out.
In Somalia, for example, 15 organisations and belligerent parties, none of them part of any state apparatus, have signed the Convention.
Another problem of a particularly shattering nature comes in the form of cluster bombs, whose victims include innocent civilians; the injuries these bombs inflict are so horrific and their effects so indiscriminate, that they should be prohibited outright.
Previous speakers have described this, and I wish to touch on it only very briefly.
You are all familiar with the descriptions of the horrendous injuries resulting from the deployment of cluster bombs.
The particularly dreadful thing about it is that the splinters from the cluster bombs that remain in the human body are almost never capable of being removed.
Not only are the effects of these bombs indiscriminate in that they can strike civilians as much as soldiers, but they are also imprecise in the area they affect, which amounts to something like 350 football fields every time a cluster bomb is dropped.
This makes the precision bombing of military targets impossible, so that there is an increased risk of innocent people being injured.
Finally, these bombs also vary in their effect over time, since, if they do not explode, they can remain live for years to come.
It was in December 2001 that Parliament last recalled the 1980 UN agreement on certain conventional weapons and demanded an immediate moratorium on the use of cluster bombs.
A moratorium can clearly only be the second best solution until such time as a ban on these inhuman weapons becomes enforceable, but I believe that imposing a moratorium in the first instance is the pragmatic way to go about things.
It is here that the European Union could, by its actions, give a very good example.
Mr President, I have nothing much to say about landmines.
The subject speaks for itself.
We have all seen the television footage of maimed children, including recently in various areas of former Yugoslavia.
Most of what I have to say has to do with depleted uranium.
Natural uranium contains over 99% uranium 238 and very little uranium 235.
Uranium 235 is excellent as a fuel in nuclear reactors and is used in nuclear weapons.
Consequently, the material is enriched with uranium 235 and what is left, the residue, which is mainly uranium 238, is what we know as depleted uranium.
This depleted uranium is used in bombs because it is very dense and highly penetrating; it can blast through floors, tank armouring and so on. However, the drawback is that it vaporises when it explodes.
And when it vaporises, most of it oxidises.
These oxides end up as soluble uranium salts over an area of 10-15 kilometres, although they are often carried several hundred kilometres on the wind.
They can be inhaled, enter the water supply and so on.
The problem with uranium 238 is that it has very weak alpha rays, meaning that I can hold it my hand without coming to any harm, but if I inhale it, because the body has phagocytes which absorb these particles, the cells are irradiated very close to their genetic material and this is thought to be the cause of the harmful effects of depleted uranium.
Of course, research carried out has not proven 100% that this is what happens, but the results are very convincing, which is why we must be very, very careful.
That is exactly what Parliament's motion says; that because it is highly likely that it represents a public health risk and that exposure to depleted uranium is dangerous, the European Union (this is point 7) needs to monitor this research and everything else to do with depleted uranium, including possible extensive environmental pollution and the long-term dangers to human health.
It is perfectly logical that the European Parliament should take an interest in this sort of issue; it needs to be taken into account so that we can avoid using this ammunition because, I repeat, it has huge drawbacks.
Also, depleted uranium takes several thousand years to decay.
If an area is contaminated, it remains contaminated for thousands of years.
The principle of precaution alone should make us think twice about using this ammunition which, I repeat, can contaminate areas for thousands of years, with long-term dangers to public health.
That is why I should like to ask my honourable friends to vote in favour of this motion which, I think, for both mines and depleted uranium ammunition, is a commensurate response to the current situation.
I think that the European Parliament should vote for it and that the Commission should take up and monitor this issue.
I trust that the Council and the Greek Presidency will do something about getting the Ottawa Convention ratified, so that anti-personnel mines can be eliminated, and introducing a moratorium, followed perhaps by a total ban on the use of depleted uranium ammunition.
Mr President, I wish to state that the current international situation is not preventing us from adopting the necessary objectivity in this debate on unexploded ordnance and depleted uranium ammunition.
It will therefore be easier to assess all the consequences underlying this debate.
Mr President, war is always war and its effects are always appalling.
The fact is, however, that sometimes we cannot escape the need for military intervention or its inevitability.
This is why we must concern ourselves with the long-term effects of this ordnance, out of consideration in particular for the innocent victims and most frequently, those harmed by their effects after operations have ended.
There is growing concern amongst interested communities and also amongst the general public in this field.
With regard to the specific case of ammunition that contains depleted uranium, the lack of rigorous clinical proof that clearly confirms the cause-and-effect relationship between its use and the occurrence of diseases must lead us to invest even more heavily in research into this possible connection.
This is where the Council's action could be extremely useful, particularly in supporting the work of groups of government experts on the leftovers of war, such as explosives and anti-tank mines, and in giving priority to this issue.
Next it is crucial that the Council and also the Commission heed the results obtained and present, within the scope of their respective competences, practical recommendations or measures to help to improve and increase the reliability of ordnance with a view to eliminating the lethal damage it causes following conflicts.
Incidentally, and to conclude, Mr President, I wish to say a few words about the people that this debate is seeking to protect.
Even without conclusive proof, it is a requisite of conscience to provide effective forms of support for victims and their families, whether or not they are military personnel, who have been affected after the end of a conflict and whose suffering could be related to unexploded ordnance or depleted uranium ammunition.
This would not be the first such action.
Portugal, for example, has been doing just this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is particularly concerned about the deaths and injury caused every year by explosive remnants of war.
Apart from directly killing and injuring civilians, explosive remnants of war often hamper humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping forces, reconstruction following conflict and development in general, which is why the Union has taken an active part in the debate on explosive remnants of war within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.
Allow me to quote a few examples of Union activities in this sector.
In June 2001, the Union circulated a discussion paper on explosive remnants of war at the meeting held on the subject in the run-up to the second review congress on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.
The General Affairs Council issued conclusions on 19 November 2001 promoting the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, in which it called on the second review congress to set up a working party on explosive remnants of war.
Thirdly, the European Union submitted a working paper to the second review congress on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva in December 2001, calling for legal instruments to be introduced in order to deal with explosive remnants of war, as a result of which efforts will be made to prevent explosive remnants of war, including through provisions requiring them to be more reliably designed and to have self-destruct mechanisms, and to prevent physical injury from detonators in explosive remnants of war.
The Union also submitted a paper on explosive remnants of war to the team of government experts set up by the second review congress.
During the congress of the States Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the Presidency stressed on behalf of the European Union that the introduction of a legally binding instrument on explosive remnants of war within the framework of the Convention was a priority issue for the Union.
The congress agreed with the recommendation of the team of government experts that negotiations should start on an instrument for these explosives.
The Council's competent working party will be discussing future Union action in this sector.
I should like to point out on behalf of the Council that the Member States of the Union are not unanimously in favour of declaring an immediate moratorium on the use of all types of cluster bombs.
The Council has not received reports of any NATO members using cluster bombs.
The common action by the Union in November 1997 dealt in its first three articles with the question of the universality of the agreement banning mines, in which the Member States of the Union set a target of totally eliminating anti-personnel mines worldwide.
The common action authorised the Presidency to take suitable measures.
These measures have consisted to date of demarches to countries which have not yet signed up to the Convention, including associated countries, and it has also recommended that churches sign the Convention.
These demarches are carried out by the Presidency at the time.
The Union has also been promoting the universality of the Convention at all the appropriate fora, especially the United Nations.
The resolutions of the General Assembly on the application of the Convention have been unanimously supported by the Member States of the European Union.
In addition, the European Parliament and Council resolutions of 23 July 2001 concerning action against anti-personnel landmines in developing countries and in third countries other than developing countries both state in article 3 that operations against landmines financed by the Union must in principle benefit those countries which are party to the convention banning landmines.
Exceptions may only be made for humanitarian reasons.
This stand by the Union has created an important incentive for countries to sign up to the convention banning landmines.
The European Union and its Member States are the main international source of funding for action against landmines, which in itself is an important way of promoting compliance with the convention.
I should also like to point out that no reports have been submitted to the Council on the use of depleted uranium ammunition by the American or British forces during the intervention in Afghanistan.
The Council has not addressed the question of the application of the protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons on non-detectable fragments to which all the Member States are party.
Nor has the Council discussed ongoing work on this question at the United Nations.
Finally, the Council does not have a catalogue of depleted uranium ammunition in current use.
Decisions on the use of various types of ammunition are taken by Member States exercising their national sovereignty.
All the Member States are party to the Geneva Conventions.
Similarly, the Council has received no information about the use of depleted uranium ammunition in Chechnya, nor has it discussed the possibility of making the use of cluster bombs or depleted uranium a war crime under the statute of the International Criminal Court.
Let me start by saying that serious scientific studies have shown that there is no reason for anxiety in relation to the issue of the harmful effects of depleted uranium ammunitions on health.
From the Commission perspective, I want, in particular, to refer to the opinion of the Euratom Treaty Article 31 Expert Group which was convened in early 2001, with the participation not only of Member States experts but also representatives of UNEP, the IAEA, the WHO and Nato.
The group focused on the lasting contamination from the use of depleted uranium ammunitions in the Balkans and the potential post-war radiological risk for the health of the local population and the international assistance teams.
The group did not look at the actual health effect on soldiers who had been on mission in that region, this being outside the Community remit and to be handled in other fora such as Nato.
Again I refer Parliament to the conclusions of its own STOA report of May 2001, when it came to much the same conclusion in relation to this issue.
On 6 March 2001, the opinion of the Article 31 Expert Group was released to the press.
In a nutshell, it concluded that there is no major concern, from a radiological point of view, either in terms of inducing short-term cancer, or in terms of a wide impact on the environment.
Widespread intervention in the concerned regions was not required.
Other reports issued by UNEP on 13 March 2001, the WHO on 1 May 2002 and the UK Royal Society on 12 March 2002 present similar conclusions.
In addition, the latter two reports also address the chemical toxicity of the uranium, concluding that it is not expected that adverse effects on the kidneys or any other organ will occur.
At the end of March 2001, my colleague, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, concluded that no further actions seemed to be required with regard to the application of the basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.
As mentioned above, further investigations into the chemical toxicity not addressed in the report of Mrs WallstrÃ¶m have since been analysed in the WHO and the UK Royal Society reports.
While the Article 31 Expert Group had concluded that there was no need for individual monitoring of the Commission's own staff and contractors sent to the region, the Commission's medical services nonetheless proposed a check-up and urine analysis programme for the staff members concerned.
No single health effect related to depleted uranium has been observed.
Coming now to the Commission's activities related to anti-personnel landmines following the European Parliament and Council Regulations 1724/2001 and 1725/2001 on the reinforcement of the European Union contribution to the fight against APLs, the European Union has taken a leading role in fostering better coordination of programmes and in providing momentum, predictability and effectiveness for cooperation between partners on the ground.
This is very strong support by the European Community for the implementation of the mine ban treaty that is the Ottawa Convention, according to which all APLs should be eliminated by 2009.
In 2001, under the new APL regulation providing for a dedicated legal basis for coordination at European Union level, the Community budget contributed up to EUR 30 million for demining actions.
Using various Community instruments such as geographical, ECHO, APL and RRM budget lines in an integrated way, the European Commission has mainly supported surveys, clearance, assistance to victims, as well as the economic and social rehabilitation of the demined regions and the resettled populations.
At European Union level the European Community efforts and the Member States' activities combined total EUR 143 million.
The European Union is, therefore, with the US, the top contributor in the fight against APLs, including stockpile destruction and creation of local capacity-building.
In order to ensure sustainability over the years, the Commission approved in December 2002 the European Commission mine action strategy and multiannual indicative programming for the period 2002-2004.
This document was prepared on the basis of strong coordination with the Member States, the United Nations, the US, and the wider mine action community.
The Commission will, in the coming weeks, make the necessary arrangements to present this strategy to the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Finally, coming to the issue of cluster bombs and other forms of unexploded ordnance, the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) is the current international framework that provides the basis for the prohibition and elimination of weapons which operate in an indiscriminate fashion or cause excessive injury and suffering.
Most EU Member States are parties to the CCW and are working on the revision of the Convention to further prohibit certain designs of weapon, such as explosive remnants of war, anti-handling devices, and to establish common principles on fuse insensitivity, self-destruction or self-neutralising weapon modes.
These principles, if agreed, would be applied to anti-vehicle mines and submunitions - or munitions delivered by a remote carrier such as an aircraft, missile, minefield launcher and so on.
The revision of the CCW is still at the level of working groups: one on anti-vehicles mines, the other on submunitions.
The Commission closely follows the debates of both groups.
This revision would lead to a new protocol to the CCW to address the problems caused by explosive remnants of war, thus covering cluster bombs and submunitions, so that these weapons are detectable and equipped with effective self-destruction mechanisms.
The work being carried out in view of the new protocol is strongly sponsored by the EU through a common position and a number of joint dÃ©marches requesting that concrete steps be undertaken to address this issue under the CCW framework.
Currently, the opportunity to prepare a further common position on the suggestions tabled is being explored.
Let me conclude by mentioning that, in addition to its participation in the international framework of the CCW, the Commission, on a concrete and operational level through its activities related to APLs, is already providing an indirect but tangible contribution to the reduction of the threat posed by cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance.
Mine-clearance encompasses de jure and de facto clearance of other unexploded ordnance, although this is not a specific submunitions instrument.
We are already engaged in such broader clearance activities in countries such as Laos, Kosovo and Afghanistan, where the APL problem is inextricably connected to unexploded ordnance pollution.
Thank you Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, and Commissioner, for the essential clarification that you have just given us, which shows the seriousness of the Commission's work.
For once, a technical expert is about to address the House on the subject, in particular, of depleted uranium weapons.
It is most important that we do not, whether consciously or not, have any confusion in our minds - either in the minds of the public or, as I have seen in this House, in our own - about the use of depleted uranium weapons and the use of nuclear weapons.
On this point you have given us vital information and I simply want to add my own personal testimony.
Depleted uranium weapons are weapons which were developed in order to enable new types of armour-plating to be pierced.
The armour-plating used in the Second World War was pierced by shells with a hollow charge, powered by chemical energy.
New types of armour-plating, however, can only be pierced by weapons powered by kinetic energy.
These are known as arrow shells.
It is important to be able to give them a high initial speed.
They must also have heavy cores.
This is why depleted uranium is used.
Here I must stress that the confusion which I am talking about is not innocent.
I heard on television a journalist who was covering our Members' visit to Iraq mention enriched uranium in connection with these weapons, and it was mentioned on two occasions, so it could not have been a mere slip of the tongue.
I was involved in the research that led to the development of these weapons, in the Terrestrial Weapons Technical Directorate, where we have very powerful unions which protect our workers and our engineers.
I am therefore able to tell you that in actual fact, if there had been the slightest risk, the precautionary principle which we observe in the French arms industry would automatically have ruled out such weapons.
Mr President, I can well imagine that the Commissioner is right about depleted uranium.
As far as I am aware, and if my memory serves me right, it even has its civilian uses, but that is something that would have to be checked.
However, as we know nothing about what long-term effects the dispersed material may have, there may be some surprises in store for us.
I would like to say something about landmines.
What we have to know about landmines that some 230 million of them are currently stored in a number of countries.
Between 70 and 100 million of them have been laid around the world.
It is unfortunate, moreover, that new ones are being laid all the time, so that great significance attaches to the issue of how we locate these landmines and destroy them, primarily in human terms - that is, about ensuring that people do not get hurt in the process - but also in economic terms - that is, about keeping costs down.
I would like to encourage the Commission to make the right use of the funds that we have inserted in the Budget for research purposes.
In recent years, we have kept on adding funds to the research framework programme for the purpose of researching new technologies for locating landmines, so they should be used for that purpose.
Progress has been made, and for that I want to express my gratitude, but these things are extraordinarily complex, and I would like again to encourage you to help, perhaps by developing some sort of multifunctional location device.
For my final comment, I turn to disarmament.
There are other things - weapons of mass destruction, for example - that have to be disposed of.
Every year, our Budget allocates some EUR 100 million to the disposal of chemical, biological and atomic weapons in the countries that formerly made up the Soviet Union.
I would like you to submit a report on this, and for us to have a debate on it or produce a statement on the subject.
After all, a great deal of money is involved and this is, above all, very much a live issue.
Weapons such as landmines and cluster bombs are a veritable nightmare.
Not only do they not discriminate between the military and innocent civilians, but after years of war they are still claiming victims among the population.
These weapons must be taken out of the arsenals for good.
Unlike cluster bombs, there is an international ban on landmines.
It is in part thanks to the European Union that the use and production of landmines is decreasing, trade in landmines has been stopped and that there are fewer victims.
However, as long as non-state actors are excluded from the banning process, there cannot be a world free of landmines.
That is why it is important that the European Union also targets these groups with its policy and puts the topic on the agenda for the next meeting on the Ottawa Convention.
Based on its experiences with landmines, it is good that the European Commission is now also developing strategies and programmes for unexploded ammunition from wars.
These new activities must not, however, be carried out at the expense of the campaign against landmines; extra money must be made available for this.
Many people also think that weapons containing depleted uranium also pose a risk to public health.
The Commissioner referred to research that says that actually there is no reason for this concern but I share the doubts of a number of my colleagues as to whether this is enough to justify coming to the conclusion that we can simply carry on using these weapons.
I am not reassured on that point yet.
No matter, it is high time that we opened our eyes to the cluster bombs and that we finally woke up from our nightmare.
Mr President, people throughout Europe will react with disbelief and anger to the statement that there is no reason for anxiety in relation to depleted uranium weapons.
It is tendentious to quote the Euratom Commission which exists explicitly to promote nuclear technology and whose radiation safety levels were originally set to allow atmospheric testing in the 1950s.
Thankfully we have done away with that.
Their anger is justified and is rising at the moment, because even low levels of alpha radiation can have a severe effect on children.
We know from testing that there are molecules of plutonium in these weapons that are isolated but can have an extremely severe effect when ingested.
Samples from six civilians near bombing targets in Afghanistan tested 100 times the normal level of uranium - contamination that stemmed from depleted uranium.
Afghan doctors have cited deaths from internal ailments such as haemorrhaging, pulmonary constriction and vomiting, which are all effects of radiation contamination.
During the Gulf War, allied troops admitted using over 300 tonnes of depleted uranium.
These are suspected to be a prime factor in the epidemic of birth defects, leukaemias and cancers in Iraq.
There is a difference between wet ground such as in Bosnia and desert conditions such as in Iraq and Afghanistan.
This is extremely serious.
I beg you not to have these children's deaths on your conscience, Commissioner, but to react more humanly and more seriously to this really dreadful situation.
Mr President, war and justice: a tense relationship, if not a contradictio in terminis.
Is war without violation of human rights possible?
For the combatants there is always the dilemma that showing too much respect for rights and obligations can lead to defeat, especially if you doubt the other party's respect for the principles of combat.
These truths must not undermine our support for the application of humanitarian law to warfare and its development.
That is why I welcome the negotiations on the question of unexploded ammunition left over from warfare.
In particular, there is a need for clarification of the responsibility for unexploded bombs that are left behind.
After all, unexploded bombs and shells continue to injure many people long after the end of an armed conflict.
The main role that I see for the European Commission is that of coordinating, informing and where necessary supporting Member States.
Accumulation of powers tends to lead to confusion rather than to practical help for the victims.
On the other hand the tension between justice and reality should make us cautious.
Our respect for international treaties must not be allowed to degenerate into misuse of this field of the law for political purposes.
After all, facile censure ultimately undermines the support for the principles of combat.
That is why I do not support the amendments of the Greens.
They confine themselves to one-sided criticism of one single nation while the conduct of many countries is extremely dubious in the light of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts.
Mr President, I refer to the motion for a resolution.
It is something of an emotional muddle and manages to confuse three unrelated elements: anti-tank mines, cluster bombs and depleted uranium munitions.
It fails to comprehend the nature of the work being done by the group of governmental experts on explosive remnants of war - a sensible body which is mindful of the need for the right balance between humanitarian concerns and military utility in regard to certain weapons.
The armed forces of our nations, and those of our NATO allies, are the most conscious of the need to protect civilian populations, avoid collateral damage and ensure that dangers to our own troops are minimised.
On landmines, I am proud to have been actively involved in the work to ban anti-personnel landmines and to have been instrumental in helping large-scale funding for assistance to mine victims and for mine clearance operations.
I congratulate the Commission in its continuing work in this area.
Our armed forces agreed that they could operate without anti-personnel landmines.
Anti-vehicle or anti-tank mines are a different matter.
Their humanitarian consequences are altogether less significant, and they are an indispensable military weapon as long as there are tanks on the battle field.
Unexploded ordnance is a problem in post-conflict situations and more work needs to be done on self-destruction and detection of munitions.
The very words 'depleted uranium' conjure up all sorts of fears and ideas related to radiation which seem to be wholly misplaced.
It is recognised that there could be a small risk from toxic dust for those working unprotected in close proximity to a vehicle hit by depleted uranium ammunition.
While I keep an open mind, there is currently no reliable medical evidence to link depleted uranium with ill health, either of troops or of local people.
This resolution is not really about any of these things.
It is wild scaremongering.
It calls for an immediate moratorium on munitions which are key weapons for use by coalition airforces and armoured forces currently deploying to the Gulf.
It is no coincidence perhaps that it follows an Iraqi proposition in the UN last October which sought to designate depleted uranium as a weapon of mass destruction.
This ruse was heavily defeated in the United Nations, only to reappear now in the European Parliament.
I hope that Members of this House will be very discriminating when they come to vote on the resolution tomorrow.
Mr President, I have to confess that I am rather concerned and astonished after hearing the Commissioner's statements.
We are on the eve of a war which we seem likely to wage on the basis of a mere suspicion: the suspicion that there may be chemical weapons.
I am concerned and astonished at the ease with which our suspicions - the suspicion that depleted uranium might have been used in a number of conflicts and that it might have had serious effects on civilians' health - are being dispelled.
I will mention just three facts.
Firstly, Nato has not banned depleted uranium weapons, and the fact that it has not banned them leads us to fear, to believe that they have been used, that they might even have been used more than once.
Secondly, a statement by the US Secretary of State for Defence in January last year referred to an increase in radiation emissions from depleted uranium weapons in Afghanistan. Thirdly, a number of medical tests carried out - under very difficult conditions because of the situation - in Afghanistan by a Canadian NGO found depleted uranium levels a hundred times as high as usual, due - it is extremely likely - to the use of depleted uranium weapons.
Now, in the light of all this, it would seem to be too easy, too hasty to claim that we do not have enough information to be able to presume to raise our voice and call for these weapons not to be used in any conflict and, in particular, to call for the danger of such weapons being used in Iraq to be avoided.
This is the essence of our resolution but, tomorrow, it will be the responsibility of the Council and the Commission not just not to exclude the possibility of this danger being fully prevented once and for all but to demand it.
Mr President, exactly this time last week I was in Basra, in the south of Iraq, with my fellow colleagues on the Parliamentary delegation.
In Basra we were shown the most harrowing images of children who were born with the most terrible birth malformities as a result of the radiation from the last Gulf War, when allied forces used depleted uranium warheads.
I wish Tony Blair and George Bush had been at that hospital.
If they had, perhaps they would stop saying that this illegal and immoral war they are about to unleash on Iraq is somehow in the interests of the Iraqi people.
The people of Iraq are still paying the price of the last war in cancers, leukaemias and deaths.
I wish Commissioner Byrne had been at that hospital too.
The facts are there.
If the methodologies cited by him cannot explain them, then I would suggest that his methodologies are wrong.
Indeed, increasing numbers of scientists are demonstrating that the impact of low-level radiation has been consistently underestimated.
There are weaknesses in those methodologies.
They are not right methodologies.
By denying that, we do the people of Iraq a double disservice and the deaths go on.
Thank you, Mr President.
I have just one comment to make because a question was asked about Greece and the anti-personnel landmine convention.
I should like to point out that the Greek Government has signed this convention.
The convention was ratified by the Greek parliament and I did not understand the insinuations or what exactly the two speakers were trying to say.
Mr President, perhaps I might deal with a few of the issues that were addressed, particularly in relation to health matters.
This issue, as I indicated earlier, has been considered not just by the Commission, and not just by the Council of Ministers, but also by Parliament.
As I mentioned earlier, the STOA report of May 2001 concluded, among other things, that in the light of the epidemiological studies on persons exposed to depleted uranium in Iraq and the Balkans, among a relatively small group of soldiers, who evidently had been exposed to depleted uranium during the Gulf War, no health problems attributable to depleted uranium could be found.
Among the British Gulf War veterans neither the overall death rate nor the occurrence of specific causes of death, such as cancer, are significantly different from those of a reference population.
No association between the health problems of many Gulf War veterans, that is Gulf War Syndrome, and suspected depleted uranium exposure could be found.
In the case of German Kfor soldiers in Kosovo potentially exposed to depleted uranium, it could be demonstrated that no significant intake had occurred.
Preliminary results of a medical expertise show that the incidence of leukaemia among the Italian Kfor troops is not significantly higher than the incidence in a reference population.
Thus, it can be concluded that, so far, there is no scientific evidence of health damage among army personnel or civilian populations as a consequence of the use of DU ammunition in the Gulf War or the war in the Balkans.
Controversial information and reports about the dramatic health effects of DU among soldiers of the Iraqi and Yugoslav armies, and among the civilian population in the area concerned, do not withstand a peer review. The Commission came to exactly the same view when it considered these issues and studies, as did the Council.
The STOA report went on to say that 'having comprehensively reviewed and cross-examined most of the specialised scientific literature, in particular the medical literature, judged reliable and trustworthy.
Having in mind the results provided by the medical observation over decades of workers in the uranium industry, as well as by the experiments with animals. Taking into account the results of the recent investigations in Iraq and in the Balkans, of the effect on man and on the environment following the use of DU', the use of DU ammunition in Iraq and the Balkans 'neither has led to a serious widespread contamination of the environment nor represents an acute or appreciable long-term hazard for man's health'.
It then it goes on to give a number of recommendations, none of which coincide with the views that have been expressed by the largely Green Members of Parliament who have spoken here this evening.
I should say that having regard to all of these scientific studies, the seriousness and comprehensiveness of the work that has been undertaken -including by representatives of this House, the Council and the Commission - it seems to me that those who have adopted the approach we have taken must - I say this in response to Mrs Ahern - have a clear conscience.
The same, I suspect, cannot be said of those who make allegations that are unfounded against people who are doing their best to provide proper answers to these questions.
The debate is closed.
I should like to inform the House that I have received 6 motions for resolutions on this subject under Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure
Mr President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo, for her report concerning the Commission's 'Forest Focus' proposal for a regulation on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions
The proposal aims to contribute to the protection of the Community's forests by means of monitoring.
It builds on the achievements of the two Council regulations on the protection of the Community's forests against air pollution and fires, which expired at the end of last year.
However, the proposal broadens the scope to include new environmental issues such as biodiversity, climate change, carbon sequestration and soils.
The protection of forests and the enhancement of their multifunctional role are matters of particular importance and urgency in the Union.
The Community and the Member States are committed to implementing internationally agreed activities and to set up monitoring and reporting systems.
Sound political decisions have to be based on reliable information.
We need harmonised and comprehensive long-term monitoring of forests at Community level.
It is essential in order to provide information on the temporal and spatial variation in the condition of forests.
Experience from the previous forest monitoring scheme shows that the harmonisation of data collection is of major importance.
There are two key issues which deserve special attention.
Firstly, comitology.
The report considers whether the principle of subsidiarity needs to be reinforced in the context of Forest Focus, and proposes strengthening the role of Member States in the proposed monitoring scheme.
Experience from the previous Community scheme shows that close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is indeed needed to set up an efficient monitoring scheme.
That is why the Commission proposed strengthening the comitology arrangements by incorporating a Management Committee.
This is an approach which balances the evident need for greater involvement of the Member States, whilst being proportional to what, in Community terms, is a relatively modest scheme.
Our view is that the characteristics of the scheme proposed closely fit the criteria for management committees set out in the Council decision on comitology.
Secondly, I would like to address the important aspect of forest fire prevention measures.
Fires have affected forests in many parts of the Community, but in particular in the southern parts of the Community.
The Commission takes this seriously and will ensure that all forest fire related measures introduced by the now lapsed Council Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 will continue to be covered in future by Community legislation.
The proposal for 'Forest Focus' and the regulation on rural development together meet these requirements.
The activities that were not already covered by the provisions of the regulation on rural development, such as specific studies, and the forest fire information system, are now addressed by 'Forest Focus'.
The Commission fully understands Parliament's concerns, which are reflected in those amendments concerning forest fire prevention measures.
However, the Commission regrets that the incorporation of forest fire prevention measures within the 'Forest Focus' proposal cannot be accepted.
Our two institutions share the objective of preventing forest fires, but this duplication of measures already covered by the rural development regulation would lead to legal and budgetary uncertainty which may impede our attainment of those objectives.
I should like to reassure Members that the approach proposed by the Commission will allow the continuity of the forest fire prevention measures.
The Commission has already urged Member States to incorporate any necessary amendments to their national or regional rural development plans.
The question of the budget increase is linked to the issue of fire prevention measures.
It follows that just as the Commission does not support additional fire prevention measures within the proposal, nor does it support the proposed budget increase.
Mr President, Commissioner, as the Commission has just said, we are dealing with a report which we will vote on tomorrow, which has been approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and which in overall terms has supported the report produced by this rapporteur.
Forest Focus replaces two regulations in force until December 2002, the legal basis of which, changed from the former Article 130 to the current Article 175, was changed on 25 February.
In other words, it became subject to approval by co-decision.
This report studied both protection against fires and atmospheric pollution, and now actions in the field of biodiversity, climate change and the retention of carbon are going to be included.
Actions in the sixth framework action programme in the field of the environment which the European Commission and the Community are obliged to implement.
However, the proposal replaces the majority of the measures on fire prevention in the former Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92.
Now, the Commissioner has just told us that these measures are included in the rural and regional development programmes which he mentioned.
I must say to him that the Member States have already presented the plans of the rural development Regulation, which was approved in 2000, but which has not been able to take account of fire prevention plans.
Therefore, it does not seem to make sense to have asked the Member States to guess that in 2003 or at the end of 2002, as it should have been, this Parliament and the Commission were going to debate the replacement of the Regulation and that it was going to be transferred to the rural development programme and furthermore that it was going to be transferred with a miserable budget of EUR 5 million, because this quantity does not appear in the rural development programme.
It will therefore have to appear in order to balance the 2002 budget.
That is, EUR 18 million per year.
Now, Commissioner, we are spending EUR 18 million.
That is what is balanced and consolidated in 2002.
The Commission proposes EUR 13 million.
It seems absurd that we want to take the same measures, plus those relating to biodiversity, climate change and the retention of carbon, with such a significant reduction in the budget.
I believe that considerable efforts have been made, both by the Council and by this Parliament, to reach to a compromise agreement, with compromise measures which ended in 2006.
It appears that it has not been possible for the Commission to reach this agreement.
I am sorry, Commissioner, but this is a regulation which is decided by means of co-decision in this Parliament and I therefore believe that the proposal which was originally on the table has been withdrawn by this rapporteur in Amendment No 44 so that we can all discuss it on equal terms.
I believe that we all have to make a move, not just Parliament.
Of the amendments presented by the Group of the European Socialist Party, this rapporteur accepts Amendment No 48.
However, Amendment No 47 is not acceptable since it would go against the spirit of the report.
There are other amendments presented by this rapporteur: two of them are amendments of a legal nature, and a third in which all we ask is that the idea already included in the recitals of increasing the scope of the European forest information system be incorporated into the Articles.
I would have liked to have introduced some other ideas, such as prioritising certain methodological projects and also promoting 'old' activities, if I may put it like that, and not just those proposed in the new modules.
I also believe that it would most advisable for the time periods to last one year, and that there be a pilot period, which needs to take account of the frequent interactions of the experts.
I do not believe it is a good idea to transfer these issues to the rural development programme, Commissioner, since that would mean moving from the only regulation which is currently subject to co-decision and it is the only regulation which protects our forests.
I would say, to use rather unorthodox terms for a plenary session, that this would be like leaving a sweet at the gates of a school.
Commissioner, we have time to clarify both the budget and the harmony of these regulations.
I believe we are obliged to do so.
Mr President, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez has drawn up an excellent and comprehensive report on the monitoring of forests and environmental interactions, for which I thank her sincerely.
The Commission proposal combines two former regulations, one of which concerns the protection of the forests from air pollution and the other forest fire prevention.
The Committee on Budgets has delivered an opinion on this matter.
In its first opinion it said that the financial statement of the Commission proposal is compatible with the ceiling of heading 3 of the financial perspective and that it will not restrict other action in the period 2003-2006.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, however, raised this financial framework of EUR 52 million to EUR 67 million.
This being the case, the Committee on Budgets stated that the framework was compatible with the ceiling of heading 3, if necessary through a reduction of other policies or through recourse to the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement.
In practice the Committee on Budgets is warning that reductions in other areas of policy will have to be made or increases in the financial perspective will have to be resorted to, which will be politically very difficult.
The opinion of the Committee on Budgets is based on the new Rule 63a in Parliament's Rules of Procedure, which obliges a committee to adopt a position on the compatibility of proposed legislation with the financial perspective.
This is meant as a guiding principle for the plenary debate, which of course is free to take its own decision.
This week Rule 63a is being applied not only to this report but also to that by Ulla SandbÃŠk, for example.
It should be noted that if the committee responsible increases the financial framework in question it must once again request an opinion from the Committee on Budgets.
Verification of compatibility does on no account constitute a position on whether the proposal by the committee responsible regarding a larger financial framework is appropriate or reasonable.
This procedure will hopefully become automatic and natural.
The plenary session must have knowledge regarding the compatibility of the financial framework with the financial perspective so that it can take its decision.
The procedure increases the responsibility of the committees responsible for the legislative proposal being debated at the time.
Activity-based budgeting, which is already established, also has the same objective.
Verification of financial compatibility under Rule 63a thus serves, above all, the interests of the committee responsible.
Mr President, Commissioner, as draftsman for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development I would like to thank you, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, for the preparatory work you have done, which shows what a good grasp of the issue you have.
You took account of the substance of our opinion at the preparatory stage when you were doing your own preparatory work.
For that I thank you sincerely.

Our greatest causes for concern in the preparatory work were connected with two matters: the Commission would have liked to assume the authority that normally belongs to the Member States in matters to do with forests, and, secondly, it sought to insist on an unrealistic data gathering programme on the part of the Member States that would have been unreasonable, not to say impossible, to realise in practice.
This unrealistic attitude was particularly apparent in the targets for measuring biodiversity, calculating the frequency of occurrence of species.
When considering costs, it is not appropriate to move forward to a context of action on a wider scale than that now being undertaken internationally within the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
It would be wise to investigate the situation first and then see.
With the changes we are making we can guarantee that forestry policy will remain in the hands of individual countries and of the Standing Forest Committee that represents the Member States.
Information compiled in the future in the EU will be important for monitoring the development of the forest ecosystem, but we cannot base a forestry policy, an EU approach to the management and use of forests, on that.
I would in this connection like to point out that forests vary greatly in different parts of the EU and forests and timber mean very different things in different countries.
It is owing to these differences that I have strong reservations about any forestry policy being managed from Brussels.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like first of all to express my support for the report by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez.
It is true that forests play an essential role, because they have a multifunctional role, and as president of a regional national park I am particularly sensitive to the various measures concerning the preservation of natural spaces, and in particular forests.
They are essential to us, amongst other things in order to prevent climate change.
However, we should not regard forest areas solely as the lungs of Europe.
They are not just green spaces; they are also a not inconsiderable source of economic, social and tourism activity.
At Community level, it is essential to compare the various experiments being carried out in Member States in order to promote the exchange of information and create an effective benchmarking system.
We must never lose sight of the fact that it is at the most local level that this part of our heritage is managed best and will continue to be managed best.
This is why the monitoring of forests should not be the sole responsibility of the European Union.
The principle of subsidiarity is vital, and what is involved here is almost a range of responsibilities shared between the Union and the Member States, the Union and local governments. and the Union and local operators represented within the European Advisory Committee on Forestry and Cork and the Standing Forestry Committee.
It is for the Union, in conjunction with the Member States, to determine the broad outlines of the measures and the main objectives, and to make provision for adequate financial resources to enable those objectives to be achieved.
The Council has a responsibility to take on here.
The Commission is proposing that repair measures following forest fires should be reinforced.
I totally agree with this important step, but I would also ask that research into the causes of such fires should be reinforced.
Repair should not be the sole objective of long-term management.
As part of the move to preserve our forest areas, public awareness is important, because the forests belong first and foremost to the public, and it is up to us, as Members of the European Parliament, to represent that public.
That is why I believe that forests should definitely come within the scope of the codecision procedure.
Mr President, it is important for us to look after the forests in Europe.
Commitment to monitoring biodiversity, climate change and carbon retention and soils calls for multifunctional action.
There are tasks in this area that we can deal with jointly at European Union level.
These include the development of common knowledge to serve as a basis for the ecological monitoring of forests, so that information based on genuine knowledge is obtained on the state of the forests.
As we develop the measures to be taken we nevertheless have to remember that the importance of forests varies greatly in different parts of Europe.
The forests themselves are also different.
For this reason any questions relating to forestry must be regarded as being based on the principle of subsidiarity.
Neither should we develop new institutions. The tasks contained in the EU's forestry action plan must be dealt with within the context of present systems, making use of existing monitoring methods.
At Union level responsibility must lie with the Commission and the European Environment Agency.
The Commission must also work in close cooperation with the Standing Forestry Committee.
I wish to thank the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, for having worked to take the Commission proposal in this direction, by which I mean she has focused on the importance of the principle of subsidiarity.
I do, however, think it problematic that the rapporteur has included measures relating to forest fire prevention in this regulation.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees that forest fire prevention is an important part of European collaboration and a matter that requires solidarity among us.
The difference of opinion is connected, however, with how this should be financed.
We heard in the Commissioner's speech that the Commission in its proposal has worked on the assumption that provision for forest fire prevention is to be made by means of the rural development fund.
The PSE Group has tabled Amendment No 47 which aims to guarantee that all operational sectors are taken into account equally in this regulation.
Neither is the PSE Group in favour of increasing appropriations for the Forest Focus action plan, as agreed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We first have to discover what measures are to become the European Union's responsibility, and what again it is more sensible and more economical to do within the context of existing systems.
It is not until we have discovered this that we can decide what sort of increase the budget needs.
At this stage we shall oppose the increase in the budget referred to above.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with a timely and relevant saying.
It goes, 'The culture of peoples is measured in terms of their love for trees' - and I would like the peoples of the European Union to demonstrate this.
When we talk about forests we are talking about one of the most important ecosystems on Earth given their wealth and importance for the international community, since they offer both productive and protective services.
The European continent shows the general characteristics of a region located in the planet's northern hemisphere and has forests with highly differentiated coniferous and non-coniferous species which reflect the regional biodiversity and bio-climatic wealth of the old Europe.
In view of all of this, we must recognise the importance today of the report by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez for nature in the European Union. I believe there are various reasons for this.
On the one hand, the report considers in a general sense the general actions necessary to prevent the deterioration of Community forests as a result of atmospheric pollution and insists on implementing a specific European Union policy to combat forest fires, which are one of the factors threatening the survival of the forests.
Furthermore, it specifically recognises the ecological wealth of certain European regions, such as the so-called outermost regions, in which certain forest ecosystems stand out, which in some cases are genuine natural botanical museums, as in the case of the region I come from, the Canary Islands, where forest observatories should be established in these unique Macaronesian islands, one of the bio-geographical regions of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) with the greatest biodiversity in the European Union.
But all of this could come to nought if the Commission does not allocate the funding needed to adopt the measures necessary to achieve an appropriate European policy on forests.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her sensitivity to the problem of forests and on her courage in defending the Community forests.
Mr President, it is important to remember, in the context of this debate, the importance of the actions undertaken under Regulation 2158 on the protection of Community forests against fires because this complementary action has contributed to and indeed made possible various projects intended to achieve prevention through actions to combat the causes and forest fires that represent a veritable scourge for various regions, especially in Portugal.
Between 1992 and 2002 around 800 projects and 18 national programmes were funded in six countries, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal, totalling around EUR 123.6 million, which demonstrates the importance of this Regulation.
Consequently, taking account of the degree of efficiency and budgetary execution of the programme, which has always lacked further means, it becomes important to keep up actions to protect forests (both actions against both pollution and fires) included in the same Regulation, thereby honouring commitments, which will become redundant with the entry into force of the current regulation.
We must take account of the fact that whereas pollution affects northern Europe more, forest fires are a scourge of the South, which means that the exclusion proposed by the Commission makes no sense, especially given that the preventive measures included in Regulation 2158/1992 contain actions not covered by the regulation on rural development, which has other aims for forests and forestry, despite what the Commissioner has said.
The failure to include these preventive measures in this regulation would mean a reduction in funds for fire prevention and would call into question a set of projects already underway, which have already demonstrated the added value of Community action.
I therefore agree with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, seeking to uphold fire prevention actions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez for this report.
Our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can support this report in its entirety and without reservation.
Whilst I think it very much something to be welcomed that we at last have a commitment to woodland at European level, I share Mrs Figueiredo's view that we have to try to concentrate more on biodiversity, changes in climate and the database for monitoring purposes, and that perhaps less prominence should be given to forest fires.
We must be clear in our own minds about one thing: this, too, is a matter of environmental concern, and so we should try to give this important step our support.
We hope that this report can be adopted as soon as possible and will enjoy broad support in Parliament as early as first reading stage, so that we can start to implement this programme as soon as possible and so that the Member States have the resources to at last implement this programme in a practical way.
Today marks the first occasion on which I have not needed to make use of all my speaking time, as I believe that we all agree that what matters is that we assign greater importance to European woodland, seeing it as an essential habitat and making it clear that changes in climate have to be monitored, and that the Commission's approach has to be widened a great deal to take account of biodiversity.
We therefore give the report our full support and hope that the Member States will be able to get down to work as soon as possible.
My thanks again to all those who have given their assistance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, year after year Portuguese forests are the silent victims of fires, which are becoming increasingly frequent, intense and devastating.
Every summer brings with it this national scourge and its consequences, which are tragic at various levels: economic, ecological, social and human.
Our forest heritage is gradually burning down and disappearing.
Sustainable forest management is becoming increasingly complex and technical.
Apart from fires, forests are exposed to other, more recent threats, caused by atmospheric pollution and climate change.
It is always worth reminding fellow Members and making them aware of the importance of forests and their resources.
To do this, it shall suffice to state that forests represent around 40% of the Union's territory, a percentage that will increase once the process of enlargement is concluded.
I therefore warmly welcome the Forest Focus Programme, a Community initiative that will help to protect and value forests in Portugal and throughout the Community.
European Union policy dovetails perfectly with cooperation in gathering data and in sharing experience and information amongst the various Member States.
The Commission's initiative takes account of the legislative framework in force to protect forests against fires and atmospheric pollution and furthermore introduces a new Community mechanism for the long-term monitoring of forests and environmental interactions.
For this programme's financial support, it has been decided to allocate it a multiannual financial framework, covering the period 2003-2008, totalling EUR 67 million.
Monitoring is actually the key word in this proposal.
I therefore heartily support Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez's idea that it makes perfect sense to maintain specific measures for fire protection and rural development.
I also agree that this proposal must cover the commitments given in the Convention on Climate Change, which portrays forests as sinks full of greenhouse gases.
Lastly, I am bound to regret the fact that the Commission proposal abuses the principle of subsidiarity, giving the Member States a rather passive role whereas it is their forests that suffer the damage.
Even more serious is the fact that the Commission proposal does not cover the measures to prevent forest fires previously funded under Regulation No 2158/92.
I therefore support all the amendments to the proposal that are intended to give the Member States greater involvement.
Mr President, I agree with most Members in believing that forest management is essentially a local and national matter, since forests throughout Europe are different and consist of individual types of forest.
On the other hand, I do not think it odd that Europe should be concerned about the health of the whole of its forest heritage, because air pollution, plant diseases and even natural or accidental disasters do not recognise borders.
Consequently, the best formula is no doubt the one referred to by Mrs GrossetÃªte, in other words codecision, or development towards codecision, in matters concerning forests.
Having said that, apart from any approval that might be given to this Forest Focus programme, I believe that it has a harmful effect on a policy which was much appreciated and which was working very well, in other words Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92, which has been mentioned by a number of Members.
I live in a region in the south of France, in which great efforts are being made, in terms of investment, to prevent forest fires.
What is happening at the moment is highly regrettable, a sort of conjuring trick whereby Forest Focus first of all abolishes a source of funding which was managed under the codecision procedure, and renationalises it under the heading of rural development, even though, as Mrs Figueiredo said just now, we do not all have the same legal basis, we probably do not have the same funding, and we are also unable to finance the same types of investment.
I am sorry that a policy which works is being changed.
Moreover, it was a safety policy.
Despite the fact that efforts are being made everywhere else in Europe with regard to maritime safety, air safety, rail safety or even health safety, the Commission is now proposing to simply do away with a policy of prevention and safety in the area of forests, which is an extremely sensitive area for all the countries in southern Europe.
I believe that this is a deplorable step backwards.
I am afraid that if, one day, we have disasters in the south of our continent, the public will blame us.
We are always saying that we want to be closer to the people, that Europe should have solidarity, that Europe should be on the side of Europeans.
Yet in this extremely sensitive area, for which there was a procedure which worked well and was particularly well appreciated, Europe is now becoming invisible.
It is removing this procedure from its policies and is renationalising it under the heading of a particularly risky policy of rural development.
This is why I shall be supporting the remarkable work done by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez and, in particular, the amendments which she has proposed, Amendments Nos 17 and 21, as well as Amendment No 47, proposed by the European Socialist Party.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will reconsider your initial proposals, explaining that they will not be supported by the Commission.
Mr President, I wish to thank our fellow MEP, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, for the sterling work she has done.
Firstly, I want to say that I have nothing against those parts relating to forest fires and air pollution, for these are phenomena that are not confined within boundaries and that affect all countries in the same way.
We cannot, however, support the third part relating to common monitoring of biodiversity.
Why?
Well, because this is an issue only affecting the Member States in as much as it is not possible to compare biodiversity in northern Scandinavia with that in southern Spain, or biodiversity in the Greek archipelago with that on the west coast of Ireland.
What is more, no one can now say what is meant by biodiversity in a European perspective.
If the Commission is asked what there is by way of a common forestry policy in Europe, the answer is that no such policy exists.
If the Commission then repeatedly introduces new monitoring tools into this area, a policy is created in secrecy, and that is unacceptable.
This is also an issue of ownership.
Were it to be deemed under the policy that the biodiversity on a particular piece of land or in a particular area was so important that it needed to be conserved for the future - certain islands were mentioned just recently in this context - who would then compensate whoever was forfeiting his or her asset?
The issue of compensation is at present an issue for each Member State.
Where is the logic in this whole decision?
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Redondo on the magnificent work she has done on her report.
I believe that all of us here consider it very important to continue improving and fighting for these measures against the factors which contribute to all the deterioration of the European Union's forests, such as fires and acid rain, to which we can now add the Commission's proposal, relating to the fight to improve biodiversity.
In view of the obvious deterioration of the forests, I believe you should be sensitive to Mrs Redondo's proposals.
One of the issues I know best and which I believe is highly topical relates to the southern European regions, which are - as you know - most sensitive to the risks of forest fires.
With regard to these regions we must continue to develop and expand a specific policy and we must combat forest fires.
In relation to the Mediterranean forests, although they offer a great variety of strategies for combating drought, at the same time these strategies make it very easy for them to catch fire.
The dry, arid climate, accidents - caused voluntarily or involuntarily - are reasons for the vulnerability of an ecosystem which is under a lot of pressure and which requires a lot of assistance if it is to be conserved.
We will therefore support Mrs Redondo's report, and we ask the Commission to be sensitive to her amendments, and also, the great majority of the speeches of those of us who are trying to support the report by Mrs Redondo.
Prevention and safety are very important in terms of maintaining all the European forests, above all in view of the characteristics of the southern forests.
It is essential that the Commission take note and that it be sensitive to this report and our speeches defending the forests.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is hardly necessary to talk about the importance of forests to the European Union, in light of the fact that they occupy 40% of our territory and that they provide two and a half million jobs, not to mention their importance to the environment, as the Kyoto protocol recently acknowledged.
It is therefore hard to understand why this Commission proposal excludes the cofinancing of measures to prevent forest fires, measures that were previously funded under Regulation 2158/92.
The southern parts of the European Union are at greatest risk of desertification, as various speakers have already said, due to their hot, arid climate, which is extremely propitious to fires.
Therefore, if we wish seriously to preserve the forests of southern Europe, we will have to provide for the funding of fire prevention measures.
Unless the Council adopts Parliament's amendments to achieve this, the countries of southern Europe will not have the means to continue the actions they have embarked on to prevent forest fires, actions which, by their very nature, cannot be separated from monitoring actions provided for, incidentally, in the regulation.
Unless forests are protected from fires, there is no point in talking about biodiversity, because when fires occur, they burn down everything.
Neither plants nor animals survive.
Tens of thousands of hectares burn down every year in Portugal and in other Mediterranean countries.
Parliament has been sensitive to this scourge and has therefore proposed - and I hope will adopt - the amendments presented to us by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez.
Unless the Council is able to understand this, doubts will remain as to its ability to understand the reality of the situation of Europe's forests.
I thank and congratulate Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, who has guided us through this matter extremely ably, with great skill and tenacity.
Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, am sincerely grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo.
The way that this new proposal Forest Focus combines two old demands, that woodland be protected against environmental pollution and against fires, meets with my fundamental approval.
Just so that you realise that I know what I am talking about, Commissioner, I will say that I have a background in forestry, but in a northern country.
I want to strongly emphasise the point of principle that forestry policy must remain in the hands of the Member States, and to keep on reminding the Commission of the principle of subsidiarity.
Will Forest Focus have a beneficial effect on woodland and on those who own it, or is this just another exercise in keeping new hordes of bureaucrats employed and fed?
I have to tell you that, representing as I do the German province of North Rhine-Westphalia, I get the impression that Brussels takes absolutely no notice of what is really going on in European forestry.
Within the European Union, 65% of the woodland is owned and managed by 12 million forest owners, and this branch of agriculture causes them serious problems as far as profitability is concerned.
Two years ago, we ran a conference on this subject in Brussels.
In my homeland, Commissioner, young farmers no longer have any interest in woodlands or in forestry.
The property rights of woodland farmers are constantly being eroded.
Why should a forester give his all without getting financial compensation, often without his efforts even being recognised by society?
If we say yes to it, Forest Focus will have to cover the social, economic and ecological fields in Europe.
Bio-diversity and monitoring have a nice sound to them, but they do not give woodland farmers any financial entitlements in respect of the work they do.
Let me say in conclusion that it is not those who are constantly discussing woodlands who are engaged in caring for nature and protecting it.
I can tell you that if we do not succeed in making forestry a more profitable proposition overall for agriculture, young people in my homeland will simply throw in the towel.
Even now, they are no longer prepared to clear up storm damage, for they take the line that this is a luxury they cannot afford.
Let us not start imposing more and more new demands on them.
Let us help to clean up the air.
Let us help provide compensatory measures as well, so that they can do such things as fertilising the soil with manure and lime. Things really have to be said on the basis of practical experience, instead of just the empty forms of words that really do try my patience this late in the evening.
Mr President, firstly I should like to finalise my remarks concerning the amendments.
I am pleased to say that there are 31 amendments which the Commission can fully support in part or in principle.
The amendments which the Commission cannot support are: Amendments 1, 3, 8 to 11, 14, 21, 31, 35, 40 to 42, 45, 46 and 48 to 49.
Concerning the discussion about the financial issue of the EUR 5 million, the budget line available for the regulations on atmospheric pollution and forest fires also covered the EFICS.
The EFICS has never utilised the available resources and there has not been an effort on the part of Member States to utilise the provisions of this regulation in the past.
The proposal is based on the amount of EUR 16 million, which constituted the resources available for 2001, when the transfer of responsibilities of the two regulations had been finalised between DGs Agriculture and Environment.
This amount has been reallocated between Forest Focus - EUR 13 million - and EFICS - EUR 3 million - to cover the monitoring needs related to forests.
As the rural development budget and provisions cover the measures on forest fire prevention, it was not deemed necessary to transfer additional resources to the rural development regulation.
This type of transfer cannot guarantee that the available resources are not reattributed only to the Member States that have been recipients under the fire prevention regulation in the past.
I have taken careful note of the views expressed in the debate, but I must stand by my previous remarks about the Commission's views on these issues.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the explanations he has given us, but he will understand that with the package of amendments the Commission is rejecting ...
Tomorrow this Parliament will vote on the report and then we will have to continue working in order to be able to achieve at some point a common position which can be accepted by this House.
That is far away, Commissioner, and I believe that it is now the Commission which is obliged to make an effort.
It has just told us that the prevention of fires is already included. I would ask, 'where?', Commissioner.
We have discussed it many times; and as for the EFIS, this is an issue which is still being considered and which does not have so many arguments.
We have just seen the Commission run out of arguments.
It should reflect, and we should all reflect, in order to find a common position which is good for the forests of Europe, which, as we have seen here, is necessary and which this House supports.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
Forests are an environmental, economic and national resource of incalculable value, as well as a source of health for the whole world, for the whole of Europe and for each individual country and, if we do not wish to become poorer by the year, the Commission and the national governments should treat them as such.
I therefore consider that the Commission's proposed 'Forest Focus' places the emphasis on the right direction.
However, I must point out that this proposal precludes the fire prevention measures for which provision is made in Regulation 2158/92, but which were not included in Regulation 1257/99, resulting in a very silly situation in which we have more money for monitoring forests and less money for preventing forest fires.
If you cannot stop the fires, what is the point in monitoring the forests?
I therefore suggest that attention should be given to continuing and increasing funding for preventive measures.
Neighbouring countries need to cooperate, so that they can prevent and fight fires efficiently, because fires do not recognise and more often than not cut across borders.
If we are to be able to implement an ambitious programme, the budget of EUR 52 million for 2003-2006 needs to be increased to EUR 67 million, with provision for a proportionate increase following enlargement.
The next item is the report (A5-0020/2003) tabled by Mrs Ulla Margrethe SandbÃŠk, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries [COM(2002) 120 - C5-0114/2002 - 2002/0052(COD)].
I thank the rapporteur, Mrs SandbÃŠk, for her efforts to secure adoption at first reading.
Our proposal for a regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries is very important in contributing to improved health outcomes and achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Let me reinforce this message by giving you one stark fact: maternal mortality in Africa has remained relatively constant in the last 10 years and largely affects the poorest women.
In some countries, for example Malawi, maternal mortality is increasing.
I find this unacceptable and we, as Europeans, need to show our commitment to improving this situation.
This regulation addresses the unacceptably high death and illness rates of women by giving us the means to carry out the principles and policies agreed in the Programme for Action of the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 and the Key Actions adopted five years later.
The main principles are: the basic right for people to protect their reproductive and sexual rights; the right of universal access to care, services and products; and the right to choose freely the number and spacing of their children.
There is a need for this regulation to fund innovative actions, which are cost-effective and have the potential to be replicated in other areas or scaled up using other funding resources.
It will serve to develop local partnerships with the different actors and, where appropriate, contribute to regional or global initiatives.
First of all, I would like to thank the two shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Martens and Mrs Sauquillo, for their great cooperation.
I would also like to thank the Commission, the Council and the secretariat.
This regulation replaces a former one that expired in December last year.
It was necessary to try to get this regulation adopted at first reading.
Without the cooperation of all these actors this would not have been possible.
For the same reason, it is only necessary to adopt those amendments that have been agreed upon among these actors.
This is, as Commissioner Nielson mentioned, a very important regulation.
Every minute of every day, 380 women become pregnant.
Of them, one woman dies.
One hundred and ninety women have unwanted pregnancies; 110 women face a pregnancy-related problem; 40 women have unsafe abortions.
It is a fact that pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death and disability for women in the developing countries.
Every year 600 000 women die as a direct result of getting pregnant.
An estimated 30% to 40% more are left with serious complications.
This is appalling, especially since at least 75% of all deaths and injuries could be prevented through basic and affordable reproductive health care measures.
This is what reproductive health care and rights are all about - saving women's lives.
This regulation is about providing women in the developing countries with access to the most basic services - those services which we take for granted - and also, where it is legal, to include in these services the choice of a safe abortion.
The regulation specifically underlines that abortion should never be used as a means of contraception.
The regulation also emphasises that everything possible should be done to avoid abortions.
In fact, it has been proved that in those countries where reproductive health care was introduced, the abortion rate dropped by 25% immediately.
This has, for instance, been the case in Russia.
A lot of allegations have been made against this report.
There has been misinformation, confusing information, unacceptable information and misleading information, such as the statement that, for instance, in the US the teaching of abstinence only has resulted in the decline of teenage pregnancies whereas, on the contrary, it has been proved that good sex education, information and counselling have reduced teenage pregnancies.
It has been implied that this regulation could leave the door open to use abortion as a means of contraception or even birth control.
It has even been implied that this regulation would be used to keep down the number of the poor.
The use of condoms has been compared to playing Russian roulette.
Those are just a few examples of what this regulation has been accused of.
All of this is obviously completely untrue.
The Commissioner has already mentioned that this is a follow-up to the Cairo programme which was signed by all of our Member States, and that is exactly so.
Moreover, it has become a very balanced report.
It puts a lot of emphasis on education.
It puts a lot of emphasis on counselling.
Nobody who reads this report can doubt that it never recommends abortion.
On the contrary, it says that everything should be done to avoid abortion, but if a woman in a developing country has an unwanted pregnancy she should not be deprived of the right to a safe abortion, a right which we have in our part of the world.
We cannot leave a woman in the Third World to die because she has an unwanted pregnancy.
That would be immoral.
I have been travelling extensively in Africa.
Wherever I have travelled I have visited small clinics for reproductive health and rights.
These clinics are the only place people can go to be tested for HIV-AIDS.
When they come with their children they are treated for all kinds of other diseases as well: if they have malaria, then the malaria is treated.
It is extremely important to have centres for reproductive health and rights.
The HIV-AIDS issue is one of the reasons why we have asked to have the amount of money raised compared to the last regulation.
It is very important that a woman can be tested to see whether she is HIV positive. It is very important that a woman can have counselling as to how she can protect herself against HIV-AIDS.
You cannot fight poverty without sexual and reproductive health care.
I am very happy that we have raised the amount, in comparison with the last regulation.
I am very pleased that we have now secured the consensus reached so painstakingly at the UN Conference in Cairo and which is soon to have its 10th anniversary.
We will soon be at Cairo+10, and this is therefore a very important signal: we back the Cairo consensus here in Europe, here in the European Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for this report, I must say that we issued our opinion last June with necessary speed for the multi-annual programme, which covers 2003-2006, to be fulfilled within the scheduled time period, but it was no use because, in view of the dates we are dealing with, it has clearly not been fulfilled.
Without getting into an assessment of the main report which, naturally, is the responsibility of the Committee on Development, from a budgetary point of view I would like to say that the new financial framework proposed by the Commission meant an increase of 78% in the new programme in comparison with the previous one, which ended on 31 December 2002, which reflects the importance the Community attaches to this programme with a view to improving the reproductive health of people without sufficient economic resources in the developing countries.
The financial framework we voted on in the Committee on Budgets was the one that appeared in the Commission's preliminary draft budget and which was finally ratified in the 2003 budget.
It will not be possible to increase the amount proposed without reducing other policies in the same heading, because the financial ceiling has already been reached.
The new Rules of Procedure have already entered into force and we therefore have Rule 63, which says: 'When the committee responsible amends the financial endowment of the act it is considering, it shall request the opinion of the committee responsible for budgetary issues'.
This is not trivial.
The Committee on Development, for its part, has increased the amount without requesting the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.
In turn, at the meeting of coordinators of the Committee on Budgets it was agreed to present an amendment on behalf of that committee to the legislative proposal in order to clarify this issue and re-establish the initial amendment presented in my report.
I am aware of the efforts made in the Committee competent for the main report to reach a consensus which would allow it to be approved at first reading and I congratulate them on their work.
I am also aware of the thankless role the Committee on Budgets has to play on this issue, since it makes it the final judge of sensitive programmes whose verdict is based strictly on the budgetary framework.
And I have already said that I am not going to get into assessing the fundamental aspects of the report.
I believe we must be coherent with what we approve on this new regulation and we must use it, because that is what differentiates us from a secondary school assembly.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of responsible and coherent parliamentary conduct, I would urge you to vote in favour of the amendments presented on behalf of the Committee on Budgets.
Mr President, we too, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, have been able to discuss this regulation.
Moreover, we have had plenty of time to do so, for the opinion was, I believe, expressed last September.
Indeed, we were aware of the importance of not leaving a gap between the adoption of a new regulation and the expiry of the previous one.
In the Committee on Women's Rights, we decided to emphasise, first and foremost, the need to accompany these policies with a literacy programme promoting education, training, knowledge and culture, including basic information services on communicable diseases, hygiene, health and human rights.
Great importance and value were accorded to this element, precisely because we believe that all the agreements we negotiate should be accompanied by the requirement of strict observance of human rights and, in particular, by a clear demand for policies of gender equality, as a precondition for any policy on the countries in question.
We are convinced that reproductive health problems are also closely linked to issues of poverty and underdevelopment. We therefore believe that it is only by pursuing this line that they can be resolved.
There is, of course, an urgent need, a need which we intend to address, first and foremost, with preventive and aid policies relating to pregnancy and birth but also responding to the need to combat diseases communicable from mother to child.
Mr President, we are discussing an important matter.
Every year 100 000 women die of complications during or following pregnancy, the overwhelming majority of them in developing countries.
Very much larger numbers are involved when you include people suffering from sexually-transmitted diseases such as HIV and AIDS.
This programme is about the whole range of problems.
The EU wants to do something about this urgent state of affairs.
The programme is geared, therefore, to the treatment and prevention of disease and infection, the reduction of maternal mortality and the prevention of abortion.
In the considerations you can read and I quote: 'schemes to promote sterilisation or abortion and improper methods for testing contraceptives in developing countries will not be eligible for support under this regulation'.
Commissioner Nielson guaranteed to the Commission once again in a letter that these are not included in the policy of the Commission.
Some fear misuse of the scheme but I cannot read the report as promoting abortion.
It may not be possible to give a watertight guarantee that it will never happen but it can be stated with certainty that the regulation itself is aimed at prevention - prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, prevention of unwanted pregnancies and prevention of abortion.
It is a sensitive issue, with opinions divided even in our group, and the text that has been produced is a compromise.
It is not exactly as our group would have drawn it up ourselves but we have managed to reach a reasonable compromise, based on the action programmes signed in Cairo by all the Member States of the European Union.
Examination of the problem clearly shows that it cannot be solved solely by emphasising rights, provisions and resources.
An important part of it has to do with mentality and taking responsibility, which is why I am pleased that the point of view of our group has been given a much better place in the text to be voted on tomorrow and by that I mean that there is more emphasis on the importance of education, information, counselling and personal responsibility and the special role of the family.
The text clearly states that there will be no support for the promotion of sterilisation and abortion.
We have negotiated to reach a solution quickly so as not to have to stop programmes unnecessarily.
It is unfortunate that the Commission was rather late with its proposal, which meant that we had to complete the whole process so quickly.
That did not make it easier.
As far as the budget is concerned, I am pleased with the compromises reached on the amendments and I hope that they can also be accepted tomorrow in order to give the budgetary authority the last word.
I assume that we can count on the full support of the Council and the Commission after this long process of negotiation.
I would like to thank all those who cooperated with us in such a constructive way.
Mr President, I would, first, like to congratulate Mrs SandbÃŠk on her report, which has achieved a broad consensus on a controversial issue.
Reproductive health is one of the fundamental aspects of development and principally, but not solely, affects the developing countries. In those countries, pregnancies and births are the main cause of death and illness amongst women, as has been said previously.
Therefore the Group of the European Socialist Party will undoubtedly support an active European Union policy on this issue which does not involve any moral stand, but rather a universal ethical imperative, human rights and development, and we therefore support the regulation being debated today.
This regulation comes at a very appropriate time for the European Union to demonstrate its determination, when other large donors, such as the United States, are pushing for a reconsideration of the commitments made in 1994 at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development.
That conference represented great progress, by correcting the political view of population which traditionally focussed on demographic objectives, and since then it has focussed on women's rights.
No less than 179 countries agreed to an action plan on this new basis.
However, at the 5th Conference on the population of Asia and the Pacific, held in Bangkok in December, there was a desire to remove any reference to rights in the field of reproduction and services relating to genetic health in order to conserve United States aid, which refuses to fund organisations which promote family planning, including the United Nations Population Fund.
In reality, in order to reassure those people who are fundamentally opposed to rights relating to genetic health, we must make it clear that family planning, information and access to reproductive health services prevent abortion and, if it is carried out, it is better that it happens under safe and hygienic conditions in order to prevent the 78 000 deaths per year caused by unsafe abortions.
This report and this regulation do not deal with abortion, but the European Union's contribution to social development, the population's access to information, to contraceptives, to health care during pregnancy and birth and responsible sexuality.
The European Union must be generous.
Therefore the Group of the European Socialist Party will do all it can within the framework of the financial perspectives and in accordance with budgetary authority to increase the funding for this regulation.
We will vote tomorrow in favour of the amendments relating to funding and against any other amendment that may affect the content of this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by sincerely thanking Mrs SandbÃŠk for her splendid effort, defending an important issue, that is women's freedom over their own bodies, being boss of your own belly as we say in the Netherlands and for emphasising the importance of prevention and education.
I would like to raise two points.
My first point is of a financial nature.
The main problem is that the financing is lagging behind the ICPD objectives, with, in addition to President Bush's decrease, the fact that 0.7% ODA has not been reached.
Taking all those things together, this means that many programmes cannot be implemented.
That is why, Commissioner, the financial section in this proposal is immensely important.
Now I would like to hear from you whether the Commissioner supports Amendment No 46, which deals with the level of the amount, but also the promise that the budgetary authority will consent.
Even more important: does the Council agree with this proposal?
We consider it very important that agreement is reached at first reading, and this amendment may put that in jeopardy.
A second point concerns the anti-abortion actions being conducted in relation to this issue.
There is a lobby group in America screaming blue murder because they say this European regulation promotes abortion.
They say it supports the Chinese policy of forced abortion as a means of stemming population growth.
It is all nonsense.
I want to publicly reject this.
Of course we are against the Chinese practice, just as we were against the forced sterilisation of men in India in the time of Mrs Gandhi.
The decision to have an abortion must be taken freely by women but not seen as an alternative to proper methods of contraception.
Once a woman has taken the difficult decision - and take it from me, it is a very difficult decision - the opportunity has to exist for her to do this in a responsible way, so that she does not have to resort to clandestine abortion, often with dire consequences.
The proposal as it now lies before us is also entirely in keeping with the principles adopted in 1994 in Cairo.
I eagerly await your response.
Mr President, no one can now continue to deny the link between poverty and the lack of any rights with regard to reproduction and sexuality.
Nor can anyone continue to plead ignorance regarding the ways in which, in certain countries, women's rights on these matters are abused.
This evening's debate enables us to demonstrate how urgent it is to make substantial funding available for setting up infrastructures covering the people who are most vulnerable, the provision of information, basic public health care and methods of contraception.
The undertakings given at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo should be maintained and honoured.
While more than ten million children die each year of curable diseases in developing countries, and while forty million people with HIV-AIDS also live in developing countries, the initiatives of the European Union are even more important when the present situation also features the attempt by the United States - fortunately unsuccessful at the moment - to include in the Plan for Action recently adopted in Bangkok the promotion of fidelity and chastity as the sole means of protecting people against sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) or AIDS.
This debate, and I would like to thank our rapporteur for her work on the subject, has to remain serious.
A society which sets up as a model the so-called ideal family cannot be anything other than a moralistic and sectarian society, of which women are always the first victims, with their rights being all too often dependent on the goodwill of men, whether father, husband or brother.
What sort of society do they think they are creating, when on the one hand there is the US District of Columbia, which still denounces extra-marital sex as a crime, and on the other there is Nigeria, where women are stoned for the same reason?
The emancipation of women and the full development of everyone requires rights and actions.
These include the inalienable right of women to have full control of their own bodies, without any constraints, and also to have the freedom to choose when they have a child.
As for the right to abortion, it still has to be defended, and for some women, including some in Europe, it still has to be acquired.
On this point, having been warned by Polish women's groups and feminist organisations, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and of the Council to a real and present threat.
The Polish Government is apparently asking now that the Treaty of Accession which it is getting ready to sign with the Union should include a reference to morality, culture and the promotion of life, which would in fact legitimise the current restrictive law on abortion in Poland.
Like the sixty percent of the population of that country who are opposed to that law, I would like to associate myself with the appeal launched against the inclusion of any such statement in the Treaty of Accession.
The Commission and the Member States would be giving a very bad signal to those people, in particular women, who believe in the values of liberty, dignity and the emancipation of our European societies.
Finally, I think the time has finally come to make more funding available for that proportion of development aid which is spent on health and education.
That is why I support the amount of funding proposed by Mrs SandbÃŠk in her report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is really amazing that we only hear voices of agreement in this Chamber this evening when behind the scenes so many obscure forces are trying to undermine the regulation and the financing of it.
This has to do with the fact that the right to autonomous control over your body, your fertility and reproduction has never been completely accepted.
In some circles people evidently still do not understand that women cannot be denied this right.
Nor men either, but there has always been more sympathy for that in the past.
When we consider the situation today, we see big differences in theory and in practice.
If we look at the European Union, we find something that has not been discussed today that there are many cases in which men's, and especially women's, desires with regard to having children cannot be fulfilled because this is so difficult to combine with a demanding professional life and a busy life in general.
Up to now we have not seen this as a collective problem.
But in any case we know that very many women would like more children than the average 1.4 per family that, for example, is reached in Belgium.
In the third world it tends to be the other way round.
Of course a woman's fertility is a blessing there too, but it is also a curse because the number of children born is often more than the number she wants and more than she can give a decent upbringing to.
That is, of course, because of the poverty in which the women and children live, as, of course, do the men too, but the number of women in the third world having to bring up children on their own is increasing more and more.
The situation is very grave.
At the time of the elections in Kenya, a social worker in one of the slums of Nairobi told me that the women find it so difficult to bring up their children that they are refusing to marry, because then they would have another person to look after and one who hits them.
Family life is so disrupted by poverty that they say: we would rather try on our own.
Of course the children have different fathers who do not care about the women or the children.
We have not explained the need for this programme at all, because if we had we would set all the budgetary concerns on one side and give it far more resources.
But I was talking about the social implications.
In the European Union and the other rich countries this leads to the phenomenon of an ageing population, in the poor countries it leads to overpopulation and worsening poverty that often takes on structural forms.
But your regulation is absolutely not targeting those large-scale societal phenomena.
It is actually elementary, the help, the access that women and men but especially women must have to escape the frightful consequences of unwanted pregnancy, the frightful consequences of rape and also the frightful consequences that occur in other communities.
I heard of a case of Roma women who are sterilised against their will at the moment they give birth.
They are made infertile without knowing it.
All this results from ignorance, of course, but it mainly due to grinding poverty.
That is why we will support the Commissioner and the rapporteur and those who submit amendments, in order to oppose those in the world who through their resistance attempt to smear these regulations, the resources and the people who are working hard to promote reproductive health.
We will make every effort to get these financial resources increased in the future and to see that they are used well.
In view of the spread of AIDS, it has to be said that all our resources are insufficient at the moment.
Fortunately official policy has come back to that meanwhile but in Kenya a few years ago people used not to tell pregnant women infected with the HIV virus that they had it, because they did not have the means to do anything about it.
Now fortunately we have the means to prevent this dreadful disease being passed from mother to child.
That 36 million people have to live with the HIV virus and that millions die of it every year must surely make an impression on those who only care about unborn lives and leave those who have been born to suffer and die.
Mr President, I should like to say a few brief words to present the amendments tabled by my group and to ask for the support of the House.
Four of them, from Mrs Montfort and Mr Mauro, deal with the specific and important question of the need to have special provisions in favour of extensive access to services that cater for and support future mothers in distress so as to help them bear their children.
In a regulation covering reproductive health in developing countries, it would be difficult to understand where our policies are heading if support for motherhood and special care for mothers in distress were not properly taken into account.
The other specific issue is a sensitive one which must be addressed clearly: is the European Union going to fund abortion worldwide or not?
This is a key aspect of the text on which we will vote.
I know that in substance our views are different and that laws differ from one Member State to another.
I do not want to open a debate that is not in the competence of the Union.
We cannot accept, however, that European Union funds would be applied in abortion-oriented policies.
The matter still requires clarification.
The official policy of the EU must be open and clear to everyone, not disguised or covered up.
Ambiguity is very wrong here.
Our Amendments 49 and 53 are in the direction of clarification.
I was pleased to hear Commissioner Nielson in committee, the day the report was adopted, assuring us that it is not correct to say that the EU is trying to develop an abortion policy and that those who imply that are ill-informed or wish to distort the reality.
I would be even happier if I could be reassured tonight.
The EU should not promote abortion.
There are details that raise concern.
For instance, on an official Commission website on the development sector, the term 'population' is defined as: 'an umbrella term now used to describe issues relating to demography and reproductive and sexual health and rights which can include issues such as abortion'.
This raises concerns.
Who adopted such a biased and twisted definition in the Commission and what are the implications?
It is not a secret that an NGO, Marie Stopes International, actively worked with Parliament to prepare this legislation.
I have here a message, sent a few days ago to several MEPs, that indicates that Marie Stopes was working at the secretariat of the European Parliament Working Group on Population.
Once out and in the open this, though a bit awkward, might not be such a big problem.
But in a report published by Euro NGOs, the representative of Marie Stopes states that her organisation is a major provider of abortion that is working with Vietnam and in other countries where abortion may be illegal.
This raises huge concerns.
The apparent active involvement of Marie Stopes in the preparation of this legislation reinforces the need for crystal clear clarification in our debate and in the text of the regulation.
That is what we are asking for in Amendments 49 and 53.
Although the Sandbaek Report aims to improve health care in the field of sexuality and family planning in developing countries, the regulation is likely to lead to a worse situation because support for abortion is not ruled out.
First, abortion is not a Community competence, being too far away from the aims of development cooperation ever to become a Community competence via that route.
The second reason why abortion may not be a Community policy concerns the supplementary nature of the policy.
It is not allowed to replace the policy of a Member State, which support for abortion would do, given that it is a criminal offence in one Member State and in several candidate countries.
The report also lacks clarity because it fails to define reproductive health.
Does the definition of the World Health Organisation apply?
This includes termination of pregnancy and therefore abortion!
Amendments Nos 49 and 53 deserve strong support because they clearly rule out abortion.
Moreover the organisations implementing the Community policy are not unequivocal in their efforts to reduce abortion.
They actually have so-called 'safe abortion' as one of their objectives.
However, the greatest potential for improving health is not in abortion but in a different area.
The report states that 13% of maternal mortality is caused by so-called 'unsafe abortion', as if there was such a thing a safe abortion.
This means that 87% has a different cause.
Better care during pregnancy and better health care in general would therefore reduce maternal mortality considerably.
The 13% caused by so-called 'unsafe abortion' can also be brought down, through more compassionate counselling of women with unwanted pregnancies.
Next the share of the budget taken by the report is unbalanced.
The annual budget of EUR 20 million represents a doubling of what was spent last year.
That will be at the expense of other budget headings.
Figures from the UN population fund show that people worldwide have better access to contraceptives than to clean water.
In short, we are setting the wrong priorities.
Finally, hopeful developments can be seen in several African countries in reducing sexually-transmitted diseases, due to education that emphasises fidelity in marriage and abstinence.
Is the Commission aware of these positive results?
I ask this question again because the Commission did not answer it during the debate on hunger, trade and the role of HIV/AIDS in that.
I refer to Uganda and Zambia.
In South Africa beneficial effects have also been acknowledged.
Fidelity in marriage and abstinence produce better results than the present secular European morality!
I eagerly await Commissioner Nielson's response.
Mr President, Mrs SandbÃŠk's report on the aid which the European Union can give in the area of health and rights concerning reproduction and sexuality in developing countries is based on a good intention.
We European women are lucky in that we are able to complete a pregnancy, have access to information and reconcile family life with professional life.
How can we accept the fact that so many women experience difficulties which we in Europe are spared?
However, we must not allow ourselves to make our aid conditional upon family planning.
It would be absurd to impose our model on these women.
It is vital to help these women to organise their society, their lives as women and mothers, in accordance with their traditions, their values and their culture.
Moreover, we cannot reduce issues involving women's rights merely to those issues involving reproduction and sexuality.
These women are pillars of their society.
They should therefore have more access to education, information and training, and they must be able to pass on to their children all that they have learned, so as to enable their countries to experience real development, in which access to health and information will occupy its rightful place.
Although pregnancy and giving birth are the main causes of death or injury among women living in these developing countries, and although sexually-transmitted diseases occur more frequently in those countries, it is certainly not by suppressing pregnancy that we shall succeed in overcoming these problems.
It is vital, in fact, to treat the causes, not just the consequences, by providing access to information, as I said just now, and by providing access to medicines, particularly generic medicines, as we said on Monday evening, so as to ensure that healthcare is not a luxury enjoyed by industrialised countries.
Mrs SandbÃŠk, you tell us that abortion will never be a form of contraception.
In order to convince us, your report should have been more precise.
The amendments which I tabled in committee and which provided an alternative to abortion, namely a reception centre for those women who choose to have their babies in spite of their difficult lives, should have been supported.
I should like to thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who took up the amendments again, because health and rights regarding reproduction and sexuality will always be linked to the freedom and responsibility of every person.
In this way I hope that these women will be able to exercise their responsibilities in complete freedom and without any pressure from our Western model.
Mr President, reproduction and sexual health and rights are a very important issue for developing countries where so much could be done to alleviate maternal deaths and the by-product ills of illegal abortions.
Health care is desperately needed yet, as this bundle of e-mails shows, it is also a highly sensitive subject and one that must be treated with respect by those at both ends of the spectrum.
I would therefore begin by thanking Mrs SandbÃŠk for the long negotiations she has had, firstly with the Council and Commission representatives, and then with the co-ordinators, the political parties in this House.
In any such sensitive issue, no one will be completely happy with the outcome.
That is why - even with the strong feelings I have on this subject - I genuinely believe that the compromise reached in the Committee on Development and Cooperation gives us a package that this House should accept.
I know there is a problem with the budget aspects of this report, but I hope that the amendments tabled are acceptable so that this report can have a clear majority in favour at first reading.
It would be a tragedy for sick women in developing countries if this report were delayed in any way because of budget technicalities.
