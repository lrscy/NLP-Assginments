competence in health matters lies with the Member States, as do decisions in the area of ethics;
the report does not deal at all with problems connected with the right to life and the right to a dignified life, nor does it address issues which we have repeatedly put to the Commission, such as a fund to help women in financial or psychological difficulties who would like to terminate a pregnancy.
The major issues raised by today's society are not covered either, such as personal relations in the broad sense, or matters of sex education;
a woman's dignity and her involvement in one of the most meaningful events in life, maternity, is treated only from the viewpoint of reproduction or the control of a sexual right.

Today in Parliament we have seen the truest expression of the EP's feeling towards the principle of subsidiarity.
I am referring not only to the vote on more than 400 amendments in various reports, which reveal a regulatory fury which is totally contrary to the concept of a simplified and simplifying European Union, the only kind of Union that will be able to move closer to the citizens. There is also the adoption of the Van Lancker report on rights in the field of sexual and reproductive health, which represents intolerable interference not only in the sphere of individual consciences but also in the powers of the Members States.
I have, therefore, voted against the report, not only because of its substance, which has been largely resolved in my country through a referendum, but also because of the intrusive method that this vote unfortunately used.
The report and the vote on it reduce to the absurd the declarations we have heard on the principle of subsidiarity or on respect for Member States' own competences.
For the Left, the Right does not exist. Everything depends merely on the ideological cause that is being pursued.
Ultimately, it is for this very reason that, by interfering in areas it is not asked to, the Union is becoming unpopular with many people, for a variety of reasons.
However, if we really want to discuss who influences whom in the long term, I think it will be the humanist Portuguese legislation, which stands in opposition to the liberalisation of abortion and which protects the right to life that will be adopted in other countries in the course of the century.
In the face of progress in genetics, in embryology, in fetology and in medicine, the twenty-first century will not be able to continue for much longer to deny what is increasingly well known, down to the last detail: in every abortion crisis, there is a human life waiting to emerge. This life is individual, unique and unrepeatable - with a dignity that must be recognised and fully protected.
On the day when human dignity prevails throughout Europe and we are all States in which the Rule of Law applies to everyone, no one will take pride in the numbers revealed in the statistics of these decades.
I have voted against this report.
The issue of abortion does not belong at European level, as public health matters fall within national competence.
We Christian Democrats believe it would be wrong to allow the EU to take over from the Swedish Parliament and other national parliaments the competence to legislate on the legal protection of an unborn child.
This issue is fundamental to the moral position of people and countries, their view of the inviolability of life and human value, and is so clearly linked to various national traditions that it must remain at national parliamentary level.
The report clearly states its position on the issue of abortion in item 12: 'The European Parliament recommends that, in order to safeguard women's reproductive health and rights, abortion should be made legal, safe and accessible to all.?
This item shows that the European Parliament is clearly not prepared to show any regard for the fact that a number of Member States, including Ireland, Portugal and Germany, consider that abortions directly contradict the principle of the State's primary task of protecting life, especially the lives of the defenceless.
I am greatly surprised that the Conference of Presidents could have authorised the Van Lanker report, which deals with topics for which the European Union has no competency.
Healthcare services, abortion and education are the sole responsibility of Member States and candidate countries, to be decided in line with their constitutional and legal requirements.
Regarding the Irish position, Constitutional article 40.3.3 "acknowledges the right to life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother".
Under this constitutional article, abortion is illegal in Ireland.
The "morning after pill", which, according to the manufacturer, is an abortifacient, is also illegal under Irish statutory law; the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861, Sections 58 & 59.
Article 42.1 of the Irish Constitution states: "The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical, and social education of their children" (42.1).

The right of women to make their own decisions over their bodies is a fundamental right which must not be undermined.
Therefore, I cannot support Amendments Nos 2 and 5 and naturally I cannot support the amendments which undermine this right.
I shall now suspend the sitting, which will resume at 3 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.32 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on combating hunger.
Mr President, Commissioner, former fellow MEPs, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, the World Food Summit - Five Years On was held in Rome from 10 - 13 June 2002.
The purpose of the meeting was to strengthen international support for reinforced efforts to combat hunger and poverty with a view to achieving the aim of halving the number of the world's starving by the year 2015.
This aim was confirmed in connection with the UN's Millennium Summit in September 2000 and now forms a basic element of the international development aims to which the global community has committed itself.
The EU places great emphasis on these aims from the Millennium Summit as a starting point for national and international strategies to combat poverty.
Since the World Food Summit in 1996, the number of starving people in the world has fallen, but unfortunately by nowhere near the extent necessary.
The average fall in the number of the starving today is just six million, despite the fact that there is a need for renewed and strengthened efforts if we are to achieve the annual average fall of 22 million in the number of starving people that is required for us to achieve our objective.
The summit resulted in a declaration entitled 'The International Alliance against Hunger', which was able to be passed as early as on the first day of the summit.
Under this heading, the international community commits itself to strengthening and coordinating its efforts to combat hunger.
During the preparations, the EU worked in particular to ensure that the declaration maintained the obligations established at the World Food Summit in 1996 and did not water down the agreements reached previously.
At the same time, the EU sought to ensure that the results of the most important international conferences and summits of recent times - including, especially, the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 and the International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey in March 2002 - were taken further and that links were made with the forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, where the issue of combating hunger and poverty will be dealt with as an integral part of the overall international development policy agenda.
In accordance with the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Barcelona, the EU emphasised two parallel responsibilities: firstly, the developing countries' primary responsibility for their own development and for the implementation of the action plan agreed at the World Food Summit in 1996 and, secondly, the international community's responsibility to assist the poorest countries in this process.
It was also crucial for the EU to secure recognition of the fact that efforts to combat poverty and hunger should take place within the frameworks of the developing countries' own priorities and strategies for combating poverty.
Measures to encourage production are essential, but are not alone the solution to the problems.
The level of global food production today is already sufficient to feed everyone.
In a number of developing countries, the particular problem is that of securing the distribution of, and access to, food.
Hunger is a problem relating to poverty.
Consequently, broadly-based poverty-oriented economic growth and an improved economic distribution policy that benefits the poorest population groups are crucial for a sustainable solution to the world's problems involving hunger.
Efforts to combat hunger must therefore also include objectives for, among other things, good governance, respect for human rights, land reforms and an increased focus on health, education and production-oriented research and communication.
In addition, consideration has to be given to the sustainable utilisation of natural resources and to the importance of ensuring conflict prevention.
Finally, the developing countries' access to research and technology is an essential element in the fight against hunger and poverty.
All these elements were emphasised by the European Union in the run-up to the negotiations.
In the international sphere, the EU considered it important to emphasise the necessity of increasing total aid to the level of the internationally approved objective, which is to spend 0.7% of GDP on development aid.
In this connection, it also wished for confirmation of the commitments made at Monterrey in March.
The poor countries' access to the markets in the West is naturally an essential element in efforts to promote those countries' development.
The EU has already shown the way with the launch of the 'Everything but Arms? initiative which, as we all know, means that the EU is giving the less developed countries duty- and quota-free access to the European market for all products with the exception of arms, or almost all products with the exception of arms.
In the negotiations, the EU also emphasised the importance of safe food for consumers in every country.
At the same time, we stressed the need to provide technical support that enables the developing countries to meet internationally recognised food standards.
For the EU, it was important that the discussion of trade and development did not prejudice the WTO negotiations and the follow-up of the Doha development agenda.
In its conclusions of 30 May 2002 concerning preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development the Council confirmed that the EU is firmly resolved that the Doha development agenda should be implemented, with a positive result and within the specified timescale.
The EU considers it important to achieve sustainable results on all fronts, which includes substantially greater opportunities for market access, including for the developing countries.
This is to be based on balanced rules and targeted, sustainably-funded technical assistance and programmes designed to build up capacity.
The Summit declaration largely reflects the EU's priorities and attitude, which I have just outlined.
The declaration focuses on consolidating the results of the 1996 World Food Summit and the recent international conferences, as well as on a strengthened and renewed political will to make active efforts to achieve the international development aims in respect of combating hunger and poverty.
The declaration launches a new initiative on the right to food.
Thus agreement was reached that an intergovernmental working party was to be set up to devise voluntary guidelines on the right to food, with the assistance of the FAO and involving all other relevant UN bodies with competence in the area of human rights.
The developing countries hope that such guidelines will give added weight both to the requirement to secure the poor countries' access to food and, thus, to the combating of hunger.
The EU is backing the initiative and will be actively involved in the work on making the right to food a practical tool.
In the circumstances, we can be satisfied with the overall outcome of the summit.
The outcome paves the way for the further discussions we will have in connection with the world summit in Johannesburg in August, where we will tackle the broad development agenda.
The balanced result is due not least to active input into the negotiations on the part of the EU.
I would like to take the opportunity to thank the outgoing presidency of the Council for its efforts.
The then President-in-Office, Prime Minister Aznar, represented the EU at the Summit.
In his contribution on behalf of the EU, he emphasised the Union's strong support for reinforced efforts to combat hunger and reported in detail on the EU's attitude to the topics of the summit.
Thanks to this input, the EU managed to create a constructive climate for negotiations and effective cooperation with the developing countries, with which we reached agreement on a wide number of matters, as is now reflected in the declaration.
At the same time, the EU was closely involved in the latest crucial negotiations concerning the most controversial issues.
Overall, the EU thus played a not insignificant role with regard to securing progress in the negotiations and a sensible result.
I would like to conclude by emphasising that the EU is already making substantial efforts to contribute to combating hunger and poverty, both via the EU's Community aid and through the EU Member States' own bilateral and multilateral aid programmes.
The EU and the Member States provide over 50% of total global development aid, a large part of which is spent on the development of rural areas and on the agricultural sector in the poorest countries.
The EU and the Member States have already committed themselves to a substantial increase in their development aid at the European Council meeting in Barcelona in March of this year.
A number of Member States, including my own country, Denmark, have already far exceeded the international objective of spending 0.7% of GDP on development aid.
All the countries have undertaken to continue contributing the target 0.7%, or more if they are already contributing at a higher level.
Those Member States that have yet to achieve this target have undertaken, as a minimum, to increase their development aid to the current EU average of 0.33% of GDP so that an overall EU average of 0.39% can be achieved by 2006.
It is on the basis both of these efforts and of binding partnerships with the developing countries that - under the Danish Presidency too, and especially in Johannesburg - the EU will go on working to step up the international fight against hunger and poverty.
For the Commission and the European Union the summit provided an opportunity to renew the dialogue with developing countries concerning the implementation of the Rome Plan of Action and to confirm our political will to fight against hunger and malnutrition.
The outcome of the summit was the adoption of a declaration containing many good elements that I hope will support and contribute to the promotion of coordinated action in order to achieve the 1996 summit target.
In this spirit, the summit decided to set up an intergovernmental working group with the participation of all stakeholders in order to elaborate, within a period of two years, a set of voluntary guidelines on the right to adequate food.
The objective of the guidelines is to support the efforts of the member states of FAO to achieve the progressive realisation of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security.
Time will tell what the impact of this decision will be.
We are certainly willing to be part of that effort and to make sure that it is going in the right direction.
The adoption of such a declaration supported by the whole FAO membership has certainly raised the profile of the fight against hunger on the international agenda.
The Commission welcomes this positive achievement and is happy to see that the declaration reflects the views of the EU on many issues.
However, in our opinion the declaration misses a key strategic line, one that has been consistently supported by the EU: the importance of elements other than agricultural production and productivity in addressing food insecurity.
It is essential that the issues I will mention here be addressed simultaneously and in the framework of national poverty reduction strategies.
These essential elements are: food availability, production, strategic reserves and trade in food; access to food - for example economic growth, employment, income, to make this access realistic; response to crisis situations, such as safety nets; and nutritional problems, which, in the long term, constitute the main element in all this.
In particular, the summit failed to clearly denounce and clarify the most crucial overriding causes of hunger, which are bad governance and man-made disasters.
Some estimates say that about 80% of the people suffering from hunger are victims of conflicts - man-made problems.
There are different versions of this.
Zimbabwe is one such case.
The problems in Zimbabwe are, to a great extent, man-made.
There is also a very real drought in southern Africa.
Of course we will provide humanitarian aid, but it should be kept in mind that a lot of this is man-made.
The FAO's public statements and appeals during the preparation process and the summit itself have been placing too much emphasis on additional ODA resources and on the role of agriculture and rural development.
The issue of ODA has already been reasonably successfully treated in the Monterrey Conference, and the EU remains committed both to the Monterrey Consensus and the clear commitments on increased ODA that were decided in Barcelona and presented in Monterrey, and which the Danish Minister has just gone through in greater detail.
In Rome, it would have been more appropriate to re-emphasise one of the main themes of recent summits and conferences: the crucial need for developing countries to overhaul their national development and sectoral policies in order to take due account of the needs and constraints of the rural poor and food insecurity.
This should lead to the formulation of national poverty-reduction strategies, including food security concerns, focusing on agriculture and rural development as appropriate.
It would then be the role of the donor community to support the implementation of national policies and strategies in a coordinated manner.
The European Parliament contributed to the international debate through the adoption on 16 May 2002 of the resolution on the summit.
The Commission agrees with the thrust of this resolution, which contains many important elements, such as support for the Monterrey Consensus and the emphasis on the need for increased policy coherence in developed countries.
In particular, the Commission welcomes Parliament's reminder that food aid must be reserved for emergencies and must be granted solely in the form of donations, with supplies being purchased whenever possible locally or within the region.
Nevertheless, the Commission does not endorse all the elements contained in that resolution, and in particular not the call made on the Commission itself and on EU Member States to contribute to the FAO Trust Fund established last year.
I do regret that the same calls for contributions to that fund are contained in some of the motions presented to this part-session of Parliament.
The opinion of the Commission remains the same as it was on the occasion of the last debate.
The EC policy is to directly support national and regional development processes and programmes in the context of its regional partnership agreements.
I am also firmly convinced that the multiplication of funding instruments, such as separate trust funds, etc., will not lead to the generation of additional financial flows but will only add to the diversion of funds.
The Commission also agrees with the longstanding policy of the European Union that the FAO should concentrate its resources where it has the best capabilities and added value, and that is in its normative work.
The orientation of the possible actions under the Trust Fund appears to be outside of that area.
I would, therefore, not want the Commission to encourage this.
Moreover, the FAO's food security approach is very much production-driven and does not promote the broader concept of food security.
We are, however, cooperating financially with the FAO on specific projects and programmes and will continue to do so, whenever we can see competence, added value and professional excellence that match the priorities and objectives of the Community's development policy.
The Commission therefore does not consider contributing to the FAO Special Programme for Food Security and to the Trust Fund as a priority in its development cooperation.
I would add here that Parliament's resolution of 16 May 2002 was adopted, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, following the debate on the statement made by the Commission without any prior consultation with the Commission.
So I have made quite specific reference to the new drafts in my speech here today.
Considering the key role of rural development and agriculture in fighting poverty, food insecurity and environmental degradation, the Commission will present, before the end of the year, a communication to the Council and Parliament on 'Fighting Rural Poverty - An EC policy and approach to rural development and sustainable natural resources management in developing countries?.
In closing I would like to recall that this World Food Summit is a step in a long process, which started in Doha and Monterrey and which will end in less than two months in Johannesburg.
It is my conviction that each of the major conferences that have taken place since Doha are not a response on their own to the global governance gap that we are facing.
Only the totality of these different conferences give a meaningful response to the challenges of sustainable development and it is this totality that defines what we like to call the global deal.
Mr President, today is my mother's 97th birthday and in her lifetime she has seen wars and famines, poverty and plagues, and she has also seen our world find the knowledge to prevent and defeat these global ills.
But she has not yet lived to see the leaders of our world unite, to use that knowledge to bring peace and health and the means to live for the 800 million of our fellow human beings who are hungry.
She was 69 when the first World Food Conference pledged everyone must be free from hunger - not everyone except 400 million - everyone.
She was 91 when the World Food Summit abandoned that pledge and set a target of halving the world's hungry to 400 million by 2015.
Now we know that this appallingly modest target will not even be met until 2030.
In the second half of my mother's life, 400 million people have died of hunger - three times the numbers killed in wars in her lifetime.
On this her birthday another 24,000 will die.
Surely we could have expected that the Rome Summit would have agreed an action plan to stop this slaughter.
Surely the leaders of the western world would have supported a programme to address the causes of hunger: poverty, conflict, disease, sanitation, bad governance, man-made disasters, and inadequate local food production and distribution, the very points that you, Commissioner, raised in your letter of 20 June to Mr Diouf on the failings of the summit.
You were right, but you were excessively polite.
You might have started by condemning the EU Member States, of whom only Italy the host, and Spain the presidency, sent heads of government.
The British Labour Government did not even send Mr Blair, did not send the passionate Clare Short.
No, they sent a junior official, a member of the DFID's - quote - "knowledge-sharing on special initiatives unit".
That is how much they cared.
Where was the passion?
The Italian press made it clear that the delegates were more interested in the dolce vita than in fighting world hunger.
The summit took two and a half years to put together.
It cost millions.
It was so well organised that the final document was agreed before the summit began.
And what a declaration!
It recalls, recognises, reaffirms, reiterates and then goes on to do it all again.
The new policy to help the hungry of the world is not "Everything but Arms", but anything but lift your arms to do anything.
One recommendation sums it up - and the Commissioner quoted it: "We invite the FAO to establish an intergovernmental working group to elaborate in a period of two years a set of voluntary guidelines for Member States to achieve the progressive realisation of the right to adequate food".
What a message of hope for the hungry.
What a cop-out.
Think nothing, see nothing, do nothing.
No new thoughts, no new vision, no new initiatives and no urgency.
In 2015, and no doubt in 2030 too, we will be back regretting lack of progress, extending deadlines, reducing targets, setting up working parties and failing to help the hungry nations to solve their needs.
Again we will issue emergency appeals for the consequences of our inaction today.
Now we move to Johannesburg and our message must be: "Wake up Europe, wake up the Western World".
For once overcome this political sleeping sickness that seems to paralyse us in the face of disasters that together we have the power to prevent.
Why do 800 million people still have an empty stomach?
Because leaders everywhere leave a great deal to be desired.
In principle, there is food for everyone.
There is no shortage of objectives and good intentions. The fewer results are yielded, the more summit meetings are organised which do nothing but conclude that policy must be intensified.
Who is to blame, the rich countries or the poor ones?
Both, Mr President. The developed states are hypocritical.
Despite fine declarations of intent, they carry on over-subsidising their own agriculture and protecting their own market.
The liberalisation of the world market is not obstructed by Europe alone, but also by America and other large agricultural states.
Western companies continue to exploit their patent monopolies on techniques and crops, development cooperation focuses too little on agriculture and technological expertise is not passed on.
Developing countries also leave a great deal to be desired.
Although most people live in rural areas, too little attention is given to food production.
Famines can really not only be ascribed to the climate or high toll barriers; endless wars, treating nature in an irresponsible manner, extreme population growth, over-urbanisation, inadequate infrastructure, but also corruption and mismanagement, in particular, stand in the way of sound agriculture.
Products are imported in order to feed cities bursting at the seams; there is too little regional trade and a great deal of monoculture.
Military expenditure for rulers is at the expense of affordable food for the people.
Solemn statements and reiterations of earlier conclusions are not expressions of real political will, but rather attempts at concealing its absence.
Hungry people have lost their appetite for them.
They are fed up to the back teeth of fine words.
(GUE/NGL). (PT) Mr President, with summit after world summit the hopes of better days for humanity are disappearing.
As in Monterrey, the World Food Summit has now also roundly failed to realise the auspicious objectives that its initial agenda led us to expect.
This FAO Summit has nevertheless confirmed, however, what we have repeatedly asserted: the objectives of the fight against hunger and malnutrition set in 1996 are far from being achieved and perhaps increasingly so.
This is the current state of affairs, despite the fact that the right to healthy and sufficient food is a fundamental right of all human beings.
This situation has arisen because there is no objective programme, because there are inadequate resources and because no appropriate guidelines or measures are in place, specifically with regard to access to land and water and ideally underpinned by a concept of sustainable development, of which the right to food sovereignty and support for family- and community-based agriculture must be essential elements. This situation has arisen because there is no appropriate policy for wealth distribution and because what is lacking, above all, is political will, clearly demonstrated by the low number of Heads of State and Government of developed countries present in Rome.
This is also happening, however, because at the same time there are too many negative factors preventing the current tragic situation from being turned around, such as the utmost priority that is given to trade issues and ultraliberal policies, subsidies given by rich countries to their goods exports in the primary sector, which have clearly influenced the recent decisions taken by the US in this field, or even the preposterous way in which biotechnologies are now being promoted.
We can now only hope, even though we do not have huge grounds for remaining optimistic, that in Johannesburg, a new, more promising phase will be launched.
Once again we reaffirm the need for the European Union to play a major role in defending the right of the poorest countries to protect their fish stocks and to develop their rural economies in the aim of guaranteeing their food sovereignty in the context of a much-desired sustainable development.
Unfortunately, the World Food Summit organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization has demonstrated that the fears I expressed to this very House a month and a half ago were entirely warranted.
The absence of thirteen European Heads of State from the Summit and the Italian Prime Minister's request that the end of the meeting be brought forward because of a football match graphically illustrate how little interest famine in the world generates in our countries.
One international conference takes place after another - Monterrey, Rome, Johannesburg; Europe would have the world believe that development is its chief concern.
At the same time, however, it abolishes the European Union Development Council, and the Directorate-General for Development may also be axed soon.
And we abstain from any binding involvement or commitment whatsoever on behalf of the poorest populations.
This was the other huge disappointment at the Summit, where we confined ourselves to subscribing to commitments that had previously been undertaken without any means of obtaining the tangible resources required for their fulfilment. This, incidentally, had happened in Monterrey too, but it was even worse in Rome.
Mr Berlusconi even had the effrontery to cast doubt on the duty of the industrialised countries to assist the developing countries in their desperate plight, invoking the precept that 'God helps those who help themselves'.
Likewise, the WTO helps the United States and the European Union to maintain and even increase their export subsidies on farm produce, subsidies which fly in the face of the sacrosanct principle of free trade proclaimed by those same two parties and which are used to a great extent to the detriment of the poor countries that are the main exporters of raw materials.
How can anyone attach any credit to a US Administration that has just increased its subsidies to cotton farmers or to the governments of the EU Member States that refused to commit themselves in Doha to a timetable for the reduction of their subsidies on agricultural exports?
We are disappointed by the resolution that the European Parliament has proposed, because it fails to condemn the gulf between the words of our governments and their deeds.
The Roman Emperors used to have a formula for appeasing their poorest citizens: bread and circuses.
I believe there were certainly circuses this time in Rome, but the bread was forgotten.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today, to address this House for the first time on my first day as a Member of the European Parliament.
The fact that the World Food Summit has been the subject of discussion and resolutions in this House twice in recent months sends out an important signal as to the priority we place on the issue of world hunger.
Every human being has the right to have access to healthy and nutritional food and a fundamental right to be protected from famine.
Hunger and malnutrition are not due to the fact that there is simply not enough food in the world.
There are currently an estimated 815 million people suffering from hunger.
This is totally unacceptable and we in the rich and well-fed west have a moral obligation to do something about it.
Mr President, if you now permit, I would like to use the occasion of my inaugural speech in this House to say a few words in my own native language, the Irish language.

(I am proud to have be granted the opportunity to serve the people of Connaught-Ulster, Ireland.
I would like to pay tribute to the record of my predecessor, Pat the Cope Gallagher, who is now serving in the Irish Government.
I undertake to assiduously serve the region I represent, in particular with regard to policies which touch on the daily lives of people in rural communities.
Having been a member of the Committee of the Regions for eight years, I am firmly convinced of the important role of regions and the need to empower them to take the decisions on so many aspects which affect their communities.
I am aware that there are certain elements of European policy at the present time which are the cause of concern to the people of the west of Ireland.
I am close to both the fishing and the farming communities and am conscious of the challenging proposals that are in the air in those policy areas.
I would like to state clearly for the record that I will be standing in solidarity with rural communities and I will defend policies that guarantee a decent living for those communities and a future for the generations to come.
As far as agriculture is concerned, the CAP is a policy which must be defended against the onslaught from countries or groups who conveniently forget the benefits they have got from the single market, and the need for socio-economic cohesion.
The CAP has served the people of Europe well, a fact conveniently forgotten by those who would reduce the construction of Europe to an accounting exercise.
I am aware that there will be a debate later on fisheries and hope to say something at that point.
But I would make one comment: the current Commission proposals are totally unacceptable to communities which are heavily dependent on fisheries.
In conclusion, I would like to briefly state as an Irish Member that between now and the coming autumn I will have one principal political aim, that is to convince the people of Connaught-Ulster of the importance of the Nice Treaty in the forthcoming referendum, in the hope that it may be ratified before the end of the year.)
Mr President, there are eight hundred million undernourished people in the world today.
This is largely the same number as when the first food summit was held in 1996, so let us tell it how it is: the efforts to combat hunger in the world have failed.
In this context it is disgraceful to see - as commented on by many Members - the apathy exhibited by the Western Heads of State in their absence from the latest Food Summit in Rome last month.
The problems of hunger in the world are largely due to hypocritical policy implemented by the EU and others.
The policy, which is officially supposed to be there for the poorest people in the world, is to far too great an extent controlled by the EU's own narrow foreign and trade policy interests.
Officially, the EU and the other Western organisations advocate free trade and liberalisation as the solution to all the world's problems.
However, in reality the liberalisation applies only to the developing countries, where the requirement of liberalisation completely destroys their ability to build up independent sustainable production.
Earlier this year Oxfam issued a report that concluded that the EU is the world's most protectionist market towards the developing countries.
It is time that we put our own house in order and grasped the nettle.
There is a great deal of work ahead of us if our wish to eradicate hunger is to succeed.
As a minimum, to start with we could abolish the EU's protectionist agricultural subsidy schemes, suspend our fisheries agreements with third countries - which are designed to deprive the very poorest in the world of their living, establish a development policy that is genuinely aimed at combating poverty and not governed by the fight against immigration and terrorism as well as concerns about our own jobs and, last but not least, support the poor countries' right to their own production and access to water, soil and biological diversity.
Mr President, at the recent World Food Summit held in Rome, 182 nations renewed their commitment to putting an end to the tragedy of hunger in the world, in which there are still 800 million people who are malnourished.
Sadly, five years on from the first summit in 1996, we have to acknowledge that we have clearly failed in our aim of halving this figure by 2015.
It is imperative that this discrepancy between promises and reality is overcome.
The need to combat this tragedy is also reinforced by the thought that hunger is both a cause and an effect of poverty.
A starving man is not a free man: he is a desperate man and can easily be persuaded to take part in desperate actions such as conflicts, international crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal immigration and terrorism.
There is no doubt that the western world needs to pay much greater attention to this, and the commitment by the industrialised countries to donate 0.7% of their gross domestic product is more relevant now than ever.
It was John F. Kennedy who said that no one can be considered rich if their neighbours are poor.
That is why we need practical action and projects. We have to act immediately to prevent a further 2 billion people joining the 4 billion who are currently cut off from wealth, as the demographic studies forecast.
Good governance in these developing countries is, however, an essential prerequisite if the cooperation which is vital for the achievement of the objectives we have set is to be strengthened.
Access to information, as the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, has proposed, rather than failure to deliver on undertakings, as Mr Rod has observed, and the new model of digital state organisation to combat corruption and increase efficiency would certainly make any use of development aid more transparent.
Another matter that urgently needs addressing through a conference of FAO countries is that of the proper operation of the agency itself.
The way it works and is managed needs to be reformed and rationalised in order to improve its transparency and efficiency and to achieve more suitable actions and results.
At Johannesburg, I will have the opportunity, together with the delegation from the European Parliament, to see whether the European Union will really be able to give - and make others give - tangible political commitments with precise deadlines, the achievement of which will have to be based on effective partnership.
Mr President, the Johannesburg meeting - as has been said - is the third great summit aimed at creating an international strategy to combat poverty.
The first was Monterrey, on development funding, with mediocre results, and the second was Rome, on food, which yielded no real results.
The final opportunity is this Johannesburg meeting, on sustainable development, which, as well as achieving commitments on this issue, must translate into concrete measures what was done at the previous ones and, as the Commissioner has said, from a global point of view.
There are therefore great hopes in this summit and above all the European Union has an enormous responsibility.
To the failure of Rome we must add the revision of the objectives agreed in 1996, on halving world hunger by 2015.
It has already been acknowledged that this objective is not going to be achieved since there is not the sufficient political will to make the necessary efforts.
I hope that we will achieve some improvements during this Danish Presidency, given the sensitivity it has.
We cannot afford more failures, above all the developing world, and this is a question of survival.
We cannot hold summit after summit without results.
We must therefore make very practical and realistic proposals which we want to communicate to the Commission and the Council: a code of conduct to guarantee food, based on the belief that food is a fundamental human right, and an emergency plan to deal with the famines and food shortages currently affecting 14 million people in Africa.
These are practical measures in relation to which the Council and the Commission must achieve a worldwide commitment.
I agree with the rest of the measures highlighted in the resolution, in particular the considerations of the Community budget and the EDF, greater coordination between bilateral and multilateral donors, the importance of microcredits and of the creation of an alliance against hunger and poverty.
The fact that the Union and its Member States are the main donors of aid allows the European Union's representatives to take the lead in making this summit a success, a success which is not merely something which this Parliament wants to see, but which is a commitment of the European Heads of State and Government in accordance with the conclusions of the Seville European Council.
We fervently hope that the Union's representatives will return from Johannesburg with concrete commitments and action plans and we will ask them to give us an account of the summit.
I am very happy to hear that the Commissioner is going to present us with a very specific communication on an action plan to combat poverty.
We anxiously await that communication.
Mr President, projections based on the 'current rate' of decline in the number of people suffering from malnutrition suggest that it will take a century to overcome hunger in the world.
Is this hard fact not enough to justify a radical rethink of the policies that are currently being pursued?
The subsidies that the governments of industrialised countries pay to their own farmers are forty-eight times higher than the amount paid to support agriculture in poor countries.
Direct competition between agricultural products from countries with very unequal productive systems, as well as the practices of exporting countries in the developed world, coupled with the risk of dependence facing the countries of the South if they specialise in the export of one or two primary products - these are the long-term threats to the future food security of the people who inhabit three quarters of our planet.
The effects of these practices, which are totally consistent with the enshrined provisions of the WTO Agreements, are verifiable and have been verified.
These practices kill. The Johannesburg summit could be an opportunity to make other choices, to focus on other avenues as yet unexplored, such as guaranteeing the right of developing countries to protect their rural economies with a view to defending their food security against multinational corporations and to supporting local food-processing businesses.
Why not make hard and fast provisions for the creation of a specific fund designed to guarantee the effective achievement of all these objectives?
The Director-General of the FAO has estimated that an additional amount of 24 billion dollars would be needed to achieve the aforementioned aims.
The disaffection of the Heads of State at the FAO summit, however, provided confirmation that the developed countries' would not be committing any more resources, which cannot fail to give cause for concern.
The only effective remedy would be a response to the needs of the poor countries; at the Forum of the Peoples that has just been held in Sibi, Mali, for example, these countries called for the immediate and unconditional cancellation of Africa's foreign debt and for fair payment for agricultural products and other raw materials.
This is the price that has to be paid to rid the world of hunger.
The FAO called on the rich countries before the World Food Summit to set aside an additional USD 24 billion in order to halve the number of malnourished people by 2015.
The World Food Summit in Rome did not give evidence of a similar pro-active approach.
There is precious little evidence of political will or high priority granted to the fight against hunger, either in the participation of the Summit or in the release of resources.
The most important industrial nations, the Group of 8, have decided not to set aside any extra funding either.
Indeed, money is not the key factor in the fight against hunger.
Basic elements are market protection, bad governance and war.
However, large-scale investments are needed in order effectively to combat hunger.
The new G8 plan merits critical consideration, given the failures of previous plans to help Africa.
There is no doubt that the setting of conditions on the aid offers an incentive for the much-needed improvement of governance in the recipient countries.
However, the previous plan was unsuccessful because both rich and poor countries failed to honour the pledges.
It leads one to believe that it is mainly the rich countries that were unable to live up to agreements. The opening-up of markets, more investment and more development aid are cases in point.
Alongside this action plan for Africa, there is apparently a new plan by the FAO.
Could the Commissioner give Parliament more details about this plan and also give his opinion on it?
Mr President, Minister, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, a World Food Summit has just ended and a World Summit on Sustainable Development is about to begin.
Summits should do more than simply pay lip service to the global fight against poverty and hunger.
Yet the horrific statistics - 800 million people suffering from malnutrition, including 300 million children - have not changed at all.
Every day, 24 000 people still die of hunger.
Global population growth of 2.5 billion people by 2020 means that almost 90% of this increase will take place in the developing countries.
The gap between prosperity and poverty is likely to widen, not narrow, as a result.
According to the FAO, we are still a long way off achieving our target, which we adopted six years ago, of halving the world's hungry by 2015.
Combating hunger and poverty is also an integral part of combating terrorism, international crime and illegal migration.
This fight requires a holistic approach.
The national strategies must focus on rural development and food security.
Access to education and skills must be promoted, and water, renewable energies, health and agriculture must be put on the list of priorities for a new partnership to combat hunger in the world.
We also need clear objectives and timescales, for otherwise, all these programmes will consist of nothing but empty promises.
Of course, the opening of the markets is important as well.
However, the "Everything but Arms" policy must not be over-estimated.
The USA, too, must adapt its policies here within the WTO framework.
The division of labour mooted by some people - whereby the developed world supplies industry and high-tech and the rest of the world, i.e. the less developed countries, is responsible for global food production - has nothing to commend it, in my view.
Furthermore, not all the problems are due to poor distribution and re-distribution.
The principle of good governance must be adopted and adhered to.
The confiscation of the property of white farmers in Zimbabwe is at odds with good governance and will simply propel Southern Africa deeper into hunger.
Here, too, the international and European community should clearly signal their indignation.
Mr President, I do not think it will have escaped the notice of the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council that a good deal of hypocrisy seems to hang over this debate.
A few days ago the Director-General of the FAO, Jacques Diouf, noted that, six years after the 1996 summit, 'for the starving of the earth the bell still tolls.'
All the speakers have noted that 800 million people - including 300 million children - suffer from hunger and that every day 24 thousand people die of starvation.
Mr Diouf has declared: 'Promises have not been kept.'
Worse still, our actions contradict what we say.
What actions were expected of us?
Here are a couple of examples: investing in the Millennium goals, that is agriculture, health and education; and raising the level of aid from the G8 countries for this great battle to 0.7% of their gross domestic product.
We have a long way to go when we think that the richest country, the United States, pays out only 0.1% or 34 dollars per head
The way the rich countries ignored this meeting added insult to injury.
The Presidents of the United States and of Russia were absent; the Heads of Government of Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Canada were absent.
Just Mr Prodi, representing the European Union, was present.
All this casts a dangerous and evil shadow over the meeting of 26 August, the Johannesburg Summit.
I believe we should remind ourselves that we do not yet have much new evidence on our side to be able to face up to and resolve this emergency.
Mr President, Minister, it is quite true that the failure of the UN and the failure of the plan to tackle hunger is due to a lack of sensitivity even on the part of many governments.
Certainly not, however, on the part of the Italian Government - and I regret that a Member from the left did not miss the chance to make some shabby political speculation even about such a serious and sensitive matter.
I must remind him that Mr Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, managed to tread new ground at Genoa during the G8 by getting approval for an initial sum of EUR 750 million out of a new package worth 3 000 billion lire, or EUR 1 500 million.
This is a concrete commitment and so these accusations are decidedly off-target.
It is true that there are always new famines appearing round the world, and not only where there is the excuse of war to trigger them off.
This scenario was debated thoroughly at the FAO meeting, particularly on the last morning, Thursday 13 June, when it was decided to give special attention to the problem of the world's mountainous regions, where hunger and poverty are always more acute and show themselves in the most dreadful ways.
At the meeting - which I had the opportunity to attend as rapporteur, since I tabled a resolution on mountainous regions in this Parliament in 1998 - it was also pointed out that one does not need to look in war zones or far-off regions to find signs of a worrying increase in abandonment, decay and even the possible scourge of famine in mountainous areas, even in civilised Europe.
Now, in the UN International Year of Mountains, this message is being passed from the FAO Assembly directly to this Parliament.
We need to grant mountainous regions prominence and attention and restore their specific identity, but most of all we must not be ashamed to consider them already a potentially poor area.
In short, this scourge of poverty can also be prevented, as well as combated.
Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for a succession of committed contributions that I myself would happily have submitted were I still a Member of this Parliament.
One can probably summarise the contributions as follows: the EU is certainly moving in the right direction, but too little has been achieved.
That is how I understand most of the contributions, and it is certainly true to say that summits in themselves do not eradicate hunger.
Neither does this debate, but like this debate the summits help to put the problems into focus - both the problems that exist in the developing countries and also those that exist in the industrialised countries and which are the cause of too little being done.
With regard to the Johannesburg summit, the Danish Presidency will place great importance on achieving a global deal with rights and obligations, with access to our markets, but also with certain obligations on those who are given this access.
We do not know how far we can get, but it is important that we get a discussion concerning the overall complex of problems, because it is really a global deal that we need.
I would like to emphasise that for all that, we have done something: we provide over 50% of total development aid in the world.
We have brought about the 'Everything but Arms? initiative and we are working to ensure that the agenda for development that was passed in Doha is implemented.
In spite of everything, an agenda has been drawn up and words have been said, and it is now a matter of holding all the parties involved to these.
So this debate on these vast, almost insurmountable problems concerns not losing the courage or the will to do more, despite everything. If things look too hopeless, people will not be motivated to act further.
On the one hand, we need to be aware of the progress made; on the other, we must promise each other that we will do more.
On behalf of the Council and the Presidency I am happy to give an undertaking that we will make substantial efforts in Johannesburg.
It looks difficult and I cannot promise anything, but I can promise that efforts will be made.
I believe that the Commissioner will say something similar, and I would like to thank him for the great commitment that he has made for many years to precisely the matter that we are discussing here today.
Mr President, I appreciate the remarks from the Presidency, and Members' contributions.
Some have focused on the issue itself and others on the relationship between the dramatic increase in population and the number of people still lacking food.
These are two complementary problems, which remind me of the dramatic vote in this House earlier today on sexual and reproductive health and rights.
These matters have a lot to do with each other and certainly it is almost impossible to fight hunger meaningfully without also addressing the issue of population policy.
Another important aspect which I have been focusing on more and more is the direct relationship between conflicts and hunger.
Tanzania for as long as people can remember, has been host to more than half a million refugees in camps.
They all have to be fed.
They all add to the number of people we have to do something about to help them survive.
Things could be different.
The hungry people who are the casualties of conflict are a man-made disaster.
Optimists would look at this as something we could change.
But it is not only a matter of increasing agricultural production, it is also a matter of creating peace and a minimum of decency and governance.
Several speakers have commented on the absence of leaders of our Member States, but President Prodi and I were there for the Commission and we did our part.
Many others have focused on the relations between our agricultural policy in Europe and trade issues: Mr van den Berg, Mr van den Bos, Mrs SandbÃŠk and others.
I would like to point out that we need to avoid the overdoses of Euro-masochism which we often hear when we talk about these matters. To Mrs SandbÃŠk, I would like to say that even if it is Oxfam that comes up with these figures, characterising the EU as being the most protectionist bloc on this issue, the reality is still that we, in Europe, import more foodstuffs and more agricultural products from the third world than the combined imports of the United States, Japan, Canada and the other OECD countries outside the EU.
This is still the reality.
So there is a limit to how masochistic we should be.
It is true that subsidies are a big problem.
This is very clear today and it will be a main topic of the discussions in Johannesburg.
The figures are overwhelming.
The OECD countries spend USD 350 billion a year on subsidies compared to USD 50 billion a year for development cooperation purposes.
Fortunately, our internal analysis in Europe corresponds to and goes in the same direction as the global pressure in regard to what we ought to do.
In both cases the heading is 'reform and reduction of subsidies'.
We hope to move forward on this.
Mr Van den Bos said there is too much monoculture and too little food security.
I agree.
One case in point is Ethiopia, which we have discussed again and again over the years.
It is the biggest case of old-fashioned traditional food aid - shipping in wheat which is good for the farmers of Wisconsin and elsewhere but not good for the survivability and sustainability of people in Ethiopia.
We are now agreeing a new approach with the Government of Ethiopia and even with the United States.
This year we held seminars with the government, at which the Prime Minister was also present, to define a new food security approach, very different from the old food aid approach.
This is exactly what I told Parliament - that we would like to see this change.
It is coming.
It is an approach I saw too little of in Mr Diouf's presentation of the agenda of the FAO.
It is one cause of the frictions in our discussions with the FAO.
Mr Ã Neachtain, I send my warm regards to your close friends and constituents.
Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, characterising Johannesburg as the last chance after Doha and Monterrey is a way of putting it with which I do not want to be identified.
It makes it look as if Doha and Monterrey were both failures. This is not the case.
In the European Union we can be pleased that due to our insistence and energetic input we have a Doha development agenda.
Without the EU's insistence on this, it would not be so.
Without the Barcelona decision leading up to Monterrey, we would not have come up with a real input.
Without a real European input we would not have had the kind of American decision we saw.
We are not moving forward empty-handed.
Rome was an occasion to re-establish the importance of the food issue in general.
For that reason it was meaningful, even in its timing.
But the next step is Johannesburg.
I agree with Mr Haarder on the difficulties in the run-up to Johannesburg.
We will have to work very hard during the weeks and months until then.
Mr Belder asked about the new anti-hunger programme introduced by the FAO Secretary-General, Mr Diouf.
The price tag of this programme, which was introduced only a few days before the summit, is USD 24 billion in additional public funds.
The price tag is high.
This was purely a secretariat initiative, not undertaken at the request of the members and not previously discussed with them.
A lot of work needs to be done in order to support and justify this initiative.
It should also be recalled that another recently adopted joint FAO/NEPAD comprehensive agricultural programme for Africa calls for the investment of an additional USD 240 billion between now and 2015.
So we are definitely not running short of magnificent initiatives involving billions and billions of new additional money coming from the secretariat of the FAO.
Most of this money, however, is coming from the secretariat without any sort of real discussion and coordination with the donors or the membership in general.
This is one of the reasons why we have not found it very easy to relate constructively to everything we have been presented with in this regard.
All this should not be misunderstood as reflecting a negative attitude.
We are working with the FAO; we are carrying out a number of good projects in Africa; we are funding it through our regional envelope when our partners in Africa ask us to act hand-in-hand with the FAO in areas where it has real expertise.
Some things do work.
I have tried to clarify this issue.
I warn against the temptation of thinking that no progress is being made at all.
What we need is a combined effort made up of population policy, broad-based sustainable development, fighting poverty, and stopping the wars and conflicts that are still the main cause of the starvation of millions of people.
It is a man-made and political issue.
That has to be kept in mind.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the consequences for transatlantic relations of the law on the protection of US personnel.
Mr President, I wish to begin by taking the opportunity to congratulate the international community and all of us on the fact that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court came into force last Monday.
This event must be regarded as one of the most epoch-making in international legal development since the Second World War.
Sixty-nine countries have ratified the statute of the court, and we can see that it now already has significant support in the international community.
A statute of this kind is something which the European Parliament has called for again and again, as I myself did a couple of years ago in a report on human rights, adopted by a very large majority.
Parliamentarians have spoken and written about it.
Now it is here, and that is a fact I think we should celebrate here in Parliament.
The many international and internal conflicts which the world witnessed in the twentieth Century underline the need for this court to be set up quickly.
The International Criminal Court can help make the world safer, more just and more peaceful.
By its mere existence, it could deter people from committing the serious crimes - war crimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity - which we have unfortunately also witnessed in our own lifetimes and until quite recently.
It is important that such crimes should not go unpunished and that it should be possible to hold everyone responsible for their actions.
That is why this International Criminal Court is a central plank in the strengthening of the international legal community.
We must appeal to all states to sign up to the Rome Statute.
Universal endorsement is necessary if the court is seriously to be able to operate effectively.
With a view to obtaining such universal support, we adopted a common position last year, which has recently been updated.
On the basis of this common position, the European Union has employed political dialogue and initiatives in an attempt to obtain the broadest possible endorsement of the court from countries all around the world.
The International Criminal Court is a recurrent theme in our contact with the United States, and it is precisely our talks with the United States that are the subject of our debate today.
The EU and the United States share the same basic values of freedom, democracy, human rights and the principles of a state based on the Rule of Law.
That is why we have always seen it as quite natural and necessary for the United States to be among those who have signed up to the Statute of the International Criminal Court.
We have no doubt that the United States could make a particularly positive contribution to the court.
During the diplomatic conference in Rome in 1998, we were perfectly clear about the United States' reservations concerning certain provisions of the statute.
Moreover, we did our best to find ways of dispelling or accommodating these reservations, but unfortunately to no avail.
To our regret, we have to note that, on 6 May of this year, the United States informed the UN Secretary-General that it did not intend to endorse the statute, which had in actual fact been signed under the previous US administration.
We believe that the United States has taken a wrong decision, and the European Union deeply regrets the fact.
Recently, or more specifically on 17 June, the General Affairs Council adopted conclusions expressing our concern regarding the present American bill which goes under the title of the American Service Members Protection Act, or ASPA as it is called.
The latest version proposes limitations upon the United States's participation in UN peacekeeping operations, prohibits the transfer of information to the International Criminal Court and bans American military aid to most of the participants in the court.
As we said in our conclusions from the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, we believe that the ASPA could seriously undermine the work of the International Criminal Court.
We also emphasised our misgivings about the provision authorising the American President to use every available means to free people detained at the request of the court, including people detained in the EU Member States.
This provision has especially given rise to concern in the Netherlands, which is to be the seat of the court and which has made no bones about dubbing the ASPA 'The Hague Invasion Act'.
If the ASPA is adopted, it will be a very unfortunate development for the international community.
We have expressed our concern to the American administration at all levels.
Our top representatives in Washington have concerned themselves with the problem over a long period.
It is a grave matter, a substantial hiccup and a serious problem in relations between Europe and the United States.
I should like, however, to say that, even though it is a major problem and a difficult situation, we shall not, in my view, achieve anything by describing the American bill as a threat to transatlantic relations.
It would be unreasonable to raise it to that level, and I should like to make that clear.
Firstly, the International Criminal Court is a matter of global concern and not a bilateral problem between the United States and the EU.
It is crucial that we not be confrontational, for that would get us nowhere.
There are also, unfortunately, other major partners of the EU, such as China and India, which oppose the court.
Turkey, as an associated country, has still not signed the statute or otherwise endorsed our common position or any of the EU's declarations in support of the court.
In Japan and Russia, there is political will to endorse the statute, but this has still not been embodied in the form of decisions.
Nonetheless, the fact that all these countries are still not participants in the court has neither damaged, nor caused a cooling-off in, bilateral relations.
We have been very careful to avoid confrontation on this issue but, at the same time, sought to keep the court high on the agendas of our regular meetings for exchanging views.
Through persistent lobbying in support of the statute, we have already managed to convince a number of countries, and we hope that, by this means, we can convince still more.
I also want to state that the International Criminal Court is not the only area on which the United States and the EU disagree.
Friends are entitled to disagree, but I think we are wise always to insist that what unites the EU and the United States is, in spite of everything, stronger than what divides us.
We can all point to examples: steel (on the subject of which we shall soon hopefully obtain a solution), bananas (an area in which a solution was found and about which there is a lot to say) and the Kyoto Protocol (in connection with which we are continuing our high-level dialogue).
Sometimes we find a solution, and sometimes we continue to disagree.
In the human rights area, we have different attitudes to the death penalty. Through our long-term efforts in combating the death penalty, we have, however, succeeded in influencing American opinion.
As an example, I would mention the recent American Supreme Court judgment on the Atkins case, ruling out the death penalty for mentally retarded people.
The EU had a part to play in this matter through what is termed an 'amicus curiae brief' of which the US Supreme Court took account in its reflections on the issue.
That is a policy we wish to continue.
The American administration has assured us that an American intervention in the territory of an EU country would be - and I quote - 'inconceivable'.
That has been said by both Secretary of State Colin Powell and Assistant Secretary of State Marc Grossman.
Many American soldiers gave their lives for freedom and democracy in Europe.
I cannot imagine their grandchildren taking it into their heads to invade one of our Member States.
The ASPA proposal is now on the table, however, and section 3008 concerning the use of force will constitute a dangerous precedent in international law.
I can assure you that we shall monitor this matter very carefully.
The International Criminal Court will soon be able to prove its worth as an independent and effective international court.
We in the EU will spare no effort to ensure its success.
I am sure that those who are at present opponents of the International Criminal Court will be able to see for themselves that the Rome Statute both ensures the highest standards of law and order and guards against the use of the court for political purposes.
We probably have to face the fact that universal endorsement of the court is still somewhere in the future. I have confidence, however, that our arguments will eventually win the day, as they have in the many other areas I mentioned earlier.
By using its veto in the UN Security Council last Monday, the United States took a very far-reaching and unfortunate step in its opposition to the court. I understand, however, that negotiations to find a compromise solution in the UN Security Council will be resumed later today.
It is essential that a solution be found which does not undermine the EU's common position and the statute of the court and which, at the same time, leaves the United States still committed to its peacekeeping operations.
As holders of the Presidency, we shall do everything to ensure that this is what happens.
Mr President, two days ago the International Criminal Court entered into force.
This is very much welcomed.
Bringing to justice those individuals who commit the most serious crimes against humanity, including genocide, widespread murder of civilians, torture and mass rape, is one of the major objectives of the EU's human rights policy.
The creation of an International Criminal Court is central to this fight.
By investigating and bringing to justice such individuals, the Court provides an essential means of promoting respect for international humanitarian law and human rights.
The European Union stands firm in its commitment to the ICC.
Now that the Rome Statute has entered into force, the ICC is finally a reality.
However, the hardest work still lies ahead of us.
We need to give the ICC real teeth so that it stands as a genuine disincentive to those who imagine they can get away with committing the most heinous crimes against humanity.
In this context, the withdrawal by the United States of its signature from the Rome Statute came as a blow to the international community as it strives to prevent a repeat of the atrocities which have plagued recent conflicts.
The fact that the world's greatest military power is not with us is a blow - there is no denying this.
This is not the first time in recent history that Europe has taken the lead and set the international agenda.
Many wrote off the Kyoto Protocol after the withdrawal of the United States, but the EU pressed on and ratified Kyoto, setting an example which was followed by the global community to deliver a genuine prospect for tackling the problem of climate change.
We intend to do the same to make the ICC a working institution for global justice.
As an independent nation, the United States has a sovereign right not to participate in the ICC if that is its wish.
In telling the world on 6 May that it did not intend to ratify the Rome Statute, the United States also gave assurances that it would not actively seek to undermine the work of the International Criminal Court, nor dissuade others from ratifying the Rome Statute.
Therefore the decision by the US Senate on 6 June to adopt its own version of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA), previously adopted by the US House of Representatives, came as a great surprise and disappointment to many of America's allies and partners.
We are hopeful that modifications can still be made to the text in the House and Senate Conference that would help dilute the impact of this legislation.
The ASPA's provisions, as currently drafted, are a grave cause for concern to supporters of the ICC for several reasons.
By attempting to prohibit military assistance to nations which ratify the ICC, the ASPA could dissuade countries from participating in it.
By seeking to remove US personnel operating under UN mandate from the jurisdiction of the ICC, the ASPA might restrict US participation in peace-keeping operations.
We are already seeing the dramatic effect that this could have on the work of the UN to maintain peace and stability in hot spots across the globe.
The US move to oppose the renewal of the UN's mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina threatens to undo years of work by the international community to rebuild that fractured community.
The Commission's first analysis identifies several potentially negative effects on the political environment and Rule of Law in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Not least of these is the counter-terrorism work being carried out by the international police task force within Bosnian territory.
The EU is working around the clock with the UN and other partners, including the United States, to find a solution to this crisis.
But on one thing we stand firm.
We will not allow the ICC to be handicapped from birth by excluding the work of the United Nations from its jurisdiction.
There must be equality under the law regardless of nationality.
There are further grounds for concern at the possible impact of the ASPA.
By prohibiting cooperation between its own judicial and law enforcement authorities and the ICC, the ASPA could set back the cause of the international fight against terror.
Last, but not least, there is a particularly disturbing provision authorising the President to use any means necessary to bring about the release of US personnel being detained at the request of the ICC, including on the territory of EU Member States.
In the light of these considerations, the European Union could not and did not remain silent.
The EU reaction was discussed at the General Affairs Council of 17 June, where we adopted conclusions expressing our concerns at the ASPA's provisions.
We also agreed upon a strategy for presenting our concerns to the United States in a coordinated fashion.
On 19 June the Spanish ambassador to the United States, together with the Commission's head of delegation in Washington, presented an agreed statement on behalf of the EU Member States to the US Department of State.
At the same time, EU ambassadors wrote to senior figures in the US Administration, as well as to senior congressmen, conveying their grave concern at the contents of the ASPA.
On 20 June US ambassadors in EU capitals, as well as the US ambassador to the EU, were summoned to be informed of the EU's position.
We sincerely hope that this series of interventions will persuade the US Administration to withhold its support from this piece of legislation and prevent it from becoming US law.
I trust that the Council and the Commission can rely on the full support of the European Parliament in carrying through this strategy.
I would therefore like to encourage you, as legislators, to take up this issue with your counterparts in the US Congress, whether through the legislators' dialogue, or any other contacts you may have with the Hill.
As the democratically elected representatives of the people of Europe, you are best placed to carry this message to the US Congress.
I am looking forward to seeing Parliament make its views known this afternoon in no uncertain way as you debate and adopt a resolution on this issue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I must inform all Members that we have a serious time problem.
We are well behind the timetable and so I will have to be rather strict.
I therefore ask Members to keep to the times allotted to them.
Mr President, I congratulate the Commission on its firm position; it has our full support.
Mr Haarder, it is true that nothing is to be gained from regrets, but neither is anything to be gained from avoiding consideration of problems and concerns.
The good news is that 76 States have ratified the Statute, but the bad news is this intolerable and intolerant attitude of the United States to the international system of justice which is aimed at putting an end to impunity.
President Bush has waged a campaign of harassment against the Court and against the countries which have signed or ratified its statute, which is completely unacceptable.
Only arrogance, ignorance and pride - the three things together - can explain a reaction like the one which has led the two Houses to approve the law we are talking about.
It is outrageous.
At least they have said that they will not invade the Netherlands.
The Union, Parliament and all the European institutions must state as firmly as possible that we will not tolerate such arbitrary behaviour; not the invasion, but the arbitrary nature of the law itself.
We must demand that the members of the United Nations Security Council defend the integrity of the new Court and we must prevent the United States from using its capacity for manoeuvre in the Security Council to undermine a text which they never liked, incorporating blanket protection for United States troops and civilian staff.
The Statute of Rome is based on the principle of complementarity and offers every safeguard against the inappropriate use of the Court.
I am sure that when it comes into operation some people will be reassured.
We must urge the sensible members - as Commissioner Byrne called them - of the United States Congress and Senate to prevent the said law from entering into force.
If they are not going to ratify the Statute, at least they should refrain from adopting measures to disturb or hinder its operation.
The prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, Benjamin B. Ferencz, said that there can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, and no meaningful law without courts to decide what is fair and legitimate in any particular circumstance.
Millions of citizens the world over believe that this International Criminal Court responds to that aspiration.
Let us not allow anybody to ruin it, not even the United States.
Mr President, tomorrow is 4 July, Independence Day.
We join our American friends in a celebration of America's achievements.
In two world wars the Americans came to liberate us from darkness and violence, and when the Balkans erupted the Americans stepped in when Europe failed.
The Americans are there when you need them, ready to fight and die for a world of freedom and democracy.
However, freedom and democracy do not stop after the obtaining of peace.
In order to maintain peace and prevent wars perpetrators of crimes must always be brought to justice.
That is why we in Europe find it utterly incomprehensible that Americans are now cheering on their legislators as they are killing off an essential tool that was missing in our quest to make the world a safer and more just place - the International Criminal Court.
The Court has a mandate to prosecute only the most horrible crimes - genocide, mass murder and mass rape.
In the past we have had to set up ad hoc tribunals for the Milosevics of this world.
Now 74 countries have ratified a court which Kofi Annan rightly calls "a great victory for justice, and for world order - a turn away from the rule of brute force, and towards the Rule of Law."
America and Europe have built-in safeguards to ensure the Court will not become a political tool.
Any government can prevent the Court from taking action against its citizens by prosecuting them at home.
Despite all this, the US has withdrawn its signature.
If that were not a large enough blow to international justice, Congress then accepted the American Servicemembers' Protection Act, which not only threatens to withhold military and financial support to any country that cooperates with the Court, but also allows the US to invade a long-time friend and ally - my country to be precise.
The Dutch people cannot understand how our American friends can now threaten us with violence, and for what?
Is it really more important to allow American soldiers to commit war crimes than to build a safer world?
Is it necessary to jeopardise international peacekeeping missions just to make the point that superpowers do not have to play by the rules?
Perhaps this is an opportunity for Europe.
Europe has a chance to show the world that it is indeed a union of values; that we believe in a world in which we are all equal before the law, a world in which perpetrators of crimes will be brought to justice, no matter who they are and where they are hiding: a world ruled by law, not by the sword of the mightiest.
I cannot believe that Americans do not also want this type of world and I hope deeply that they will reconsider their position.
However, until they do, Europe must take the lead.
We must show the world that we will stick to our principles and fight for justice.
If a majority of the House sends that signal to the world tomorrow by supporting our compromise resolution then we are also celebrating Independence Day, the day that Europe stood up for its values.
Mr President, in my view, it is quite apparent that there is a large majority in this House in favour of a very critical position towards US policy on this issue.
Let me make it clear that I am very gratified by the role played by the European Union in bringing the Statute to fruition and enabling the International Criminal Court to begin work.
However, if this is to continue, this approach must be rigorously upheld.
Mr President-in-Office, I think you have trivialised the problems in some respects, especially by painting an overly positive picture of transatlantic relations and Europe's ability to assert its position vis-Ã -vis the USA.
This may well be true of the bananas issue, but if we look at the complexity of the trend over recent months - the attacks on the Chemical Weapons Convention, the obstructing of a monitoring organisation for biological weapons, the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, the threat of withdrawal from the Outer Space Treaty and of renunciation of the Test Ban Treaty, the threat to the non-proliferation regime, the failure to support the Landmine Convention, and Kyoto, to name just a few - it is apparent that there are major problems and that issues of principle are at stake here.
I think that the International Criminal Court is an even more fundamental issue in some respects.
Mrs van der Laan has just said that American troops fought for freedom in Europe in the First and Second World Wars.
I do not want to generalise here - for there are other examples in American history - but I do not entirely agree with her view.
What is at stake here is a fundamental principle which is also enshrined in American history, namely the principle of common values, which has been underlined here and is now being called into question.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau described the role of the law as follows: "In the relationship between the weak and the strong, it is liberty that oppresses and the law that liberates."
A law which does not apply to the strong is extremely problematical.
I therefore fully endorse the draft resolution on behalf of my group and would ask the Members of this House to vote for our amendment as well.
Mr President, a few weeks ago, people still joked that the United States planned to release American citizens or soldiers - by force, if necessary - from the cells of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Meanwhile, this controversy has developed into an extremely serious conflict between Europe and the United States.
I would immediately like to make it clear what irritates and vexes me the most, and I think I speak for many other Europeans.
As an American professor expressed it in this morning's Herald Tribune, a newspaper which is also read by Mr Oostlander, the United States behaves like a big gorilla that does not tolerate any restrictions imposed on its behaviour.
In fact, what it comes down to is that the United States thinks it is above comparison with other nations.
Strict agreements?
Discipline?
This is all well and good for other countries, but the United States does not feel like adhering to these.
It is the double standards that go against the grain with Europe.
If the Americans can do as they please, how can we in heaven's name prevent the Russians and the Chinese, that do not happen to support the International Criminal Court either, from doing as they please and riding roughshod over agreements reached at international level?
Meanwhile, the questions are mounting.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, allow me to submit to you the most pressing questions.
It looks as if the future of SFOR is not at risk because a new UN mandate is not required for this.
Is this also how the German Government views this?
Is there therefore no risk of German troops withdrawing from Bosnia?
And what is this saying about the legal position of the SFOR military?
Are they immune from prosecution by the International Criminal Court?
Does this immunity apply in Bosnia, or does it apply elsewhere in the world too?
If the mandate of the UN police force in Bosnia is not extended, which is not likely, how will the non-European countries, which account for approximately 900 agents, or 60% of the total, react?
If these leave soon, does this mean that the European soldiers and European police officers who stay behind will be tested to the limit?
Is the European Union - and I sincerely hope so - as Mr Xavier Solana stated yesterday, willing and able to provide additional police troops promptly for this police force, and is Mr Haarder, is the Council, prepared to pay extra for this?
Finally, I should like to ask the Council one last specific question about the position of Great Britain and France in the Security Council.
Is this now truly being coordinated with the European Union across the board?
In other words, am I to conclude, if the answer is positive, that the Council too endorses the compromise proposals which are now, for example, being tabled by Britain and which, in my view, undermine the position of the Criminal Court?
Finally, allow me to finish on a positive note.
It could be a step in the right direction if the European Union turned this into a policy of defending people, in the knowledge that accountability is required, for one King Kong is more than enough.
Mr President, the hostility of the United States towards the International Criminal Court should not surprise us in the least, for we have long been well aware that, in its international relations, the United States will not contemplate the mere idea of partnership and is no less averse to an Atlantic partnership, whatever pathetic illusions may be harboured by the Europeanists and other ideologists of the great fusion of nations.
The US Government remains intransigent; in these circumstances, to disarm our Member States means disarming Europe.
The most astonishing thing about this whole business is that we constantly prove blind to the ways of this so-called partner.
The fact is that the United States is not a partner in any area of activity.
Its unilateralism prevails both in its foreign policy and in its anti-environmentalist stance - on the subject of climate change, for example - not to mention, of course, its strong-arm tactics in the main areas of trade policy.
The Americans are encouraging European countries to disarm but are themselves engaged in a vast programme of unilateral rearmament.
They want to extend NATO as far eastward as possible without changing its command structures.
They advocate universal interference in the government of nations and refuse to listen to any opinion as soon as it challenges their own views.
Only the imperialist mind thinks in this way.
In actual fact, Europeans would have to be very weak or even - dare I say it - cowardly to overlook this evidence.
The United States does not want partners.
It will only accept acolytes.
It is, quite simply, an empire.
By extolling a ludicrous system that seeks to subject all human activities across the globe to the law of profitability alone, in other words the law of the jungle, where might is right, this master of the world has been responsible for much of the poverty on our planet.
From that point of view, Europe has but one political option, namely to pursue a policy of redressing the balance, because otherwise we shall truly become America's poodle.
To pursue such a policy is the courageous, the honourable course, which we owe not only to the nations of Europe but to Europe itself and, ultimately, to that venerable ideal of a free world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a staunch pro-European, a staunch pro-American and above all a staunch and stubborn advocate for over ten years of the need to set up the International Criminal Court, I never thought that this tool could come into operation without encountering problems, precisely because it is so important.
I always thought that, especially as it marks a momentous change, it would surely encounter all kinds of resistance: not just the more open and even more transparent although unacceptable resistance of our US friends, but also that of others.
I hope we shall not forget the hostility and deliberately obstructive behaviour of other great powers beset with internal problems and even crime - I am deliberately referring to our Chinese friends and others - who are also putting obstacles in the way of the International Criminal Court without, however, having the courage to face an open debate in a dignified manner.
It is therefore important to debate and discuss the matter with our allies in an atmosphere of mutual respect, without trying to claim any sort of legal high ground, but resolutely putting across our point of view.
With all due respect to the US Administration, I should like to remind it that the International Criminal Court is a tool that is intended to be permanent, whereas political leaders are, by definition, bound to change.
It may also be our duty to do our utmost to make this tool effective, in the conviction that future administrations of our US friends may possibly take a different attitude and themselves take advantage of the major tool we are offering them.
As the Council has quite rightly pointed out, something similar is happening with the death penalty issue, where dialogue has led the Federal Court to take major steps forward.
Having said that, I am not really interested in discussing whether we are facing an irreversible split in what we call the West.
I am interested, rather, in understanding how we move on from here.
In this respect, I believe two major responses are emerging.
First of all, it is worth noting the growing number of countries choosing to ratify the court.
By 11 April, 66 countries had ratified it and, in little more than two months, the number has now risen to 76.
Secondly, we must realise that everything depends on us.
What we have to do today is to work out whether we Europeans are willing and able to take on the responsibility, and hence also the costs in terms of money and personnel, and move forwards, for instance as regards peace missions.
Indeed, I am afraid that the real aim of our US friends is not so much to scupper the International Criminal Court as to get out of the peace-keeping operations and thus in some way attack the United Nations system.
I know our ambassadors in New York are negotiating tirelessly and resolutely but not inflexibly.
I believe the greatest contribution we can and must make is to stand by our convictions and be prepared to take on the costs and the responsibility.
The more pro-European we are, the more I believe we will manage to provide valid tools, not to demonise, of course, but to foster dialogue and save the alliance with the United States, which I consider strategic and vital for us.
Mr President, I have no doubt that most speakers today will criticise the United States, although not of course India, China, Russia and Sri Lanka.
And they will perhaps criticise Israel.
These are countries that have voiced objections to the Rome Statute, or have refused to ratify it.
The US actions in the Security Council will not in themselves threaten the mission in Bosnia, but indicate the seriousness of America's concerns, the most important of which is the possible prosecution of its civilian and military leaders for serious crimes committed abroad by its military personnel.
The expanded definition of war crimes included in the statute and the much looser definition of command responsibility, looser than at Nuremberg, mean that it is very possible that Donald Rumsfeld or his successor, on a visit to Paris, might find himself under arrest for crimes committed by his subordinates, which he did not participate in, did not give the order for, or even have foreknowledge of, and for which there would be no question of his being tried in an American court.
Some might find that contrary to natural justice but there is no doubt that liberal governments and exponents of international civil society and universal jurisdiction such as Amnesty have fully supported the coming into being of the ICC, whilst ensuring a minimum of public debate over its flaws and its ability to cause political mischief for the Americans.
There are other problems.
It is at least arguable that terrorists will be excluded from some of its provisions and there is a danger that justice will take precedence over amnesties that deliver long sought-after peace and reconciliation in countries such as Angola, South Africa, Sri Lanka or Colombia, to name but a few.
International justice is a noble principle, but America's concerns are very real and serious and it is perfectly entitled, as a sovereign nation, to pass the ASPA and use Article 98.2 of the Rome Statute, but not of course to use force against European nations such as Holland.
We should look for ways to meet these concerns, if necessary through altering the ICC's statutes to tighten the provisions relating to command responsibility and giving the UN Security Council a codecision role in the prosecuting process.
Mr President, I too am pleased that Mr Tannock does not intend to invade the Netherlands, but I would still like to concur with Mr Oostlander's views, and would like to be the first to invite President Bush, in his capacity as commander-in-chief, to receive the Dutch new herring on the beach of Scheveningen on our European Dutch coast.
Such a herring invasion seems to me to be so much more beneficial for the goodwill of the international coalition against terrorism than the threat to invade Europe, if necessary, to release American military accused of crimes against humanity and brought to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which opened its doors this Monday, and is backed by 133 countries.
It appears that the United States would like to put its peace keepers and military above the law, which militates against respect for the Rule of Law, and this despite the fact that the treaty unquestionably hands the responsibility to investigate and take action initially to the country that supplies peace keepers.
The International Criminal Court is a last resort, essentially to penalise war criminals and also leaders of those regimes that commit crimes against humanity.
By tolerating the existence of international lawlessness, we undermine a credible coalition against terrorism, the very object of the exercise.
If being a super power means being above the law, then we are clearly on the wrong track.
The United States is playing with fire. So all the more reason why Europe should take a tough stance, tougher than that stated by Mr Haarder a moment ago, in order to put our ally under diplomatic pressure.
In this, Europe must speak with one voice, and emphasise a broad concept of security and key emphases, such as prevention and civilian elements.
President Bush sometimes wants to play the cowboy at international level, but risks turning his own peacekeepers into outlaws in the process.
This does not fit in very well with the historic American tradition in accordance with which the Rule of Law currently applies to everyone, irrespective of creed, race and origin.
This should also apply to Americans worldwide.
This is why we need an international coalition, and this is where the International Criminal Court in The Hague comes in.
President Bush, I am making an urgent appeal to you, as commander-in-chief, to return to the international coalition for the worldwide Rule of Law.
You are most welcome on our beaches, and we will offer you our first Dutch herring with pleasure.
Thank you, Mr President, Mr Haarder, ladies and gentlemen, the International Criminal Court is officially a reality.
Nearly four years after 120 countries rubberstamped the Rome Statute and the establishment of the Court, it opened its doors in The Hague yesterday, on 1 July 2002.
The European Union is fortunately a staunch supporter of the Criminal Court, but the United States is its most radical opponent.
The Americans are now running a campaign against the Court in order to prevent its own citizens or military from ever being able to be taken before the Court, and they do not stop short of threats, for example by showing their willingness, if necessary, to sacrifice the entire UN police force in Bosnia for this.
My group emphatically rejects the campaign by the United States against the International Criminal Court.
The so-called 'Hague invasion act' is a serious violation of the agreements between the NATO allies.
At one time, back in 1945, the Americans were our liberators, and now they are threatening to invade Scheveningen.
I too would gladly present them with Dutch new herring, Mr Van den Berg.
Why exactly are the Americans kicking up such a fuss?
Does the American administration not believe in its own legal system?
After all, the Court is only activated when the country in question takes no, or insufficient, action in trying crime.
However, two things should be prevented by Europe.
This week, it transpired that the UN mission in Bosnia is at stake.
My group deeply regrets this dramatic step which jeopardises the UN peacekeeping operations in general.
It was therefore appropriate for NATO to hold an emergency meeting, but at this moment in time, a practical solution to Bosnia appears imminent; this conflict, however, may in no circumstances compromise future UN peacekeeping actions.
This immediately brings me to my last point.
The conflict surrounding the Criminal Court could widen the gap between the European Union and the United States.
I call on both the Council of Ministers under the Danish Presidency and the Commission to make every effort in order to keep relations with the US as smooth as possible in the interest of us both and the rest of the world.
Mr President, for a few days now, attention has mainly focused on America's refusal to agree in the UN Security Council on the deployment or enforcement of every peace-keeping force.
This is used as a lever to demand that American military personnel be immune to international prosecution for war crimes.
As a result, we seem to overlook the fact that the conflict started with the US threatening an EU Member State because that is where the International Criminal Court is based.
As early as the beginning of June, the American Senate decided in favour of the possibility of a military invasion in the Netherlands in order to release American prisoners in The Hague.
After the refusal to sign the Kyoto Climate Treaty or decommission chemical and bacteriological weapons and after the taxation on steel imports, this is the umpteenth time the US Government has flown in the face of the entire world.
It demands cooperation and discipline from others in the fight against terrorism, but America itself does as it pleases.
It is high time that we in Europe realised that it is impossible to make or maintain close cooperation agreements with a country or government of that kind.
I have a feeling Mr Haarder underestimates this growing gap.
If we go about it in this way, Europe will eventually have to give in to the US, and this is the worst possible scenario.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, overwhelmed by the tragic events in Rwanda, Belgium adopted a law some time ago which makes it possible to punish the people behind genocide on its own territory.
However, this is only one piece of legislation.
We require international Rule of Law in which the International Criminal Court features as a fundamental keystone.
This is with reference to the United States and various incidents which illustrate that the United States is pulling out of joint commitments which we do want to embrace.
The Commissioner has called for a dialogue with our US colleagues.
I should like to address the President of this Parliament.
I am worried about the increasing degree to which the parliaments in Europe and the American Parliament and American opinion seem to be growing apart.
Might it not be a useful suggestion to send our delegation for relations with the United States, or a special committee, to the US Congress in order to talk about these issues?
We can, of course, also hope that we can make ground by ridiculing their somewhat exaggerated attitude.
However, I take the view that we can achieve better results with formal action, and better results are what we need.
Mrs Maes, the delegation met recently and is planning a visit for November.
The plan has not yet been finalised because, as you know, the United States will be holding mid-term elections on 4 November, which naturally makes everything a little problematic.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the United States' decision to distance itself from the International Criminal Court and its announcement last Sunday in the Security Council that it will henceforth only participate in UN missions if its military personnel are granted immunity reinforces the impression that, in some areas, the United States has adopted a more critical stance towards the institutionalisation of international politics than has the European Union.
After the war, it was the United States which played a key role in the creation of a world order through the establishment of international institutions.
Indeed, at that time, international justice was the watchword.
Today, it is the United States which - through its withdrawal from international treaties - is challenging the acceptance of internationally valid rights and duties.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask the Commissioner and the President-in-Office, and indeed all of us, why this is the case.
There is a reason for it, and I have a document in front of me, dated August 2000, entitled "The American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2000: Implications for US cooperation with the ICC".
Indeed, I wonder why we are holding this debate today.
We set up an early warning system several years ago, but it does not appear to function.
It would seem that regular talks are taking place, but the analytical methods appear to vary, we do not seem to be listening, we do not seem to be assessing each other's problems in time, and nor do we appear to be genuinely listening to each other.
What is the problem, then?
I would ask you all, especially the Council Presidency but also the Commission, to ensure that the early warning system functions in time.
I think that the proposal put forward by Mrs Maes is excellent. We should indeed point out at forthcoming meetings with the Americans that we need better systems and make sure that they actually work in practice.
What I am afraid of is not a transatlantic divide, which we have been discussing, but a transatlantic clash, and I am dubious about the much-vaunted common values which we are always talking about.
I would urge you, Mr President-in-Office and Commissioner Byrne, to take this point very seriously.
Mr President, a dream came true when the International Criminal Court commenced its work at the beginning of this week.
This is an institution in the service of humanitarianism, which will bring war criminals before the court, impose sentences for genocide and punish international perpetrators of violence.
The fact that the US has not signed up to this and is trying to oppose it is both incomprehensible and tragic.
Carrying out such a unilateral and dangerous power policy not only undermines relations with Europe, but also - which is worse - jeopardises and weakens the International Criminal Court.
In addition, the credibility of the UN and the worldwide community is weakened, along with their ability to take action.
Today, the US definitively submitted a new resolution to the UN Security Council regarding Article 16, a resolution which it appears the United Kingdom also intends to support.
According to the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, this new proposal threatens vital elements of the Rome Statute.
I appeal to the Commission and the Council to urge the Member States to stand by the decisions taken and stand up for the UN and the ICC.
Mr President, for four years we in the organisation Parliamentarians for Global Action (PGA), with 1 400 members from parliaments around the world, have been working for the ratification of the Rome Statute of the ICC.
We note with great satisfaction that the Rome Statute entered into force on 1 July this year.
In 1998, 120 states voted in favour of such a court - only seven opposed it, including the US.
Seventy-six states have now ratified the statute.
The court will constitute a vital tool for strengthening international law through legal instruments.
No country, no leader, no government can avoid prosecution for serious breaches of international law such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
It is surprising that a country with such a long legal tradition and so many lawyers per square metre as the US can consider exempting its citizens from liability to prosecution for such serious crimes.
What does the US have to hide?
What criminals is it trying to protect?
Exempting peacekeeping forces from such liability to prosecution would be devastating for women.
This would in effect legalise rape, sexual assault and forced pregnancy, which unfortunately also occur with peacekeeping forces.
The action of the US sends serious signals to the world.
It is a dangerous and irresponsible path which George Bush has chosen, and the EU must react robustly.
Mr President, I think we can conclude today that there is huge agreement between the Council and Parliament on this matter.
Europe as a whole urges the Americans to reconsider this matter.
We cannot understand the Americans, and we appeal to them as friends.
We view the matter very seriously.
We shall do everything to influence the United States, and I am able to inform Mrs Mann that the Council did in fact use its Early Warning System, but that, in the event, it did not work.
The Council and its members are now continuing the work, for example during the UN General Assembly in New York.
I am pleased that so many people have also mentioned the common values that link the two sides of the Atlantic.
We must not impute more far-reaching motives to the United States than it actually possesses.
We must also note that the United States has clearly repudiated all notions of an invasion of the Netherlands. Nor has the United States expressed any desire to undermine the International Criminal Court.
Our task now is to maintain the firm support that exists for the International Criminal Court and to ensure that it is able to function and that the UN peacekeeping operations can continue to be carried out effectively, that is to say with American participation.
As regards the pressing problem of the UN police force in Bosnia, we have, as is well known, agreed to take over the force on 1 January 2003, and I should like to say to Mr Lagendijk that if, as a result of this conflict, we were to take over the police force earlier, the Council would also find the money to do so.
I would turn last of all to Mrs Mann whose commitment in the US delegation I myself have witnessed.
There are good reasons why the US delegation should consider how the Early Warning System discussed in this delegation can be improved.
The initiative we are debating today came of course from the US parliament - or, rather, Congress - and I therefore think that all Mrs Mann's observations were particularly relevant.
I must otherwise refrain from giving Parliament good advice, however. I just wanted to commend both Mrs Mann and the efforts being made in Parliament's US delegation to improve relations with the American Congress.
I thank Parliament for what amounts to a powerful affirmation of the Commission's policy on this particularly difficult issue, as expounded by myself and others - and expressed, if I might say so, with some considerable eloquence and passion.
The fact that it was expressed with virtual unanimity is also a source of support for the Commission in the pursuit of the policies it has said it will follow.
A number of speakers raised particular issues to which I should like to respond.
Mrs Bonino asked "what steps next" and specifically referred to the cost aspect.
Of course it would be a very serious issue if problems arose with the UN mandate for peacekeeping.
Clearly this will have to be addressed, particularly the cost aspect.
I know that there are debates under way and considerations being examined at this time in relation to this issue.
A solution will have to be sought, but a good one will be hard to find.
I want to refer to the question raised by Mrs Maes as to whether there is room for the possibility of a parliamentary delegation from this House to the United States to take up these issues with their colleagues and counterparts in the US.
From the Commission's point of view, let me say that this would be a development which the Commission would fully support and welcome; indeed, it believes that there may be some benefits in pursuing that course of action.
The task now before us is to fully support the work of the ICC, which opened its doors for work only two days ago, in the hope that it will do its work in the manner that those who are behind it and have ratified this court believe it can do.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure
The next item is the report (A5-0215/2002) by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the monitoring of Community policy on the protection of purchasers of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis (Directive 94/47/EEC) [2000/2208(INI)].
Mr President, with regard to this report I must say that my only job - to use a bullfighting metaphor that the House may not understand - was to go in for the kill, because for a year - between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2002 - the rapporteur was Mr Marinho and then he had to leave it, and it was therefore he who did all the preparatory work and it simply fell to me in the final phase to take up the amendments proposed and bring about some kind of compromise.
In the end there were some sixty amendments.
Under Mr Marinho there was a hearing with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and there was a first stage and a second one with amendments.
My job was simply to bring all the strands together.
The directive on the use of immovable property on a timeshare basis was approved in 1994 by means of the co-decision procedure and I was Parliament's rapporteur on this directive.
The directive took three years, in principle, to enter into force, but in many countries it was postponed for one year.
By the way, I am pleased to say that recently the Spanish Supreme Court passed the judgement that the Spanish Government should compensate private Community consumers for its delay in applying the Directive.
I believe that this is a good legal precedent which increases the validity of Community directives.
The current Directive is a minimal directive.
Certain information obligations were established and also the opportunity for the purchaser to change their mind within a period of ten days, with the sum paid being refunded.
But it is clear that, being a minimal directive, it was not going to be able to resolve all the issues raised.
In the discussions on this issue in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market over the last two years, it has become clear that for many Community citizens the current system is doing harm and that we should therefore increase the arsenal of instruments at our disposal.
From the point of view of Community law, perhaps we will be faced with difficulties.
And the difficulty lies in the current concern in all the Community institutions with regard to simplifying the regulatory procedure.
We have the Council's Mandelkern report, we have the proposals of the Commission on European governance and on the improvement of Community regulation and finally we have the agreements of the Seville European Council, which insist on the need to make progress in this area with the participation of the European Parliament.
Furthermore, the present Directive is peculiar in that it involves the field of private law, contract law, property law, which are traditionally considered to fall within the competence of the Member States.
Therefore, the road before us is not easy.
On the one hand, I believe it is a clearly Community field, in that it involves property sold in one country to Community citizens and with responsibilities which may arise at a later date, and, on the other hand, it is - as I said earlier - a question of private law which would not normally be considered a Community matter.
Furthermore, the question is raised of the possible use or limitations of the legislative procedure.
It has been suggested for example that other types of measure may be useful in this field, such as measures for cooperation between Member States to combat the forms of money laundering that appear in certain types of timeshare companies or simply certain types of fraud.
It mentions the possibility of employing co-regulation or self-regulation procedures, for example through the accreditation of operators in this field and there are a whole series of difficulties reflected in the report.
Parliament's report is a compromise report.
There is an exhaustive study by the Commission, but it dates from 1999.
I believe that the main conclusion is that the Commission must be asked to study the issue again and to present proposals to us as soon as possible which may be either legislative or non-legislative.
Specifically, on reviewing the report approved in committee, we detected an error in paragraph 20, which referred to certain infringement procedures which have already been concluded and therefore that paragraph 20 no longer makes sense and should be removed.
And there are also some unnecessary repetitions in paragraphs 6 and 7.
I would propose that the House vote against those three paragraphs, 6, 7 and 20.
With regard to the amendments presented, there are three - Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 by Mr Bradbourn, Mr Lehne and Mrs McCarthy, which relate to the stipulation of specific days - which I believe to be too precise for a non-legislative text.
And finally, there are three amendments by Mrs McCarthy, which clarify certain aspects in the field of information and responsibilities, which I believe to be very good.
I will end my speech here, Mr President, and I hope the House can adopt the draft report tomorrow.
Mr President, I am particularly pleased to speak on this report as I have taken a special interest in the revision of the timeshare directive, following numerous complaints that I have received from aggrieved holidaymakers in my own region in the United Kingdom who have suffered at the hands of sometimes unscrupulous operators.
In November last year the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market instigated a public hearing on timeshares and a number of my constituents were able to come and explain their experiences directly to that hearing.
I am very happy to say that many of the problems raised at the hearing, both in the oral presentations and the written dossier of evidence I submitted at the time, have been addressed.
A particular concern has been the increase in holiday club, or points club operations, which, by the very nature of their membership rules, take advantage of current legislation, which does not cover contracts of under three years.
I would therefore commend to the House the proposal to cover all contracts of this nature, thus shutting off the loophole that currently exists.
Furthermore, I am pleased to see that we have proposed that the handing over of credit card details be subject to the same cooling-off period as a deposit by any other means.
I have heard in surgeries in my own constituency of stories of innocent holidaymakers unwittingly giving timeshare touts their credit card details, only to find on their return from holiday that significant amounts of money have been debited from their accounts.
Similarly, it is also vital that once contracts have been definitively signed, consumers are adequately protected against unreasonable increases in maintenance costs and, in cases where there has been malpractice, holidaymakers have easy recourse to legal redress.
A significant hurdle to such redress is the cost of complainants undertaking often lengthy legal procedures in a country where they are not completely at ease with the process.
We must therefore look at new ways of simplifying this procedure, perhaps allowing complainants to use their own national judicial systems if necessary.
These measures represent essential steps towards genuine consumer protection for European holidaymakers purchasing this type of holiday.
However, the current report is not a complete solution to all problems.
I hope that Members will be able to support my amendment to extend the cooling-off period to 28 calendar days from its current 10.
This would give a real opportunity for people to consider, in the cold light of day when they return from holiday, whether they wish to go ahead with their purchase.
I hope now that the Commission can come forward with appropriate proposals for legislation as quickly as possible so that our EU citizens can enjoy all forms of timeshare holidays in complete peace of mind.
Mr President, Mr Medina and Mr Marinho have methodically highlighted the shortcomings in current Community legislation on timeshares and shown that, if it is to be effective, unilateral regulations are no good.
A large majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with this approach, which is why we should adopt it unanimously.
The new legislative proposal to come out of the report should: first, provide an integrated response to the problems which consumers have faced in the past, secondly, abolish the practice of circumventing the guarantees set out in Community legislation and, thirdly, protect all the parties involved.
This means that all new contractual forms for the enjoyment of immovable property on a timeshare basis should be included in the scope of the directive, without any reference to fixed time limits as regards either the minimum duration of a contract or the annual period of use.
In addition, we need rules: one, that guarantee that agents will honour their contractual obligations in the long term, even if they go bankrupt or are insolvent, and restrict the number of agencies licensed, two, governing the right of the consumer and the obligation of the undertaking to allow the consumer to purchase his timeshare on the basis of a specific price and, three, on the system for exchanging timeshares.
Problems have arisen in practice, as has the question of international jurisdiction and applicable law, which is why jurisdiction clauses referring to offshore jurisdictions or simply to jurisdictions other than in the place in which the property is situated should be banned, as should clauses referring to the law of a third country.
As we have already said in connection with the need to avoid unilateral regulations, the question of the property owner's interests still needs to be resolved.
In addition, this system needs to be treated as a way of developing tourism and providing jobs.
Finally, given past experience, we need to look at the possibility of a new information campaign at European level promoting reliable timeshare companies.
Mr President, imagine, colleagues, that you are an intelligent and sensible person, you are on holiday in another EU country with your elderly and frail mother, you both end up being trapped for over half a day in an airless room by total strangers, offered little or no refreshment and, because there is a large gentleman blocking the door you feel your exit is cut off, so you end up signing a contract and paying a deposit for a timeshare product that you do not want.
You return home to find that you have waved goodbye to the deposit of several thousand pounds and the company you dealt with is a worthless shell, constituted in some offshore haven.
You have no chance of redress.
Yes, this is a true story.
How many of us have heard hapless tales like this from our constituents, despite the existence of a timeshare directive?
This report is timely.
Its contents need to be acted on now, not delayed for further studies and reports.
But let me sound a note of caution.
Whilst it will have the support of the Liberal Group, I am not totally convinced that this raft of rather complex and different legislative and non-legislative initiatives will answer the problem.
The simple problem, to my mind, is this: these timeshare scams are one of the most appalling signals that we do not have, that we have not created a single European area of justice.
Cross-border access to justice within the internal market is still fraught with many barriers for our citizens.
Few, if any, of these scams are perpetrated against citizens in their own Member States.
These rogues are only too easily able to profit from the lack of a single European civil area of justice.
If they knew they would be pursued in their own countries they would think twice.
I commend paragraph 15 of the report as a good starting point for bringing these contracts within the definition of consumer contracts.
It is this sort of horizontal approach that will eventually provide the answer.
If we have proper cross-border access to justice then the timeshare scam bandits will think twice before they prey on our holidaying constituents.
Mr President, I wish first to express my gratitude for the warm words of the rapporteur, Manuel Medina Ortega, but I must say that the report has lost nothing with my replacement.
Mr President, the sharing of opportunities provided by the use of property with the time being shared - what is known as 'timeshare' - has not actually resulted in the happiness of all users.
The problems that these products have experienced in the past and that still remain are well known and it was as a consequence of these problems that, in its time, Directive 94/47 was adopted, in the aim of providing protection against flagrant abuses of trust.
Some problems, nevertheless, persist.
The directive adheres to the principle of minimal harmonisation, establishing a low level of consumer protection measures that the Members States could then extend if they so wish.
This has not, unfortunately, been common practice.
As a consequence, consumers now face a hotchpotch of laws, which afford greater protection in some States than in others.
Since the directive was amended, the number of complaints received from European consumers has increased rather than decreased, as acknowledged by the Commission in its implementation report.
There are, as a matter of fact, increasingly sophisticated methods of offering timeshare products, such as contracts of less than three years, normally of 35 months, thereby falling short of the minimum duration covered by the directive and evading Community discipline.
Similarly, the directive covers only property that is used at least seven days per year, which has led to an increase in timeshare contracts for periods of less than seven days.
As Mr Medina Ortega quite rightly states, the directive, therefore, clearly needs urgent revision.
Consumers require an effective measure of protection for their transactions, in particular those that take place in more than one Member State.
The industry needs guarantees that fair practices will be encouraged and supported, through a reworded directive that eliminates the scandalous practices that we have been seeing.
Mr President, either we come up with standards that, without involving excessive regulation, of course, allow this activity to develop freely, or we leave everything the way it is and we accept, in the open society - and the information society - in which we live, all the attacks on this industry, be they well-intentioned or otherwise, that wish to destroy the competitive framework in which it must operate.
Our decision must come down on the side of consumers, of tourism, of leisure activities, of the opportunity of holidays for all and of respect for responsible and honest promoters and this is why I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Manuel Medina Ortega, whose text clearly exposes the shortcomings that need to be overcome in a future legislative text.
It now falls to the Commission to take responsibility and to say what needs to be said.
Mr President, I also want to congratulate my colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, and indeed his predecessor for the work that has been done on this directive.
Mr Medina referred to action that had to be taken to implement this directive throughout the Member States and the laggardly way in which they have done so.
It has all been too little, too late.
There is a fringe of fraudulent activities - the timeshare sharks.
There are practices that exploit the time limits of the directive itself, the growth of holiday clubs, points clubs and so on. There is avoidance of the limited protection of the very brief cooling-off period which is, I fear, not universally implemented, again by the different Member States.
My colleague, Mrs McCarthy and others join me in recommending a proper cooling-off period of 28 days where the contract is signed outside the buyer's country of residence, as is the normal procedure.
In my own country the victims of timeshare fraud have banded together to try and demand action.
One of my constituents, Claire Griffiths, who attended the public hearings here, organised boycotts of the agents in her area.
They were successful in terms of the diminished business of those people, but the group is still waiting for proper redress and their money back.
The Association of Timeshare Owners is today organising a co-regulatory body to deal with the management of timeshare resorts, which has been one of the other matters at issue.
Our quarrel is not with them.
I appreciate anything which is done in the field of co-regulation.
However, they, and we, need action from the Commission, either by a resolution or by a directive.
That is the only way we can demonstrate our power here to protect the vulnerable against exploitation that is not merely callous but very often criminal as well.
Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega and the members of the Committees on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer policy for all their helpful work on this issue.
I take the timeshare issue very seriously.
Transactions are almost exclusively cross-border and often involve very significant sums of money.
It is, therefore, essential that we aim to provide a high level of protection for consumers in this field.
The present EU directive has made a significant contribution to consumers' rights, establishing minimum harmonisation.
However, I am well aware that a number of consumer protection problems still exist.
This, in my view, is not due to the transposition of the directive, the Commission has already withdrawn all the infringement procedures in relation to that - but to its application.
Therefore, more needs to be done.
Consumers can be vulnerable to several problems when they buy rights to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis.
Firstly, certain unscrupulous vendors and agents use aggressive marketing techniques, which either mislead or place undue influence on consumers so as to induce them to buy, often to their detriment.
Secondly, new practices have emerged under which timeshare deals are offered through certain packages such as club points schemes or shares in a company, which effectively circumvents the obligations stipulated by the directive.
As a result, consumers miss out on access to the required level of information and on cooling-off periods.
I attach great importance to your resolution.
Its conclusions, together with the Council's conclusions and the reactions to the 1999 Commission report on the implementation of the directive provide a solid basis for further action.
Furthermore, I am sure you will agree that we need to act immediately given the numerous complaints that our institutions have received on this issue.
I believe that the more general problems could be tackled within the context of a framework directive on fair trading.
Further harmonisation of laws is necessary to achieve a uniform, high level of consumer protection throughout the EU.
This is outlined in the follow-up communication to the Green Paper on consumer protection, which has just been adopted by the Commission.
The marketing practices which could be tackled using this approach include those based on misleading claims or failure to disclose material information to consumers prior to the conclusion of the contract, those involving harassment, coercion or intimidatory techniques and those relating to after-sales customer assistance.
In addition, in order to address the most urgent problems, we should establish links with leading associations and members of the timeshare industry in order to make self-regulation more effective.
The timeshare codes of conduct could be used to raise standards and to address those unfair and opaque practices not caught by the directive.
I have recently been informed that a European trade association has taken legal action against certain holiday clubs in Spain for violation of Spanish timeshare law.
The association in question has provided information to the public authorities on dishonest practices, which have subsequently been investigated.
Several holiday club companies have been closed within the past few weeks and their principals have been arrested as part of the investigation.
Thus a more systematic cooperation between the industry and the relevant contact points in the Member States could and should be encouraged.
Such cooperation should aim to identify companies with which problems have arisen and against which enforcement action can be taken.
The Commission will therefore draw on the experience of the European centres, the Euro-Guichets, and work with the newly established clearing houses of the European Extra-Judicial Network and with the International Marketing Supervision Network to address current outstanding problems and encourage them to cooperate closely with the industry.
Specifically, the points that have been raised by Mrs Wallis in relation to access to justice are of significance and the cross-border nature of that problem is highlighted by her, in my opinion rightly.
Our proposal contained in the follow-up paper on fair trading specifically refers to the need for law enforcement cooperation among Member States.
In our consultation process with Member States and others, there was a very strong response to that part of the paper focusing on enforcement cooperation.
With this in view, it is the intention of the Commission to bring forward a specific proposal in relation to that particular issue by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.
Furthermore issues such as reciprocal injunctive powers between Member States would also, in my view, be of significance and could be effective.
In effect, EU-wide contract and consumer law needs to be looked at, which we are doing in my DG at the moment, as I am sure many of you are aware, and we will bring forward proposals in that area also in due course I hope sooner rather than later.


These are our plans but if, after taking action as I have outlined, problems still remain that cannot be solved by these actions, I will not hesitate to review the timeshare directive as indicated in the consumer policy strategy recently adopted by the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0253/2002).
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, is with us, with the added value that he was an MEP for a long time and he knows very well how this House operates and the wishes of the Members.
Question No 6 by Mr Gallagher will not be taken, as its author is no longer a Member of the European Parliament for a politically very interesting reason: he is now a Minister in the Irish Government.
We will send him the written reply to his question.
Question No 1 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0356/02):
Subject: Draft law on the media in Turkey
The Turkish Government plans to adopt a controversial draft law on the media which is contrary to the country's constitution and Turkey's commitments to the EU.
EU officials, Member States' diplomats and the Commission's representative in Ankara have already voiced their concerns about the content of the draft law.
The draft law extends the ban on broadcasting radio and television programmes in the Kurdish language, which Turkey had pledged it would lift at the end of the previous month, thereby jeopardising the fundamental democratic principle of freedom of expression and paving the way for the creation of an uncontrolled monopoly.
Does the Council, therefore, consider that adoption of the draft law is politically and legally consistent with the Copenhagen accession criteria and the EU-Turkey customs union?
Will the Council intervene to safeguard the democratic rules and human rights enshrined in international law?
Mr President, thank you for your friendly welcome.
One might say that Mr Gallagher's absence from the House and my own presence here are both due to our each having become ministers. That is the way it is sometimes.
In response to the question, I would say that the controversial law on the media to which the honourable Member refers was adopted by the Turkish parliament on 15 May of this year.
The Council is of the view that, if it were to be implemented in practice, this law on the media would clearly be a retrograde step and would mean further tightening of the restrictions upon the freedom of radio and television broadcasting in Turkey.
The Council would draw attention to the fact that on 13 June, after the matter had been introduced by the Turkish President, Mr Sezer, the Turkish constitutional court suspended five articles of this law, including the article concerning the appointment of members and that concerning economic sanctions in the event of infringements.
I would also point out that the constitutional court is still investigating the substance of the rest of the text.
The Council would remind the House that the European Commission reacted immediately to this law partly on the grounds that it was not consistent with the politically based Copenhagen criteria and partly on the grounds that it conflicted with the accession partnership, a necessary prerequisite of which is that all legal stipulations prohibiting Turkish citizens from using their mother tongues in TV and radio broadcasts are to be cancelled without delay.
The EU has emphasised this precondition quite unambiguously in its discussion meetings with Turkey and did so most recently at the political directors' meeting on 17 May in Madrid immediately after the Turkish parliament had adopted the law.
The Council will monitor the situation carefully, since we are concerned here with absolutely crucial principles.
The Council and Mr Papayannakis are therefore agreed on that point.
I thank the President-in-Office of the Council or, perhaps I should say, the honourable Member.
Thank you very much.
You gave a very clear, excellent reply.
I have nothing further to add.
I just want to ask you one more thing: do we perhaps have any information as to when this saga will come to an end, for better or for worse?
For better I hope of course.
When will the final decision be taken on how long this law is to remain on the statute book?
I should like to thank Mr Papayannakis for his kind words.
I am pleased that we are agreed on this.
I cannot, unfortunately, give any indication as to when this issue will be concluded.
Can we not all agree to keep an eye on the matter and to continue to exert pressure?
We can then hope that a solution will be found as soon as possible.
Mr President, I can provide the following information about the Council position.
At the last ministerial meeting on 14 May in Reykjavik, the EU and NATO repeated their promise to develop close and transparent links between the two organisations and stated that progress had been made on a number of points concerning the arrangement in relation to NATO support for EU-led operations.
They also observed, however, that the decisions made at the NATO Summit in Washington in 1999 and subsequently by the Council of Ministers and the Nice European Council mean that there are a number of points requiring further discussion.
As is well known, further progress could not be made because one NATO member had expressed misgivings.
What is termed the Ankara text constitutes a non-binding attempt to define guidelines which, at the same time as taking account of these misgivings, can prepare the way for being able as quickly as possible to fulfil the promise of developing close and transparent links between the EU and NATO.
In Barcelona, the European Council emphasised how important it is for a permanent arrangement to be reached as soon as possible between the EU and NATO.
The Presidency was therefore requested to make relevant high-level contacts, in conjunction with the High Representative, Mr Solana, in order to ensure a positive outcome.
The Presidency and the High Representative are doing their utmost to find an acceptable solution for all EU and NATO members, a solution which is, in all respects, in accordance with the decisions made by the Nice European Council and which can facilitate rapid progress towards the goal confirmed in Reykjavik by all the ministers from the EU and NATO countries.
Finally, between 21 and 22 June of this year in Seville, the European Council expressed its satisfaction with the progress made by the Spanish Presidency in implementing the Nice provisions with regard to involving those European allies which are not EU members. In Seville, the next Presidency - which is to say the Danish Presidency - was, moreover, given the task of furthering this cooperation in conjunction with the Secretary-General, that is to say the High Representative.
Mr President-in-Office, what you said was perfectly clear.
I would just like to ask, if I may, for a few more details on what happens now, following the decisions taken in Seville.
If I have understood rightly, the Spanish Presidency was praised on this account; it was decided that efforts to find a solution would continue but I believe that a number of addenda to this famous text were also discussed which will not be binding but which are politically significant.
Is there any news since Seville?
Do we know how this text is to be improved and what the alternatives are?
Mr President, I have to say to Mr Papayannakis that I really cannot answer the question he has put or, indeed, his supplementary question.
The fact is that, because of the Treaty derogation we have in the defence area, Denmark does not exercise the Presidency of the EU when it comes to preparing and implementing decisions and actions affecting the defence area.
It is Greece which exercises the Presidency in these matters, and I would therefore recommend that any supplementary questions be put in writing, whereupon they will be answered on the basis of careful instructions from my Greek colleague.
Since this is such an unusual case, we will give the floor to Mr Papayannakis for a point of order.
Mr President, I honestly did not mean to allude to the Danish opt out, but the President-in-Office's reply means that, because the opt out also applies to common foreign policy and the euro, we may need, at some point, to invite the Greek representative to Question Time to the Council.
I put it to you, Mr President, so that you can put it to the Bureau.
Written questions, as Mr Haarder recommends, are not enough.
They are all well and good but verbal questions have a charm of their own because they raise supplementary questions and answers. Is this perhaps something we should be looking at?
As President for the sitting, I take good note of this problem, but Mr Haarder has the floor.
Mr President, I should like to assure Mr Papayannakis that Denmark exercises the Presidency both in the Committee on Internal Affairs, in spite of the fact that the Danish derogation applies to certain subjects dealt with by the committee, and in the ECOFIN Council.
In the case, however, of decisions and actions affecting the defence area, we have chosen, out of respect for the decision taken by the Danes getting on for many years ago now, to let the Greek Presidency exercise the Presidency of the Council on this point.
I should like to add that, in common with the majority of the Danish parliament, the Danish Government would like to see these derogations removed as soon as possible.
Until, however, they are removed following a referendum, we shall respect them.
It is a democratic decision we are respecting, and I am pleased that Mr Papayannakis is sympathetic to our doing so.
We are, moreover, very pleased that the Greek Government is so helpful and that there has been such splendid cooperation in connection with drawing up the Danish Presidency's programme, for which Greece has written the section relating to defence.
Question No 4 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0371/02):
Subject: Georgia
At its fourth meeting, which took place in Tbilisi on 29 and 30 April 2002, the EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee adopted a final document in which (point 14) it 'calls on the Georgian and EU authorities to fulfil, as soon as possible, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), in order to create the basis for starting negotiations for an Association Agreement'.
Can the Council provide a comprehensive list of points of the Cooperation Agreement which have not yet been implemented and the reasons why this is case, together with a statement of strategy and the timetable prepared by the Council so that the Agreement as a whole can be implemented as soon as possible?
Moreover, does the Council not consider that the PCA, or even a possible Association Agreement, is not a suitable EU response for Georgia to be able to face the challenges arising out of the region's extremely problematic situation?
Does the Council not consider that the issue of Georgia's accession to the EU should no longer be evaded, and that therefore, without further delay, Georgia should be included in the list of candidate countries, on the understanding that its membership will depend on its ability to integrate the acquis communautaire into its national legislation?
Mr President, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Georgia came into effect on 1 July 1999.
It was initially to last for ten years, whereupon it was to be automatically extended each year.
The same condition exists in all the partnership and cooperation agreements entered into by the EU.
It has therefore always been clear that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Georgia was a long-term commitment for both parties.
When the purpose of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is considered, it is clear that it has created a solid basis for closer links between the EU and Georgia.
It has created a framework for political dialogue that has contributed to the development of the links between us, and it has also helped promote the economic ties between the parties.
On the other hand, there is clearly still a long way to go, namely in connection with the need to support Georgia's efforts to consolidate its democracy and develop its economy.
There is also a lot to be done within the fields of legislative, administrative, economic, social, financial, civic, technological and cultural cooperation.
As I say, it has been clear that our cooperation under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will take some time.
Moreover, Georgia has also had to struggle with some quite special problems.
Since 1991, one million people have left Georgia, the gross national product per inhabitant has fallen by 70% and now 60% of the population are living under the poverty threshold.
Two unresolved internal conflicts have meant that there are now almost 300 000 displaced persons within the country's borders.
Georgia is in a very difficult situation where regional security is concerned, and the fight against corruption has come up against considerable resistance from various quarters. It is a genuinely tragic situation.
We support Georgia's aspirations to become further integrated into the European models and structures.
The EU has provided EUR 350 million by way of aid since independence in 1991 but, in the Council's view, it would not at this stage be responsible to consider further steps that are subject to agreement.
We are convinced that we must concentrate on the full implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
This is also apparent from a recent letter from President Shevardnadze to Mr Solana, in which he talks about the need for further progress in the implementation of this agreement.
That depends of course upon political, social and economic reforms, as well as upon the resolution of two internal conflicts for which Georgia itself must assume full responsibility.
In that connection, the Council wishes to emphasise that the two internal conflicts in Georgia and the conflict between the other countries in the Southern Caucasus mean that conditions in the area are far from stable.
The lack of stability leads to problems involving terrorism, poverty, corruption, weak political institutions, illicit trade, emigration and the risk of ethnic conflicts.
Conflict resolution must therefore be our first priority.
It demands effort and good will on the part of all the countries in the Southern Caucasus, as well as on the part of the international community.
We cooperate with Georgia in frequent meetings of our Cooperation Council and Cooperation Committee.
There are still, however, measures which Georgia itself can take in order to help itself.
Failure to implement existing legislation impedes progress and limits the impact of EU aid.
The commitment Georgia entered into in October 2000 to adopt a national programme for the implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement has still not been fulfilled.
We look forward to progress in this area.
Finally, I wish to thank Mr Dupuis for his considerable commitment to this issue.
