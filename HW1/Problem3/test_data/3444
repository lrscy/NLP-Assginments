Mr President, on 13 March 2007 the European Parliament passed a resolution on collective cross-border management of copyright.
In its resolution, Parliament called on the Commission to waste no time in presenting a proposal for a framework directive regulating collective cross-border management of copyright and related intellectual property rights for legitimate online music services.
It also called on the Commission to make it clear that the 2005 recommendation in this area applies exclusively to online sales of music recordings.
Can the Commission update Parliament on the measures it has taken to date, in response to Parliament's requests?
Can the Commission inform Parliament whether it is following the same guidelines and instructions issued by President Barroso on the unified, democratic, rapid development of a united Europe?
When will the Commission respect Parliament's procedural rules and the position adopted by the majority of its 785 Members?
The 13 March resolution reflects the European Parliament's clear position on cross-border collective management of copyright.
The Commission's recommendation was the first step towards future convergence of the various practices in the 27 Member States.
On behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, I myself argued, in my opinion for to the competent Committee, in favour of the importance of ensuring equal treatment for all right-holders, whether writers, composers, editors, record producers or performers.
In other words, this is an issue concerning millions of right-holders throughout Europe.
The situation today, as regards online services is not considered to be effective enough, either for rights users, or for right-holders.
We have thus all worked to present the Commission and the Council with the proposals that we believe would bring about a change for the better in the collective management of copyright.
The close cooperation between rights managers must be retained for the benefit of all parties.
Piracy remains the greatest problem facing the music industry today.
Three of the reasons for the spread of piracy internationally are the technological facilities for low-cost illegal copying, unfavourable economic conditions and the expansion of the Internet.
We shall all have to bear in mind that the spread of music piracy has the greatest impact on small countries where the music industry is mainly of a local and regional nature.
In specific terms, piracy entails a shrinkage of the legal music market and results in a decline in legal sales; it therefore affects the viability of the national music recording industry.
Piracy certainly entails copyright losses for composers and songwriters, but it also deprives the state of income tax and VAT.
The fight against piracy must therefore be included among the Commission's initial aims in the possible legislative proposal on collective management of copyright.
I would therefore like to call upon the Commission to take steps, as soon as possible, to fulfil Parliament's requests and to present a proposal for a framework directive with a view to regulating the collective cross-border management of copyright.
Lastly, as I have always said, music is not a commodity, and it is the duty of us all to protect and strengthen creativity in Europe.
A directive that will in all likelihood not come into force until 2010 is a disaster for millions of artists in the EU.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Thank you very much.
I would like to emphasise that this is about an extraordinarily important area, since income from goods and services protected by copyright and related rights accounts for 5-7% of the European Union's GDP.
This highlights the importance of such rights being managed appropriately.
As you know, in 2005 the European Commission adopted a Recommendation on the cross-border management of legitimate online music services.
At the time, Commissioner McCreevy described the Recommendation as 'a "soft-law instrumentâ designed to give the market a chance to move in the right direction'.
The Recommendation has far-reaching consequences for the copyrights market and major players in the market are already acting on the basis of it.
It clearly goes further than merely interpreting and supplementing existing rules and its impact has all the characteristics of a full regulatory initiative.
At the time, a lot of fear took hold in connection with this Recommendation, including the fact that it would result in uncontrollable competition and that market forces would be concentrated in the hands of a few big management societies, and monopolies would be created.
This is precisely why I thought that I should make a recommendation in an own-initiative report for the online music market to be regulated in a different way.
All the same, the Recommendation - which the Commission adopted - deprived the European Parliament and the Member States of the opportunity to have any significant influence on the changes affecting competition and cultural diversity in Europe.
It is precisely for this reason that I have been able to win the support of the whole Parliament and all the political parties for my report, in the interests of bringing to fruition a decision-making triangle, so that Parliament cannot be left out of the legislation of such an important area, and I have recommended that the Commission draw up a framework directive.
In my opinion, this recommended directive must meet the following requirements: it must guarantee right-holders a high degree of protection and equal treatment.
It must be based on solidarity between right-holders and on an appropriate, fair balance among management societies.
It must provide for democratic, transparent and accountable governance in management societies, including organisational structuring, transparency, representation, rules relating to copyright and production, and accounting, through minimum standards.
Comprehensive transparency must be ensured in collective management societies.
Creativity and cultural diversity must be promoted.
Fair and controlled competition can be allowed, without territorial restrictions, but with the necessary and suitable qualitative criteria for the collective management of copyright and the preservation of the value of the rights.
A high degree of legal certainty must be provided for users, and the availability of the global repertoire must be preserved.
We, or I, therefore ask you to think about whether a directive would be necessary for regulating this important area.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Borg's reply to the question put by Mr Dumitrescu fills me with concern: the Commissioner spoke of leaving the matter in the market's hands.
But what is it we are talking about?
We are talking about rights which have taken two centuries to evolve: rights of creators, authors, composers, artistes.
And now we are being told that those rights are to be regulated by the market: by what market?
The market of thieves, the market of people who have divested producers and creators of their intellectual property by using new means of communication?
What sort of rights are we talking about?
Rights are regulated by public bodies; specifically in the European arena we have institutions, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament: the Commission with its power of initiative, the Council and Parliament through the codecision procedure.
It seems to me that now is not the time to follow a path which will lead to the disappearance of intellectual property.
And if intellectual property disappears, intellectual creation disappears as well.
Some of the wise men and women who talk to us today about the advantages of the information society say well, yes, composers and authors can wander the streets giving concerts like in the Middle Ages.
Are we going to reduce our authors to medieval minstrels who can play in the middle of the street, with a cap on the floor hoping someone will give them alms?
I think now is the time for the institutions of the European Union to react vigorously to defend this European tradition; its political essence is very important and it is vital for the maintenance of intellectual creativity.
Only through societies of authors, the collective management of those societies, can intellectual property rights and the creation of intellectual property be defended today, right now, against the real thieves in the form of broadcasting companies which use intellectual creativity for their own benefit.
(PL) Mr President, the response to the Commission's Recommendation on collective cross-border management of copyright for legitimate online music services was provided by Parliament's Resolution that a framework directive be introduced to regulate this issue.
However, the Commission did not carry out the necessary and wide-ranging stakeholder consultation that was required, including with Parliament, which was a breach of democratic procedures.
It is completely unacceptable to ignore the institutional triangle and instead apply the so-called soft law approach without prior consultation and without the formal involvement of Parliament and the Council in the matter.
This recommendation, which aims in practice to create more freedom for copyright owners to select the institution that provides collective management, depending on requirements, would have far-reaching consequences for the copyright and related markets and would create a potential threat not just to competition rules, but also to cultural diversity.
As a result, market power would be concentrated in the hands of a few of the largest entities that will then be able to bypass the network of bilateral agreements and grant licences to the whole European market.
It is worth remembering that about 5-7% of the EU's GDP comes from the sale of goods or services that are protected by copyright and similar laws.
This fact illustrates even more how important is proper management of the relevant rights, as well as the need to strengthen their position in the current digital era.
While respecting the principles of competition, we should avoid reducing the income of composers, at the same time providing users of musical works with an EU-wide licence that corresponds to the business model of the future.
With this in mind the Commission should, as soon as possible, submit a proposal for an appropriate instrument that would be legally binding on entities working in this area.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the Members who spoke for their comments, which I will certainly convey to my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy.
If I can pick up on a number of points that have been raised: regarding the need for legislative intervention, let me say that the 2005 Commission recommendation on online music licensing has already brought about significant progress in the marketplace.
The recommendation has given collecting societies in Europe an incentive to set up EU-wide licensing platforms that make their repertoire available for online music shops across Europe.
Let me cite three relevant examples.
The UK and German societies have set up a platform for EU-wide licensing of the EMI repertoire, CELAS.
The UK and the Spanish societies are cooperating on a platform that will manage the Anglo-Hispanic repertoire at EU level, and the French and Spanish societies have announced a joint licensing platform that grants EU-wide access to the French-Hispanic repertoire.
In these circumstances, the Commission does not see the need for any premature legislative intervention.
I would also like to say that the 2005 Commission recommendation on online licensing has already brought about significant progress in the marketplace.
The recommendation has encouraged collecting societies in Europe to set up EU-wide licensing platforms that make their repertoire available for online music shops across Europe.
I refer to the three examples I have just mentioned.
The CELAS joint venture alone is in fact in a position to license approximately 25 % of all musical works to any European online music retailer, such as iTunes, Sony's CONNECT or eMusic, in a single transaction.
On the question of cultural diversity, let me state that our recommendation is not detrimental to cultural diversity.
There are clear indications that the new platforms for Anglo-American, French or Spanish music are open platforms.
These platforms can include other music publishers' repertoires or the entire repertoire of existing societies.
National collecting societies would not disappear; authors would still be members of local collecting societies and revenues would still be distributed through collecting societies affiliated to the new licensing platforms.
Regarding the issue of rights, I would like to underline that there is no reason to think that this multiterritorial licensing model is bad either for cultural diversity or for the rights of artists, while it is good for the rightholders, who get more money than under the old territorial model.
Cultural diversity and the rights of artists are also about giving authors more money so that they can continue to create.
Let me make one last point.
The Commission actively encourages the development of an own online licensing market for music.
In this vein, the Commission will closely monitor developments in this emerging market and, in doing so, the Commission will carefully consider the issues raised in the LÃ©vai report of 5 March 2007.
If, between now and 2010, we observe, for example, that monopolistic licensing structures are emerging on the Internet, that the repertoire available on the Internet does not adequately reflect Europe's cultural diversity and that the marketplace alone is not delivering EU licensing structures that are adapted to the Internet era, then the Commission will consider adequate alternative means for reaching those objectives.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 November in Brussels.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) The purpose of Mr Dumitrescu's question is to remind the Commission of its responsibilities. Through its recommendation of September 2005 and its decision to call into question the territorial competence of CRMs, the Commission has upset the relationship between rights-holders and national collecting societies - and this has happened outside the context of any legislation or harmonisation measures.
Under the guise of adaptation to the digital environment, the Commission has introduced confusion into the European system of author's rights and related rights.
That in turn has encouraged concentration and a format-based approach, to the detriment of artists and to the advantage of industrialists and other economic operators.
The Commission urgently needs to stop taking random initiatives without serious assessment of their impact; it needs to examine the situation in all the arts and cultural sectors, in conjunction with all the stakeholders, and to adopt a comprehensive policy that will reflect the requirements of cultural diversity, as well as Europe's values and the Lisbon Strategy objectives based on the knowledge and innovation economy; and it needs to present Parliament and the Council with coherent draft directives respecting the principles that I have mentioned.

Situations of fragility
The next item is the Commission statement on 'Towards an EU response to situations of fragility: engaging in difficult environments for sustainable development, stability and peace'.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, it is always very useful to be able to debate such an important issue in front of a heaving Chamber of colleagues who are agog to hear what Parliament has to say on this very important matter.
I am also very grateful to the Commissioner for having laid down the ground rules and his views on how we tackle this issue.
Fragility is a condition that has many, many parents.
The first of course is the process of decolonisation when the colonial powers drew arbitrary lines on maps, which cut across all sorts of internal stable civil society functions and split countries into two or three or four, irrespective of their tribes or religious factions and so on. That induced a certain amount of instability.
Then there is a natural form of instability that fragile nations now experience: countries which are prone to floods; small island states that are open to only a single economy product.
There are countries which are geographically unable to sustain themselves because of the way God has blessed them with very few attributes, countries which have desertification, starting to produce mass migrations of people.
There are 26 so-called fragile states in the world as we speak and the most vulnerable people in the world are facing catastrophic consequences, not through their own fault in some cases, but sometimes through bad governance, sometimes through internal conflict, sometimes through civil wars, sometimes through genocidal dictators as we found, not many years ago, in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
Now you can change a fragile state from being a fragile state to a post-fragile sustainable country, as we see happening in front of our eyes in Sierra Leone.
But this requires effort; it requires commitment; it requires a long-term commitment, as the Commissioner said, to that country's economic growth.
It requires a commitment of nation-building, an expression which I use advisedly in this Chamber because the concept of nation-building is something that my country, the United Kingdom, has long experience of, as have France and Spain and some other European countries.
But it is wholly and utterly away from the knowledge of other emerging superpowers who have not, to put it bluntly, a clue how to punch their way out of a paper bag in terms of nation-building.
We need to be able to connect ourselves with the body of historic knowledge that is reposited in the consciousness of European nations, to help other nations who are taking a lead around the world in the process of nation-building.
Had we done that, and had Prime Minister Blair done that, I think the situation in Iraq, for example, would have been completely different.
Is Iraq a fragile state?
Yes it is, because it is unstable; the governance is not secure; there are insecurity problems.
There are other countries in Africa which are very fragile - the Sudan, Somalia, small islands - as I said earlier all these require coming together with a body of knowledge that we already have and therefore I am very pleased indeed to be opening this debate this morning.
Thank you very much, Mr Deva.
I am afraid you forget one factor in instability.
When you arrive in those countries instability starts again.
Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak after hearing such remarkable experts and specialists, who have spent years grappling with this subject, and I include you among them, Madam President.
I would like to draw attention to the problem of the growing number of states recognised as unstable.
Over the course of six years this number has almost doubled, from 14 to 26, so this is a very real problem, and one that is an increasing challenge for the European Union.
I would like to stress that over half of these unstable states are in sub-Saharan Africa, which highlights the need for us to give particular attention to that region of Africa, that region of the world.
I also think that strong words need to be said about the need to build the authority of governments in these countries.
The African Union is right to point out that the problem of reconstruction is also a political issue, perhaps more so than a technical one.
In view of this, the mechanisms of democracy and transparency are fundamental issues.
I fully agree with Mr Hutchinson, who spoke before me, about the need to simplify procedures so that our aid might be more rapid and more real.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I also truly welcome the fact that this subject is being dealt with in this Chamber, because although it is true that there is not an exhaustive legislative definition of what a fragility state is, we do have many cases which, empirically, fall into that category.
This afternoon we are, for example, discussing among other matters the case of Somalia.
This resolution therefore enables us to tackle some of the more serious problems that have to be faced in those contexts - for example, the fact that this fragility is frequently based on a situation of extreme poverty that tends to bring with it institutional collapse and insecurity at all levels.
In addition, it is also crucial to start from the principle that these states present a challenge in terms of development, and this means that we urgently need to define a coherent agenda based on the humanitarian principle of do no harm.
This is the first principle, and it is an important lesson to learn from recent events regarding the approach taken by Zoe's Ark in Chad.
With regard to external action, in particular European action, in this type of context, this must be based on implementing programmes on the ground, which must be flexible and adaptable to changing needs and based on a strategy planned in the short, medium and long term.
All too often we stop at measures that may be necessary in the short term, but which fundamentally lose sight of the medium and long-term consequences.
Finally, I must mention the importance of establishing a dual mechanism of accountability, in particular including an obligation for the recipient countries to be accountable, naturally, to those who have provided resources, funds and donations, but also to their own populations, whom they should and must protect and ensure the survival of.
The donors should also guarantee that they are going to be accountable to these populations.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Madam President, there is no doubt that it is urgent to provide more and better humanitarian aid in an ever more unequal and unfair world where concentration of wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the exploitation and misery of millions.
There is no doubt that more and better cooperation for development is urgently needed in a world facing a new arms race and the increasing militarisation of international relations, led by the United States and its allies.
It is for that very reason that we are seriously concerned about the attempts to make development aid conditional on security strategies intended in practice to achieve more or less concealed objectives of interference, plundering of resources and neo-colonialism.
An analysis of the international situation must not leave out or underestimate the external causes fomenting and exacerbating the contradictions which are so often at the root of the problems.
We need only look at the very subjective list of what the World Bank considers to be fragile States.
How many instances of external interference and aggression does that reflect?
We do indeed need an agenda for cooperation and development to respond to the most basic needs of millions of human beings, based on respect for national sovereignty and independence and peaceful solutions to international conflicts - an agenda which encourages the demilitarisation of international relations, which promotes equitable and fair economic relations and the cancellation of foreign debt paid for long ago, an agenda which overcomes the policies which are causing the profound injustices and inequalities, in order to build a fairer, more peaceful, more humane world of greater solidarity.
In fragile states the link between governance, development and security is paramount.
The EU must determine strategic priorities for relations with those states with human security as the overall goal.
It is not enough to support government institutions.
It is essential to promote the strengthening of parliamentary scrutiny, to support free and pluralist media, the independence of the judiciary and the empowerment of civil society, giving priority to women, vulnerable groups and minorities.
That requires commitment on the part of the EU.
Somalia today tragically illustrates the aloofness of Europe.
The causes of fragility that stir up violent conflict, exacerbating the incapacity of the state - bad governance, extreme poverty or violations of human rights, for example - must be broached in bilateral dialogue and often the Council, Commission and Member States fail to do that.
The causes of fragility must be taken into account in defining strategies and in the globalisation of the EU's financial instruments.
Development aid must be focused on people and direct financial support for governments should be considered only when there is proof of commitment to resolving conflicts, to building the democratic rule of law and to improving governance and the human security of the peoples.
Finally, and unfortunately this aspect is omitted from the Commission's Communication and the resolution we are to vote on, the EU must invest more, alongside DDR and SSR programmes, in controlling global transfers of light weapons, since they fuel armed conflicts which perpetuate the fragility of many states.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the short but very comprehensive debate. Allow me to sum it up as follows: it basically reflected Parliament's support for the general position, for the Commission's general concept, for the general idea.
Of course some individual issues arose during the debate and these can be discussed in the course of future debates.
For example, there is the issue of light weapons transfers and many other ideas that, in my opinion, significantly enrich the general concept.
I have received a motion for a resolution submitted in accordance with Article 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Social reality stocktaking (debate)
The next item is the report by Elizabeth Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on social reality stocktaking.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs.
That a report of this scale has received no plenary amendments shows this is truly a report from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and one we can all be proud of.
I would also like to thank the Commission for its close cooperation and the Portuguese Presidency for making social policy a priority for its Presidency.
We face a huge challenge in Europe.
That challenge is one of fairness.
It is about lost potential, the inability to live a life free from the charity of others, and a life free from discrimination, poverty and social exclusion.
Our objective is clear: we want to expand opportunities so that nobody, whatever their background or circumstances, is left behind.
The vision of Europe must be freedom and opportunity for all, increasing opportunities and incentives to work, whilst strengthening the safety net for those who are unable to work.
In 2007 the facts are chilling: 72 million European citizens continue to live in poverty; 8 % of all people in the European Union now suffer from in-work poverty.
Those are truly shocking statistics.
But what do they actually mean?
They mean that one in six citizens is now living below the poverty line - one in six!
Many people would not believe that could be possible in 2007.
Fifty years after the Treaty of Rome, after 50 years of economic growth, 10 % of people belong to households where nobody has a job!
By any measure, poverty remains one of the greatest social problems challenging Europe, and reducing social exclusion must be at the heart of our policies.
In some areas we are succeeding, but we must be frank: in the majority we are not.
The gap between the rich and the poor in many EU Member States is increasing.
The elimination of income-related poverty must remain a priority for Member States but, for the one in six who live in financial poverty, there are many more who are excluded from society for other reasons.
We have to recognise that for many families - for many individuals even - there are problems more complicated than simply low income.
Barriers to opportunity are complex.
More than anything else, early intervention is crucial.
Prevention, of course, is better than cure.
In the UK, we know that the daughter of a teenage mother is three times as likely to become a teenage mother herself; we know that sons with a convicted father are over four times more at risk of being convicted of a crime than those without a convicted father.
Yet, in many areas, there is no need to reinvent the wheel.
We must look at how other EU countries deal with these issues and learn from them.
We must share best practice more effectively.
Finland, for instance, has introduced a holistic sustainable approach that has been incredibly effective in reducing the number of people who are homeless.
Denmark, meanwhile, is implementing new policies that improve the quality of life of long-term rough-sleepers, rather than having the sole aim of integrating those individuals into mainstream society.
In Belgium, people who have experienced poverty are working with social workers to help them better understand the needs of poor people.
It is not always unemployment that causes poverty: in-work poverty is a problem as well.
That is why I have called for an exchange of best practice on the provision of a decent working minimum wage throughout the Member States.
At least five EU Member States do not even have one.
Equally, we must push all Member States to adopt a minimum living income for all.
Member States must do more to prevent exploitation of vulnerable workers as well; to make sure that disabled and older people have a way into employment; to prevent trafficking; to safeguard the rights of asylum-seekers; to ensure equal access to healthcare and community services for all; to destigmatise people with mental health problems; and to promote a more constructive approach to drugs and alcohol.
These are but a few of the issues this report has addressed.
Europe's vision must be freedom and opportunity for all.
That is why it is so important to look at setting up mechanisms at a European level so that the exchange of best practice becomes a reality.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to start with I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, on her very interesting and comprehensive report.
I am pleased to see that the European Parliament has decided to address the fairly wide range of social issues covered by this report, issues that need to be solved urgently.
This report is a significant contribution towards social reality stocktaking on an ongoing basis.
This document comes at the time when the Commission and the Member States are examining the possibilities of strengthening the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy.
We must respond to our citizens' fears and we realise that social justice is one of the key problems for them.
Public opinion surveys show that the European Union should play a key role in supporting more integrated and cohesive societies.
As President Barroso said during a key debate on globalisation yesterday morning, the European Union has made significant progress in achieving the Lisbon goals.
New jobs are being created: 3.5 million new jobs were created last year alone.
The unemployment rate has fallen to approximately 7%. Although this rate is still too high, it is the lowest it has been in the last 10 years.
Economic growth has been satisfactory in spite of the recent financial instability.
However, there is no room for complacency.
Implementation of the Lisbon Strategy has been uneven and not all of its goals have been met.
Indeed, 12 million people are still unemployed, and these are often young people or long-term unemployed people with poor prospects for professional growth or social advancement; 8% of the European workforce suffers from in-work poverty; 78 million European citizens suffer from poverty and one in five European Union citizens suffers from inferior living conditions.
In short, more has to be done in order to meet our common social goals.
Now, at a time when we are seeing the positive results of the European Union's strategy in the area of growth and employment, it is the right time to begin to pursue social goals.
I welcome the reference in the report to the necessary political will and resolve to deal with issues of poverty and exclusion.
I, too, feel that it is urgent to tackle child poverty, combat discrimination and enhance diversity.
This of course means monitoring the transposition of the relevant legislation into national law and, if necessary, instituting proceedings against those Member States that have been found to infringe European Union legislation.
The report also looks at the barriers that prevent involvement in society and integration into the job market.
I agree that we have to combine supporting measures with suitable safety nets to ensure that no one is left out.
This attitude is reflected in the recent Commission communication on active inclusion. This communication defines three key elements of a balanced and strategic approach to active inclusion:
Access to integrated job markets;
Better access to services;
Adequate income support.
This communication also launches the second phase of consultation with the social partners on these issues with a view to stepping up European Union cooperation in the area of active inclusion.
Following this consultation, the Commission intends to draw up a recommendation on the common principles of active inclusion, which is scheduled for the second half of 2008.
In a further communication due to be adopted in the next few weeks the Commission will also present new measures to support the active inclusion of people with disabilities.
The Commission is grateful to the European Parliament for its persistent efforts to combat discrimination.
As stated in the Commission Legislative and Work Programme 2008, the Commission will present proposals in 2008 for solving the problem of the existing protection loophole under Article 13 of the Treaty.
The proposals, which should be adopted by next summer, will be based on long-term dialogue with the European Parliament, on experience from the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and on extensive public consultation.
The European Union has made significant progress in achieving gender equality, and the European Parliament has been an important partner in this process.
However, we have to continue to strengthen gender equality in the future.
This is a fundamental right, as well as a vital condition for achieving Europe's goals in the areas of growth, employment and social cohesion.
I therefore welcome in particular the report's reference to gender equality.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam the Union has made progress in all areas of gender equality, and since 2003 in the area of equal opportunities for disabled people.
That said, there is still a lot of work to be done in both areas.
The fact that multiple discrimination still persists is a strong argument in favour of continuously emphasising equal opportunities in all areas.
This topic will be dealt with in the Commission communication due to be adopted in 2008, which will be based on lessons taken from the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
Ladies and gentlemen, the changes in the EU's social situation naturally follow the development of our society and the changes in the global concept as a whole.
In spite of that, I am convinced that the fundamental concept, i.e. finding a balance between the economic and the social and ecological aspects, is still entirely valid.
Therefore, the onus is on us to continue to look for new approaches that will help us to overcome problems that still exist.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (SK) Although it is necessary to monitor the social situation and social policies in the Member States in order to identify the problems and challenges facing the Union, the actions we take to deal with them are even more important.
As regards public health, we should focus on the problems facing EU citizens in the area of health care.
Taking into account the demographic trends and the rising average life expectancy, we have to develop public health strategies that will improve our quality of life, with a view in particular to preventing diseases and combating them effectively.
At the same time these strategies should take into account the need for high-quality, accessible and reliable health care for citizens from all sections of society, irrespective of their social status, age or country of residence.
We should pay particular attention to the most disadvantaged groups, such as physically or mentally disabled people, the elderly and children.
In view of the rising costs of health care, the Member States should adopt effective measures, such as targeted information campaigns, the use of generic medicines, the use of new technologies, mutual assistance measures at local level or greater solidarity between generations and in families. In addition to that, and in cooperation with the Commission, the Member States should develop policies and support European initiatives to combat smoking, alcoholism and obesity, which will help to improve the quality of life of our fellow citizens.
Last but not least, we should focus on the effective implementation of the existing public health legislation.
The Member States and the Commission should ensure the application of the Community legislation on water, air and soil quality, and noise pollution, as well as the application of the regulations on chemical products, including those covered by REACH.
In this opinion the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality stresses that there are a number of dimensions to poverty and social exclusion but that the most important of these are the economic situation of families, housing conditions, and access to education, to health care and to long-term care.
The committee stresses that women and children are the main victims of poverty and social exclusion and points out that the risk is even greater in the case of immigrants, the elderly, the disabled and members of single-parent families.
It also notes that, on average, 15% of pupils drop out of the education system but that, in some countries, such as Portugal, this rate is as high as around 40%, which gives cause for concern as regards the education and training of young girls.
It stresses the importance of maintaining quality public services, a solid public and universal social security system and high levels of social protection and quality employment combined with rights and of ensuring effective gender mainstreaming in the formulation and implementation of such public policies; finally, it urges the Commission and the Member States to give maximum priority to women's social integration and women's rights, by altering their respective policies accordingly, including income distribution policy.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you very much, Madam President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lynne's report, on which I heartily congratulate her, clearly does not and cannot have the last word on the issue of social inclusion and the transformation of social policy.
We are often prone to think that the European social model is timeless, but social policy must clearly also change, not only through globalisation, but also through the economy, social expectations, the demographic challenge and changing values, since we must find suitable responses to the challenges we face.
For this reason too the Commission's initiative for preparing some sort of inventory of the social problems weighing on Europe's population is to be welcomed.
It is obvious that nearly 500 million Union citizens are not one homogenous mass.
Despite the fact that the differences in income between the old Member States are falling, the differences between the rich and poor regions are still demonstrating a growth trend.
Two thirds of the population of the ten new Member States of the EU live in poor regions where the level of income is half, or less than half, the average income of the old Member States.
The situation is even worse in Bulgaria and Romania, where the average income does not even reach one third of the per capita income of the old Member States.
There is no question that in order to fight poverty we need to know more about the different forms in which poverty manifests itself.
However, to do this we need new poverty indicators, since up to now we have only had comprehensive data on the risk of relative poverty.
For this reason, we are eagerly awaiting the Commission's communication in relation to this.
The report also draws attention to new risks of impoverishment.
For example, we know little about how dangerous are the proportions assumed by the population's debt.
Of the 15 old Member States, the per capita debt of the population in 12 Member States exceeds EUR 16 000, which accounts for 90% of the average annual family income.
Please allow me to say one last sentence, Madam President.
The report again points out the importance of fighting child poverty, and we consider this to be extremely important.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (CS) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Elizabeth Lynne for the very good report and for her excellent cooperation.
Social exclusion is caused by a wide range of factors, and it would be a great pity not to use this report for follow-up work.
In my speech I would like to stress the importance of public services and their contribution to eliminating poverty and exclusion.
Once privatised, public services will become more expensive and less accessible.
I regret that we have not managed to adopt the position condemning those states that introduce a low basic tax, and so make it impossible to accumulate enough funds to carry out the State's social tasks.
It would certainly be useful for the Member States to inform one another of their successes as part of the exchange of information on proven methods.
Of course I would also welcome the exchange of information on methods that did not pay off or even backfired.
I know that this is not being done but I am sure that it would be useful if the social partners and non-governmental organisations made it happen.
A fundamental precondition to ensuring that more and more citizens of the Member States do not find themselves dependent on often imperfect social welfare is the provision of an adequate number of reasonably well-paid jobs.
We cannot tolerate the fact that some people who work often depend on social welfare.
Consequently, we must seek to set up an adequate minimum wage in all Members States, either through legislation or through collective contracts, depending on the country's traditional method.
Efforts to adapt old age pension schemes are being stepped up.
When taking steps to preserve the fundamental pillar - the State old-age pension scheme - all Members States should respect the relevant International Labour Organisation conventions that they have ratified.
Integrating disabled people into the job market is particularly important. Therefore, we must look with a critical eye at the actions of those governments that have abolished various incentives for increasing the number of jobs for disabled people, and the Czech Republic is one of them.
Congratulations to my colleague Mrs Lynne on drawing up her report and on having achieved a political compromise that takes account of the opinions of the different political groups regarding the social realities within the Union.
It is true that the Member States' governments are directly responsible for reducing poverty.
It is their duty to take measures to ensure that people have jobs, children attend schools and the poorest people are given social assistance.
However, the Union's role in solving problems connected with poverty and inequality continues to be equally important.
The fact that 78 million European citizens live in poverty and the social divide between the poor and the rich is getting bigger and bigger is a most serious indication that action should be taken at both national and European level.
Most Member States have adequate minimum income rates.
However, there are still cases where the employers do not pay the established rates, thereby breaking the law.
As I have mentioned before on more than one occasion, Lithuanians working abroad happen to experience such unlawful treatment.
We should not tolerate employers carrying out such practices.
I welcome the Member States' response to the Council's call to reduce child poverty.
However, they have not yet drawn up their action plans for tackling the problem.
The disabled and elderly are particularly vulnerable.
We must make sure they have access to at least minimal long-term care at affordable prices.
The Social Fund has allocated resources for this.
It is a shame they remain unused in my country.
I do agree with the rapporteur's position on the necessity of sharing experience and following the successful examples of achievements in Social security.
It is necessary to learn from those Member States that are making efficient use of resources allocated by the EU, to share their experience.
Ladies and gentlemen, in order to gain our citizens' trust in the European Union, in its institutions, we must solve the most difficult problems they face.
In the speech he gave in this House, Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, said that the French feel that the EU does not care about them and does not provide social security.
French citizens have voted not against the Constitution, but against Europe, as they do not feel safe there.
The Commission has promised to prepare a report based on the social realities, with an analysis of social trends.
I do hope the main focus of this report will be the framework of actions, the framework that will define the methods of reducing or even abolishing poverty in Europe.
Then we will be able to win the support of our citizens and perhaps start to feel that we are working for them.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we have here before us a great many ideas on social policy, for which I thank Mrs Lynne.
As social policy does not carry as much weight in the EU as economic policy, this report is not EU stocktaking - as the title says - so much as a list of demands for sociopolitical measures in the Member States.
I have two comments to make.
Sociopolitical matters are within the competence of the Member States.
We at European level may only make recommendations.
Europe is in a state of imbalance because there has been economic but not social harmonisation.
Europe has not become more just since Lisbon 2000.
On the contrary, poverty is increasing.
To truly combat poverty and make it possible for all EU citizens to live with dignity and justice, we need not only economic, market and competition aspects but also a social, just, ecological internal market for all people.
Secondly: often it is a case of 'all talk, no action'.
We know what the problems are.
We do not really need studies and analyses.
It is time to take action at last.
It is not sufficient to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
We need an effective anti-poverty agenda, we need data - so that all people, including those who are unemployed, have sufficient basic income and can live in dignity.
This is a matter of justice and is a human right for all.
Madam President, Mrs Lynne, this is a good stocktake of the lack of social security under which far too many of the citizens in the Member States are forced to live.
The stocktake also shows the connection between poverty, overcrowding, social exclusion and increased ill health and shorter life expectancy.
The stocktake looks at the importance of the right to housing, work, social security and the rights of women and persons with disabilities.
It also shows that problem gambling, alcohol consumption, drugs and smoking increase social exclusion.
The conclusion is therefore that Member States must tackle these problems.
So far so good, but the reality is often quite different.
Often these are just fine words because the EU, through various directives and regulations, with reference to the rules of the single market and competition rules, often prevents Member States from solving problems.
In addition, we subsidise wine producers and tobacco growing.
The free movement of goods, for example, prevents Sweden from maintaining a restrictive alcohol policy, which is very important.
Sweden has a gambling monopoly to limit gambling, but the EU is threatening court action.
There is the same double dealing when it comes to the text of legislation on misleading advertising and on advertisements aimed at children, because the EU's other hand adopts TV directives with product placement and advertisements aimed at children.
It is possible to change the social reality but, in order to do so, public health concerns and environmental concerns must be given more importance than the competition rules of the single market, and social welfare and security must be given more importance than deregulation and privatisation.
The GUE/NGL Group is voting for the report and we will continue to do everything to improve social security for citizens.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President, when I initially heard about the process of social reality stocktaking, I was delighted that someone wanted to hold a real discussion on the state of society.
Unfortunately, upon reading the documents from the Commission, I was disappointed to find that the stocktaking process was not looking at social reality but at economic indicators.
I am not convinced that economic indicators are a reliable measure of social reality.
If they were, the improved economic status of Ireland over the last decades should be matched by improvements in social cohesion, rather than the rise in serious crime, addiction, suicide, alienation, family dysfunction, exclusion and loneliness that we actually see.
We would not just ask if a person is employed; we would ask if they are valued, connected and nourished physically, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually, and we would check whether the respect for this person extended to every person, regardless of age, size, ability, colour or any other characteristic.
To properly take stock of social reality, we would also look at the sustainability of the natural habitat of the human person: the family.
With this in mind, we would not just look at the gap between rich and poor, but the gap left by family breakdown and social isolation.
To understand social reality, we must start with the reality of the human person that makes up society.
I will give you just one example, and I hope it will illustrate the contradictory results we get if we look at the money and if we look at the man or woman.
We all agree that women should have the right to work and find equality when they do.
But when we exert economic pressure on women who would like to stay at home with a young baby to work rather than care for the child and push them into the workforce, we register a very high rate of employment and assume that this means a healthier social reality.
However, if we look at the baby, hardwired for immediate maternal input, and see the loss he or she suffers, which scientists tell us will be neurological and lifelong, then we have to question whether this high employment really translates as an indicator of a healthy social reality.
The irony of short-term thinking, of focusing exclusively on the economics of a society, is that it is the welfare of the people and the family at a human level that ultimately has the greatest impact on the economics.
Look at the cost of a troubled people to the exchequer.
Think of the cost of crime, drugs, dropping out, etc. Economic growth can be gobbled up by the growth of social problems.
The word 'economics' comes from the Greek for management of the home.
Economics should serve all people, helping them to be at home in their communities, at home in themselves.
If we get this right, we will have a very healthy social reality of which to take stock in the future.
(NL) Madam President, the report somewhat cryptically entitled 'Social reality stocktaking' was adopted almost unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - there was only one vote against - and in fact this should come as no surprise.
After all, the report's 97 recommendations amount to calls for assistance for everything and everyone: the poor, women, men, young people, the elderly, the unemployed, low-paid workers, the disabled, those who suffer discrimination, the sick, the healthy of today who may fall ill tomorrow, and so on and so forth.
I could say, with some irony, that the only group omitted from this report is those such as myself: heterosexual, middle-aged white men of right-wing political orientation.
Without irony, however, I would say that there is not a single person in this House who does not agree that the weaker members of our society are entitled to protection and that a civilised society can ultimately be judged on the degree of social protection it affords to people who, for objective reasons, find it difficult to play a normal part in society.
Therefore, you would have to be a bad person, as it were, not to support the catalogue of good intentions and social Santa Claus policy contained in this report.
Nevertheless, I shall not be endorsing this report.
The fact is that the list of recommendations contains a number of things I cannot support, particularly with regard to immigration policy, integration and diversity, and also the lack of essential protection of family policy.
The main reason I cannot endorse this report is much more fundamental, however.
Social policy and everything that can be subsumed under the heading 'social security' is an outstanding example of a domain of the Member States, and sometimes of their federal states - not of the European Union.
Unless someone in this House has a machine for producing money and resources from thin air, unless such a machine exists, social protection measures still have to be funded from taxpayers' money.
This means that choices have to be made and that, unfortunately, we cannot always play Santa Claus to everything and everyone.
There are essential decisions to be taken that are most fundamental to a whole society, and these decisions must be taken at the lowest possible level, as close as possible to citizens, and not in the ivory towers of Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg.
The experience in my home country, for example, has been that Flemings and Walloons make fundamentally different choices on such matters as health care and their approach to unemployment.
The Flemish and Walloon societies are different, their political and economic worlds are different, and therefore they opt for different approaches and priorities.
If this is true of Belgium today, how much truer is it, mutatis mutandis, of the very different Member States of the European Union, for example the United Kingdom and Romania?
It would be one thing if this report were only a catalogue of good intentions, but the European institutions have been intending to appropriate the field of social policy for years, and that is not a good thing.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to some of the speakers immediately before me, I believe the Commission is only to be congratulated on the communications on which this discussion is based.
They are not only a rich source for Member States seeking social facts and data but also, in my opinion, a sure sign that the EU and the Commission are serious about a stand-alone social policy.
If we declare our commitment to the European social model, in the sense of not only extolling it as a tradition and historical achievement, but also of making it into a trademark for a united Europe for the future, then a stocktake of our social reality is a basic prerequisite.
Particularly as a result of the enlargement rounds of 2004 and 2007, we must finally distance ourselves from the view that European social policy is an adjunct to the internal market.
However, this is not entirely self-evident, for in many areas the dominance of economic policy in Commission proposals is, unfortunately, conspicuous.
In this connection, I would remind the House of the Green Paper on 'Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century' and the flexicurity debate.
The former was shelved by the Commission yesterday, news I can only welcome wholeheartedly while recommending the same course for the flexicurity proposals, which are directed at hard-won employees' rights in the employment relationship.
All the points addressed in this report - many thanks to Mrs Lynne - are highly topical.
I am thinking of the minimum-wage debate in my country and the wage claims that are supported by the current strikes on the French and German railways.
When it comes to wages policy, we are right in saying that a full-time job must provide a living for the man or woman who does it.
Anything else falls short of the Christian responsibility of employers for their employees.
Work must be worthwhile - that must be the basic principle.
What always upsets me is child poverty, which I lament even in my own country.
I believe we must pay special attention to this.
It should not exist.
Actually, I should like to see rapid efforts in the Member States making it redundant for us to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to begin by thanking Mrs Lynne for an excellent job and an excellent report.
I was myself invited to the conference in the Azores where we, the Commission and Parliament, together had a dialogue with civil society concerning these issues.
I would also like to commend the Commission for taking these issues seriously through its new communication on social exclusion and by presenting a recommendation next year which takes up these issues.
It is precisely as Mr Å pidla says, the situation in Europe is generally very good with increased growth and more jobs, but at the same time the gulfs are increasing.
The gulfs are increasing and poverty is increasing.
There are big differences between Member States.
In a number of countries the differences are extremely large, and I am not just talking about new and old Member States - there are new Member States with small gulfs and old Member States with large gulfs.
We must deal with this.
I think the Commission's strategy with three pillars is very good.
When it comes to work, jobs are not enough, because there are also bad jobs from which it is not possible to support oneself and which are not empowering.
We must have good jobs which pay decent wages.
We on the Committee looked at the situation regarding minimum incomes and saw big differences between Member States.
We need an exchange of experience here to find best practice.
Then there are the public services to which everyone must have access: social services, housing, health care and so on. The methods are the open method of coordination which we shall strengthen.
I would also like to mention, before I finish my remarks, that today we are going to vote on Parliament's position on, among other things, the forthcoming Integrated Guidelines.
We must also include the social dimension in the Integrated Guidelines in order to combine growth issues and employment issues with a social dimension so that we see these issues not in isolation from each other, but as a whole.
(ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mrs Lynne for raising a very important matter. I welcome the report's aim, namely to focus various stakeholders' attention on discussing what constitutes Europe's social reality.
This is a wide-ranging topic and for that reason I can dwell only on a couple of crucial points.
At the Nice Summit in 2000, the Member States undertook to bring about a significant, measurable reduction in poverty and social exclusion by 2010.
Regrettably, action on that objective has not been particularly successful.
An open Europe based on free movement and free trade has contributed to the economic progress on which people's well-being and a better quality of life depend.
It has, however, become clear over the last few years that for many Europeans it is a matter for debate whether the net effect of globalisation, liberalisation and greater competition does anything to improve their well-being.
Today, in the 21st century, the level of poverty and social exclusion in Europe are worryingly high.
Mr Å pidla recently said that about 20%, in other words one in five of our citizens, is in danger of falling into poverty.
All the Member States have social services and social benefits, yet even after receiving them one sixth of people live in poverty.
Have we asked ourselves why this is the way things are in a Union which was not forcibly brought together?
Why now, 62 years after the end of the war and 50 years since the Union came into being, have we been unable to guarantee people's basic rights?
My question is: is a successful economy an end in itself or should it be a means of improving people's well-being?
Furthermore, by providing social aid the Member States are committed to providing benefits equivalent to the minimum amount needed on which to live; to providing aid sufficient to fulfil this objective.
We do not need to formally transpose reams of directives - there lies no more than self-delusion.
This raises the question as to whether timely implementation of adopted texts is guaranteed at the level of the European Union institutions, including in the 'soft policy areas'.
In Europe we should not focus solely on economic results and competition; we should also consider establishing greater social solidarity and sustainable social measures.
And where we have adopted a decision to that end, we must also see to it that it is implemented.
Our citizens expect that much of us.
- (PL) Mr President, unfortunately economic development, which we all crave so much, is accompanied by an increase in income stratification, which weakens social cohesion and creates serious problems where the weaker groups are concerned - those affected by unemployment, those receiving a low wage or those who have difficulty accessing education and health care.
The tasks adopted at the Nice European Council have been carried out inadequately.
There are still groups of people whose income is below the minimum needed to survive.
Lack of economic independence also interferes with people's sense of dignity.
A general ban on discrimination, and a guarantee of equal opportunities, chiefly for disabled people, are obviously needed, but they do mean a rise in expenditure on social aims.
Our populations are ageing, which gives rise to fears about the financial capacity of pension insurance systems.
I congratulate Mrs Lynne on an excellent report, which draws attention to these and other important social problems in our countries and also to methods that could be used to deal with them.
I most definitely support this draft.
I would, however, like to draw attention to a contradiction in the European Union's approach to social and economic problems.
The pressure to restrict expenditure on social aims prevents numerous social problems from being dealt with. One example that could be quoted is the reform of the pensions system in Poland.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not alone in congratulating Elizabeth Lynne on her report, partly because I know that in taking stock of everything that is socially flawed in Europe, she found so many things that were wrong that parliamentary officials were forced to drag her away from her desk so that she could be here with us this morning, and she still had not finished.
It is true that there is much poverty in Europe.
When I came in and saw my colleague Fernando FernÃ¡ndez, I remembered what he said in Puebla, Mexico, a few years ago, when we were both attending a conference on world poverty.
He said then that poverty can be predominantly blamed on bad government, which exists all over the world.
Therefore, those responsible for poverty are first and foremost national governments, and not the European Union.
This is a call for national governments, who expect and demand so much from Europe but do so little themselves, especially where it is most needed, to accept responsibility.
I also met a friend of mine, Mr von Wogau, as I came into Parliament, and he asked me whether it was true that in Italy, the state pension for a widow or for someone is completely incapacitated is EUR 50 a month for life.
Mr President, I had to tell him that unfortunately this is true.
For this reason, as the only elected representative of pensioners in this Parliament, I say yes to a minimum wage for anyone lucky enough to work, I say yes to a minimum pension in Europe for all old-age pensioners and I say yes to anyone who is unemployed, out of work or without a pension, that they too should also be entitled to receive a minimum income.
(DE) Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, I am much obliged to the Commission for the initiatives and to Mrs Lynne for her most excellent report.
Anyone who wants to combat poverty - as Mr Fatuzzo has already said - must really focus more intensely on the older generation.
We must stay abreast of demographic changes and also ensure, despite steadily rising costs in the health system, that it will be just as possible to age with dignity in the future.
Older people have just as much right to comprehensive, quality-assured health care and long-term care regardless of their income or where they live.
We urgently need a targeted exchange of experience amongst Member States as to how best to organise and secure high-quality, affordable care.
In particular, we must take into account the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from dementia.
However, to do this, we need sound data; that is also why we are asking the Commission to provide us with these data as quickly as possible.
In a social Europe, all patients must have equal access to evidence-based medicines and medical products.
It is simply unacceptable that the very same antibiotic costs EUR 3 in Belgium and EUR 34 in Germany, for example.
Therefore I am glad that, with this report, we are calling for the Commission and the Member States to enter into intensive dialogue with us, and with the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups, in order to develop balanced guidelines for greater transparency as far as the effectiveness and price of medicines are concerned.
This is another contribution to reducing the costs of health care for us all.
- (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too congratulate you on your two communications and I hope that you will continue with your constructive proposals.
My colleague, Mrs Lynne, with her sensitive approach to social issues, and all of us with our amendments, have been involved in all the OMC actions included in the national action plans.
The report on social reality stocktaking will give direction to the social policy of the Member States.
It should take account of the fact that in Europe today there are serious demographic problems directly affecting social cohesion and solidarity between the generations.
The family is still not taken into account by Member States in terms of the support it should be given, although it forms the basis of society.
Poverty is increasing, in single-parent families as well as in large families, not only because of lack of income, but also because of a lack of social support and equal treatment, especially in taxation.
Families' living conditions directly affect children, especially in the more vulnerable categories.
Inequality of access to resources and opportunities is growing, limiting both personal development and the future economic development and cohesion of Europe.
Would the EU, for each child born there, not be able to guarantee an income to cover those children's living expenses and upbringing, equivalent to the per-capita income of each Member State?
Policy on the promotion of social cohesion must be based on participation in the employment market.
It must also contribute to the social integration of individuals not in employment and those offering informal services within the family.
For this reason, the Member States are called up on primarily to investigate ways of recognising the unofficial skills acquired when caring for children and dependent persons, such as preliminary training and work experience.
This will facilitate their integration into the employment market and provide pension and insurance rights.
Solidarity between the generations must be maintained by making use of the knowledge and experience of older people and through its dissemination and use by younger generations.
The Member States are called upon to promote systems for the exchange of services between the generations and to invest in voluntary schemes, whether of an educational, cultural or business nature.
This will be achieved by creating suitable infrastructures and providing information on increased opportunities for older people to participate in such activities, so that they do not become marginalised or fall victim to social exclusion.
(ES) Mr President, Mrs Lynne, Commissioner, thank you very much for offering us this communication and this document, which are undoubtedly going to enable us to improve our knowledge of changes and trends, and the agenda that we need to have for the future.
We should not, however, make a mistake.
We have many documents, we have many analyses, we have many debates and we have many words, but here, as for diseases, we need not only a diagnosis but also treatment.
It is true, as you said, Commissioner, that we need European treatment, through the Union, its institutions and its mechanisms, in order to respond to the problems of today and tomorrow, taking into account that if we do not do it at Union level it will be impossible to do it solely at the level of the Member States.
Some Member States that are making fast progress, such as mine, are beginning to be threatened by policies that are seeking to slow down, or, in other Member States, to establish unfair competition with the supply and social change that is taking place in our countries.
Commissioner, please take account of the fact that the feeling is beginning to spread that European social policy, which in the 1960s and 1970s, as a Spanish trade unionist said to me in a letter today, was aimed at harmonising progress, and in the 1980s and 1990s limited itself to ensuring minimum requirements, is now beginning to slide towards a social policy in which there is competition between the Member States to achieve the lowest common denominator.
Commissioner, the risks that we face for the future include not only ageing and globalisation, but also the contagious lack of solidarity and aggressive, xenophobic and anti-European nationalism that is threatening both Europe's current social victories and its future ones.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my voice sincerely to the thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lynne.
Social protection and social inclusion help to combat poverty and exclusion in preventive health care and many other areas, and are among the most important challenges for the future.
The term 'minimum income' is often discussed in different ways in the Member State that I come from.
However, I fully support Mrs Stauner's approach with regard to jobs, full-time working and income.
The social partnership is strongly established in Austria, which gives us a great opportunity, indeed one that is used in attempts to find a solution with the agreement of all those involved.
This means we do not have as many strikes as in other EU states, where these are frequently the order of the day.
This is precisely why a regulation at EU level must be approached very carefully.
The different national social welfare systems mean that we must proceed very judiciously with any harmonisation.
Our concern must be to offer social protection to all employees and to enable their social inclusion.
Naturally, it must also be possible, within the framework of subsidiarity, that Member States should, must and can have higher standards.
Mr President, the social reality of Europe is that poverty is rife.
Seventy-two million men, women and children are below the poverty line, many are homeless and many disabled or confined to their homes because of lack of services.
Many people are trapped in poverty by inflexible welfare rules.
I am afraid that communications and guidelines will not solve these issues.
While I do not underestimate the difficulties faced by Commissioner Å pidla, we need to establish legal obligations on Member States to achieve the necessary changes.
Working people are seeing their pensions devalued and their job security undermined, and many fear the race to the bottom.
The problem is that inequality is built into many Member States' economic models.
For many of them, including Ireland, the attitude is 'Let us create the wealth. Then we will sort out the social problems'.
This is to ignore the reality that social inequalities are a brake on economic progress and that we cannot have long-term sustainable prosperity for everyone if we treat social policy as an afterthought and fail to avail of the wasted talent of 72 million people, not to mention the human misery that hides behind that statistic.
(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European societies are undergoing dramatic changes in relation to the nature of work and family life, the social status of women and social mobility.
Social values are changing and societies are becoming more and more multicultural.
The current developments have expanded people's horizons and given them more options when making decisions about their lives.
Although the Member States of the European Union are among the richest countries in the world, new types of poverty and inequality are still emerging.
Tens of millions of European citizens continue to live in poverty.
Social inclusion and social protection are basic values of the European Union and fundamental rights for all individuals. However, the Member States must step up their efforts to combat child poverty.
Unless there are significant improvements in the inclusion of children from disadvantaged social groups even at pre-primary level, the number of pupils who drop out of school early will not decrease; nor will we be able to increase the number of people completing secondary school and thus gaining key skills.
An increasing number of citizens will have to cope with social exclusion, unemployment and other socially undesirable phenomena that are harmful to themselves as well as to the economy and society.
From this point of view, it is also crucial to combat youth unemployment.
It is important to remove the obstacles in some professional training programmes so that they are more flexible and effective and reflect the needs of the labour market.
This will significantly improve the opportunities for disadvantaged people to assert themselves.
Strengthening social cohesion and eradicating poverty and social exclusion must be political priorities for the European Union and its Member States.
Mr President, I welcome this debate and report on social reality and, though we must of course welcome stocktaking and exchanges of best practice and the open method of coordination, the reality that we have to understand is that these devices have not yet stopped: women having 24 % less pay compared to men in Germany; nearly one in three children living in poverty in Poland; and wealth inequality in my own country, the United Kingdom, at a 40-year high.
I do think that European social funding and national programmes like the New Deal in the UK are essential active labour market measures to tackle the real barriers which prevent groups in our society from progressing from worklessness to work and that work is still one of the best devices for us to combat poverty.
I do thank Commissioner Å pidla for putting a firm commitment in the Commission's work programme for new legislation on Article 13 discrimination, which I have long discussed with him.
I and this Parliament look forward to working with him on the detail, not least in the Presidency conference next week.
But all of us - he and us together - must guard against this talk on stocktaking delaying the new social agenda in Europe, or deregulation in one area actually leading to increases in inequality and injustice, not combating these evils.
Trade unionists, social NGOs and of course disabled people, with whom I have worked for more than 20 years, are sceptical about what we are doing for social Europe.
We have to listen to their concerns and we have to respond to them.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, this debate has been extremely comprehensive and detailed.
It would be very difficult to give a detailed answer to the individual comments, so allow me to provide a brief summary in response.
First of all, it seems to me that the debate has clearly shown that Parliament's welcomes the idea of social reality stocktaking, and though I agree with Mr Cercas that diagnosis is not the same as therapy, I am also of the opinion that no therapy is possible without diagnosis.
Our society is constantly changing and we have to find new methods to adapt to it or reform the old methods.
For this to be effective, we need to understand the global picture.
I think that the debate has another common denominator, and that is that although the social reality has its own dynamism to some extent, we also have our own values: a general European concept of a European social model that encompasses social inclusion and social protection and activity in general.
It is therefore not acceptable in our model of thinking and acting to adopt a passive view.
There is always the possibility of trying out active politics and active intervention.
There is also a third idea that I would like to stress.
There is no doubt that, like most policies, the majority of European decisions also comply with the principle of subsidiarity, according to which the policies to solve a given problem are dealt with in the best and most effective manner.
This means that there is no doubt in relation to the position of the Member States on social policy.
On the other hand, the debate also clearly shows that the goal cannot be reached at Member State level alone, without efforts at European level.
It is therefore our duty to find the most advantageous and effective synergy in this area.
The debate brought to light a concern that I also share to some extent: a concern that there is a risk that inequality and the incompatibility of the social policies in individual Member States may lead to competition that possibly lowers social standards.
The European Commission does not want to open this door.
Our fundamental concept is to make individual European social policies compatible in such a way that will ensure competition and development from the bottom up, with a view to progress that always includes a social dimension.
Ladies and gentlemen, the debate also clearly shows that social and economic policies cannot be designed on an 'either/or' basis. The only possibility is 'not only/but also', which means the balanced development of both policies together, without making giving preference to one over the other.
The usual trend is to give priority to the economic policy.
However, I could see clearly from the debate that this approach is not favoured by the European Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, you mentioned a wide range of individual problems, notably the issue of the health service, including access to medicines and its overall organisation.
You discussed the effects of demographic ageing and the importance of services of general interest.
I am glad that all these views are represented in the European Commission's strategic documents.
We aim to integrate them into a general global strategy.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me in conclusion to express my thanks to Mrs Lynne, whose report, which is currently being discussed here, is without doubt an important element of the global effort to ensure progress across the European Union.
Thank you, Commissioner.
As President I would also like to congratulate Mrs Lynne on a report that has had a huge impact among civil society.
I have been a privileged witness to how the convoys of young people standing against poverty and for inclusion, who travelled across Europe, took Mrs Lynne's document and went from city to city, from European capital to European capital, honouring the European Parliament, thanks to the work of our colleague.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.35 and resumed at 12 noon)
(ES) Mr President, I would like to ask you, along with Mrs Mann, who cannot be here today with us in Parliament, and other colleagues, to pass on the solidarity of the citizens of the European Union that our Parliament represents with the victims of the tropical storm, which then turned into a Christmas hurricane, which has devastated Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Cuba, Barbados and other areas of the Caribbean, leaving a trail of destruction, disease and death.
Also, Mr President, please express our solidarity with the victims of the floods in the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and also, above all, Tabasco.
I would like to ask you, Mr President, not only to pass on our solidarity but also to urge the European Commission to mobilise the tools at its disposal to alleviate this situation and remedy the damage, which always affects the most disadvantaged areas.
Thank you very much, Mr Salafranca.
As far as this relates to Parliament, we shall proceed in this manner, and we shall also pass your thoughts on to the Commission.

Regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding (vote)
- Leinen report
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, last Friday, the Council accepted the essential content of this Regulation on the funding of parties and foundations at European level.
In addition, this morning, a trialogue took place with the Commission and the Council, and we reached agreement on the questions that remained to be settled.
Therefore, there is a realistic chance of adopting this project at first reading and creating the prerequisites for better financing even for 2008.
I therefore suggest that we postpone the vote until 29 November, at the next plenary, in Brussels.
(Parliament approved the proposal)

The European Interest: succeeding in the age of globalisation (vote)
- Joint motion for a resolution:
- Before the vote on the heading above paragraph 1:
on behalf of the ALDE group. - I would like to suggest changing the heading of the first part to read: 'External Lisbon dimension'.
That is to say, to change 'External policies' to 'External Lisbon dimension'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraph 5:
(DE) Mr President, due to the withdrawal of an oral amendment to paragraph 5, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to vote 'no', contrary to what is stated in its lists.
- Before the vote on paragraph 14:
(DE) Mr President, there are Members who have a problem with the central section, the part from 'points out that one' to 'domestic demand'.
In agreement with Mr Caspary from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I therefore suggest adding the words 'in some Member States' after 'European economy', and I hope that this will deal with the problems with the central section.
I believe this could also be of assistance to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraph 30:
(DE) Mr President, there is no objection to postponing the text, but I would still ask that we hold a vote on it.
If Parliament votes in favour of the text, the text belongs elsewhere, but it could be that it is not endorsed, which is why I am asking for a vote on the original text.
There has been no request for a split vote.
- After the final vote:
(SV) Mr President, Parliament has now voted in favour of updating and amending the Integrated Guidelines.
This concerns, for example, the social dimension.
So far the Commission has chosen not to pay attention to this.
I would like to hear Mr Å pidla's comments on the decision which Parliament has now taken and whether he is going to push the issue of updated and amended Integrated Guidelines within the Commission.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) The decision taken by Parliament has a certain weight and the Commission must take it into account when preparing further documentation.
Therefore, Parliament's vote naturally carries the appropriate weight and the issue of the Integrated Guidelines was fundamental in the debate we held with Parliament.
We interpret 'certain weight' to mean 'great weight' and recommend that the Commission adopt our assessment.

Application of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their families to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (vote)
Joint motion for a resolution:
- Before the vote:
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to Rules 19 and 166 of the Rules of Procedure.
Before Parliament votes on the joint motion for a resolution by certain groups on freedom of movement, I would like to condemn most firmly on behalf of my group the personal attack in paragraph 13 thereof on the Vice-President of the Commission, Franco Frattini.
I wish to denounce a politically undignified manoeuvre by the Italian Socialists, taken up by certain of my fellow Members, which is unworthy of the challenges we face.
More serious still, this untruthful distortion of Mr Frattini's comments, which our institution must reject, will mean we cannot make a composed decision.
If our group were to vote against this resolution because of this manoeuvre, this would not in any way diminish our support for all the Romanian and other EU nationals who obey the law and respect their host country.
Europe is founded on the rule of law, something we reaffirm in the resolution my group has signed on the joint initiative of our Italian and Romanian colleagues.
The question of freedom of movement is not just a national matter, but a European one.
It is not a case of settling political scores, but a question of values, ladies and gentlemen.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we held an extensive debate in this Chamber in which Commissioner Frattini took part.
The Commissioner responded very moderately in his own comments and in his answers to speeches from various Members.
The resolution criticises only one point; that is, that it can be proved that Commissioner Frattini gave the public incorrect information on a specific point of European law.
The fact that our resolution corrects this and also clarifies that the Commissioner responsible for the legal protection of the citizens of Europe made an incorrect statement in public on an essential question of citizens' rights is the duty of this Parliament and has nothing to do with any conspiracy theories.
However, we know very well, Mr Daul, that you are a pitiful Member, because you were pressured by Forza Italia to make that statement.
That is all there is to be said on the matter.
(Applause from the left)
We do not want to conduct a debate here now.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we should comment on the statement by the chairman, Mr Daul, separately.
This Parliament will express itself with a majority and has every right to criticise or censure the Commissioners.
It is the sovereign right of this Parliament.
If we did what we did, it was because Mr Frattini misinterpreted Community law, and although it is difficult to make myself heard above all this shouting, I would like to repeat that we are acting here as MEPs towards a European Commissioner and we will continue to do so!
(Applause from the left)
Please could we be a little less emotional in dealing with this matter.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on a point of order.
Independently of any party political debate, it is highly unwise of Commissioners to get involved in party political matters in their own countries or in anybody else's country.
I think it is not unreasonable that this House should remind the Commission of its duties in this regard.
(Applause from the left)
I now have three more speeches and then we shall close this short debate.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I think I do not need to add much to what Monica Frassoni, Graham Watson and Martin Schulz have said.
I would simply like to say this: it would be sensible, when any Commissioner has his words challenged by four groups who are not all from the same half of the Chamber, for him to reflect on what he should avoid doing again if he wants to have Parliament's trust.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Rules 151 and 19 of the Rules of Procedure, I ask you to assess the admissibility of paragraph 13, which contains an unmotivated and unfounded personal attack on the Vice-President of the Commission.
This is a text which, if approved, after the statements by the spokesperson of the Commission President defending Mr Frattini, would cause an unseemly conflict between Parliament and the Commission for internal political reasons.
Therefore, I ask you to put the text of the motion to the vote without paragraph 13 and at the same time I ask the authors to retract the text via an oral amendment.
- Before the vote on paragraph 1:
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add the following oral amendment: 'Expresses its deep regret at the murder of Ms. Giovanna Reggiani in Rome on 31 October 2007, and sends its sincere condolences to her family'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraph 13:
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add the following amendment: 'Considers education and the fight against school drop-out within Roma communities to be one of the fundamental tools for combating social exclusion, exploitation and crime'.
(The oral amendment was not accepted)
- Before the vote on Recital F:
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, considering the importance of the conditions set forth in Articles 5, 6, 7 and 8 of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of entry and residence.
(The oral amendment was not accepted)

Application of the Schengen acquis (vote)
Motion for a resolution:

Pakistan (vote)
Joint motion for a resolution:
- Before the vote on paragraph 1:
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I led negotiations on this compromise text.
I recognise that it is a sensitive issue and it is important that we all recognise the situation in Pakistan.
I think the whole House will want to send a strong, unified message to General Musharraf.
In the spirit of compromise and, I hope, to win the support of the whole House, I would like to propose the following oral amendment.
In recital A, we refer to President Musharraf 'suspending the Constitution and the rule of law and replacing them with martial law'.
I would like to propose that we say that he has replaced them 'by the state of emergency, de facto martial law'.
Then, in line with the suggestions made by other colleagues, in three other places, paragraphs 1, 10 and 11, we should replace 'martial law' with 'the state of emergency'.
I hope that will command the full support of the House.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
9.
Bali Conference on Climate Change (vote)
Motion for a resolution:
- Before the vote:
(FI) Mr President, I would just like to say that one important point in the Finnish version of this resolution has been translated wrongly.
In section 1, which concerns the Bali negotiating mandate, there is a misunderstanding in the Finnish, which suggests that this resolution would be dealing with the EU's internal negotiating mandate before the Bali Conference.
In fact, the Bali mandate means that at the Bali Conference the countries which have ratified the climate treaty will try to obtain a negotiating mandate to make it possible to establish the next climate treaty.
In other words, the Finnish text in section 1 which says 'to agree on a negotiating mandate for the conference' should say 'on a negotiating mandate for a treaty at this conference'.
- After the vote:
Mr President, I should be recorded as voting against Amendment 7.
I am afraid the wrong light came on when I pressed the button.
It should have been a vote against.
This does not change the result of the vote, but it is a sensitive issue for me.
I would therefore ask that my vote be recorded as a vote against.
It will be noted as you have said.
10.
Strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy (vote)
Obiols i GermÃ  and Tannock report
- Before the vote on paragraph 14/2:
(FR) Mr President, excuse me, I would just like to make it clear that the deletion of the term 'readmission agreements' only concerns the first section of paragraph 14, to remove any ambiguity over the interpretation of the vote.
- Before the vote on Amendment 3:
rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to add for paragraph 19a the following wording: 'underlines the need to involve and work together with the EEA countries (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein) and Switzerland and to make full use of their experience of working with the European Union'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraph 42:
rapporteur. - Mr President, this is just to confirm that the oral amendment is to delete the paragraph, so that should be taken first, before Amendment 13, which means that the order of voting in the list needs to be changed.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
11.
Trade and economic relations with Ukraine (vote)
Zaleski report
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, before the vote I, together with my colleagues from the Committee on International Trade, should like to say thank you for the successful work that has been done, which allows us to save time due to the absence of amendments.
This report should send a clear signal to the new government and the parliament in Ukraine that, for our part, we have done everything necessary to ensure that the negotiations for the free-trade area can take place.
We are trusting partners in this dialogue.
If there is a representative from Ukraine here today, please would he or she tell the national parliament that the European Parliament recommends voting without delay on the application by Ukraine for accession to the WTO, and ratifying this accession as soon as a decision has been made in Geneva.
For the mutual benefit of both the EU and Ukraine, I would ask you all now please to support this report.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Mr Zaleski, if I were allowed to congratulate you on how well you express yourself in my own language, I would do so.

Social reality stocktaking (vote)

rapporteur. - I propose that the word 'women' be changed to 'individuals' in paragraph 9.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
Voting time
The next item is voting time.
(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
The next item is the explanations of vote.
in writing. - (PL) Mr Leinen's report specifically states that the most significant innovation in the Commission proposal is to make it possible to fund not only European political parties, but also affiliated political foundations at European level from the Union budget.
I agree that the proposed regulation will improve the financial stability of European political parties and the funding of their election campaigns in the European Parliament elections in 2009.
(SK) A year ago it still looked like the date for the enlargement of the Schengen area would be postponed until 2009.
I am glad that we have all stepped up our efforts and found a constructive solution to make the free movement of people without passport controls a reality.
I thus welcome the report by Mr Carlos Coelho confirming the accession of nine new Member States to the Schengen area.
I believe that the free movement of people without passport controls is a real success story of European integration, which is why I was happy to vote for this report.
The accession of the new Member States, including Slovakia, to the Schengen area, says clearly to the people of Europe that the Iron Curtain, built by the totalitarian Communist regimes between Western and Eastern Europe, will be consigned to the history books after 21 December 2007.
For me, the vote on this report is a historic event since it is taking place in the same week as the Slovak and Czech Republics will commemorate - on 17 November - the 18th anniversary of the fall of the totalitarian regime that used to prevent citizens from travelling around Europe.
I believe that all European citizens will welcome this Christmas present.
(NL) Mr President, I voted against the Coelho report primarily to draw attention to the numerous problems with the open-border policy of the Schengen Agreement.
After all, the Schengen system stands or falls by a strict, watertight control of its external borders on the one hand - which, to be perfectly clear, is not taking place - and by a rigorous approach to crime in all Member States, coordinated in all Member States, on the other - which is found far too rarely.
Finally, all Schengen countries must also conduct a strict immigration policy, something that is completely at variance with, for example, the waves of mass legalisation seen in quite a few Member States in recent years.
In these circumstances, as an individual and as a politician, I cannot rejoice at no longer having to pass through border controls at internal borders, since criminals and illegal immigrants do not have to do so either, and that is pernicious to our society.
(CS) Mr President, allow me to speak about the report by my colleague Mr Carlos Coelho on the draft Council decision on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the nine Member States that joined the EU in 2004.
I personally believe that this decision is absolutely vital.
The accession of our countries, including my home country, the Czech Republic, should not be postponed under any circumstances.
All the analyses to date objectively state that all these countries are adequately prepared for the enlargement of the Schengen area.
Thanks to an incredible effort by the relevant Members States, the many experts involved in the inspections, the police, judicial authorities, officials and others, today these Member States are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner.
I therefore assume that the Justice and Home Affairs Council will also express its support for this decision on 6-7 December this year.
The symbolic importance of the elimination of the internal borders that our citizens associate with joining the Schengen area will go down in history and can only be compared with the fall of the Iron Curtain almost 20 years ago.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that - in spite of the technical problem - we all joined together to vote on the report confirming that the new Member States, including the Czech Republic, will be ready to join the Schengen area as early as 2008.
I appreciate the effort and openness of the Member States and the Commission during the intense technical consultations required prior to the enlargement.
The enlarged Schengen area will no doubt present greater challenges for Europe's internal security, but on the other hand, and I would like to emphasise this, it is the culmination of the efforts to achieve free movement in a truly integrated area.
Next year Europe will be united as it has never been before.
The Iron Curtain is definitely gone and I thank you for that.
- (PL) Mr President, Poland's accession to the Schengen area brings with it not only potential benefits linked to convenience in crossing borders, but also threats.
One negative phenomenon that Poland has already been experiencing for a number of years is the difficulties encountered by citizens of our eastern neighbours in entering our country, including Poles living in Belarus and Ukraine.
A lack of border controls may lead to many negative phenomena associated with criminality and illegal immigration.
We are also concerned about action taken to remove national border controls in Member States in favour of pan-European EU border services.
That is why I abstained from voting on this matter.
in writing. - (PT) As we have long argued, we consider that the areas of Justice and Home Affairs are central competences of States, particularly of the Portuguese State.
We therefore oppose their progressive transfer to the supranational institutions of the EU in a process that justifies every new 'advance' on the basis of the previous 'advance'.
Such is the case with the creation of the 'Schengen area' with its Schengen acquis, which serves as a catalyst for the communitarisation of policies or measures linked to border control - visas, asylum or immigration - or police and judicial mechanisms.
All the more so when such 'communitarisation' happens in a framework in which the major EU powers, in concert, make sure that the decision-making process gives them the possibility of defending and safeguarding their interests, which is not the case for Portugal.
As we have stated, essential international and European cooperation between sovereign States with equal rights concerning these matters is one thing, but the unacceptable handing over of fundamental elements for the safeguarding of national sovereignty and democracy to supranational institutions dominated by the major EU powers to create 'Fortress Europe' is quite another.
Hence our vote.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting against this report since, as I have already explained at length on several occasions, including recently, during my speeches in Parliament, I am firmly opposed to the Schengen Agreement. I am particularly opposed to it when this Agreement becomes the vehicle for illegal immigrants and dangerous movements within the EU.
The borders of these countries that want to become part of the Schengen acquis are an easy target for criminals.
They would provide another means of entry for uncontrolled immigration from former Soviet bloc countries and from the Middle East,. not to mention the social disorder that the free movement of citizens within the EU undeniably causes Italy and other countries.
The Schengen cooperation must remain open to all Member States who wish to join and participate in the cooperation.
On the other hand, it is extremely important that all the countries participating in the cooperation already satisfy the requirements at the time of joining, because the cooperation entails a common external border.
If there are deficiencies in one country, Sweden has no way of checking the border protection.
The investigations made show that there are problems which need to be tackled, and the reasonable thing would be to delay joining until all the requirements have been satisfied.
With this explanation of vote, we the undersigned Swedish Social Democrat Members of the European Parliament would like to clarify how we voted on the Braghetto report.
We think it is very important to set up a recovery plan for bluefin tuna. Bluefin tuna has been an endangered species for a long time following massive overfishing.
In time this risks damaging the whole ecosystem in the fishing waters concerned.
However, we think that the Commission's resolution is not entirely adequate and therefore voted against it.
We voted for the Committee's Amendments 4 and 6 - two amendments which entail the removal of two, in our opinion questionable, exemptions for bluefin tuna fishing.
We also supported Amendment 13 which would have meant that we should adopt a recovery plan worthy of the name.
The proposal went considerably further than the original proposal, which is something we fully support.
The level of bluefin tuna stocks is still dangerously low and the European Union must take greater responsibility for the recovery of bluefin tuna stocks.
in writing. - (FR) I would like to explain my vote on the report on the recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
In view of the truly critical state of bluefin tuna stocks, the European Union is reacting as follows through this regulation: a steady reduction of catch quotas, a restriction on fishing periods, and a stepping up of control measures to combat illegal fishing.
I support these proposals.
I am, however plagued by a certain pessimism.
Firstly this is because scientists are already saying that the provisions in this regulation are not enough to guarantee the recovery of stocks.
They believe there would be good reason to set quotas going well beyond the annual catch rates set by ICCAT (the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas).
I am inclined to believe them, so I have lent my support to Amendment 13 tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
In view of the presence in the Mediterranean of fleets from non-EU countries such as Libya, Turkey, Tunisia, Japan and China, which are not members of ICCAT, it is clear that the regulation we are looking at will only have an effect if these countries sign up to the provisions it lays down, and there is no certainty they will.
in writing. - (PT) The establishing of an EU multi-annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna is the practical implementation of one of the measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
The plan provides, amongst other things, for a steady reduction in the catch quota, closed seasons, an increase in minimum size and an observer scheme on board fishing vessels and on fish farms.
The recommendation adopted also provides for financial compensation to be paid to fishermen during the closed season with a view to safeguarding the fleet and employment in the sector.
We also think it is important to improve control, periodically updating the volume of catches by the various vessels to prevent some countries from exceeding allocated quotas to the detriment of others, as happens at present.
You will recall that the bluefin tuna fishing season was closed from September to December because it was suspected that some countries had already exceeded the quotas, as turned out to be the case.
Finally, we regret the rejection of our proposal underlining the fact that small-scale coastal and traditional fisheries, in addition to providing thousands of jobs, enable the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this proposal for a Council regulation, which sets out a plan for the recovery of bluefin tuna stocks in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
Under the proposal, fishers will be compensated for losses caused by closed seasons and quota reductions designed to allow the stock to recover.
It recommends no derogations on seasons or minimum sizes.
Firm action is needed to make sure this fish stock is not depleted beyond repair.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against this resolution that picks up the main aspects of neoliberal policies at Community level and tries to encourage their implementation at world level.
It is a resolution that accepts flexicurity as a concept to be developed and integrated into the National Reform Programmes of each Member State, that attempts to hide the real implications and objectives inherent in the Lisbon Strategy and in its guidelines for economic and employment policies, in particular the associated liberalisations and privatisations.
We cannot accept a resolution that welcomes the intention to develop an external dimension to the Lisbon Strategy, specifically the promotion of market liberalisation on a worldwide scale, accentuating its neoliberal nature and interference in the economic guidelines of third countries.
The Commission communication on its contribution to the October meeting of Heads of State or Government states that the re-launch of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs has been a success, but it should have added the words 'for the large national and international economic and financial groups' who have seen their profits grow exponentially, whereas workers have had to face an erosion of their rights.
in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues believe firmly in the Member States of the European Union pursuing policies that will enhance Europe's competitive position in the globalised economy.
We believe that Europe should pursue the Lisbon Agenda vigorously by securing a deal in the world trade talks, pushing for further deregulation to free industry and business to compete in world markets, driving forward liberalisation in the internal market, implementing effectively the Services Directive and adhering to a sound competition policy.
All of this must be underpinned by an unshakeable commitment to free trade and open markets.
Some of these elements are present in this motion and we welcome that.
Sadly, however, we believe that overall this joint motion is a huge missed opportunity.
It should have set down the basic principles of an EU approach to globalisation as outlined above, but does not do so.
There are elements in this motion which would take Europe in a direction which would undermine the ability of the EU to compete successfully in the globalised economy.
in writing. - (FR) This resolution should have provided a chance to affirm a few urgent matters and to state what the European Parliament is actually expecting of the European Union institutions to ensure a revival of growth, shared social progress in our 27 Member States and development for the developing countries.
There is none of this, but just the same old story of what a good thing globalisation is.
There is nothing about a democratic counterweight to the ECB imposing a monetary policy that favours industry and jobs.
There is nothing about a strategy to counteract the EU's permeability to hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds.
There is nothing about Community preference and the strict imposition of social (ILO) or environmental standards.
There is nothing about development aid, which is essential for co-development.
Why are we surprised about the low growth in Europe, social problems and the people's mistrust?
in writing. - I voted for this composite resolution which responded to the Commission paper 'The European interest: succeeding in the age of globalisation'.
The resolution highlights a number of ways the Union can take advantage of the opportunities globalisation allows: promoting a level playing field in competition and trade issues; improving EU policymaking so it is more joined up; and emphasising the need for the social dimension of the EU to be reinforced.
in writing. - I welcome this resolution which draws attention to a series of interrelated issues - social rights through to financial regulations and the impact of how, as a result of expanding markets, the citizen can make sense of them.
There is a balance to be had between liberal market conditions and issues of the needs of developing countries and it is absolutely necessary that we continue to debate this issue time and time again.
Europe will not succeed in combating the increasing poverty and global warming - the major challenges of globalisation - if it constantly puts the emphasis on liberalisation.
Indeed, it is free trade that causes these problems.
Globalisation creates the illusion that the general level of prosperity in the world is gradually increasing, but at the same time I note a steady increase in the gap between rich and poor in the Member States.
Liberalisation is also the cause of the great environmental disaster that lies ahead unless we hasten to take decisive, enforceable measures to combat global warming.
Lacking a vigorous policy in this field is criminally irresponsible.
Investing in an energy-efficient economy and creating jobs in that area is nevertheless a promising course of action.
The 'polluter pays' principle is disregarded all too frequently.
As a Member of the Group of the Greens/ European Free Alliance I regret the absence of this input.
If Europe wants a single market with free movement of people, goods, services and capital, it should also lay down high social and environmental standards that offer protection and set an example to the rest of the world.
The proposed text remains vague and superficial and once again typifies the Commission's policy.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be truly hypocritical if Parliament, after voting by a very large majority for Mrs Angelilli's oral amendment, which sends the condolences and support of the European Parliament to the family of a victim of such an unmotivated and serious crime in our country, then fails to adopt a clear position to prevent these acts, this massacre of honest citizens, which is happening due to the lack of controls.
No one wants there to be xenophobia in Italy, especially towards members of a people such as the Romanians, who, as an editorial in the newspaper L'Avvenire reminded us, have given us such artists as Mircea Eliade, Ionesco and Cioran.
This is a great civilisation and one that is closely related to our own.
The influx of criminals, and specifically the emergence of Roma groups, is another matter entirely.
For these, border controls and deterrents are needed, with the introduction of a fingerprint recognition system so that we know who is coming into our country and what their intentions are, if possible, and more importantly so that we can pinpoint the exact date of entry.
Although we do not want to introduce draconian measures in Europe, if we are saying that checks must be carried out after three months, then we need to know the exact date of entry and this, as Mr Amato admitted in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, is not the case at present.
Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I recognise that the free movement of persons is a fundamental principle of the European Union and one which must be respected and defended by all Member States.
Furthermore, I think we are right to emphasise yet again that the EU was actually founded on measures to combat all forms of racism and xenophobia and indeed all forms of discrimination.
Equally, we should all in this House recognise that the Roma people of Europe are perhaps the most discriminated against, in some countries to totally unacceptable levels.
We should understand that the assimilation, social integration and protection of the Roma minority are objectives that this European Union has yet to achieve.
I think that this is an aim that we should all work for, along with the spirit of free movement.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the resolution on freedom of movement in the European Union tabled by centre-left groups - I will explain why in a minute - after declaring that I am absolutely and totally in favour of Mario Mantovani's proposal to block entry into the EU and therefore Italy for non-EU nationals for three years.
For EU nationals, I am very much in favour of the right to freedom of movement of workers, citizens and tourists, provided that this is not a licence to kill.
It is inconceivable that a 45-year-old woman should die on her way home from work and a doctor a few days away from retirement should be killed during an attempted burglary at his home in Milan.
Both of these events have occurred in the past few days in Italy.
This is not freedom of movement!
(RO) I voted in favour of the resolution regarding freedom of movement submitted by the PSE, ALDE, Verts and GUE/NGL Groups, although it only partially fulfils the purpose for which I believe this resolution should be drafted.
I believe the text of the resolution should have constituted an even clearer support for the European citizens residing in countries other than their country of origin, implicitly for the Romanian citizens residing in Italy who obey the Italian laws.
The voted text does not condemn the xenophobic attitudes toward Romanian citizens and does not refer to the amplification of the tension between the Romanian community in Italy and the Italian people, which is also generated by the inadequate enforcement of the decree issued by the Italian Committee of Ministries and statements of certain Italian politicians.
I also believe that, as mentioned in the common PPE-DE and UEN resolution, the efficient enforcement of the legal provisions by the Italian authorities would have prevented this situation.
I ask both the European Commission and the Italian authorities to take into consideration the provisions of the common resolution of the PPE-DE and UEN Groups as well, which are not included in the text adopted today.
(NL) Mr President, things are actually becoming more and more ridiculous.
Now a majority in this House even deems it necessary to level an accusation of xenophobia at the people and government of Italy.
In addition, the motion for a resolution states that the Italian Government's approach to the problem of crime among the Romanian Roma present there in massive numbers has contributed to rising tensions.
Italy therefore has only itself to blame for all this and should have participated in the European Social Fund programmes for the integration of the Roma.
I should like to make it clear at this juncture that the people and government of Italy have a right to defend themselves, and that what has happened mainly goes to show that the Directive is unsuitable and that it must be made easier, not more difficult, to deport criminals - criminals, mark you, not decent people working to make ends meet.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this joint resolution, which notes that the right of free movement is a fundamental one accorded to all EU citizens.
Member States have an obligation to look after the citizens of other Member States living in their territories, and to ensure dignity and respect for the rights of all citizens of the Union, no matter where they are living.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am strongly opposed to these motions for resolutions and want to express my firm opposition.
This has all stemmed from belated and inconclusive action taken by the Italian government, which has realised that Italy is facing a crisis, unfortunately only following terrible incidents perpetrated by EU nationals.
Directive 2004/38/EC is clear when it says that 'All Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another Member State [...] if they [...] have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State'.
Therefore, these motions for resolution seem pointless and pretextual.
The treaties impose freedom of movement of citizens within the EU and no one wants to engage in discrimination based on the country of origin.
However, once EU citizens commit serious and execrable violent crimes in another Member State or if they are unable to give a reason for their visit, as the Directive requires, it is in the interests of the entire Union that they should be sent back to their own country.
in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of the resolution regarding free movement, initiated by PSE together with other political groups, because I consider it to be extremely important for the situation created in Italy not to create a dangerous precedent questioning the very respect of European Union fundamental principles.
I believe this situation should be solved immediately in order not to allow the European Union citizens to be discriminated against, irrespective of their nationality.
The measures proposed by the resolution will protect all European citizens from abuse.
The EU needs all its citizens and Romanians should feel the solidarity of European people because there are thousands of Romanians working abroad who are appreciated for their hard work, honesty and correctness.
The Union's Charter to be annexed to the Reform Treaty lists the fundamental rights of European citizens: dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, citizenship, justice.
The EU guarantees democracy, rule of law, human rights, as well as the protection of minorities.
In this context, the measures proposed by the resolution will contribute to the better integration of the Roma community.
(SK) To reiterate what is said in the motion for a resolution, I, too, would like to congratulate the Portuguese Government for putting forward a proposal providing a technical transitional solution - SISone4all - which will allow the new Member States to be connected to the Schengen Information System in 2007, before the Commission introduces the new Schengen Information System II.
Congratulations are also due to the new Member States entering the Schengen area on the tremendous efforts they made to meet all the Schengen requirements in such a short period of time.
Enlargement of the Schengen area to include nine new states from 21 December 2007 is also the richly deserved outcome of the European Parliament's actions to stick to the original date.
This is why I voted for this motion for a resolution.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against this resolution because we are opposed in principle to the communitarisation of Justice and Home Affairs, an area at the heart of state sovereignty.
The 'Reform' Treaty is an attempt to turn the communitarisation of Justice and Home Affairs into a common policy.
Communitarisation - that is, the loss of national sovereignty - is all the more serious when it is promoted in a context characterised by Community policies and measures which dangerously compromise citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees that represent the progress of civilisation and fundamental democratic achievements.
Consider the restrictive asylum policy and the increasing difficulties faced by asylum seekers in securing their rights and guarantees.
Look at immigration policy with its security-orientated approach, its criminalisation of irregular immigrants, its inhuman 'detention centres' and repatriation measures, its discriminatory, exploitative and predatory treatment of human resources from third countries.
Note the growing use of information and the ever-increasing storage of data - including biometric data - available to a wider set of bodies, including third countries, for example the access of US bodies to air passenger data.
The current political climate in Pakistan is certainly critical, since the President has declared a state of emergency and clear violations of human rights have been committed through deprivation of liberty, violence against peaceful demonstrators, and silenced media.
We are firmly opposed to this but we are also opposed to the European Parliament, through this resolution, making yet another attempt to have the EU take over the independent foreign policies of the Member States.
The UN is the only body which, on behalf of its members, has the competence and authority to apply pressure in the global community.
It is very important to restore stability and peace and to restore respect for human rights in Pakistan, but that is not a task which the EU should take away from the Member States.
in writing. - I agree the state of emergency declared (de facto martial law) should be ended and the state of civil law reimplemented with immediate effect and voted for this.
For many of us who are observers of Pakistani politics, it is depressing to see how badly affected the Pakistani communities without our constituencies feel.
A return to a democratic procedure is essential for credibility and the due process of Pakistani politics.
(FI) Mr President, our Group considered the amendment regarding the recognition of the role of nuclear power in our declaration on the climate conference to be an essential part of this resolution.
That is why we want to express our satisfaction that Parliament confirmed this by adopting Amendment 7.
We are not alone in our view.
The UN's climate panel, the IPCC, also confirmed the role of nuclear power as a low-emission form of energy.
Perhaps, too, we should remind ourselves that this House took an historic decision in connection with Mr Reul's report, with 509 votes in favour.
The European Parliament recognised that nuclear power was, at the present, the EU's most important energy source with low carbon dioxide emissions, and at the same time highlighted its role in the fight against climate change.
On the other hand, our Group did not support section 25 in the resolution because in our opinion it needlessly linked or compared the peaceful use of nuclear power with the spread of nuclear weapons and the threat of terrorism.
We should remember that there are no moral censors in the atmosphere.
It does not shun one form of energy or sympathise with another for ideological reasons.
Only freedom from emissions has any importance, and now the emissions are not welcome.
In any case, I wish to say we are pleased that this House sent out a clear message for the Climate Conference and recognised the seriousness of the threat of climate change.
(DE) Mr President, my delegation, the Austrian Social Democrats, abstained from voting on the report on the Bali conference for precisely the reasons that Mrs Korhola has also raised.
We support the other political messages of this report. The report is very good.
My delegation cannot support the sending of a signal that nuclear power is an essential element in combating climate change.
I also think that it should be up to the countries and continents themselves which strategy they follow.
I should like to reemphasise my delegation's support for all elements of this report, including the exclusion of nuclear power projects from the Clean Development Mechanism.
However, we did not want to back this political signal in favour of nuclear power, so we abstained.
In order to show our agreement with the rest of the report, which is good overall, we did not vote against it.
in writing. - We support the resolution dealing with the upcoming Bali conference.
The resolution expresses several important points.
Among other things it clarifies the significant amount of emissions which are emitted from the livestock sector.
It also emphasises the importance of relevant support to developing countries in their prevention and mitigation work to limit the negative effects of climate change.
However, we do not support the proposal that nuclear energy should be seen as a tool which is necessary to prevent climate change.
I voted in favour of the motion for a European Parliament resolution on limiting global climate change to 2 degrees Celsius - the way ahead for the Bali Conference on Climate Change and beyond (COP 13 and COP/MOP 3).
Having regard to the fact that climate change is a major challenge facing societies today, I think it is fundamental for the European Union to renew its leading role in the Bali Conference and for a global post-2012 climate agreement to be reached.
in writing. - (PT) Amendment 7 destroys all the spirit of compromise which prevailed during the negotiations over the final text.
The fact that it was adopted introduces a fundamental change in a text that should have retained a broad parliamentary consensus on the Bali challenges.
Thus, in the spirit of that overall objective and, although as shadow rapporteur I indicated to the Socialist Party that I would be voting in favour, I personally found myself forced to abstain in the final vote in protest against two aspects: the introduction into the text of the abovementioned Amendment 7 which supports nuclear energy, and the method employed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the light of the spirit of compromise which prevailed during the negotiations over the text.
in writing. - (PT) It is true that we are noticing very marked, rapid, and unnatural climate changes that result from many factors, but particularly from the predatory nature of neoliberal policies.
We need effective measures to adapt human society to new living conditions.
The climate changes anticipated in various scientifically credible and reasoned scenarios might not be slow and gradual, depending on the measures taken in the meantime.
There is an urgent need to take deeper, cross-cutting measures to avoid more serious problems in the future, even the proliferation of human and environmental tragedies.
However, we also stress the need to break with neoliberal policies at European and global level, otherwise the major powers and the multinationals will continue to impose their own interests in terms of profits, both the exploitation of natural resources and in international trade, including trading in greenhouse gas emissions, which will have an extremely adverse impact on balanced human development.
Environmental problems are transboundary and therefore the UN Climate Conference is an important diplomatic arena for change at the global level.
In the resolution in question, the EU aims to gather the Member States under a common flag in order to steer the conference negotiations in what the EU considers to be the right direction.
Limiting climate change is a good objective, but it is regrettable that in the EU's hands global environmental policy is overstepping the boundary into foreign policy at the same time as we dictate to third countries and Member States how their national climate policies should look.
The June List considers that every country should have its own vote at the Climate Conference and we have therefore chosen to vote against this resolution.
in writing. - I voted for this resolution from the Climate Change Committee setting out the EU's proposed negotiating position for the start of talks on the future of global climate change cooperation post-2012.
It sets out a sound and progressive EU position to drive reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, taking note of the social impact of climate change, the EU's desired intention to restrict global warming to 2Â°C or less, and the vital need for global buy-in to the system.
in writing. - On behalf of the Fine Gael Delegation (EPP-ED):
Fine Gael Members voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, as we believe it is important to have the European Parliament's view on climate change stated in advance of the Bali Conference.
However, we voted against Amendment 7, as we are traditionally opposed to nuclear power.
in writing. - I would like to thank the rapporteurs on this issue which brings into focus the issues surrounding one of the most important problems of our time.
Caps on emissions with targets to reductions alongside alternative non-carbon based energy production are not accepted by some jurisdictions in the way the EU has agreed.
But this Conference can go a long way to unite and coordinate international action.
in writing. - (RO) The resolution on limiting climate changes to 2 degrees Celsius is an extremely important document for our future and, for this reason, I voted in favour of its adoption.
Climate changes represent a major challenge with catastrophic consequences on the environment and human communities.
We are dealing with a problem we should address with short, medium and long-term measures.
Climate changes already have disastrous effects on agriculture, hydrologic systems, forests, fauna and flora.
Countries such as Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Spain and Portugal have dealt with periods of drought, as well as with floods.
The EU should reaffirm its role as the leader in reducing climate changes.
The financial mechanisms available for protecting water resources, avoiding deforestation and promoting non-polluting technologies should be increased and accessed by the Member States.
We have to allow each Member State to define its own energy mix in order to provide its energy resources.
At the same time, Member States that generate nuclear energy should ensure the security of such installations and, especially, adequate waste management.
Research funds for decreasing the quantity of waste and increasing the security of installations are required.
(NL) Mr President, by no means do I want to detract from the sterling work done by the two rapporteurs on this report on the European Neighbourhood Policy, but I wish to point out that the report contains a gap. It fails to draw attention to the immense challenge presented by immigration from the south, in which regard I take the view that the North African countries themselves also bear tremendous responsibility.
I should have liked this report to include a plea for a joint policy between EU Member States and North African countries to combat illegal immigration, one that called the North African countries themselves to task and made good neighbourly relations and financial and material support from Member States dependent on goodwill, on a joint approach to this enormous challenge.
This - as I see it - fundamental aspect is lacking in the report, and I have therefore abstained from voting.
in writing. - (PT) Following the decision to take new and significant steps in European capitalist integration, specifically at the level of what is known as 'role of the EU in the world' that is reflected in the ongoing 'constitutional' project - now revived in the 'Reform' Treaty - and in the current EU policies, the majority of the EP is approving a report, which is compulsory reading..., on strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP).
Any doubts concerning the EU's real purposes and ambitions in relation to the ENP would soon be cleared up on reading this report.
It amounts to a programme for actually interfering in and controlling the whole area of the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
It is a programme which aims to achieve such objectives as: 'triggering and strengthening the commitment of the governments of the ENP countries to political and economic reforms'; their assimilation of EU 'common policies'; their 'alignment with EU foreign policy'; and the creation of a free trade area'.
The report also advocates 'more joint actions between the EU and the USA' for 'the promotion of democracy, the enhancement of energy security and the strengthening of regional security in the EU's neighbourhood', a point so transparent that it was toned down in the vote in plenary.
It would be best to read the report...
in writing. - (PL) The Neighbourhood Policy is taking on new significance at a time when further expansion of the European Union is going out of fashion.
It is different in nature in the Mediterranean Neighbourhood compared with the Eastern European Neighbourhood, where many countries released from the Soviet area of influence are openly declaring a desire to accede to the European Community.
In this event, as Poles, Hungarians and Lithuanians well understand, any substitute forms of involvement will not satisfy national ambitions.
They have less influence on the required direction in political and economic evolution in these countries. They provide less of an incentive to reinforce the procedures of a state based on democracy and the rule of law and economic market principles and a genuine respect for citizens' rights.
Looking at this from the perspective of a European Union border country like Poland, it would appear that the best policy is maximum openness to the aspirations of countries located beyond our eastern border.
This is clearly linked to creating an area of stability around the European Union and limiting the field of action of demagogy, of which there is plenty in young democracies.
There is also justification for a budgetary effort based on ENPI, the new instrument to replace the TACIS and MEDA programmes, which supports the desired processes in our part of the world.
So far, the Eastern European Neighbourhood has been less well funded than the Mediterranean Neighbourhood.
The larger the European Union becomes, the greater our responsibility for the Old Continent will be.
The report on the European Neighbourhood Policy summarises the ways and means of imperialistic intervention in neighbouring countries.
It falls within the EU's overall imperialist strategy worldwide.
As usual, the report uses 'democratic reforms' and 'democratisation' in the neighbouring countries as the most suitable pretext for exerting coercion and pressure on governments that do not align themselves with its policies.
This is to support and fund the action of the numerous civil society organisations, so that they can further their undermining role within these countries and promote the interventionist plans of the EU.
The European Parliament calls upon the neighbouring countries to participate in the EU's anti-migration policy by intensifying repressive measures against migrants.
It calls upon them to cooperate closely with all its repressive mechanisms, such as Europol and the border protection agency Frontex; it incorporates them into the EU's plans to restrict democratic freedom and strike at popular movements, on the pretext of combating terrorism.
It openly calls for 'joint actions between the EU and the USA in advancing goals', such as joint imperialist interventions and the sharing of the spoils.
It is in the interests of the people to resist and overturn the imperialist plans of the EU and USA in this area and to intensify their struggle for national independence and popular sovereignty.
in writing. - (FR) Strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), as detailed in this report, requires a deepening of cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean via a heightened dialogue between governments, local authorities and representatives of civil society.
It is also essential to remember that the ENP must follow the line set by the European Union's development policy.
Almost all the countries to the south and east of the Mediterranean are developing countries, according to the official list drawn up by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee.
Achieving the millennium development goals should therefore be a priority of EU action in the region.
(SK) I am in favour of strengthening the relationship with Ukraine and I support further structured dialogue with this country, which is our neighbour directly to the east.
During the last elections Ukraine showed great determination to make democratic changes. It decided to continue with a coalition that is clearly pro-European, modern and progressive.
We must also remember that Ukraine is a vast country with attractive economic potential and a serious partner in economic relations.
It is high time we signed an agreement with Ukraine on economic cooperation, on a free trade area.
We must respond to the fact that Ukraine is going to join the World Trade Organisation.
I fully support the creation of a reliable energy transit system between Ukraine and the EU.
I am very much in favour of cooperation in agriculture and environmental matters, but I would put most emphasis on scientific and educational cooperation, and on strengthening the dimension of the knowledge-based economy.
(SK) Ukraine is a neighbour of strategic importance to the EU and a natural 'bridge' connecting the EU with Russia and Central Asia.
It is a large country whose Orange Revolution has put it on the road to democracy.
Ukraine has become a key partner of the European Union's neighbourhood policy.
Our cooperation with Ukraine must improve and we must give all possible diplomatic and political support to Ukraine's accession to the WTO.
Negotiations on the free trade area should start as soon as possible so that an ambitious agreement can be signed as soon as possible.
We all understand how complicated the situation is in Ukraine: it is a very young and fragile democracy.
Today this country finds itself facing a strategic decision: to move towards Russia or to move towards the European Union?
That is why the excellent balanced report by the rapporteur, Mr Zbigniew Zaleski, comes at the time when Ukraine needs a clear European perspective.
I welcome this report and I gave it my unequivocal support during the vote.
I believe that following the early parliamentary elections the country will be able to form a government that will bring Ukraine even closer to our common European house.
- (PL) Mr President, the European Union's intention should be to build stronger and increasingly close relations with Ukraine.
Mr Zaleski's report, which we have accepted, contains many suggestions on how this might be done.
Ukraine should be our strategic partner, not just because of its specific geographical situation and size, but particularly because of the role it plays in the region in relations with Russia and the Central Asian states.
It is therefore in the EU's interests to strengthen and develop economic and political ties with this country.
We are all aware of how much more work lies ahead for the Ukrainian people on the road to achieving Western standards in their economy, in their standard of living and social matters and in strengthening the democratic system in the state.
The EU should provide aid for achieving these goals, and one way of doing this would be to conclude a free-trade agreement with Ukraine, as well as to support its accession to the WTO.
This would help to reinforce the market economy, democracy and the civil state, which will bring Ukraine closer to EU membership.
Bringing the EU and Ukraine together is a long and difficult process.
It is one that is proceeding on a number of levels, but it is necessary nonetheless.
For the two sides to come together, Ukraine must continue with the economic and social reforms it has begun, maintain its pro-European policy slant and strengthen its democracy.
For its part, the EU must send out a clear signal to show that there are prospects for Ukrainian membership of the EU.
The June List welcomes increased trade and deeper economic relations with Ukraine. Such a development would benefit both parties in the short and long term alike.
However, it can be seen that the underlying purpose of this report is not only to develop economic relations but to conduct foreign policy on the part of the EU.
The tone of the report is manifestly dictatorial and the proposals for cooperation given are presented almost exclusively on the EU's terms and with the EU's own interests in the foreground.
Therefore the June List has chosen to vote against this report.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, for which I was the Socialist Group shadow.
It notes the areas where the EU and Ukraine should strengthen their relationship, discusses a free trade area with the Ukraine, energy supplies, and relations with Russia.
I would like to see a stronger and deeper relationship between the EU and the Ukraine, and trade and economic relations are a vital part of that.
in writing. - (PT) EU relations with the Ukraine fall under European Neighbourhood Policy which, as the report stresses, aims at supporting the development of the market economy in the EU's neighbouring countries, in other words, capitalism.
The report aims at the signature of a free trade agreement (FTA), i.e. Ukraine's integration 'into the EU single market' by the 'gradual adoption by Ukraine of the Community's acquis'.
Thus the report:
'Calls on Ukraine... to pay more attention to market liberalisation by guaranteeing the successful achievement of the privatisation process, the dismantling of monopolies' (read: public undertakings) 'and the independence of Ukraine's national bank';
encourages 'the approximation and convergence of standards in the agricultural, industry and services sector' through 'conformity to Community standards', and, in the light of Ukraine's conditional adhesion to the Single Economic Space (SES) with Russia and other former Soviet Union Republics, 'recalls that certain provisions included in the SES agreement, if fully implemented, might be in conflict with the establishment of a functioning FTA with the EU'.
Believe it or not, as the rapporteur states, 'the agreement with Russia would in fact prevent Ukraine from any real form of economic sovereignty and stake a heavy claim on the country's independence'.
Enough said...
We find some of the trends that 'will to some extent form the EU's humanitarian approach in the future' very worrying and extremely negative, taking the form of initiatives such as the 'EU response to situations of fragility in developing countries' or the 'European Consensus on Development', aimed basically at African countries but also at Caribbean and Pacific countries.
An analysis of those initiatives reveals that the central issue of including 'development' as one of the external dimensions for achieving the strategic objectives of the EU's major powers (CFSP/ESDP), which is tantamount to saying the promotion of 'development' as an instrument for interference and control in a strategy which, significantly, does not rule out 'coercive military intervention'.
Hence a whole programme and panoply of instruments which, in our opinion, amalgamate and confuse the 'borders' between 'aid' and interference, for example in such fundamental issues as 'state-building'.
There is certainly an urgent need to show solidarity with many countries that have inherited disastrous situations from colonialism and that are the victims of decades of interference, but such solidarity, in order to be effective, must be based on respect for the principles of national sovereignty and independence and on an effective and genuine development aid and cooperation policy.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I say I voted in favour of Elizabeth Lynne's proposal to tackle the poverty that exists in Europe.
However, before this packed Parliament here in Strasbourg, I must criticise the fact that in Italy there is discrimination against elderly pensioners, who are made to live in poverty if they become incapacitated after the age of 65, but are given a significant allowance if they become incapacitated before the age of 65.
Mr President, since on 12 December 2007 the new Treaty will be signed in Brussels, giving binding legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I ask that infringement proceedings be brought against Italy on 12 December because it is violating the right of the elderly to receive the same treatment as all other citizens.
We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report.
It is important that the fight against poverty and social exclusion is intensified in Europe.
However, we would like to clarify our position.
Paragraph 32 speaks of the setting up of a decent minimum wage at Member State level. The report states clearly that this should be done together with the social partners where applicable.
We therefore consider that the collective agreement model we have in the Nordic countries is covered by the formulation.
