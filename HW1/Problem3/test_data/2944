They think that the airports are local monopolies and exploit their monopoly position in order to impose unreasonable charges.
The Swedish air transport agency LFV and the smaller air transport companies, however, have misgivings with regard to new legislation.
For the smaller air transport companies new legislation and harmonisation are more of a threat, since they often choose to fly to competing airports which apply lower charges.
I have voted against the directive for several reasons.
Airports are already regulated by national authorities, and their action is limited by existing competition legislation in the EU.
Those countries which choose a business model that leads to higher airport charges resulting, for example, from investment or transfer of ownership must be allowed to do so as long as the charges are not contrary to existing legislation.
It is then up to the Member States to judge whether their charges are competitive or not.
The European Parliament has reduced the scope of the directive.
Along with others, I voted for the amendments limiting the directive to 67 airports (compared to around 150 which would have been affected before).
However, I cannot support price regulation at EU level.
in writing. - (FR) In the first reading in the codecision procedure, I voted in favour of a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation on the export and import of dangerous chemicals, based on the report by my Dutch colleague Johannes Blokland.
I am delighted that a compromise has been found, since there is a fairly urgent need to regularise the legal situation ensuing from the annulment by the Court of Justice of the previous Regulation dating from 2003, while at the same time improving the regulatory situation to take account of developments since that time.
in writing. - I have voted in favour of the compromise amendments agreed by the vast majority of the political groups, which are intended to promote joint responsibility between parties with regard to international trade in hazardous chemicals.
Rules adopted at EU level are vital for the provision of a high level of protection of the environment and public health, and we aspire to these rules being extended internationally.
Awareness of risks is paramount for exporters and importers.
Countries, by virtue of exchange of information and best practice and compulsory national decision-making on the acceptability of chemicals, can heighten such awareness while also making legislators and stakeholders aware of such risks.
The proposed legislation implements the Rotterdam Convention, the underlying principle being to help participating countries learn more about the characteristics of potentially hazardous chemicals and pesticides.
This provides countries with the information and the means to stop unwanted imports of toxic chemicals, putting the requirement and onus on the exporter/exporting country to comply with the laws of the importing country.
I very much welcome and support this legislation and the European Parliament's compromise package.
in writing. - (IT) I welcome the implementation of the Rotterdam Convention, as it shows that Europe is well aware of its commitments to protect the environment and health of third countries and, in particular, developing countries.
From today it will no longer be possible to export hazardous chemical products to countries outside Europe without prior authorisation from the countries of destination (the so-called PIC - prior informed consent procedure).
We had to put an end to the double standard that existed when a substance was strictly regulated in the European market to protect the environment and the health of European citizens, but could be freely traded with third countries without any precautions or any obligation to provide information on risks.
A measure of courtesy and solidarity especially towards countries with fewer information and risk analysis resources than the European Union.
in writing. - (PT) The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade was approved in September 1998 and entered into force on 24 February 2004.
Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals implements the Rotterdam Convention.
The Commission considered it necessary to bring an action against the Council and the European Parliament at the Court of Justice because it did not agree with the change in the legal basis (environment rather than common commercial policy).
In its Judgment of 10 January 2006, the Court of Justice annulled the Regulation on the grounds that there should have been a dual legal basis including both Article 133 and Article 175(1) of the Treaty, and ruled that the effects of the Regulation would be maintained until a new regulation founded on appropriate legal bases was adopted.
The European Commission submitted a new draft regulation based on the above-mentioned dual legal basis.
In today's vote, at first reading, the European Parliament approved a range of amendments to the European Commission proposal that will now be negotiated with the Council.
Hence our vote in favour.
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the agreement reached on this Regulation at first reading.
There are 75 000 different chemical products on the market and 1 500 new ones are added to that every year.
So it is difficult for governments to monitor and manage all the potentially dangerous substances that cross our borders on a daily basis.
The Regulation will help to ensure that these dangerous chemical products are used in a more rational way, by facilitating the exchange of information about them.
Importing countries will thus be properly equipped and informed so that they can identify potential threats and keep out those chemical products that they are not in a position to manage safely.
We do have to recognise the difficulties that exporting countries sometimes face in seeking to obtain explicit consent from the importing countries.
However, derogations granted to exporting countries awaiting consent may no longer be valid for more than 12 months.
I am pleased that we have adopted this measure, which aims to prevent uncontrolled imports of dangerous chemical products into third countries.
The Regulation will enable us to avoid repetition of the many errors committed in the past, which have caused damage to the environment and to public health.
in writing. - (PL) The rapporteur, Johannes Blokland, is right in noting that adequate rules should be adopted worldwide and at European level in order to provide a high level of protection for the environment and public health.
The development of a specific infrastructure in less developed countries could certainly combat the irresponsible use of chemicals which would otherwise damage the ecology, economy and working conditions.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the report.
I see the implementation of the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent (PIC) as a positive step in this policy area.
Ensuring that prior consent is given from third countries receiving dangerous substances helps ensure that developing countries do not fall victim to the dumping of restricted chemicals in their backyard without their agreement.
Though this is an encouraging move in the right direction, the implementation of the measures needs to be closely followed by the Commission.
in writing. - (DE) Unscrupulous traders are trying to evade the special requirements that apply to the transport of chemicals and other hazardous goods, requirements such as specialised driver training, labelling and the like. Vans belonging to parcel services carry highly corrosive acids, explosive liquids or ammunition, often without the driver even knowing.
If items are not labelled and waybills do not indicate the true nature of the goods, staff may be risking their lives in the event of an accident.
A fire would have unimaginably dire consequences, not only in the form of permanent damage to health but possibly of environmental contamination too.
It makes sense to simplify the requirements for the transport of dangerous goods without compromising safety.
There is also a need to think about ways of speeding up the switchover to double-hull tankers in order to reduce the incidence of environmental disasters.
Above all, however, more targeted spot checks on HGVs are needed throughout the EU so that the black sheep who drive with unsecured, unlabelled or dangerous loads, defective brakes, etc., can be taken off the road.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Johannes Blokland on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals.
The report raises the issue of permitting transport without explicit authorisation.
From the economic point of view, the existing situation is unsatisfactory for European exporters of chemicals if they do not receive any response from importing countries about substances listed in the Annexes.
As a result of this regulation, European exporters of chemicals which are severely restricted in Europe can export these substances outside the European Union more easily.
This more flexible approach could result, especially in less developed states, in countries no longer enjoying any protection against imports of chemical substances.
In order to avoid the uncontrolled export of hazardous substances to third countries, and in order to protect those countries that are less able or even unable to assess hazardous chemicals, the period of tacit agreement should be shorter.
It is important that the Commission's proposal should apply to the issue of introducing tools making it easier for customs authorities to carry out the provisions of the Regulation.
For the mechanisms proposed in this new regulation to function correctly and effectively it is vital to have close cooperation between customs authorities and selected national authorities.
The introduction of the new regulations should be preceded by drawing up guidelines concerning the use of computer products and documentation and providing training in accordance with EU standards, particularly for the new Member States.
in writing. - (FR) In the first reading in the codecision procedure, I voted in favour of the legislative resolution amending the proposal of the European Commission amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, on the basis of the report by my excellent Hungarian colleague Csaba Åry, which introduces technical amendments to the European Commission's proposal with a view to making the Regulation clearer or easier to read.
He is pleased that this Regulation sets out to give an accurate impression of the evolution in the legal situation of national social security schemes, and hence to ensure appropriate coordination at Community level.
in writing. - (PL) With reference to the principle of the four basic freedoms in European economic integration, I would also like to draw attention to the meaning of Regulation 1408/71, which aims to promote the free movement of workers in the European Union.
Whilst it is true that the report in question relates to strictly technical issues, these very issues, in serving to update the above-mentioned Regulation by making it take into account social insurance changes at national level, have a direct impact on the everyday life of citizens who are travelling, working or living in another Member State.
I would also agree with the rapporteur that, when implementing the principle of free movement in Europe, social conditions should be set out in a precise manner.
Finally, I would like to emphasise how important the proposed changes and the transparency of the guidelines are for thousands of Polish citizens who are living and working outside of Poland.
This is one of the principal reasons why I support Mr Åry's report.
in writing. - (PL) Mr Åry is right in acknowledging that, on the level of the European Union, effective coordination needs to be ensured between Member States as regards benefit payments.
This Regulation, by introducing updates that take into account the latest changes in certain Member States, holds out the possibility of guaranteeing to citizens who are travelling from one Member State to another the possibility of benefiting from social insurance.
in writing. - (FR) On the basis of the own-initiative report of my German friend and colleague Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, I voted in favour of the Resolution on a Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework, following the Communication from the European Commission based on the 'CARS 21' high-level group.
I should like to begin by welcoming the method involving the holding of a genuine industrial audit with all the stakeholders, with a view to specifying an industrial policy for the automotive sector involving parameters as important as not only the impact on purchasing power, employment, safety, mobility, the environment and the regulatory burdens the industry has to shoulder, but also innovation, competitiveness, the problems of second-hand cars, disposing of old cars, etc., in an internal market which is far from complete.
It is essential that, having created the internal market in the interests of consumers, the European Union should devote particular attention to manufacturers, implementing a European industrial policy with them.
The automotive sector, in which we have a great tradition, must be given support as it undergoes the major changes taking place today.
in writing. - While I do not disagree that it may be desirable to reduce CO2 emissions in an overall environmental context, it is not for the undemocratic EU to decide these issues.
in writing. - (PT) The European automotive industry, which represents around 3% of the EU's GDP and 7% of its manufacturing output, is one of the most important economic sectors, producing around one third of global production.
It is also one of the EU's leading export sectors and invests 4% of its turnover in R&D. The sector is one of the largest employers, with over 2 million direct and 10 million indirect jobs, and is therefore a key factor in Europe's economic, social and cultural life.
The sector is facing serious challenges, however.
Rapid technological progress, coupled with fierce international competition, means that it must change rapidly.
Furthermore, considerable social expectations weigh upon the sector, particularly in terms of the environment and road safety.
This close interaction between the industry, the environment, energy and transport makes it one of the EU's most regulated areas - it is covered by around 80 directives and 115 UNECE regulations.
We cannot support all the proposals presented in this report, however.
Too much emphasis is given to defending the internal market and competition, while little attention is paid to social and labour issues and the development gap between Member States.
in writing. - (FR) The Chatzimarkakis report is supposed to be about the main factors that will make the automotive industry competitive in the years ahead, taking account of environmental constraints, product and safety standards, competitors in the international context, etc.
Yet, threaded throughout the text we find evidence of the ongoing urge to persecute drivers.
Surely curbing traffic in urban areas and the cross-border enforcement of fines for infringement of traffic rules have no place in such a report?
Are Europeans now to be required, on pain of sanctions or higher taxes, to buy 'clean' vehicles fitted with expensive safety-related technologies, while the reality in a country like France is that the high average age of cars on the road (eight years) is a reflection of people's financial difficulties and low purchasing power?
Why are private cars yet again castigated, when they are responsible, in France for example, for just 13% of CO2 emissions, and that figure is certainly lower in countries that do not use nuclear energy?
There is a basic paradox here in seeking to have a competitive automotive industry in Europe, when the overall thrust of European policies is to push up the price of cars and to impoverish consumers, while at the same time introducing new forms of persecution to dissuade people from buying and using vehicles.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report proposing a competitive automotive regulatory framework.
It is a road map for making cars cleaner and safer and for simplifying the legal context for the development of European vehicle manufacturing.
We must make it possible to reduce the impact of road transport on air quality as vehicles currently in use are gradually replaced.
I welcome the adoption of the deadlines that Parliament has set, coinciding with the date of 2015, to achieve an emissions limit of 125 g/km for new cars coming onto the market.
The date is the same as that for the entry into force of the Euro VI standards.
Additional measures (involving alternative fuels, eco-driving or tax incentives, for example) could contribute to this effort, and particular attention should be paid to biofuels and hydrogen.
CARS 21 recommends a holistic approach to road safety, involving vehicle technology, infrastructure and road users (suggested measures include electronic stability control, seat-belt reminders and emergency braking systems).
The first requirement of effective legislation is that it should be realistic, and environmental concerns have long been central to policies within the industry.
in writing. - (NL) I have voted against the Chatzimarkakis report, because the Commission proposal is more environmentally friendly.
The rapporteur suggests a target of 125 g/km of CO2 in 2015.
The Commission proposal suggests a maximum emission of 120 g/km of CO2 in 2012.
I tabled an amendment to have that withdrawn, but it just failed to go through.
I wonder where the rapporteur has got the less environmentally favourable proposal from without being influenced by the motor industry lobby.
For years now there have been voluntary agreements between the Commission and the motor industry to reduce CO2 emissions.
The Commission target does not just come from nowhere and it is, according to the motor industry, technically achievable and from an innovative point of view an export product.
They will, however, make less profit temporarily in order to be able to stabilise their competitive position in the future.
It is wrongly argued that jobs will be lost.
I might point out that only 6% of the production costs of new cars are staff costs.
The choice of labour cost savings is separate from the shift to 120 g/km of CO2 in 2012.
If the motor industry decides to move its operations to low-wage countries, it will do that anyway.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the report.
I strongly believe that the CO2 target of 120g/km by 2012 is one that must be met and is essential in fighting climate change.
Though I acknowledge that Member States need to engage in the funding of research and development for the automobile sector in this area, I feel that the industry itself should also contribute and demonstrate a further commitment to reducing the effects of climate change.
I also approve of the directive calling for the information and consultation of workers on this issue.
in writing. - (NL) Together with my colleague, Mrs Liotard, I voted against the Chatzimarkakis report, because the original Commission proposal is more environmentally friendly.
The rapporteur sets a target of 125 g/km of CO2 in 2015.
In the Commission proposal, the maximum emission was 120 g/km of CO2 in 2012.
My group tabled an amendment today for that to be withdrawn, but it just failed to go through.
I wonder where the rapporteur got this less environmentally favourable proposal from, if it is not influenced by the motor industry lobby.
For years now there have been voluntary agreements between the Commission and the motor industry to reduce CO2 emissions.
The Commission target does not just come from nowhere.
According to the motor industry, it is technically achievable and can generate an innovative export product.
Certainly car factories will temporarily make less profit, which they see as interference with the strengthening of their competitive position.
It is wrongly argued that jobs might be lost.
Only 6% of the production costs of new cars are staff costs.
Any lower labour costs are separate from the shift to 120 g/km of CO2 in 2012.
If the motor industry wants to decide to move its operations to low-wage countries, a less strict rule will not prevent it.
in writing. - (PT) The future of the competitiveness of the European automotive sector is extremely important.
The EU should therefore continue to adopt a long-term approach based on investing in research and development and improving the operation of the internal market by means of the necessary legislation and by simplifying administrative procedures, making them quicker and less costly.
The report suggests that an integrated environmental approach should be adopted, allied to new engine technologies and the use of less polluting fuels, and that additional measures should be taken in the area of traffic management, driving behaviour and infrastructure so that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced even further.
I consider these aspects to be essential, and the investment required should be funded largely through public-private partnerships as a new tool for industrial research and technological development.
Finally, the international dimension highlights the need for urgent measures to be taken to improve access to markets, particularly in Asia, by means of multilateral negotiations and bilateral trade agreements.
I therefore voted in favour of the report on the CARS 21 initiative.
in writing. - I will be voting in favour of the Chatzimarkakis report, even though I believe that the car industry has to do more to reduce emissions from the vehicles it produces.
It is very easy on the one hand to pick out the motor car as the chief sinner in all things environmental, and certainly the motor car that we have at the moment leaves a lot to be desired in this area.
But we must work with industry and educate them on the need to produce more environmentally-friendly cars.
The motor industry is a big employer of people and contributes considerably to local, regional and national economies.
It therefore cannot be treated in a cavalier way, as some Members of this House believe.
One area that concerns me is in this report is the clear view that fiscal measures, and fiscal harmonisation, should be used as a way of promoting the Car 21 concept.
For me, this is a move too far, and the one area I cannot support.
However, I welcome this report and support it because overall it adopts a balanced and practical approach.
in writing. - (DE) The report entitled CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework has my full support.
This report can help to enhance the competitiveness of the car industry.
Besides imposing new obligations on the industry in the form of environmental requirements, we also need to give it simplified procedures, to cut red tape and to apply the principles of better lawmaking.
In addition, the automotive sector must benefit from more research and development funding.
With regard to the achievement of the target CO2 values, it is important that we base the phased reductions on the parameter of vehicle weight rather than the 'carbon footprint'.
The only physical correlation that exists is between the weight of a vehicle and its CO2 emissions.
The carbon footprint does not offer this kind of correlation, and its use would only serve to put the German car industry at a competitive disadvantage.
We have come out emphatically in favour of an integrated strategy that takes account of all possible means of reducing CO2 emissions.
We want factors such as individual driver behaviour, the creation of various incentives to drive environmentally clean cars, the use of biofuels and the promotion of new forms of vehicle technology to contribute to the reduction of emission levels.
This poses a challenge not only to car manufacturers but to all stakeholders.
in writing. - I voted against the Chatzimarkakis report, because the Commission proposal is more environmentally friendly.
The rapporteur sets as target 125 grams of CO2 per km in 2015.
The Commission proposal suggests a maximum emission target of 120 grams of CO2 in 2012, which was retabled as an amendment.
This amendment has regrettably been dismissed.
I wonder from where the rapporteur got the proposal, which is environmentally and technically inferior, without having been influenced by the car industry lobby.
For years there have been voluntary agreements between the Commission and the car industry to limit the CO2 emissions.
The Commission target does not come out of the blue and is, according to the car industry, technically feasible and, innovatively speaking, an export product.
They will, however, temporarily be making a lesser profit in order to stabilise their competition position in the future.
There is unjustified use of the issue of loss of employability.
I point out the fact that only 6% of the production costs of new cars are personnel costs.
The choice of cost-cutting on labour is unrelated to the move to 120 grams of CO2 per km in 2012.
Should the car industry decide to move to low wage countries, they will do this nonetheless.
in writing. - (NL) The transport sector accounts for one fifth of greenhouse gases.
Sustainable, efficient and clean cars can make a serious contribution in the fight against climate change.
Efforts to achieve that can make the motor industry considerably stronger in the future.
Unfortunately there is no sign of that message in the response to the CARS 21 document by the Commission and Parliament.
In our amendments, we have tried to note a number of core points.
Individual mobility and the motor industry need to be looked at in the broader context of sustainable mobility.
We emphasise that the escalating worldwide demand for transport fuels can lead to the exploitation of oil sources with serious adverse effects on the environment, such as tar sand and synthetic coal gas.
Steps also have to be taken to improve fuel efficiency in the sector.
The choice of biofuels can only be developed if the Commission establishes a binding comprehensive certification system with strict social and environmental criteria.

Finally, we would also like to remove, firstly, the paragraphs suggesting that motor sport and Formula 1 racing can possibly contribute to more environmentally friendly technologies and, secondly, the paragraphs that allow manufacturers to produce vehicles that emit extra CO2 if those emissions result from legally binding measures at EU level.
Most of our amendments have been rejected. I am therefore voting against this report.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations, based on the own-initiative report by my excellent colleague Piia-Noora Kauppi in response to a communication from the European Commission on the same subject.
I am very concerned about the unfavourable repercussions of the large number of regimes applied by the Member States to cross-border losses on the workings of the internal market.
In the context of the recent decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the Marks & Spencer case, this is a particularly opportune time, since, in the absence of cross-border deduction of losses, compensation for these losses is generally limited to the profits realised in the Member State in which the investment was made.
This distorts the decisions of undertakings within the internal market.
It would seem to be essential to instigate direct coordination of Member States' tax systems within the internal market.
However, this must be a temporary solution, since in the longer term we must adopt a common consolidated basis for taxation of companies that constitutes a global solution and eliminates the tax obstacles involved in cross-border compensation of losses and profits.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the Kauppi Report because there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various contentious issues that arise in this report.
It is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime.
However particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland, whose prosperity and employment levels depend to a large extent on its capacity to attract foreign investment.
in writing. - (PT) Unfortunately the amendments tabled by our Group were rejected, in particular certain positions contrary to those that were finally approved.
This included the opinion on the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the Marks & Spencer case, which constitutes excessive interference in the right of Member States not to have their tax systems weakened.
In cross-border situations fiscal competence must be fairly distributed between the Member States concerned, avoiding the double offsetting of losses and risks of tax evasion.
There is also considered to be a risk that, by allowing cross-border losses to be offset, companies tend to ensure that their profits are taxed in low-tax rather than high-tax countries.
The possibility of offsetting cross-border losses can thus only be justified when parts of the same enterprise are genuinely interlinked, or, in other words, when those parts are economically and organisationally integrated.
Above all, the conditions for appropriate and equal tax treatment which avoids tax evasion and which also ensures that public services function and that income is apportioned and distributed more fairly must be safeguarded.
in writing. - (SV) The internal market is the EU's greatest contribution to democracy and prosperity in Europe.
The intention of this report is said to be to make the internal market work better by bringing about the harmonisation of tax bases, in this case by the harmonisation of ways in which company losses are to be treated when several countries are affected.
However, the report rests upon a premise which has not been thought through.
Harmonisation of tax bases has very different effects in the different countries depending on differences in the structure of their industries.
In some countries there is a preponderance of heavy primary industry with huge long-range investments, whereas in others industry is dominated by service businesses and light engineering.
We therefore consider that the question of harmonising tax bases should be investigated more thoroughly before a report such as this is debated in Parliament.
in writing. - (PL) Ladies and gentlemen, taxes must be one of the most sensitive EU topics.
Whenever discussions on this subject take place in international fora, there is a chorus of critical voices, chiefly because Member States jealously guard their right to set taxes.
In the discussions concerning Mrs Kauppi's report on Tax Treatment of Losses in Cross-Border Situations, the issue of taxes was thoroughly analysed.
The report draws attention to the major problems associated with branches of companies that benefit from different tax systems, frequently within the framework of a single company, but in different countries.
There is no doubt that the European Union needs competitive tax regulation.
This does not at all mean harmonised, but competitive.
This means regulations that do not create an excessive burden but, on the contrary, will provide an incentive to start a business.
I believe that the European Union should definitely not think about the harmonisation of taxes on legal persons, but it should coordinate taxes on the EU level so as to create real benefits as a result of tax competitiveness.
I am very pleased that the rapporteur puts forward the same view in the report that has been presented.
in writing. - In my view the tackling of the obstacles apparent in cross-border trade does not lie in harmonisation of taxation, which should fall under the remit of individual national legislatures.
I therefore, abstained from the vote on this issue.
in writing. - Mr President, sometimes I do wonder if the effort we put into reports in this place is worth it.
Taxation policy must remain a competence of member states and any moves from anywhere to extend Community competence to this policy field will be met with opposition by our constituents, national governments and businesses.
Accordingly, while I do not denigrate the hard work that has clearly gone into it, I disagree with much of this report and even question the need for it.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats welcome the Community strategy on health and safety at work and have therefore voted for the report.
It is important that targets now be set for the number of labour inspectors in Europe.
According to ILO recommendations the number of inspectors should be one per 10 000 employees.
It is to be deplored, however, that following cuts imposed by the Government Sweden no longer meets the requirements laid down by the ILO and now the European Parliament.
After the Government's savings Sweden will only have 0.7 inspector per 10 000 employees.
Compare this with Denmark, for example, where the figure is a least two.
in writing. - (FR) On the basis of the report by my British colleague Glenis Willmott, I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the Community strategy on health and safety at work 2007-2012, in response to the Communication from the European Commission on this subject.
Every year, almost 500 000 people die or suffer permanent disability for work-related reasons, and we must applaud the European Commission's goal of achieving an average 25% reduction in work-related accidents in the EU.
I support the idea of increased activity by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao (Spain).
In this matter and, more generally, in the development of social Europe, I regret the fact that neither the report nor, moreover, the Communication from the European Commission stresses that it is essential to support the social partners; we must always remember that under the existing Treaties, with Articles 137 ff. of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), and this has been confirmed by the Lisbon Treaty that is in the process of being ratified, legislative instruments are available to the latter to facilitate the development of European social law.
in writing. - This is a non-legislative report which has undergone substantial revision in committee as a direct result of our input.
As a result, there should be no automatic need to divide on party-political lines, though we have tabled a few additional amendments for the plenary session.
In its raw original form, it called for more prescriptive EU legislation in many areas.
It now welcomes the Commission's greater emphasis on regulatory simplification and the reduction of administrative burdens, and the strong focus on helping SMEs.
It recognises the prime role of Member States in promoting the health and safety agenda.
We are proud of the role that we have played in significantly softening the original approach to make the report acceptable.
Safeguarding the health and safety of workers is a concern for us all.
in writing. - (PT) The report approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs covers significant aspects of the struggle for better living and working conditions, with greater protection of health and safety.
Unfortunately, however, on the PPE's initiative, several proposals were amended and paragraph 59, which stressed that permanent employment is an important contributory factor to health and safety at work, was rejected.
Hence our final vote to abstain.
Concerned that the number of accidents and illnesses at work is not falling uniformly, since their incidence is much greater than the EU average among particular categories of workers (migrants, people on insecure contracts, women, the young and the elderly, for example) and particular Member States, the European Parliament calls upon the Commission to give priority to activities and/or sectors that involve particular risks.
However, we welcome the approval of the paragraph that considers excessive working hours and insufficient rest periods to be a key factor in increased levels of accidents and illnesses at work, and that calls for a proper balance of work and family life.
in writing. - (SV) The June List considers that issues of health and safety at work are essentially a national matter.
Obviously everything, from phasing out asbestos in the workplace to the protection of health care workers who work with sharp instruments, is important.
But we have every confidence that the Member States are competent to formulate adequate national strategies on health and safety at work.
We would therefore question what practical added value EU ideas in this area can bring.
On the basis of the arguments made above we have voted in favour of the amendment to limit the strategy on health and safety at work and against the report in the final vote.
in writing. - (RO) I am in favour of this report and I support the proposal of using the Structural Funds to invest in mining infrastructure in order to prevent so many occupational accidents occurring in this sector.
The European Union cannot have a credible strategy of labour protection without providing financial support to the Member States.
Mining is Romania's hardest hit industry, having the highest number of occupational accidents, but the insufficient national resources are available for improving working conditions.
The European Union can remedy the situation by the funding it makes available to the Member States.
I would also like to propose that part of the European funding available under the human resources operational programme should be used for the training and equipment of labour inspection departments.
It is important that all Member States should reach the minimum level specified by the World Labour Organization, of at least one labour protection inspector for every 10 000 workers.
in writing. - (FR) The aims of the Community strategy on health and safety at work for 2007-2012 - while undoubtedly laudable in themselves - are unlikely to be realised, just as the Lisbon strategy is unlikely to be realised by 2010.
Moreover, such is the degree of disparity in legislation on these matters in Europe that they are not readily manageable at Community level, and the big risk is that health and safety standards will converge towards the lowest common denominator.
Instead of publicising the benefits and advantages it has to offer, Europe should be taking practical action and attacking the factors that actually place working people at risk, namely insecurity, unemployment and poverty.
When these have been addressed, and only then, questions of health and safety at work can, of course, be resolved in the ongoing process of common standard-setting.
Our leaders in Europe are mistaken: encouraging immigration is not the way to reduce levels of poverty or its prevalence, or to promote growth.
That much is plain from the fact that the last 10 years, with immigration at unprecedented levels, have seen lower than ever growth rates by comparison with the rest of the world.
The Community strategy for health and safety at work has not taken these parameters into account.
We shall therefore vote against the report.
in writing. - I found that the report was a very encouraging step towards ensuring a safer workplace.
The need for increased funding to guarantee health and safety measures are met in areas such as mining, steelmaking and shipbuilding is essential, especially in such high risk industries.
The call to protect health workers from blood-borne infections, and to introduce new legislation on occupational diseases, takes account of the profound changes in the dangers that workers now face in their day-to-day work.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - Mr President, I am delighted to congratulate our rapporteur on a balanced report taking account of an important strategy, as the EU has been instrumental in raising health and safety standards at work across the EU and the Community strategy to 2012 looks set to continue that work.
However, we must always be mindful that there does come a time when standards are sufficiently high and the focus must go to enforcement, not new legislative or regulatory burdens.
We must keep an eye on this area to ensure that a proper balance is struck, and this report takes us in that direction.
in writing. - (NL) Health and safety at work have an extremely important part to play on the European agenda and in the Lisbon Strategy.
Investment in them increases productivity and reduces social security costs.
The previous policy plan, for instance, already significantly reduced the number of accidents at the workplace.
For the new policy period (up to 2012), further efforts will be made to achieve a 25% reduction, and the Commission undertakes to help SMEs implement the existing regulatory legal framework.
The Willmott report improves considerably on the Commission proposal.
It aims at a suitable mix of tougher and better labour inspections, effective prevention, appropriate incentives and sanctions, together with sharing best practice and increasing worker participation.
With a few 'green' amendments such as greater attention to the group of agency staff (women, migrant workers), temporary and poorly trained workers, and attention to the underlying causes of mental illness and to mental health, to addiction and psychological risks at work, such as stress, harassment and bullying, as well as violence, I fully support this report.
in writing. - (EL) The Community Strategy 2007-2012 on Health and Safety at Work does not deal with the actual causes of accidents and conceals the irresponsibility of capital.
The proposed measures are piecemeal, limited to management of today's criminal reality at the expense of the working class and employees generally.
Accidents at work are the heavy price the working class is made to pay, within the scope of the barbarous spread of capitalism, all for the sake of profit.
Accidents at work each year are steadily increasing in Greece and in the other EU Member States, with the result that thousands of workers lose their lives and thousands of others suffer insurmountable problems.
The Îuropean Union, true to the anti-labour Lisbon Strategy, is shifting the weight of responsibility onto the workers, and is strengthening privatisation in the field of health and safety at work, proposing access to private external agencies, downgrading the role of public control mechanisms, and remaining silent about the responsibilities of enterprises.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
(CS) Mr Chairman, I would just like to ask whether today's special regime will be repeated or whether it was really only today's extravaganza.
Can you give me an answer, please?
As I understand it, this was an exceptional situation as regards the number of applications.
I hope that this situation will not be repeated.

Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)
Presentation of the programme of the Slovenian Presidency (debate)
Ladies and gentlemen, today is a very special day.
It is a special day because for the first time in the history of the European Union the representative, the Prime Minister of this country, namely Slovenia, has the Presidency of the European Union.
Slovenia is a country that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 along with nine other countries.
And it is the first time that one of the former communist countries now living according to the basic principles of freedom, democracy and parliamentarianism, namely Slovenia, has the Presidency of the European Union.
I therefore warmly welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, the Prime Minister of Slovenia, Janez JanÅ¡a.
Welcome to the European Parliament!
(Applause)
Today is also special for another reason, however, and I therefore extend a particularly warm welcome to the President of the European Commission, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso, because it is exactly 50 years ago that the first President of the European Commission, Walter Hallstein, convened his first Commission.
The 50th anniversary of the European Commission is another event for us to celebrate.
And so I also send the Commission, as an exception in this rather solemn context, all good wishes for this special birthday.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to listen to the report of the President-in-Office of the Council.
President of the Council. - (SL) It is my honour and pleasure to be with you here today, and indeed also a matter of pride.
I feel pride as a Slovene whose country is the first of the new EU Member States to be entrusted with the presidency of the European Council and also as a European whose Union is entering 2008 with a signed Lisbon Treaty and an enlarged Eurozone and Schengen area.
I assure you that in the months leading up summer I will be delighted, if you invite me, to come here more often, and certainly after each meeting of the European Council.
I look forward to close and constructive cooperation with the European Parliament throughout the six-month period.
Today is a historic day in many respects.
Slovenia is presenting its priorities for the presidency in the European Parliament as the first new Member State, as the first Member State from behind the former Iron Curtain, and also as the first Slavic country to lead the Council of the European Union.
This would not have been possible without the profound changes that have occurred on the European continent in the past quarter of a century.
They have enabled Europe to become united to a large degree, that is to say united in a union of peace, freedom, solidarity and progress.
All this was unimaginable to millions of Europeans only 20 years ago.
In May this year exactly 20 years will have passed since a very particular and personal experience of mine.
Allow me to share it with you since it is very symbolic of the changes I have just referred to.
In 1988, two other journalists and I, along with a non-commissioned officer, were arrested, imprisoned, tried and convicted before a military court because we had criticised the then totalitarian Communist regime in Yugoslavia, and in particular, the militaristic aspirations of the then Yugoslav army.
There were no fundamental rights of defence, no right to a lawyer, and no public presence.
We were tried in the middle of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, at that time still a republic of Yugoslavia, and tried in what was for us a foreign language.
Despite the trial being held in secret and the threats of intervention by the Yugoslav army, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and squares in peaceful protest.
They demanded respect for human rights and democracy.
They brought about the beginning of the changes.
Almost exactly 20 years later I stand before you today in this esteemed chamber, in the European Parliament, in the middle of Strasbourg, which I am able to reach without stopping at borders.
As the Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia and the President of the European Union, I can address you in my mother tongue.
If anyone had told me this was possible 20 years ago in my cell of the military prison I would obviously not have believed a word of it.
But it did happen and after only 20 years in the life of the same generation.
In that time Slovenia has established a democratic parliamentary system and a market economy and become an independent, internationally recognised country and is now a member of the European Union and Nato and part of the Eurozone and the Schengen area.
In 1988, 20 years ago, we had an income of around EUR 4 000 per capita in purchasing power, whilst in 2007 the figure was EUR 22 000.
We have reached 91% of the European Union average, last year our economic growth exceeded 6%, and we have the lowest unemployment rate in history and one of the lowest in the European Union.
The level of poverty is the second lowest in the Eurozone, we are the third least indebted member of the Eurozone, and we rank among the first six Member States on the European Union reform barometer.
Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the democratic changes similar great progress has also been made by the other former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe which are now members of the European Union.
Following the removal of the Schengen border between Italy, Austria, Hungary and Slovenia in December last year tens of thousands of people in Slovenia and on the other side of the former border spontaneously celebrated this symbolic act.
Those of you who were with us at that time - the President of the European Commission was there and there was great rejoicing in other places too despite the cold weather - were able to see that people's reactions were very emotional.
The situation was the same everywhere on the former borders of the one-time Iron Curtain from the Baltic to the Adriatic.
On that occasion I met an elderly Slovene couple among the happy crowd at the former border crossing.
Both had tears in their eyes.
They told me about the hardships they had endured for decades living on the hard border and later the humiliation they had suffered almost every time they had crossed the border.
The lady said she hardly dared to believe that all this was happening and that the border would practically no longer exist and that something was emerging which she had not even dared dream of 20 or even 15 years ago.
I wish that the members of the European Parliament who supported enlargement of the European Union and the Schengen area could have been there that December evening.
They would have found it very gratifying.
However, as it was not possible for all of you to be there, may I take this opportunity here to say 'thank you'.
Thank you on behalf of that elderly couple on the vanishing border at the former border crossing, on behalf of thousands, tens of thousands and millions, on behalf of the over 100 million Europeans of Central and Eastern Europe who 20 years ago where still on the other side of the Iron Curtain, some in prison with no political and many human rights who are now together in a united Europe, with genuine opportunities for a better life and opportunities the likes of which were never available to our predecessors.
(Applause)
You may not even be aware how immense the consequences have been of your decision to support our aspiration for freedom and show solidarity with us.
The decision is probably unprecedented in the entire history of human kind, a decision which would bring so much good to so many people.
I thank you on behalf of those of us who are here because you stood with us.
You were in no way forced to take such an unselfish decision - freedom and solidarity triumphed because you cared.
Those of us who belong to generations that were not born in the European Union probably have a more emotional view of everything that has occurred in recent years and decades.
For us, the European Union is not something to be taken for granted.
We know that another, far worse, alternative exists and that is another reason why we are prepared to do everything to ensure that the European Union is preserved, developed and strengthened.
Our principle objective is for Europe to make progress in as many areas as possible in the next six months.
We defined these key areas some time ago when we drew up the 18-month presidency programme together with Germany and Portugal.
It was a unique experience and working as a trio was excellent, as was the contribution of the European institutions.
This Parliament has been informed of the programme and the significant progress which our partners in the trio achieved last year in implementing the joint programme.
Slovenia will make every effort to complete everything that remains to be done.
Therefore, our starting point remains the abovementioned programme since we wish to maintain the continuity of European Union policies.
At the same time we will also devote ourselves to any new challenges.
As the final country in the trio we will ensure a smooth transition to the next trio.
The main achievement in implementing the programme thus far was the agreement on a new EU Treaty which was signed in Lisbon in December last year.
Let me express my appreciation of the personal commitment of Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister JosÃ© SÃ³crates which has led to this result.
Let us remember the uncertain and difficult circumstances in which the German Presidency took on this project a year ago.
The Berlin Declaration and the agreement in principle, contained in it, that the European Union should be given a new treaty basis, was the first breakthrough on the road to Lisbon.
Following successful agreement on the mandate for an intergovernmental conference at the European Council in June, the work of the German Presidency was successfully continued by our Portuguese colleagues.
Under their leadership the intergovernmental conference was successfully concluded and we gained the new Lisbon Treaty.
On this occasion I would like to highlight the important role and contribution of the European Parliament, in particular your representatives at the intergovernmental conference, in drawing up the new treaty.
I would also like to highlight the important role of the European Commission in reaching agreement on the new treaty.
I have followed this work closely.
I am familiar with it and can therefore speak from first-hand experience.
The President of the Parliament, Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, and the President of the Commission, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, demonstrated great personal commitment in offering strategic assistance to both presiding countries last year.
The synergy of the efforts made by all three key institutions of the European Union made possible the success and the signing of the Lisbon Treaty.
This Treaty will ensure greater effectiveness and democracy in the functioning of an enlarged European Union.
It will facilitate decision-making in many new areas and strengthen the role of the European and national parliaments.
However, our task was not ended by the signing of the Treaty.
We have entered the ratification period which - as we know from the 2005 experience - is the most sensitive stage in enacting a new treaty.
I should stress that ratification is an exclusive area of competence and responsibility of each Member State.
In that respect I would like to offer particular congratulations to Hungary which has already completed this process.
We hope that by the end of our presidency most Member States will have followed this example.
The Slovene Parliament will take a decision on ratification by the end of this month.
The objective is to enact the Treaty on 1 January 2009.
That means, amongst other things, that we will have a great deal to do as regards all the necessary preparations.
We are working closely with the next presiding country, France, to ensure that everything is ready in time to enact the Treaty.
In that connection we will also work closely with the European Parliament.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the progress of the European Union in the fields of economic reform in the Member States and the construction of the internal market has been encouraging in recent years.
During that period the EU economy has strengthened and productivity and employment have increased substantially.
During the next three-year cycle of implementation of the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment we must, above all, continue along the same lines as before and focus on investment in people, modernisation of labour markets, increasing entrepreneurial potential, providing reliable and affordable sources of energy, and protection of the environment.
In order to launch the new three-year cycle effectively at the European Council in spring, it is necessary to adopt, in good time, integrated guidelines for which the EU institutions are responsible.
Distinguished Members of the European Parliament, at this juncture I would like to reiterate the importance of constructive inter-institutional cooperation.
Implementation of well-planned reforms in the Member States with support from the institutions at European Union level, where the implementation of common policies means added value, is key to sustaining economic growth.
There are many problems which could challenge such growth and thus there is a need for constant reform and adaptation.
At present we are faced with a number of difficult challenges, key amongst them being the increase in oil and food prices and the prevailing turmoil on the financial markets caused by events on the mortgage market in the United States.
The Slovenian Presidency will devote all the necessary attention to alleviate the consequences of it.
To that end, a comprehensive programme of EU activities to strengthen the stability of financial markets will be laid down during the first half of the year.
There is a need for greater market transparency, strengthened supervisory mechanisms, and closer cooperation at international level.
Investment in people, knowledge, research and new technologies remains one of the bases of the Lisbon strategy.
A society based on creativity and knowledge is increasingly becoming a necessity for modern Europe.
However, investment in knowledge alone is not enough.
This year we have an opportunity for an in-depth debate on the kind of EU single market we want to see.
We must ensure that there will be no obstacles to the flow of ideas and knowledge.
At the European Council in spring we therefore wish to add a fifth freedom - the free flow of knowledge - to the four freedoms of the European Union where exceptional progress has been made thus far.
Greater mobility of students, researchers and lecturers will contribute to this.
The advantages of the EU internal market must become more accessible to consumers and small and medium-sized businesses.
Further rapid progress in actually establishing an internal market in services and innovation is key to implementing the European Union's reform strategy.
We intend to do our utmost to make progress in liberalising the internal energy market.
At the end of our presidency I would gladly report to you that agreement has been successfully reached on this matter.
We hope that we will succeed in taking the necessary steps towards a better, cheaper and reliable supply of energy for our citizens and businesses.
Distinguished Members of the European Parliament, as regards the future of the EU we must refer to the enlargement process which is not yet completed.
Enlargement is one of the most successful policies of the European Union.
In 2006 the European Commission demonstrated conclusively in its communication 'Enlargement - Two Years After' that the greatest enlargement to date, namely that in 2004, benefited both the old and the new Member States of the European Union.
A glance at the map of Europe confirms our impression that enlargement is an unfinished story.
It is vital that this process should continue in accordance with the undertakings entered into and on the basis of fundamental principles, primarily the principle that the membership criteria must be met.
The Slovenian Presidency will endeavour to continue the accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey on these bases.
The countries of the Western Balkans are a case in themselves.
When the EU presidency was last held by a country bordering on that region, namely Greece, the foundations for the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans were laid down in the Thessaloniki Agenda.
We consider that now, five years later, is the right time to confirm and consolidate the prospects of these countries joining the EU.
The presidency intends to promote their progress in this direction.
I should stress that we are not advocating lowering the criteria or providing a short cut.
Not at all.
We want the European Union to intervene more actively in this area and to step up its involvement in assisting these countries in their reform processes.
We should not forget that a firm and tangible prospect of EU membership is an essential lever for bringing about the necessary changes and reforms in these countries.
We therefore wish to strengthen that prospect, also by means of specific steps in a range of areas.
At the very core of the Western Balkans lies Kosovo.
In the 1970s Kosovo gained autonomy and became part of the federal system of the former Yugoslavia.
The status of Kosovo was virtually the same as that of the federal republics.
Fifteen years later MiloÅ¡eviÄ unilaterally removed that status and then attempted to carry out ethnic cleansing which was only stopped by the international community.
Following that intervention peace was restored but the question of Kosovo's permanent status has remained unresolved.
Today this is one the most demanding questions facing the European Union.
It would, of course, be desirable for the issue of Kosovo's status to be resolved in a manner which was entirely acceptable to the two parties directly involved.
Regrettably, the lengthy negotiation process shows that the possibilities for such an outcome have been exhausted.
Furthermore, it appears unlikely that it will be possible to reach agreement on the issue in the UN Security Council in the foreseeable future.
On the other hand, we all know that further delay in resolving the issue could drastically destabilise a large part of the Western Balkan region.
That would be the worst possible outcome.
Kosovo is above all a European issue.
The Slovenian Presidency will build on the decisions of the European Council in December.
We have the foundations on which to build consensus, we have the European Union's political agreement in principle to deploy a civilian mission to Kosovo, and we agree that maintaining the status quo is unsustainable and that the issue of Kosovo is a particular problem which cannot be applied to any other situation in the world.
Within this framework the presidency will coordinate solutions which enjoy the broadest possible support within the European Union and at the same time ensure long-term stability in the region.
However, Kosovo is not, of course, an island in this region.
All the countries of the Western Balkans are important to Europe, to the European Union.
It is more important to Slovenia than to many other Member States of the European Union as it lies in our direct vicinity and the present situation in the Balkans is an unfinished story in the geopolitical transformation following the end of the Cold War.
We would like it to have a happy ending.
We as the European Union bear responsibility for it and owe it to the nations and cultures of this region.
The stability of the region is extremely important to the European Union as a whole and attainable only within a European perspective.
Serbia has traditionally played an important role in the Western Balkans.
It is vital that we encourage Serbia on the road to Europe through an appropriate approach and in spite of the short-term turbulence and wavering.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate status back in 2005 but has still not been given a date for the start of negotiations.
It has implemented many successful reforms but still has to implement others and we must help it in that respect.
It must not become hostage to the wider situation in the region.
The earliest possible resolution of Kosovo's status is also very important to its internal stability.
We should also mention the role of Albania which had a distinct history after the Second World War but we now value for its contribution to stability in the region and its constructive approach to resolving the issue of Kosovo's future status.
We can also place in the same category Montenegro, which has also seriously embraced reform with a view to inclusion in the Thessaloniki Agenda.
The post-Dayton structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina with an international presence and internal political instability has shown us in recent months that this country requires special attention.
Much has already been done and support for its EU membership is strengthening, but further assistance is required.
We should not forget the refugees who have still not returned to their homes and the serious crimes that have as yet gone unpunished.
Punishment of these crimes against humanity, peace and reconciliation are of fundamental importance to the European future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There are numerous reasons for further strengthening our cooperation with neighbours, strategic partners and others.
I have today already mentioned the external border of the European Union.
Beyond that border we have important and valuable partners whom we must involve more in our various activities.
The European Neighbourhood Policy is a welcome tool for strengthening the area of stability and prosperity beyond our borders.
The eastern and Mediterranean dimension are equally important.
We should we forget Ukraine, Moldova, the Southern Caucasus and North Africa.
We need intensive dialogue and new circumstances repeatedly call for new forms of specific cooperation.
They are very welcome.
We would like to see strengthening of institutions and processes such as the Barcelona process and Euro-Med.
What we do not need is duplication or institutions competing with EU institutions which cover part of the European Union and part of the neighbouring area at the same time.
The EU is a whole and only as a whole can it be sufficiently effective in establishing peace, stability and progress in the neighbouring area and beyond.
We will also strengthen cooperation with our strategic partners in the world.
During our presidency we will organise four summit meetings: with the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.
We will establish cooperation with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean with the aim of achieving sustainable development and combating climate change and poverty.
During the Slovenian Presidency we would like to consolidate and, if possible, formalise our partnership and cooperation with the Russian Federation.
During the Slovenian Presidency the European Union will provide reliable support for the Middle East peace process.
The EU will cooperate in fulfilling the obligations entered into in Annapolis and Paris.
We want both Israelis and Palestinians to live secure, free and successful lives and will commit ourselves to the coexistence of two peaceful countries.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the time is coming for the European Union to have a new, strengthened role in the world.
Europe is entering 2008 with a signed Lisbon Treaty, an enlarged Eurozone and Schengen area, solid economic growth, a stable Euro and over three and a half million more jobs than at the beginning of the previous year.
Therefore, we have many reasons to conduct the European Council with ambition, with optimism and - I hope my French friends will not take this amiss - with vision.
Such vision is always necessary.
Because if you don't know how to adjust the rudder, every wind is the wrong wind.
There is a great deal of wind, in particular the wind of change.
The last two decades of change have not only affected Europe, the whole world has changed.
Moreover, in recent years it has done so faster than before.
Some changes have already occurred but have not been fully assessed.
We have much to say about the economic rise of India and China.
In 2005, at the beginning of the UK Presidency, I listed to a speech by British Prime Minister Tony Blair given in this esteemed chamber.
He pointed to these changes and to the growing strength of two new economic superpowers, India and China.
Incidentally, this week those two countries signed a number of bilateral economic and trade agreements.
These new players are rapidly investing in knowledge, research and development and enhancing their competitiveness.
It has correctly been concluded that the European Union is compelled to reconsider and take steps to ensure that its competitive situation does not deteriorate.
In recent years we have listed all our deficiencies and spoken about measures to remedy them.
Many of those measures have been carried out, some, unfortunately, have not.
However, I do not wish to speak again about the objectives and obligations stemming from the Lisbon Strategy.
Finally, I wish to say that it is not sufficient to address the changes facing the European Union in a global world solely in terms of competitiveness and the fight against terrorism.
Both responses are correct, but not sufficient.
At a global level the European Union faces the following key challenges to which, sooner or later, it will have to provide answers in addition to those we have heard so far.
The first challenge is the issue of UN reform and the establishment of a new world order.
The European Union can play a key role in this reform.
The second challenge is combating poverty.
This is one of the absolute priorities.
The international development aid provided by the European Union is substantial but not always used effectively.
If it is to be more effective, we primarily need to do two things: one, focus on education, that is to say raising educational levels in poor societies, and, two, purchasing food and other goods to be donated as development aid in the countries and regions at which the aid is targeted.
That is the only way we can effectively help strengthen their agriculture and economies and root out the causes of poverty in the long term.
As regards international development aid, the word 'competitiveness' must be replaced with the word 'cooperation'.
We should be heartened by the fact that the less developed countries are becoming more developed and the poor are becoming richer.
The more countries are developed, the more they will be able to help combat poverty.
The third challenge is combating climate change.
With the conclusions of last year's European Council the European Union became a global leader with increased credibility and much stronger influence.
We must retain this role.
We will achieve this also by ensuring, when negotiating with our global partners, that the same criteria we apply internally are also applied externally as regards sharing the burden in the fight against climate change.
The fourth challenge is, of course, intercultural dialogue.
It is needed more than ever before.
In the long run the conditions for world peace and a response to the greatest security threat to the modern world cannot be created without it.
Therefore, we are pleased that 2008 is also a year in which the European Union is devoting great attention to intercultural dialogue.
We are also pleased that the President of the European Parliament was able to attend the opening ceremony in Ljubljana at the beginning of the month and that the European Parliament is to organise a large number of important events in that connection.
You are making a very significant contribution, firstly, to reinforcing awareness of the need for such dialogue and, secondly, to us taking genuine steps forward.
From time to time we hear that the above issues are not really true priorities of the European Union and that we should deal with domestic problems, but I am convinced that that is too narrow a view because the establishment of peace and security for our citizens, stable and secure EU energy supplies and the management of migration pressures on the European Union largely depend on how we resolve these four key issues in future and how the European Union exercises its increased role and influence in a global world.
The more the European Union is capable of acting as a global player on these bases, the greater guarantees it citizens will have of peaceful and secure lives and stable economic and social development.
Ladies and Gentlemen, allow me to conclude by assuring you that Slovenia will take on, or has taken on, this task before it with complete responsibility and after three years of intensive preparations.
Our presidency may not be on such a large scale as the French and as high-profile as the German, and perhaps our civil servants do not have such long-standing and excellent traditions as the British.
We may make mistakes, say something too directly or quite naively.
However, we promise to work responsibly and apply ourselves to the substantive issues.
We will not compete for the spotlight.
That is not important to us.
We know where we started from 20 years ago when Slovenia was underestimated by many.
We are aware of what we have had to do to be successful and to be here today.
It is our greatest wish that our contribution will, each month, create more satisfied Europeans so that one day any person walking down the street in any town in Europe will answer immediately, when asked whether he is concerned about the future of the European Union, 'I care about the future of Europe because I know Europe cares about me.'
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are perhaps not there yet, but we are not far off and clearly on the right track.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Many thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister JanÅ¡a.
It is wonderful that Slovenia has the Presidency.
The Group Chairmen will soon be expressing their affirmations, but I can say now, on behalf of the entire Parliament, that the European Parliament stands alongside Slovenia in creating a successful European Union and we are therefore sure that the Slovenian Presidency will be a great success.
Now I would like to ask the President of the Commission to speak to us.
President of the Commission. - Mr President, Prime Minister, Members of Parliament, my first word goes to the Slovenian Presidency.
Indeed, it is the first time a Member State of the last enlargement has assumed this very important responsibility.
Slovenia is a great example of the success of the enlargement.
It was the first country to adopt the euro.
The example of Slovenia demonstrates that the Member States which joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007 are now at the core of European integration.
It also shows the very important European credentials of Slovenia.
I wish to express to Prime Minister JanÅ¡a my full support for the next six months for the very important task of being President of the European Council.
You, Prime Minister, dear friend, and your country, are symbols of the struggle for freedom, a fundamental value for Europe.
And thank you for reminding us of these great celebrations of Schengen.
I was very moved to be with you and with others on that border between Slovenia and Italy, and I will not forget the words you used at that moment, reminding us that, about 20 years ago, people were killed there by the Yugoslav Army when they were trying to reach freedom, to reach Italy, to reach the European Union.
It was indeed a very impressive journey that I undertook with Prime Minister Socrates and the President of the European Council, and at the end of December we visited Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic; we were also on the border between Estonia and Finland, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria, and we saw the emotion expressed in the eyes of so many people.
I think it is important to remind ourselves about this, from where we are now.
Listening to you today, Prime Minister JanÅ¡a, could only reinforce my firm belief that this enlargement of 2004-2007, which united Europe in peace and democracy, is indeed one of the greatest achievements of European history, and we should be proud of it.
The Commission will work very closely with the Slovenian Presidency on central issues of its programme, such as the stability of the Western Balkans, Kosovo, and Bosnia in particular, but also enlargement, the European neighbourhood policy, asylum and immigration, cooperation with strategic partners and intercultural dialogue.
Let me concentrate on three issues that are very much linked with our responsibility.
I would like to focus on three priorities: the Treaty of Lisbon, the package on energy and climate change, and the renewed Lisbon Strategy.
The year 2007 leaves the European Union in good shape.
Progress towards the conclusion of a new Treaty met our expectations.
The Union followed the roadmap that was presented by the Commission in May 2006: first the Berlin Declaration, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and outlined a vision for the future of the Union; then the June European Council, where we agreed - under the German Presidency - on a precise mandate for the IGC; and finally, the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon in December.
The process of reaching agreement showed a remarkable degree of consensus between Member States and European institutions on the way forward.
We have a credible and balanced Treaty, and I believe that it provides strong foundations for the future.
We have avoided much of the disunity and disagreements of previous institutional debates.
This leaves the Union in good shape to ensure we deliver our political priority for this year.
The political priority for this year is the successful ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
I call on all Member States to proceed swiftly and decisively to ensure ratification of this European Treaty.
Next week, the Commission will adopt the climate change and renewable energy package.
Our proposals meet the ambition set by all Heads of State and Government in last year's Spring European Council, who called for precise and legally binding targets.
The Commission is now acting on that mandate.
I see with great satisfaction that this is also a priority, both for the Slovenian Presidency of the Council and for Parliament.
We will have to work hard to have the package adopted by the end of 2008.
Our package will complement the proposals presented last year on the energy internal market.
A European energy market will give more options and better prices to European citizens, and it is essential to meet the three central challenges which the European Union faces in energy: competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply.
We knew from the very beginning that transforming Europe into a low-carbon economy is not an easy task.
But this is the moment to be serious, responsible and coherent with our commitment.
The Commission will follow a balanced approach to efforts asked of the Member States.
They start from different places; they have different circumstances; some are more able than others to finance investment.
We also need to minimise the costs of adaptation for European industry and to address the challenges faced by energy intensive industries.
The Commission is well aware of these realities, as our proposals will show.
But do not expect us to compromise on the European interest, which is to lead global efforts to fight climate change, to ensure energy security and to provide a competitive advantage to our economies.
Both our international credibility and the credibility before European citizens depend on the fulfilment of the targets established in March 2007.
Bali was a great success in setting out a roadmap to agreement, but our package next week is a clear demonstration of our willingness to put our money where our mouth is.
The energy and climate change package should be seen as an opportunity for Europe in economic terms.
It will encourage innovation and it will increase competitiveness.
It is a mistake to set the fight against climate change against the competitiveness of European industries.
The Union should lead global efforts to tackle climate change, and European industries should continue to be world leaders.
At the same time, we will also create new markets and new jobs and will have the 'first mover' advantage in many of those sectors.
It is true that our package aims at a more environment-friendly Europe, but it will also contribute to a more industry-friendly, a more job-friendly and a more consumer-friendly Europe.
It will be a win-win initiative.
Three years after the relaunch in 2005, the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs is working.
It has contributed to a better performance of the European economy, in particular to the creation of 6.5 million new jobs over the last two years.
We expect the creation of five million jobs up to 2009.
Structural reforms are also helping economic growth and improving the prospects for European long-term prosperity.
These are very encouraging achievements.
As we launch the next Lisbon cycle, we need to take ambitious decisions in the Spring Council on areas such as research, innovation, the business environment, professional skills and the qualification of labour.
The Commission is making proposals to turn the fifth freedom - the free movement of knowledge - into a European reality in order to speed up innovation and make it available to a higher number of European citizens.
We also need a Small Business Act for Europe to foster the growth of the small and medium-sized enterprises.
Those small and medium-sized enterprises create nine out of ten new jobs.
This is a priority for the Commission in 2008.
Last but not least, Europe needs active labour policies: policies that give people the skills to realise their potential, and policies that allow our citizens to secure their employability.
Investing in people is the surest way to guarantee our citizens that they will remain employed in spite of moving from job to job.
We need to offer prosperity, not just for some, not even only for the majority, but for all.
This is why investing in people and modernising labour markets remains one of the four priority areas for the new Lisbon cycle.
We must promote the entrepreneur spirit of Europeans: the creation of jobs, innovation and competition are keys to European success.
Economic forecasts for 2008 and 2009 are already slightly less optimistic, and we should take these signals seriously.
We know that the cause of this is some financial instability coming from the other side of the Atlantic.
Yet we should fight negative discourses.
Our economic fundamentals are sound and solid.
We also know that economic downturn could blunt the readiness to pursue economic and social reforms.
It may be a natural reaction, but it would be the wrong lesson to draw from past experience.
Global competition and the prosperity of our citizens require that Europe continue its reform process to be a more competitive economy.
This is the only way to keep our model, our European model of social cohesion.
One of the keys to success in 2007 was the Commission's ability to work well with Parliament and the Council.
We would never have had agreement on the Lisbon Treaty or solutions for difficult dossiers like the European Institute of Technology and Galileo without this partnership approach.
The triangular institutional partnership between Parliament, the Slovenian Presidency of the Council and the Commission will be crucial to our success in 2008.
With a ratified Treaty, an agreed energy and climate change package, and a delivering Lisbon Strategy of growth and jobs, we will certainly have in 2009 a more confident and a better prepared Europe to face the future.
Finally, let me thank President PÃ¶ttering for his congratulations on the 50th anniversary of the first meeting of the European Commission.
Indeed, it has been a long journey since 1958 for this institution.
The European Commission has been at the centre of the European integration process as a source of dynamism and ambition, as a reference for all those who believe in the European project.
Today I am proud to be leading this institution at the beginning of the 21st century as we face new challenges and require new solutions.
The European Commission will remain loyal to Walter Hallstein and all the founding fathers who, 50 years ago, launched this great institution as a central player in our common project.
In close cooperation with Parliament and with the Council, we will continue to promote our common goals: a strong Europe, an open Europe, a Europe of freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
And we are quite sure that, working hand-in-hand with the Slovenian Presidency and with Prime Minister JanÅ¡a, we will achieve concrete results for our citizens.
Many thanks, Commission President.
Walter Hallstein said on 16 January 1958 - I quote, because it is a short sentence addressed to the Members of the Commission: 'Your work will bear fruit, however, only when there is close cooperation with the other bodies, particularly the Council of Ministers and Parliament's Assembly.'
End of quote.
Today we are the European Parliament and what applied then in 1958 also applies today in 2008, and I have no doubt at all that, when the European institutions work together, they will also be successful.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the European Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is fortunate that the desire of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for Europe in 2008 to be effective and able to respond to the concerns of its citizens coincides with the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union.
Slovenia, your beloved country, Prime Minister JanÅ¡a, is indeed a country that works.
The macroeconomic indicators and nature of the political debate prove this.
Slovenians are in the vanguard of making people feel they belong to Europe.
Slovenians are among the most effective at achieving the Lisbon objectives.
During her journey to EU accession and since 2004, Slovenia has achieved many successes.
What we have done, or not quite done, in 50 years, Slovenia has managed to do in 10, while making the difficult transition from socialism to a market economy, without disrupting society.
A strong privatised economy, stable inflation, rising salaries, a relatively low unemployment rate and above all a strong currency that enabled you to join the euro in 2007.
You have also joined the Schengen area and you are now the first of the new Member States to take the reins of the EU.
The Slovenian Presidency undeniably marks the integration of the new Member States within the European Union.
By taking responsibility for following through the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty, by directing the efforts being made by the 27 Member States to meet the challenges Europe has to face in terms of energy and climate change, growth and employment, by continuing the integration process of the Western Balkans, by contributing through your initiatives to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which will provide the chance to reaffirm the values of openness, tolerance and dialogue that are at the heart of the European project, the Slovenian Presidency is showing that the countries that have joined the EU since 2004 are now familiar not only with the EU's institutional affairs, but also with its internal functioning and the way Europe asserts its interests at international level.
President of the Council, the PPE-DE Group will be alongside you, supporting the achievement of your priority objectives.
The future of Europe will be played out with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Effectiveness is therefore vital if ratification is to be achieved so that new instruments are available by the time of the European Parliament elections in 2009.
Our group will also support your efforts to launch the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy effectively and to guarantee a prosperous, equitable and environmentally-friendly future for Europe and ensure our economy is in a good position to benefit from the opportunities offered by globalisation.
Therefore, to create favourable conditions for social growth, to make knowledge and innovation drivers for growth and to find answers for demographic challenges, energy supply and climate change, Europe must play a dominant role in negotiations with its global partners on a post-Kyoto system.
President-in-Office of the Council, concerning the Balkans and the prospects for the Western Balkans joining Europe, we will support your efforts to foster stability and cooperation in the region, because the security and prosperity of the whole EU depend on this.
The EU and your Presidency must play their part in resolving the issue of Kosovo's status.
The bridging role between East and West that Slovenia has often played in Europe historically and geographically is an asset for the EU and its Member States.
At the crossroads of all the influences that have marked the history of our continent, Slovenia is a constant thoroughfare for people, goods and cultural currents of all kinds.
Slovenia will be the ideal promoter of dialogue between the different cultures, creeds and religious and spiritual traditions in the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, this I say on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I look forward to an effective Europe in 2008, a successful Europe. The EU Presidency is undoubtedly a considerable challenge for a country like Slovenia, particularly in view of its human resources and the size of its government administration, as you have said.
However, President-in-Office, other EU Member States - Luxembourg, Austria - have proved many times over that European conviction, tradition and performance are not measured by the size of countries.
All the best to the Slovenian Presidency!
(Applause)
Many thanks to my colleague, Martin Schulz.
Conventions in the House make it impossible - or at least not customary - for a proper answer to be given to the President on tongue-in-cheek contributions from Group Chairmen.
If I had been in another role, it would have been a pleasure to give you an answer, but I am grateful for Walter Hallstein's friendly comments.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to address some remarks to Prime Minister JanÅ¡a.
President-in-Office, my group comes to you with one simple message: 'Europe expects'.
It expects 2008 to be a year of progress.
We expect that progress to start now.
And we expect your Presidency to rise to the challenge.
I have no doubts you will.
Was it not a feisty Slovene who, raising his fist against a mighty empire, first declared: 'All roads do not lead to Rome!'?
Well, neither do they lead to Paris, and this is not the start of the French Presidency.
It is an historic first for the countries which entered our Union in 2004.
President-in-Office, your country may be small in size but we know that it is mighty in spirit, and we know too that Europe's Davids often make better presidencies than its Goliaths.
True to form, your Presidency's programme combines quiet ambition and a consensual style, which have the potential to unite our continent.
Such unity will be vital to the early ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and to mustering support for an interinstitutional agreement on how to govern Europe under that new Treaty.
On interinstitutional cooperation, we would welcome much dialogue with you and a greater presence of your Government in this Chamber.
We regret that your seat was empty yesterday when we heard from the first guest in our Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Your programme speaks of the importance of internal dynamism - and that, Mr Schulz, is the way to create jobs and to maintain jobs in this continent: internal dynamism.
We rely on you, President-in-Office, to push forward the single market in energy, in telecoms, in health-care services.
The European Union has a hard enough time convincing its citizens that it adds value to their daily lives, so, in a clear-cut case for faster medical care, for lower bills, for greater consumer choice, we would be mad to push proposals for patients' rights off the table just because they are controversial.
In other areas, you will have to flex your muscles a great deal more - particularly with your presidential counterparts who have a vested interest in promoting nuclear energy as the panacea of climate change.
Solidarity and burden-sharing are the key to success in cutting emissions and meeting renewable energy targets.
In 2008, our Union must show, as President Barroso said, that it can turn fine words about combating climate change into action.
Progress in the Western Balkans is rightly one of your priorities and your experience and understanding of the area will be a bonus to our Union.
Nonetheless, I suspect that maintaining, as you do, that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is worse than that in Kosovo does not reflect majority opinion in the Union.
Nor am I sure it is a good way to motivate the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
If it is designed to appease Serbia, it will not work.
Sweetening the pill of Kosovo's independence with a Stabilisation and Association Agreement may be a way forward.
But, while Mr ÄeliÄ readies his pen to come to Brussels, my group reiterates - in the strongest possible terms - that there can be no Stabilisation and Association Agreement without Serbia's full cooperation with the ICTY.
(Applause)
Serge Brammertz, the new Chief Prosecutor, has yet to see fresh evidence of cooperation.
None of us, President-in-Office, wish to see Serbia remain on Europe's sidelines, and your Presidency's courteous and constructive attitude may well bring it in from the cold and deliver Ratko MladiÄ.
But in the mean time, as you say in Slovenia, 'pray for a good harvest, but keep on hoeing'.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the Slovenian Government is taking over the responsibility of the EU presidency at a time of many challenges.
The European countries have to tackle ratification of the Treaty; the spotlight is being trained on the Balkan region; an agreement has to be reached at EU level on the energy package; and new impetus has to be found in order to resolve the conflict between Palestine and Israel.
As has rightly been commented on by colleagues already, the list of what Europe needs to be doing is endless.
The range of topics and decisions and the areas of interest and of conflict that have to be dealt with are enormous.
Rather than give lectures to you on what you fail to do or on what others may fail to do in the future, I shall focus briefly on three areas.
Firstly, the Reform Treaty, the Lisbon Treaty: its ratification is essential for the onward development of the European Union.
Secondly, with regard to future enlargements: we must ensure that candidate countries feel they have an opportunity and a chance to become members of the European Union in the near future.
Thirdly and, in my opinion, most importantly, Kosovo and what is happening there, and a peaceful transition from its present status to whatever future status may emerge.
We have already seen tremendous success in Kosovo where joint police forces from both ethnic groups are patrolling jointly in each other's areas, where there is no longer that idea of a single police force for a single people, but a joint police force for all the people of Kosovo.
Your experience, Mr Prime Minister, as a rebel in one sense, as an intellectual but, most importantly of all, as a democrat and as the voice of reason that could lead your country from the dark ages of Communism into the bright lights - sometimes dimmed because of energy crises - and future of the European Union, that kind of image and that kind of imagery is what is most important to the people of Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo and, indeed, Turkey.
I look forward to working with you and with your Government.
Despite the fact that you may be small as a country, not only are you big in spirit but there is also great quality there.
As has already been proven by your own starting of this process, you are not afraid to stand up to the 'big boys' when they try to bully you around the place.
But, most importantly of all, what you bring is the moral certainty of where you have come from.
What the European Union needs today is new heroes - heroes who know what it is like not to have freedom; heroes who know what it is like not to have the freedom of speech, liberty and democracy.
That is the best light that we can shine in the dark corners of the European continent today.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are quite sentimental about Europe and what it has achieved as a model of peace and democracy and what it might achieve in terms of boosting people's freedom and well-being and representing a centre of innovation and consistency in tackling global environmental challenges.
We are therefore delighted to welcome you here today, but we are a little sad that this experience might in some ways be a unique one, because, as you know, one of the reforms of the Lisbon Treaty is the election of the President of the European Council.
This is something that is of concern to us, partly because none of the candidates who have been put forward would in my opinion be able to advance the cause of Europe very far.
Having said that, however, I would like to mention some specific points that are especially relevant for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
As the President of the Commission mentioned, during your Presidency the 'energy package' is to be presented: this is the result of the work done by all last year and we know that there is a widespread commotion about it and manoeuvring and pressures are already in progress to diminish its value and impact.
We believe that a fundamental aspect of your Presidency will be to resist these pressures from both major and minor players to restrict and weaken the impact of these regulations.
We will also continue our battle on principle, on which I believe that we will be in disagreement.
In our view, a low carbon economy - here I am also addressing the President of the Commission - cannot be a nuclear economy; funding and wasting time on a new nuclear future which does not exist yet or on expensive technologies of uncertain application such as carbon sequestration and storage are actually in direct competition with the true renewable energies which we should encourage and fund: sun and wind energy, and energy saving, this latter being the most promising prospect for innovation and employment.
Another important issue during your Presidency will be coordinating territorial and urban development, which will be highly important in view of the Spring Summit and which make reference to the follow-up to the Leipzig Charter: safeguarding the quality of our cities and the enhancement of territorial cohesion are perhaps less in fashion than other issues, but we believe them to be absolutely crucial in the battle against climate change.
Waste legislation will also probably be completed during your Presidency.
We are extremely concerned, not only by what is happening in my country, in Naples, but also because it seems to us that the lip service paid to the hierarchy of waste strategies, placing a priority on prevention and re-use, is actually contradicted by the text of this legislation, which once again gives priority to incinerators, which, in our view, are definitely not the only way of solving the waste problem.
There are two important issues relating to trade and data protection on which we would really like to see whether your Presidency will truly be a friend to this institution or not.
You will have to battle hard with some of your colleagues on the issue of Parliament's assent to the economic partnership agreements with the ACP countries, which, following the strong disagreements with the African countries that emerged in Lisbon, we view as more vital than ever.
Then there is freedom of access to negotiating documents on the partnership and cooperation agreements with countries such as China.
Just think - the European Parliament has not yet been told anything at all about how these negotiations are going.
Everything is being done in total secrecy!
We believe that there ought to be an open debate on this issue and that this Parliament should at least be informed about what is going on.
Finally, President-in-Office, I would like to mention the data protection issue.
We know that the Council is planning to take a decision on this during your Presidency, but we would ask you to be courageous and request that implementation of this framework decision be postponed until after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, because this would enable Parliament to play a direct part in the reform; my fellow Member will speak to you about this again later on, I ask you, President-in-Office, to hold the first national conference on the Roma people during your Presidency.
This would make a significant contribution to intercultural dialogue.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, for this first Presidency of a new Member State, Slovenia is inheriting a number of rather thankless tasks from its predecessors.
Thus, as regards the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, you are required to ensure that no Member State apart from Ireland sets the bad example of organising a referendum, including countries that have made firm commitments to do so.
This is to some extent like moving backwards at a time when the EU's citizens and institutions are supposed to be moving closer together.
Frankly, you deserve to have been given a nobler ambition.
At the social level, the Presidency will first have the difficult task of getting things moving again on two emblematic draft directives, one on working time and the sadly famous opt-out, and the other on temporary work and equal treatment of employees.
Nor will it escape a substantive discussion on the action to be taken in the wake of the recent judgments by the European Court of Justice in the Laval/Vaxholm and Viking Line cases, which lend legitimacy to social dumping.
My group, moreover, has requested a debate on this matter to be put on the agenda of a forthcoming parliamentary session.
This brings up again the whole problem of the Bolkestein Directive and the provisions of the treaty on which it is based.
In the midst of the ratification of a new text that includes all these provisions, this makes for a real muddle.
Finally, again on the social level, Europe is facing increasing demands for higher pay.
Indeed its share of added value has been diminishing for some decades.
It has never been so low, as even the financial press are pointing out.
Yet, the European Central Bank has just threatened to raise interest rates if this demand, however legitimate, is met, despite the fact that profits have never been so high, as the experts acknowledge.
If we do not put this issue on the agenda, it will soon make its own way there.
I recall that the joint document of the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies underlines in point 68 that, I quote 'The overarching aims of the three Presidencies will be to strengthen the European Social Model as an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy'.
As the adage goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating!
A word also about another sensitive subject: that of illegal migrants.
In its current state, the draft directive on their return deserves the 'outrageous directive' label given to it by organisations that defend human rights.
Adoption in its current state would cast an unkind light on the good intentions expressed by the EU in the context of intercultural dialogue.
To conclude, I would like to mention the problem of Kosovo.
Before any decision is made, surely it would be justified to have clarification on a three-pronged question?
Firstly, how to explain the fact that two billion euros of aid from the international community have, in the space of seven years, resulted in non-existent economic development, endemic poverty, 50% unemployment, and the proliferation of corruption and mafia networks?
Secondly, how to explain the fact that 17 000 NATO soldiers have proved unable to prevent the destruction of dozens of orthodox buildings, the kidnapping or murder of hundreds of Kosovar citizens from minority communities and the forced exile of thousands of others?
Finally, how will the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo and the replacement of UNMIK with the European Union solve these vitally important problems while guaranteeing the stability of the Balkans?
I would be curious to hear your response.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office for the nice visit we had to Slovenia before Christmas.
President-in-Office, I hope you will lead the European Council better than you led the meeting group leaders had with you: you took most of the speaking time yourself and you said nothing we did not know in advance; you did not allow your ministers, whom I would expect to know their subjects, to answer most of our questions; and you did not send the answers in writing afterwards.
A parliament also contains an opposition with certain rights.
Yesterday I received a petition from 571 Slovenian journalists criticising you for not respecting their press freedom.
Will you allow an independent investigation?
Last week you were reported to have asked Portugal to cancel the possible referendum supported by most Portuguese voters.
May I remind you of the existing Nice Treaty, which requires you to take all decisions as close to citizens as possible?
To cancel a referendum is a violation of this article.
Member States can be criticised but not punished, because ratification is still a national competence.
The behaviour of a presidency and the European Commission is a Community affair.
You have to respect the national ratification procedures.
If you say something, you should remind Member States of the joint legal obligation to legislate as close to the citizens as possible.
You violate the Treaty, and so does the European Commission when it does not behave as guardian of this Treaty article.
You are part of a political agreement among prime ministers to avoid a referendum.
This agreement is a violation of the Treaty.
The Commission should have protested it instead of supporting the attempt to avoid the peoples of Europe.
Read Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union once more: 'Decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen'.
What a wonderful sentence that would be, if it were implemented!
The Lisbon Treaty was decided in as closed a way as possible and as far away as possible from the voters.
Now it seems that only Ireland can save our European democracy.
But the Council could at least publish a consolidated version of the Lisbon Treaty, so that you would be able to read what you have signed.
On 17 December 2007, Hungary signed a text it had not even received!
This is not a way to decide close to the citizens or the Members of Parliament.
Mr Bonde, we look to you as Chairman of your Group to ensure that you and your colleagues acquit yourselves in the House as parliamentarians.
Face up to the challenges in your own right rather than merely targeting others!
(Applause)
- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, as a Member from Carinthia, an immediate neighbour of Slovenia, it is awe-inspiring and a pleasure for me that a nation that only 20 years ago was groaning under the yoke of communism is now in charge of the European Union for six months.
This is proof for me that the path of European integration away from the catastrophes of the 20th century is the right one in itself to freedom and unity.
When I hear that Slovenia's aim during this Council Presidency is primarily to introduce all the states of the former Yugoslavia to the European Union, then I believe that it is right and it is important, in order to round off this process of European integration territorially, as it were.
I believe that this is considerably more important than, for example, the accession negotiations with a country like Turkey, whose primary territory is in Anatolia, in Asia.
I believe that this process of introducing states of the former Yugoslavia to the EU would need to take place primarily in such a way that it enables Europeans to act without the influence of powers outside Europe, for instance the United States of America and Russia.
I hope that Slovenia is able to bear in mind first and foremost Croatia's desire for EU membership and that conflicts like those surrounding fishing zones between Croatia and Slovenia, for instance, will not present any obstacle to this, because of the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Croatia, along with Slovenia, is undoubtedly the country that is most ready for Europe and a democratically mature, central European country.
On the issue of Kosovo, which will undoubtedly tax Slovenia's Presidency of the Council the most, the situation is such that on the one hand, we have to take account of the right of each people group to self-determination, the right of the majority of the Albanian Kosovars, but on the other hand, we also have to consider the historic rights of the Serbs.
Something like a US satellite state should not be allowed to emerge with Kosovo, nor should Serbia be driven into the arms of Moscow, into the arms of the Kremlin.
Kosovo's autonomy should not become a precedent for Turkish Northern Cyprus.
The aim should be stability in the Balkans and the rounding off of European integration in territorial terms.
Let me get down to discussing in a nutshell a bilateral problem between Slovenia and Austria: the issue of topographic signs in Carinthia.
I hope that the Austrian Federal Government will soon find a fair solution that satisfies the eminently well protected Slovenian minority in Austria.
By the same token, I hope that Slovenia also finds a sensible solution regarding the German-speaking Austrian residual minority in Slovenia and recognises these people as an indigenous minority, and that the cultural convention between Austria and Slovenia can be full of substance in this regard.
(SL) Ladies and Gentlemen, the programme of the Slovenian Presidency contains all the important topics of our time and is a good working basis for these six months.
With just two minutes, I will limit myself to only one area, i.e. citizens' freedom, administration of justice and internal affairs.
I expect the Slovenian Presidency to devote appropriate attention to following the effects of the "SIS 1 for allâ information system and accelerate the implementation of "SIS 2â.
The common asylum and migration policy must be based on close cooperation with the countries of transit and origin.
At the moment there are 27 different regimes and approaches to solving this problem and, of course, we have no illusions that such a complicated question can be resolved in such a short time.
However, we have to tackle this difficult task.
The third area is cooperation with Frontex, where the Slovenian Presidency, based on analysis of the Commission report, will prepare the guidelines for the future activities of that agency.
The fourth area concerns urgent harmonisation of the European visa policy and shaping of the legal groundwork for starting the operation of the European visa information system.
A red thread running through all the Presidencies so far has been the fight against organised crime and terrorism.
I support the proposed measures and suggest that we should at last start tackling the causes of terrorism as well.
Slovenia is one of the most successful members of the European Union in the area of e-administration and the elimination of administrative obstacles.
I therefore expect Slovenia, during its Presidency, to offer its good practice in every area to the other Member States.
I also hope for good cooperation between the Slovenian Presidency and the Parliament and Commission, and I am convinced that, after the Slovenian Presidency, it will be possible to say that the European Union has made a further step forward.
(SL) I am proud that the Prime Minister of Slovenia is addressing the European Parliament today in the capacity of President of the European Council.
As the Prime Minister said, this is also a testimony not only to the dramatic changes witnessed in Slovenia in the last twenty years, but also to the almost unimaginable changes we have witnessed within Europe itself in this very short period of history.
The Vice-President of the European Commission said in Ljubljana that the start of the Slovenian Presidency of the European Council was the end of the division between the old and new members of the European Union.
I would like to build on that beautiful thought by saying that until recently we could only listen to what the candidates and thereafter new members of the European Union expected from it.
Today Europe has the right to ask the Prime Minister of Slovenia, and Slovenia as the presiding country, what Europe can expect from Slovenia.
I think we are faced with an exceptional historic event which has its symbolic and real consequences.
It is my personal conviction that it can expect the most Slovenia can give.
In my opinion, Slovenia is well prepared for and totally focused on its international role and the presiding role of the European Council.
I would like to thank my colleague Mr Schulz for the support our group gave the Slovenian Presidency and, as President of the largest opposition party in Slovenia - the Social Democrats - I would also like to assure this esteemed House that, in the light of the parliamentary elections which will follow the end of the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union, I will not use the European politics of the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union to make it a target or a victim of our common endeavours for Slovenian success in this important international task.
The success of the Prime Minister will be the success of the Slovenian Prime Minister, that of the whole of Slovenia and also my own success.
I am convinced that at the end of the Slovenian Presidency we will be able to establish that, as someone said, there are no minor or major members of the European Union, and that there are only those which are a little bit more or a little bit less successful in their Presidency of the European Union.
My wish is that, with a modicum of luck, the Prime Minister and the Slovenian government will succeed in being counted among the more successful.
(SL) Prime Minister, your arrival and address today represent the start of the last phase of the full integration of Slovenia into the European Union.
Slovenia is the first country among the eleven new countries to have been able to take over the Presidency.
It is a great privilege for Slovenia and for Europe and I wish you great success in the Presidency.
However, the task of the Presidency is an arduous one, which is why I would like to ask you also about the injustices taking place in the European Union.
This question is addressed not only to you but also to the President of the Parliament and the President of the European Commission.
In 2004 ten countries joined the European Union.
It was actually only nine and a half as only part of Cyprus joined.
Two years later we announced the entry of Romania and Bulgaria and again we forgot about the northern part of Cyprus.
And even after Romania and Bulgaria had joined, we again said nothing about Cyprus.
Prime Minister, today you spoke of western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova, Caucasus and northern Africa without devoting a single word to the question of northern Cyprus.
It is as though they have been overlooked, wiped out, which is not good.
It is right that in Ljubljana you started a dialogue between cultures and religions.
And the area where we could really achieve great success is precisely Cyprus.
Cyprus needs to have a dialogue between cultures and religions so that those 200,000 innocent people can have an opportunity to become members of the European Union.
Also, Cyprus has just accepted the Euro as its new currency.
In the north they are still using the lira.
And finally, Prime Minister, when you spoke about your culpability, that you were tried in a foreign language, I would rather you had said Serbo-Croat, or Serbian.
Some people in this hall might think that you were perhaps tried in Russian.
Once again, I wish you complete success in your Presidency.
- (PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Prime Minister JanÅ¡a on taking up the Presidency of the Union.
This is a historic moment in the history of European integration, it being the first time that a new Member State has taken up the Presidency.
Slovenia is a country which has been affected on many occasions by the border changes that have taken place on our continent.
It is therefore a good example of European unification, not only from an economic, but also from a geopolitical aspect.
For this reason I believe that the next six months will be fruitful in stabilising the situation in the Western Balkan region.
I would like to express the hope that the Union's neighbourhood and enlargement policy will be given priority during this period.
I am counting on the aspirations of our eastern neighbour, Ukraine, also being received with more understanding.
I am glad that energy policy will also be one of Slovenia's priorities.
We are only too well aware that a secure Europe cannot exist without us ensuring our energy security.
There must be no future blackmailing of the European Union on energy by anyone, and I am convinced that Slovenia, a country that bore the burden of communism for more than 40 years, has an excellent appreciation of this.
Mr President, my congratulations to Slovenia, and welcome to Prime Minister JanÅ¡a: only four years a member of the EU and already the European Presidency.
It means work and responsibility, but it is also a proof of confidence in your young state, President-in-Office.
What worries and disappoints me - us, I should say - is that an impressive number of MEPs from very different countries and groups have still not received a clear answer to their repeated request as to whether Slovenia is going to host the first annual Roma conference.
A big thing, but also a huge challenge - and you are not alone.
The European Commission has offered financial support.
Moral support comes from the European Council which, in the Conclusions under point 50, underlines that the EU should appear with concrete steps on Roma issues.
Logistical support comes from the European Roma community, who expressed willingness to cooperate closely wherever they can.
Political support comes from many MEPs from different groups in this House who are aware of Europe's forgotten nation, the Roma, many of them still victims of the latest Balkan wars, living as refugees spread all over Europe.
Slovenia had a narrow escape, but it deeply experienced lack of freedom and safety itself.
I hope that Slovenia will take it as an honour to host the first annual Roma conference.
It knows it has many supporters - and maybe, I should say, fans.
Mr President, I too would like to wish the Slovenian Presidency well.
Today is indeed a historic day.
I do not doubt for a moment Slovenia's capacity as a small Member State to preside over a successful presidency.
I hope, President-in-Office, that you are really serious when you say that you wish to see a Europe that really cares and a Europe that puts the citizen at the centre.
I have to say to you that, if we were serious about making that more than rhetoric - making that reality - it would in fact require a radical step change in our approach and in the content of our policy in this institution and across the institutions of the European Union.
I share the concerns of a previous speaker at the fact that referendums will not be held in Member States on the issue of the Lisbon Treaty.
I come from a jurisdiction in which there will be a referendum and the people will have an opportunity to assess, in a real-life way, how they reckon this project is advancing and developing.
President-in-Office, in Ireland you caused something of a stir: you were reported in the media as saying that it is important not to launch some discussions that might cause problems in our country.
This indicates to us that you propose postponing controversial or difficult issues.
We would like to know what those issues are.
If we are serious about democracy in the Union, if we are serious about a Union that cares, we certainly have to ensure that full information on policy initiatives and direction are given to the people.
- (PL) Prime Minister, not long ago you said that the European Union was united not only by a common economy and policy, but also by the values of a common memory, culture and creativity.
I agree.
Greetings to you, Prime Minister, from Poland, the land of Adam Mickiewicz.
That prophet, as the French call him, once asked: Slavs, what can you offer that is new?
What do you bring with you to the world stage?
His message was that the Christian spirit has particularly penetrated certain European peoples, and all Christian progress also contains within it the progress of nations.
Europe - the mother of nations - is united by a Christian culture in both the west and the east.
Here in this Parliament the French President ValÃ©ry Giscard D'Estaing told me recently that he was always in favour of including a reference to the Christian God in the European constitution.
Prime Minister, you are right in saying that the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue is an opportunity for Europe to strengthen itself through culture.
Jean Monnet, now at rest in the secular PanthÃ©on in Paris, used to say that if he were to start over again, he would start with culture.
Christian culture and religion, as Professor Tadeusz ZieliÅski, buried in SchÃ¶ndorf near Munich, used to say, is expressed in human longing.
So let Slovenia, that small EU country, express this longing through its actions for the benefit of Christian culture in Europe.
This is where the greatness of your country in the EU lies; this is where the greatness of our Slavic EU countries lies.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the Slovenian Presidency wants to deal with the subject of the threat of climate change and with the policy of safe and sustainable energy.
I think that it is about time we take off the green populist spectacles and free ourselves from the unjustified scare of nuclear reactors.
We have an opportunity to stop taking money out of the citizens' pockets by immoral trade in emission permits, which are nothing but indulgences for the greatest polluters.
We have the opportunity to discard ludicrous taxes on fuel particles as well as technical pseudo-solutions, expenditure on which far exceeds their benefit.
Ladies and gentlemen, according to documented scientific conclusions nuclear energy is the form of energy that does not produce CO2 and minimises the aggravation of climate change.
It is also the cheapest low-carbon energy, it is reliable and it is safe.
In addition, nuclear energy reduces a country's dependency on the supply of fuel from unstable territories.
I am convinced that if we wish to act in the interest of the citizens of the Union and deal with climatic change, we should invest in research, development and education in the field of nuclear energy.
- (DE) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency of the Council on its comprehensive programme, the final phase of the programme of the three Council Presidencies, and also on the successful development of your own country.
You are part of Schengen, you are part of the euro area, and it really is a historic Council Presidency, of which I make the request that you do not do as all the others before you have done and present a programme that even a large country would not be able to accomplish in six months.
As a smaller country, you have the solidarity of the larger countries as well as of the European Parliament.
My request, however, is that you do not overdo things.
UN reform will certainly not be possible within six months under a Slovenian Presidency of the Council.
There are some very pressing problems pending, a few of which you have listed.
The most difficult will be the Kosovo issue.
Here, too, you are in a particularly difficult situation.
Another is the continuing development of the internal energy market, the agreement with Russia - these are the priorities you will in reality be able to address.
And if you succeed in moving ratification of the Lisbon Treaty forward, then you will be able to say at the end of this six-month Presidency: yes, as the first country from the former communist block, we have managed to shape this Council Presidency as a positive role model for prosperity, freedom and peace.
Finally, a minor observation for our colleague, Mr Schulz, who is no longer here.
He talked about the Socialist Group here - in Germany he keeps quiet about this - but we do know he has done so.
At the end he warned against right-wing radicalism, as though communism might have been a right-wing extremist system!
If I quote him correctly, he has also assigned you the task of bringing Turkey's membership forward.
The Commission has already confirmed that it is dealing with Croatia and Turkey even-handedly.
Do not get involved!
Leave this to the larger states, which have not been able to resolve it to date.
If you concentrate on the Western Balkans, you'll be doing Europe a great deal of good and you will potentially have a lot more success in this than in trying to resolve Turkey's problems!
- (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, do not be reduced to your role in the Balkans.
Continue to be a European Presidency!
I shall begin, however, with small matters, and I hope that my country, Austria, will also make an effective contribution to your Presidency by solving the outstanding problems concerning the Slovenian minority in Austria and that the Slovenian minority will now finally come into its own.
As rapporteur for Croatia, I do hope that Croatia will be able to make great progress during your Presidency.
You must contribute something to this, as must Croatia.
From you I expect that during your Presidency, you will implement the Treaty that you concluded with Prime Minister Sanader and that a solution will then be found to the disputed borders through appraisal by a third party.
I expect greater efforts from Croatia and, as regards the ecological fishing zone, I expect the promise to be kept not to extend and apply this zone to Croatia and Italy.
The greatest problem is certainly that of Kosovo and I am of the opinion that you are going down the right path.
You are acting with caution, calmly, but purposefully.
This is the solution to which we aspire in Kosovo because, let's be honest, it is not possible and not reasonable - either for Kosovo or for Serbia - for Kosovo to have a shared existence within Serbia.
This does not mean, however, that we do not share Serbia's concern and cannot understand why Serbia has great problems here.
However, one thing should also be stated very clearly for Serbia's ears, specifically to Prime Minister KoÅ¡tunica: we believe that the future of Serbia, of a democratic Serbia, a Serbia that also cooperates with the ICTY, lies in Europe!
If Mr KoÅ¡tunica believes that Serbia's future lies in Russia, that's his problem, but I do not believe that the population of Serbia would agree with him.
A clear signal should therefore be sent to Serbia under your Presidency: you must choose between Russia and the European Union on this issue.
We are making a straightforward offer to the entire region, and specifically to Serbia, to continue on the path towards the European Union in a reasonable period of time.
This is a massive task to perform and I'm sure you will perform it well!
(Applause)
Mr President, I want to combine two of the topics for the Spring Summit.
Firstly, climate change and the climate and energy package.
Of course, it is very difficult when you have to go from targets to tools.
This creates a burden on all our Member States.
Still, this is something we have to do.
I want to point out two areas where we have to be very cautious when we enter negotiations on this green package.
The first one is the social issues.
In this Chamber we have had a lot of debate when it comes to the Lisbon Strategy and to adding economic development to sustainable social development and environmental issues.
It is very important that sustainable economic development is reflected in the green package when it is delivered next week.
The second thing is technology neutrality.
Slovenia is a forestry country, as is my own country, Sweden, and I think it is very important that you have all the different alternative fuels on the table so that you can pick and choose and let innovation get the full potential of the whole thing.
Do not forget methanol and cellulose!
Finally, the Lisbon Strategy has to be a combination of climate and economic development.
Look at the transport sector, which is a perfect example of how trains and cars can achieve not only economic development and a better internal market, but also the goals of the energy package.
It is only by starting that the unachievable can become achievable.
I wish you all the best luck in the world, President-in-Office.
- (PL) Mr President, Slovenia is the first of the new Member States to take on the Presidency of the European Union.
This Presidency coincides with the year 2008, which has been designated as the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, so this is one of the main foundations of its programme.
It should be remembered, though, that such dialogue is possible only when the parties have a strong sense of cultural identity and wish to share this wealth with others.
The cultural foundation of Europe is Christianity, so Christian values should be promoted and strengthened, and not undermined.
It is difficult to discern such a positive approach in the most important EU documents that have been passed, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Reform Treaty.
They contain no references to Europe's Christian roots.
There has also been no serious debate on this subject in the forum of the European Parliament.
In this context there must be doubts as to whether the European Union, while neglecting, and thus eroding its own roots, is sufficiently prepared for an intercultural dialogue with strong partners from other regions of the world.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Barroso said, the Slovenian Presidency in itself represents a historic achievement and this allows us to reflect on the relationship between Europe and the Balkans region.
This has certainly been subject to criticism, partly because of the aspects of disintegration which it has involved, and Europe should now counter this by promoting peace and rapprochement, encouraged by the very relationship with Europe.
That is why we should avoid unilateral action on Kosovo, on which there should be a common European policy, as the new treaty, in any case, states.
We need to tackle the problems of the new external borders which have arisen as a result of some countries' accession to the European Union.
We need an active policy for social, economic and environmental integration which encompasses the entire area, and frankly I do not see nuclear power as a solution to energy problems.
Finally, I would like to remind the Slovenian Presidency of the problem of the 'erased', that is, those former Yugoslav citizens who still have citizenship problems in Slovenia, so that it may be definitively resolved.
- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, we were told very graphically as children how General Tito tore through the streets of Belgrade, people jumping aside - it was closed, no traffic regulations were in force.
To our youthfully naive way of thinking, this was the epitome of the arbitrariness and ruthlessness of a particular system.
Later we then noticed how proceedings were arbitrarily initiated against dissidents, against critics in the country from which they were able to escape.
Now you are here, and your joy is understandable, but be vigilant!
The Tito here, in his attitude, for instance, is our Secretary General, Harald RÃžmer, who tears through this city of Strasbourg and does not fear the consequences even if it is at 100 kilometres an hour and people also have to jump aside.
And unfortunately there are arbitrary proceedings against unwelcome critics even in this European Union.
I resolutely reject these attacks against the Secretary General of the European Parliament.
Mr President, may I warmly welcome the Prime Minister to Parliament and wish him well in his period as President-in-Office of the Council.
I feel sure that Slovenia will carry out the task ahead with great competence.
I welcome the emphasis given to the next stage in the Lisbon Strategy.
There remains much to be done to persuade Member States to reform their economies and I hope that the Presidency will advocate greater liberalisation, reforms to labour markets and ensure European business benefits from globalisation.
Europe needs to be more competitive, more focused on creating new jobs and less concerned with protecting a social model that hampers employment growth.
I want to see action on completing the internal market and, in particular, the telecoms sector.
I welcomed the announcement by the Commissioner last year on further liberalising the telecoms market.
We now have the opportunity to reassess the existing framework to get rid of bottlenecks and to map out a more competitive future for this crucial industry.
I look forward to hearing in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, where I am also the PPE-DE Group spokesman, how the Presidency intends to take matters forward.
I also welcome the commitment to pursue vigorously the energy and climate change agenda.
The EU has established tough carbon emissions targets and it is now incumbent upon Member States to follow through with real action, and not just words, to ensure burden sharing does not just end up as load shedding.
I read with concern in the press this week that some Member States are trying to undermine the EU agreement of last year on climate change, and we will pay particular attention to see that the British Government lives up to the commitments it has entered into.
(NL) Mr President, I would like to return to the situation with regard to Serbia.
I think that it is a good idea to set up a task force analogous with that for Croatia, as proposed by the Slovenian Presidency, to help Serbia cooperate fully and effectively with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
That could also clear the way - as far as I am concerned - for the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
I would also appeal to the government of my own country, the Netherlands, to cooperate and to support the Slovenian Presidency's proposal, and also to take a look at how well this has worked in the past with Croatia.
I would like to make a second comment about our neighbourhood policy.
Ukraine now has a new government, and negotiations are to start on the successor to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with that country.
We would like to know about the Slovenian Government's proposals and ideas, the form the negotiations should take and the intended result.
We are not in favour of offering membership to Ukraine at this time - that is definitely not on the table - but it is important to offer the country something more tangible in terms of its links with the European Union.
I would now like to say a few words about the situation with regard to Georgia, another country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Personally, I found the European Union's reaction to the election results and to the elections themselves rather too hasty and rather too positive.
There were large demonstrations afterwards.
A discussion is still under way about the irregularities that occurred in the course of the elections.
What I consider important now is that both the European Union and the Presidency take initiatives to at least foster links between the opposition in that country and President Saakashvili.
Finally, I would like to comment on the situation with regard to Russia.
Presidential elections are to be held shortly.
It appears that the way is clear for the opening of negotiations on a new partnership agreement with the country.
In our opinion, the whole issue of energy transparency is of particularly great importance in the preparatory negotiations for the new agreement.
We also want to engage in dialogue with Russia about the quality of democracy in that country, however, and in particular the problems we have experienced recently with election observation and the way we see this versus the way Russia sees it.
I hope that this subject, too, will be on the Slovenian Presidency's agenda.
- (PL) Mr President, I think we are anticipating that in 2008 the Slovenian Presidency will enable the European Union to settle the matter of the Constitutional Treaty and make preparations for its ratification, and that it will also enable a solution to be found to one of the awkward problems that Europe faces - the problem of Kosovo.
I think it is important to say, however, that besides these priorities there are certain tasks that favour them.
I would request that intercultural dialogue be seen as one such task.
I think that it lies among the values that create European unity, and that it also underlies a certain geopolitical value that EU policy may have.
It seems to me that in this particular context Europe may play the role of a bringer of peace in a situation in which the world appears to be in a state of international disarray.
I would further add that where Kosovo is concerned, it is exceptionally important for the problem of intercultural dialogue to be its context.
This will be the problem of the future for Kosovo.
Prime Minister, I wish the Slovenian Presidency success.
- (PL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I congratulate Slovenia on its Presidency of the Union and I wish Slovenia success, especially in ratifying the new treaty.
Little Slovenia has got in ahead of great big Poland, and that should be food for thought for us Poles.
Perhaps through Slovenia's example we will see a reduction in our fear of the Union and an increase in our faith that it makes sense.
After all, you, sir, are the second Slav, after John Paul II, to come to lead the culture of the whole of Europe, including its western part.
After its expansion in 2004, the Union looked forward to an influx of fresh blood, new brains and a new outlook, and through your proposal of a fifth freedom for the Union - the free movement of knowledge - you are meeting that expectation.
Your country, once a part of the former Yugoslavia, with its awareness of the problems of the worlds of Christianity and Islam, will certainly provide the impetus for a fair outcome for Kosovo, with respect for the rights of Serbs.
(SL) It is with joy and pride that I am sharing with you festive feelings accompanied, of course, by a strong feeling of responsibility and great opportunities.
I am convinced that Slovenia will also show through the Presidency that its inauguration, years ago, was not just a geo-political decision, but also an acknowledgement that we were willing to cooperate responsibly in the creation of a free, democratic and successfully united Europe.
I strongly support the ambition to implement the Lisbon strategy, which is crucial for our future.
In this sense I expect that Slovenia will do everything for advancement of the common policy in telecommunications and information technology.
That is essential for implementation of the Lisbon strategy, not only because of the contribution to the essential increase in competitiveness, but also to get closer to the citizens.
The citizens of Europe like to feel the common policy in their pockets and we were successful with the directive on roaming, which enables us to phone cheaper within Europe; the common policy in this area will certainly make it possible for us to feel the benefit of such policies more often.
My second emphasis is in the area of health.
I am very pleased, and I am not the only one in this Parliament, that the priorities of the Slovenian Presidency also include the fight against cancer.
It should become a permanent item on the agenda of the European Council.
Cancer is not only a matter for Health Ministers.
Every third citizen of Europe can expect to contract this disease and the trends are not promising.
It is a wide social and political question that is also connected with implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
If increasing numbers of people become ill, we will not be able to achieve higher productivity and better competitiveness.
Health is a vision, a dimension, and not just an activity sector.
I will be pleased if we achieve two things during the Slovenian Presidency.
Firstly, more attention should be paid to prevention in the fight against cancer, and secondly, interinstitutional working groups for the fight against cancer should be established.
This fight requires good, united coordination between the European parliament, the Council and the European Commission.
President of the Council, I wish you a successful Presidency.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Prime Minister, with your Presidency the new Member States have taken a new step on the road towards coming of age.
It is likely that your Presidency will contribute to melting the reservations that have never existed in the European institutions but which have been present in the everyday life of the European Union.
You have the first Presidency in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Our region knows that, next to the big red blob on our globe, Eastern Central Europe became a blob that was painted pink, but this region has never been all the same colour.
This region has always preserved its historical multicolour and diversity.
