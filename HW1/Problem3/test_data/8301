Instead, parents are to be given the opportunity to share the responsibility for children.
The third part I wish to highlight is that concerning equal treatment in matters of employment and occupation.
We should be concerned here not only with equal treatment for women already established in the labour market but also with non-discrimination when it comes to recruitment and employment conditions.
Â Â  Mr President, this resolution was intended to increase equal opportunities and improve the situation of women in the job market.
Many of the amendments will help change things for the better, but it would appear that if actual improvements are to be made, we must not only introduce legal standards, but above all change the way we think about womenâs role in social and economic life.
We must abandon liberal ideas, which are based on moral relativism, and move to an approach based on ethical and moral principles, which pay attention to the individual, whether female or male, and do not just see an item that may be used for profit.
Weaker individuals, and especially women, are particularly vulnerable to the risks of a utilitarian approach, which involves corporations, concerns and commercial chains refusing to grant maternity leave or pay wages, and women being forced into humiliating jobs or services.
Changes in the way we think must begin withÂ education at school, at home, in the workplace and in all areas of life.
Women are different in psychological and physical terms, and in our opinion should be prohibited from working in a number of jobs for their own protection.
Women who fight for equal treatment often find themselves in unfavourable situations, competing and fighting with men instead of cooperating and sharing responsibilities in line with their predispositions.
I believe that it is very unfair that the draft omits to mention the significant number of women who are either retired or not receiving a pension.
This runs counter to the resolutionâs declarations.
Unless the aforesaid provisions are included, the directive under discussion will be yet another dead document.
Â Â  Mr President, this directive deals with the position of women in the labour market.
It is therefore primarily addressed to women, and it is we women whose cause is yet again being advanced by the completion of the bonfire of red tape that we promised the public.
I hope that we will vote as one tomorrow, and also that the reference to the anti-discrimination law was a bit of verbal skirmishing on Mr Wuermelingâs part.
A national election is already underway and it has nothing to do with this directive.
According to Article 119 of the Treaty, European law promises women equal rights, and they need to see these put into effect.
Many women Members of this House have made reference to the areas in which they have not been, and to the need for awareness to be raised of the direct and indirect discrimination that goes on.
Discrimination may well begin in peopleâs heads, but its removal requires that we change the rights, and laws and their transposition into national law will follow.
There is a need for political will, and this Commission has demonstrated that it possesses it.
This House is contributing its own.
I hope that, tomorrow, we will be able to get what we want and send women in the EU the message that we are still the engine that moves womenâs rights forward in Europe.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, problems relating to reconciling the work-life balance have become part of modern-day life.
One of the reasons for womenâs unequal status in the workplace is that employers are wary of conflicts of interest between work and family responsibilities.
Even though women account for almost 44% of participants in the Czech labour market, the best-case scenario according to our research is that there are five times as many men as women in managerial positions.
Women who are keen to move up the career ladder have to perform exceptionally well in order to be regarded as equal partners to men; in fact, they have to go to greater lengths to succeed than men doing the same job.
The average wage for women in the Czech Republic is currently 19% lower than that for men.
It is also a proven fact that women themselves often ask for lower wages in interviews than men applying for the same job, which in itself indicates womenâs lack of self-confidence in employment relations.
It therefore follows that the promotion of equal rights for women and men should not merely be a matter of adopting various directives and laws.
I am all in favour of a directive, but it must be rooted in fundamental changes within European culture as a whole.
Indeed, I would go so far as to say that its starting point must be the complete eradication of our medieval attitudes, and of the mistaken belief that equality between men and women is merely a problem for women, and that there is no such a thing as discrimination against men.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, in the present situation, in which the European Union finds it difficult to speak its mind, or at least to do so in such a way that it is understood by the public, it is all the more important that the EU legislation and case law should become clearer and more readily comprehensible.
That is why I welcome this proposal.
When it comes, though, to the modernisation and improvement that are mentioned in this document, I regret to have to say that the method of recasting leaves no scope for changing or adding anything of any substance, such as equality in occupational pensions, for example.
When we were preparing the last directive relating to Article 13, we were promised that this issue would be dealt with later on in the recast directive.
Both the Commission and the Council are now opposed to this being done, and I find myself wondering why this opportunity has not been made use of.
What was needed was for this point to be given greater emphasis, and I regret that this was not done.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my thanks for an extremely animated and focused debate.
I should like to start by emphasising that an opportunity is available to us to adopt this crucial directive without delay.
In the interests of Europeâs citizens, this opportunity must be seized.
I would note that this is a key step forward that must be taken in order to promote equality between men and women in the eyes of all stakeholders, regardless of the different opinions held by the institutions on the thinking behind this revision.
If I may, I should now like to explain the Commissionâs position on the amendments in a little more detail.
The Commission can readily accept a significant number of them, and indeed we believe that they are also consistent with the Councilâs position as set out in its general approach of 7Â DecemberÂ 2004.
They go a long way towards improving Community legislation in this field and making it more accessible.
A variety of tools are employed to this end, including technical measures, legal clarifications and provisions that will give fresh political impetus to the promotion of equality between men and women, for example with regard to equal pay.
The Commission cannot accept a second set of amendments for purely technical reasons, and it will outline these reasons in detail in its amended proposal.
In addition, it has rejected a certain number of amendments because they go beyond the scope of what can reasonably be achieved during this revision process.
The specific aim of the latter is to facilitate the ongoing and parallel procedures of codifying Community legislation on the one hand, and laying the groundwork for fundamental changes on the other.
The first of these amendments relates to the newÂ Article 3(a), which would oblige Member States to implement positive action measures, instead of this being an option.
Given that Article 141(4) of the Treaty, which is a source of primary law, clearly states that the Member States are competent to take whatever action they deem necessary in this field, any act of secondary law that cited this Article of the Treaty, while at the same time encroaching upon this competence, would in our opinion face major obstacles.
Secondly, the Commission cannot agree to the obligation incumbent upon Member States to support certain measures in the framework of social dialogue being turned into an obligation to guarantee certain outcomes of this dialogue, in line with the amendments to ArticlesÂ 24 and 27.
It would be hard to square these amendments with the principle of social partnersâ autonomy.
I should also like to remind the House that corresponding provisions were included in Directive 2002/73/EC, following lengthy negotiations with Parliament and the Council.
This Directive and the rules it lays down, which represent an innovative approach intended to increase the involvement of social partners, will not come into force until OctoberÂ 2005.
As we see it, it would be inappropriate to amend these provisions before they have had a chance to prove their worth in practice.
The new ArticleÂ 28(b), which proposes a review clause for the Parental Leave Directive, is unacceptable because this Directive does not fall within the scope of the present revision.
A clause to this effect would be difficult to reconcile with the relevant provisions in the Parental Leave Directive and with those in the European-level framework agreement between the social partners, upon which the Directive is based.
What is more, problems would arise regarding the compatibility of this amendment with the autonomy of social partners and their role, as enshrined in Articles 138 and 139 of the Treaty.
Finally, the Commission cannot accept the amendments to ArticleÂ 8 that are aimed at prohibiting the use of gender as a factor when calculating insurance premiums and benefits for employee insurance schemes.
These amendments also go beyond what is involved in drafting legislative proposals such as the directive under debate.
That is not to say that this issue should not be a subject of political debate in the future.
Even though opinions are divided on the matter, and the position currently held by the Council is quite clear, I am absolutely convinced that this is an important issue that requires our attention.
Furthermore, the Commission does not of course believe that applying different schemes for second- and third-pillar pensions would give rise to ambiguity in the present context, as was also suggested during the debate.
This is an entirely separate issue, and one that transcends purely technical considerations.
In conclusion, I would note that the Commission can accept a number of amendments in full on the basis of these considerations, and, if I may, I will run through the amendments in question.
The Commission can accept in full Amendments 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 96, 101, 106, 107, 108 and 109.
The Commission can accept in part Amendments 5, 24, 71, 72, 73, 76, 84, 98, 102, 103, 104 and 105.
The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments 3, 12, 13, 29, 30, 36, 44, 46, 53, 63, 67, 81, 86, 94, 95, 97, 99 or 100.
I have already set out the rationale behind the Commissionâs position.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, this leads me to put a question to you.
In the proposal from the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, there are two essential elements â parental leave and occupational pensions â that actually constituted the core of the proposal, and you have rejected them.
Your response to occupational pensions was along the lines of âyes, that is a very important issue, and we will take it up at some pointâ.
It is my belief, Commissioner Å pidla, that you promised us that at the time when we were working on the directive ...
I ask you, though, Mr President, to let me put the question.
You described this as an important issue, and as one that would at some point be taken up.
What I want to know is: when you will do that, and in what form will it be taken up?
What about your actual timetable?
I really would ask you to make a statement on the occupational pensions issue â as you have promised to do â, because it is in fact in breach of the Treaty, ...
Â Â  I apologise, but that did not relate to the matter at hand.
It concerned a completely different matter, but I will allow the question, and I would ask the Commissioner to take the floor.
Â Â  .Â Â Â As I see it, it has emerged quite clearly from the debate that the aim behind this proposal for a directive is to make technical improvements to the EU legislation currently in force, and not to introduce extensive and far-reaching changes.
It is for this reason that the Commission cannot accept the two key amendments to which MrsÂ Breyer referred, since that would clearly be at odds with the thinking behind the drafting of this directive.
The two issues she mentioned are of such enormous importance that I will be dealing with them in the course of my work, although at this moment in time I cannot give the House any exact dates.
What I can say, however, is that these are issues that we will debate in the very near future, and indeed I am quite sure that an opportunity to do so will present itself during next weekâs debate on the Green Paper on demographic change.
How we reach our conclusion is still an open question, however, and it would be inappropriate to go into any more detail on the matter.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0211/2005) by MrsÂ Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (âRome IIâ) (COM(2003)0427 C5-0338/2003 2003/0168(COD)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as you will know, the Commission has proposed a measure for the payment of damages, which aims to pursue three objectives.
The first objective is that of predetermining the solutions and therefore of guaranteeing legal certainty to the citizens and to the economic operators that are victims of torts.
The second objective is that of facilitating the resolution of disputes before the courts and encouraging mutual recognition of the decisions made by the judges.
The third objective is, obviously, that of facilitating as far as possible the resolution of such disputes.
In order to achieve these objectives we have proposed a general rule, that is to say, the rule of application of the place where the damage was caused, or rather the place of direct damage.
We decided to adopt such an approach, because it is the most widespread solution in the Member Statesâ legal systems and, in our opinion, the solution that provides the best balance between the parties.
The Commission proposal also included a number of special rules, such as liability for defective products or environmental damage.
I believe that the general rule does not always allow an appropriate balance to be achieved in these particular issues, for which special provisions are needed.
The measure provides for a certain degree of flexibility for judges, in order to allow them to take account of exceptional circumstances.
Such flexibility, however, has to be limited, in order to avoid compromising the general objective, or rather legal certainty.
In that regard, it is clear that allowing judges to exercise full discretion would make it difficult to predetermine the legal certainty that is one of the main objectives of this initiative, since economic operators and citizens wish to know in advance which law will apply to their situation.
In the light of what has been said, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her high-quality report, the outcome of extremely in-depth consultations, and I should like to thank her for her determination to proceed swiftly, in order for the report to be approved before the summer.
In my opinion, the only problematic aspect is an excessive margin of flexibility granted to judges in the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, allowing them to take account of special circumstances on a case-by-case basis.
This excessive amount of discretion risks compromising strict legal certainty.
We have difficulty, moreover, in accepting the amendments abolishing the special rules.
I referred to product liability, which provides for the full protection of the consumer, or to environmental liability.
In my opinion, scrapping those special rules would be dangerous.
On the other hand, I fully agree with the solution reached by the rapporteur on sensitive issues, such as press defamation and the link between international private law and the internal market.
They are two extremely delicate sectors and I believe that the compromise reached is satisfactory.
Finally, with reference to traffic accidents, I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Wallis once again on having thoroughly studied this issue, which is of great practical importance for citizens.
As the Commission, we agree with the intention to pursue an extremely in-depth analysis, for example in the framework of implementing Rome II.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think this proposal is ground-breaking for Europe, ground-breaking for Parliament.
We have had no previous coherent set of rules dealing with applicable law over such a vast arena of civil and commercial claims.
We now have a potential roadmap for litigation and access to justice in the internal market, building on the structures of Brussels I in relation to the jurisdiction of our courts.
For Parliament, this is the first time we have acted as a co-legislator in such an area of private international law.
I am proud that via our committee we have raised the policy debate in a number of areas where we might not have been expected to tread.
Let me touch on some of those debates.
We have thought long and hard about the kind of general rule required, looking for the approach that can best deliver justice in our courts.
It seems to be one, if I can put it this way, that gives a little subsidiarity to our judges.
We start from the Commissionâs clear rule but then give some room for manoeuvre, to deliver justice in the many and various situations that would doubtless arise in litigation.
Here there is a clear message about the difficulty of characterising torts inherent in the method used by the Commission.
Our approach avoids this difficulty, unless we can find good definitions.
I would accept my Socialist colleagueâs amendment on product liability on this basis.
I think it is a good definition and rule and would add to the debate.
On road traffic accidents and personal injuries in general, we have sent a clear message about the injustice of applying the damages regime of the country of the accident.
If I may illustrate this, I have a constituent who had an accident in Spain.
He has been offered GBP 4000 according to Spanish law.
It would be GBPÂ 43Â 000 according to English law and it is in England that he has to live out his life.
This problem has to be addressed, if not here, then by further Commission study and proposal.
On the use of foreign law, the success of Rome II will depend on good judicial cooperation, proper use and respect for one anotherâs laws.
The record to date is patchy.
Courts often avoid the application of foreign law.
The court and parties should â or must â consider this issue, otherwise we are all wasting our time here.
That is a matter that has to be closely monitored if we are to deliver a true area of civil and commercial justice.
On defamation, where Parliament was expected to be active, I was grateful for the opinion of my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I personally share their view but have always felt that we would have to go further to respect the mediaâs concerns about freedom of expression.
We now have a compromise which has wide support across the political groups and, more importantly, across publishing and the journalistic world.
It is unclear whether it will work technically, but it gives the direction for new discussion in the Commission and the Council.
It indicates what is acceptable in achieving a balance between freedom of expression and the rights of the victims of defamation.
Finally to our old friend: the country-of-origin principle.
I shall say it again: it is not a choice of law rule; it will not give you the answer to the question as to which law should be applied to a dispute between two civil parties.
If it gives you an answer, it will probably not be the one that the supporters of the principle want.
It is an important principle of Community law in the field of public or state regulatory law and should be given full weight as such.
I believe we have done that in the solution we have put forward in the committeeâs report.
I hope that will survive intact after amendments from either side.
I thank everyone in the Legal Affairs Committee and the LIBE Committee who have supported our work on this report and express my considerable gratitude to our secretariat on legal affairs who have helped us by carrying out extensive research and making efforts towards producing a report that I believe we can be proud of as a committee.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to join the Commissioner in expressing my sincere thanks to Mrs Wallis for her extremely perceptive report, and for having brought about compromises on many difficult issues.
Although this is a complex and technical regulation, it represents a very important stage in the establishment of a coherent European civil law system.
The lack of such a system would make it a great deal more difficult for the common market to function, and even though the latter is sometimes criticised, it forms the basis of European integration.
It is for this reason that all the comments submitted by both the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and, above all, the Committee on Legal Affairs, are absolutely key.
Given the short timeframe, and above all in view of its competences, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs concentrated primarily on Article 6 of the regulation, which indicates the law applicable in situations where a personâs honour and reputation are violated, or where a person or company is defamed by media publications.
It also outlines the application of this law in the event of possible legal disputes.
In the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I acted as draftsman, the European Union must guarantee its citizens a high level of legal security.
In the event that a publication violates a personâs honour and reputation, it is therefore key that this personâs subjective rights should be protected above all else, and that this should take place in the country where the offence has been committed.
Our basis for these considerations was the fact that there is no current threat to media freedom in Europe, since the latter is protected both by the constitutions of the Member States and by European courts.
Furthermore, a compromise reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs meant that an amendment has been tabled that takes into account the position of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the one hand, and, on the other hand, establishes such a precise legal framework that European publishers should be able to rest content.
I support these amendments, since this solution, especially in the context of the Brussels 1 Regulation, grants legal protection to publishers, as well as providing a guarantee that the rights of victims will be enforced.
Â Â  . Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the way she has handled this difficult material, which eventually boiled down to only a few aspects, but these were fought over with particular vigour.
Rather than specifically addressing these, I would like to consider, in the light of what has been said over the last few weeks, two ways in which this legislation brings us forward both in practical terms and in principle.
One of them has already had light shed on it in this debate: the familiar case of the road traffic accident, which needs to be properly taken forward and resolved.
It is, I believe, in this instance, that one is most likely, and most frequently, to see the citizens, in the most literal sense of the word, âcollide withâ Europe, and afterwards ask themselves where their rights begin and end.
The second, that of the law relating to the press, is about fundamental principles.
Over recent weeks, we have seen the fourth estate, which keeps a close watch on how the first three work together, and which is, in some sense, the publicâs primary lobby, itself becoming a lobby.
The case of Princess Caroline of Monaco might lead one to believe that this is of relevance only to people who are rich, beautiful, famous, important or noble, but it can, by its very nature, also affect ordinary people, in ways we have not seen since the lost honour of Katharina Blum.
A new Europe-wide understanding of fundamental rights is dawning, and, as we have to accept the possibility of it putting free expression of opinion and rights relating to the personality on a collision course, it is a good thing that we are now endeavouring to draw a dividing line that will work in practice, while also incorporating a review clause in the regulation.
Just one final point, quite unspectacular, but important: Mrs Wallis proposed a new option to take account of the way in which the law develops ...
Â Â  . I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, and I would like to draw attention to only one or two items.
It is my opinion that coherent, unified European regulations in private international law relating to civil and commercial non-contractual obligations are a significant step for the continued development of the area of freedom, security and justice in terms of cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs.
We can see that economic mobility and citizensâ mobility have increased with internal market integration, and consequently issues relating to compensation obligations in this area have become an everyday occurrence, and may in fact include a number of international components.
Consolidating the legal provisions applicable in such cases at European level is a matter of urgency for a variety of reasons, and I think that this regulation answers this need.
This is a matter of utmost importance from the point of view of businesses, as uniform legislation guarantees them legal certainty, predictability and consistency.
It is advantageous for citizens, consumers, and potential injured parties and victims too, as it lays down provisions that serve to protect them, and makes relevant legislation more transparent.
All of this will help to bring the European Union closer to its citizens through the legislative process too.
A particular merit of the draft provisions is that they take into account, and at the same time facilitate, the work of the European Court in interpreting the law.
I would like to draw particular attention to the broad spectrum covered by the provisions of the draft regulation, ranging from damages sustained by consumers and product liability, to traffic accidents and environmental damage, and defamation.
Consolidation of European law on liability for international environmental disasters is an aspect that I, as a Hungarian Member of the European Parliament, consider particularly important.
Let me remind you of the cyanide contamination of the river Tisza by Romania a few years ago, and of the Rosia Montana (Verespatak) project.
I repeat: this regulation is a major step forward in terms of legal certainty, predictability and transparency.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commission and MrsÂ Wallis for the excellent work carried out, which has produced a useful legislative text.
We are, however, very perplexed by one of the points in the text, about which we hope to succeed in persuading MrsÂ Wallis to change her mind.
The point relates to Article 7 on specific legislation on violations of the environment.
We do not consider that that specific rule should be abolished and we indeed believe that, in the overall economy of MrsÂ Wallisâs report, abolishing it would deprive the Commissionâs proposal of an important element.
As far as violations of the environment are concerned, I believe that at European level, as well as in many Member States, the law is very weak and there is no legal certainty, and therefore depriving victims of this option offers no advantage whatsoever.
My group has decided to abstain in the event that this aspect of MrsÂ Wallisâs report is adopted.
We hope, however, to succeed in persuading MrsÂ Wallis to abandon this amendment before tomorrow.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief.
I should like to once again thank the rapporteur and all of the Members who have spoken.
I should just like to mention a point that has already been discussed.
Firstly, as I said before, the Commission also believes that the special sectors, such as the protection of the environment, deserve to be treated differently, and therefore I take the liberty of drawing the rapporteurâs attention to that matter.
As regards press defamation, I confirm my appreciation of the compromise that the rapporteur proposed to the Commission and which the Commission accepted.
As regards the amendments tabled after the vote by the Committee on Legal Affairs, I believe that they run the risk of in fact reproducing a mere variant of the country of origin principle, that is, a variant of a principle which, in my opinion, we cannot lay down and decree in this House.
To conclude, in confirming my appreciation of the first compromise reached and voted on by the Committee on Legal Affairs, I must, however, admit to having some doubts about the second proposed change, that is, Amendments 56 and 57.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  â With regard to the report by Mrs Wallis (A6-0211/2005) on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) I should like to say, if I may, that, in order to ensure freedom of expression, together with a legal framework for protecting privacy and legal certainty for journalists and the media in the European Union, I voted:
a) in favour of Amendments 57 to Article 6 and 56 to Recital 12, and
b) against Amendment 10 to Recital 12(a) and Amendment 54 to Recital 26(a), both from paragraph 3.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on âno-fly listsâ/passenger name records.
Â Â  . Mr President, as you know, with regard to the well-known incident with a KLM flight, the United States authorities indicated that the flight was prevented from entering US airspace after two passengers were identified from advance passenger information â API data.
API data is essentially passport and ticket information collected at check-in to speed up immigration controls at the destination.
The transfer of API data by airlines prior to arrival at the point of destination constitutes normal airline practice.
According to the information available to the Commission, air carriers only send API information to border control authorities.
That information is not retrieved by the US authorities from computer reservation systems.
The Commission also wishes to clarify once again that the passengers concerned could not be identified on the basis of passenger name record â PNR â data.
That instrument does not cover flights overflying the United States, but only flights from and to the United States.
As such, it is not relevant with regard to cases such as the KLM incident.
In the Commissionâs view, the use of API data by the United States authorities does not seem to constitute a circumvention of the PNR agreement.
The Commission will be particularly attentive to any circumvention of the agreement and will raise this issue in the framework of the joint review.
The Commission wishes to underline that there is no current requirement for air carriers to provide the US with API data on passengers for over-flights.
The no-fly list is drawn up by the US authorities and contains the names of people they do not wish to fly into the US on the basis of US intelligence and risk-threat assessment criteria.
It is produced by the United States and that country alone is responsible for it.
The European Union has a rigorous policy on aviation security, but that does not include a no-fly list.
In the Commissionâs view, a no-fly list does not mean that the people included are necessarily suspected of any wrongdoing.
The United States simply decided that it does not want them to enter the country for various reasons, based on a number of rather general criteria.
It is, of course, very annoying for somebody to be denied access to the United States because his or her name is on the no-fly list.
In this regard, the Commission will seek clarification of the US no-fly list in its talks with the United States.
For example, the early and effective forwarding to airlines of an up-to-date no-fly list is an essential aspect.
The Commission is, therefore, seeking to better clarify these criteria with the American authorities, in order to prevent future cases of false positives.
Since the start of the US-EU talks in March 2003, the Commission has been able to secure from the United States the undertaking that the American Congress would require the appointment of a chief privacy officer within the Department of Homeland Security who has to report annually to Congress and whose findings are binding on the department.
The chief privacy officer has agreed to receive and handle in an expedited manner cases lodged by data protection authorities in the European Union on behalf of citizens who consider that their complaints have not been satisfactorily addressed by the Department of Homeland Security.
So the EU citizen has stronger assurance of fair treatment.
As regards the joint review of the United States Undertakings, the latter provide for a joint review of their implementation, to be conducted by the United States authorities and the Commission, the latter assisted by representatives of European law enforcement authorities and data protection supervisors.
The joint review will take place after the summer break, presumably in September.
The review aims to provide a clear picture of the way the Undertakings function.
It is the Commissionâs intention to inform this Parliament of the outcome of this joint review and any important developments.
Finally, national data protection authorities will be part of the Commission-led team conducting the joint review.
This should allow the national data protection authorities, the so-called Article 29 Working Party, to assess fully the implementation of the Undertakings.
I am pleased to tell you that despite differences in view of the United States PNR package, there is excellent cooperation on the implementation of this package between the Article 29 Working Party and the Commission, and this cooperation will continue.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me say, on behalf of my group, that the Commissionerâs elucidations of this question were very persuasive.
Let it be said that our desire for a joint evaluation of the agreements relating to PNR data is something to be welcomed.
We find ourselves in the difficult position of having to hold in a balance the interest not only of every single one of the EUâs Member States but also of the USA in being protected against terrorist acts, as against the need to protect individual citizensâ personal data.
The process is a difficult one.
I hope that the Americans will actually deliver on the promises they have made to us that the data we supply to them will be collected and evaluated only for the purposes of protection against terrorism, that they will destroy them when they are no longer required, as they have promised to do, and that we will keep each other informed about problems relating to internal security.
I think there is a good chance of the agreement between the European Union and the USA producing a result that will not only comply with our provisions on data protection but also give us all less cause to fear terrorist attacks.
Let us also, though, look to the future; one thing I regard as important, and of which we must keep on reminding the Americans, is that we have no liking for unilateral security rules, for we want to protect our citizens just as much as the Americans want to protect their own.
For that reason, Commissioner, I believe that the right approach is for us, jointly with the Americans, to assess the risks to our passengers and share the results that emerge from that, thereby, and together, making the public safer.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we are grateful to you, Commissioner, for this clarification.
However, there is no escaping the conclusion that the US is trying to impose an increasing number of security constraints on Europe, and we are still not reassured. That is why we oppose the agreement on the transfer of passenger data by airlines to the US authorities.
The fight against terrorism must preserve a balance between security and individual freedom.
The agreements concerned are disproportionate in relation to their aims.
We cannot automatically treat citizens as if they were all terrorists.
This is why an agreement with the US will only be acceptable if we put an end to the systematic transfer of personal data on all passengers.
As you have pointed out, Commissioner, a KLM aircraft en route to Mexico was recently turned back at the request of the US.
That incident once again showed that the rights of European citizens are being flouted.
How could the US authorities have obtained data on the passengers on that flight when it was not even en route to America?
Were data on the passengers transferred and, if so, by what right?
What specific measures can the Commission take to put a stop, once and for all, to these practices which are a breach of Community law, in particular the Directive on Data Protection?
You told us that you had received an undertaking.
How can we check that it is complied with?
Can the Commission assure us that the US authorities do not have unlimited access to the airlinesâ reservation systems?
It is vital that, in response to that repressive view of the fight against terrorism, Europe can hold up its own vision.
We acknowledge that to combat terrorism and organised crime effectively requires stronger crossborder cooperation, but the European Unionâs anti-terrorist policy must be developed with absolute respect for the rights of citizens, particularly their right to move freely and their right to have their privacy protected.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time that we meet in this House late at night to discuss issues of passenger data.
Commissioner, you mentioned the case of KLM and you reassured us that the way in which the US obtained the data was perfectly legitimate.
However, like Mrs Roure, I, quite frankly, am not reassured because we never got a clear answer.
In this case, the US acquired the âAPISâ data, which they apparently got from Mexico.
Where did Mexico get the data?
Was it allowed to transfer the data to the United States?
Does such an agreement also apply to flights through US airspace?
We would like a precise answer, not general reassurances.
We were in the United States last week, discussing this issue.
I have the feeling that the United States might be accessing the databases directly on the basis of the PNR Agreement.
Secondly, I would like to know about the US administrationâs no-fly lists.
You say that the people on those lists are not necessarily dangerous, but I still find it remarkable that the US administration considers them to be dangerous enough to deny them access to US airspace and send them back to the European Union without notifying the EU authorities; it only notifies the airlines.
They are apparently considered to be dangerous in the United States but not in Europe.
As regards the annual joint review, you said that you will review issues of protection of privacy.
I hope that you will also include the effectiveness of the measures in that review.
The word âsecurityâ has been mentioned here a number of times, but I would like to know how many crooks have been caught, how many attacks have been prevented and how many mistakes â false positives â there have been.
The joint review was supposed to take place in May.
It has now been postponed until September.
I understand that is because the US was unable or unwilling to provide us with the data requested.
Could the Commissioner shed some light on that?
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall speak in Greek.
Either I shall speak very, very quickly and no one will translate, or I shall speak very quickly or I shall speak more slowly.
I ask for your forbearance.
How many 'no-fly' passenger lists are there today in America and how is erroneous reconnaissance avoided?
How many names are added to these lists and how?
With what objectives and how is the temptation to use them for other purposes avoided?
How safe are the names and details from unauthorised use and access?
How effective, ultimately, are the lists in identifying terrorists, when we know that the names of possible terrorists are not put on the lists, so that the airlines do not know and so that it does not leak out that they are being watched?
Finally, how can people inspect and correct their details?
These are not my questions.
The US Congress itself has put them to the US administration.
They may be difficult questions for American citizens, but they are doubly difficult when European citizens are involved.
The Commission needs to cooperate with the United States here and try to jointly formulate policies relating to us.
Commissioner, in March 2005, the Congressional Research Service issued a report on precisely this subject.
It states that the Î¡ÎR details of European passengers will be used on the Secure Flight Programme, which relates solely to domestic and not to international flights, contrary to what you said.
If you wish, I can give you the page and the details.
To close, there are three major dangers now: the citizens are not controlling the authorities; it is the authorities that are controlling and monitoring the citizens.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too will be extremely quick, but I believe that some consideration should be given to specific points.
During the talks with the United States, the Commission intends to call for clarity, in order to prevent the adoption of unilateral measures that may affect the interests of European citizens, and to demand that such measures are agreed on with the European institutions.
I refer in particular to the so-called no-fly list.
We believe that it is an important first step, since the no-fly list is currently the sole responsibility of the United States only in relation to flights over US territory.
As regards flights from or to Europe, we will ask the airlines to give us advance notice, so as to avoid the mistake made in the past of listing people with the same name on the no-fly list, prompting the grounding of an aircraft simply because of confused identity.
With advance notice from the airlines on the data included in the no-fly list, those mistakes could be avoided.
As regards the issue of secure flights mentioned by MrÂ Lambrinidis, we have already conducted an in-depth discussion with the US authorities on aviation security.
It is with a great deal of satisfaction that I can tell you that the US authorities have recently given their consent for US airlines to exclude citizens of European birth from the planning of secure flights.
In other words, they undertake not to include data on European citizens in the trials concerning internal flights with the United States.
It is a guarantee that we have been given, on which we nonetheless intend to continue our talks.
We were unable to hold this meeting earlier for reasons of a technical nature.
A video conference was, however, held a few weeks ago, and the dialogue will continue during the September meeting that I announced previously.
For my part, I will be absolutely clear in demanding full respect for the protection of EU citizensâ personal data.
I have already clearly stated this to Secretary Chertoff, on the occasion of our meeting held in Sheffield a few days ago, and I will continue to do so.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the political situation and the independence of the media in Belarus.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking those of you who asked for an exchange of views with us on Belarus.
It is the third exchange of views on Belarus since I became a Commissioner.
It is very important, because I share your concerns.
I firmly believe that strengthening democracy and supporting independent information sources in Belarus are of the utmost importance, especially in view of the forthcoming presidential elections.
The European Commission has a strong interest in Belarus being a democratic and stable neighbour and hopefully, in the future, being able to benefit fully from the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Recent developments in Belarus, however, have moved the countryâs political system further away from a European democratic system and norms and values, preventing the country from taking its rightful place in the family of European nations.
After the parliamentary elections and the referendum in Belarus last year, which fell significantly short of international standards for democratic elections, in November 2004 the Council of the European Union confirmed the restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with the Belarusian authorities.
At the same time, the European Union sent a very clear message to the population to tell them that we had not forgotten them and that we wanted to enhance contacts with civil society.
The European Union has consistently condemned the arrests and politically motivated trials of potential opponents to President Lukashenko.
We have called for respect for the rule of law and the immediate release of these people.
We see these actions by the regime as attempts to eliminate opposition leaders, especially in the run-up to the presidential elections in 2006.
The growing repression of political parties, non-governmental organisations and independent media outlets is of serious concern to us.
We are also closely monitoring the human rights situation in Belarus.
As a clear signal that the European Union cannot accept violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, last year we imposed a visa ban on certain high-ranking Belarusian officials on the basis of Council of Europe findings.
There was the Pourgourides report on politically motivated disappearances.
We then extended this visa ban to cover the officials considered responsible for rigged elections and also the rigged referendum, as well as those responsible for the repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Our grave concerns about the observance of trade union rights in Belarus have led to an investigation into alleged violations of freedom of association and also the right to collective bargaining, as defined in the ILO Conventions, especially within the framework of the GSP, the Generalised System of Preferences.
The investigation might ultimately result in the withdrawal of Belarusâs access to the benefits of the GSP.
Against the background of the worsening political situation in Belarus, the European Union remains very committed to assisting civil society and the people of Belarus.
Here it must be said that the Commission is a major donor to Belarus and in the past few months we have also streamlined our assistance to the country.
A workshop was organised in Vilnius specifically to coordinate our assistance.
This was very important, as it gave us the chance to intensify our coordination, not just amongst the Member States but also with countries like the United States of America and Canada.
We have two objectives.
One is to assist and support human rights, democratisation, civil society and democratic forces in the strict sense of the word.
We pay special attention to support for the media, non-governmental organisations, the strengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law.
This is being done through the EIDHR â the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights â and the decentralised cooperation instrument.
Two calls for tender were launched there in March and the project selection has already been completed.
Contracting will probably take place over the summer, so that the activities can start before the end of the year.
There are 10 to 12 projects relating to education and advocacy NGOs giving legal advice to people who have human rights problems.
I hope that the results will be excellent.
The second objective is to support the broader needs of the population in related areas.
By broader needs, I mean the TACIS programme that focuses on support for the population itself in different sectors, including good governance, sustainable development, the social sector, education, health, the environment and economic development, and also alleviation of the problems caused by the Chernobyl catastrophe, which figures prominently on our assistance programme.
The idea of supporting independent radio broadcasting to Belarus has been suggested as an effective and useful response to the lack of alternative and independent information in Belarus.
We have studied the possibilities carefully and will see how that can be managed.
Under our current financial regulations it is not easy to find the right solution immediately.
However, I can tell you that, as regards the difficulties journalists are facing in Belarus, we have a key programme for training journalists and we have already been able to do a lot.
We have provided support for the Belarusian Association of Journalists, for which it is very grateful.
For instance, we gave it our backing as the winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2004.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, this is in fact Parliamentâs fourth resolution on Belarus.
It is, however, the first to result from a deep sense of disillusionment with the Commissionâs attitude.
From Parliamentâs point of view, the Council is an ally, and the Commission is the enemy, at least as far as a review of current policy on Belarus is concerned.
The Council understands what is needed, whereas the Commission has no understanding whatsoever of how the existing instruments should be modified in order to support civil society and the process of democratic transformation in Belarus.
The message sent out by Javier Solana during his meeting with Condoleezza Rice in Vilnius on the democratic opposition in Belarus is important in political terms.
At the same time, however, the Commission has fallen into a peculiar kind of vicious circle.
It believes that change can be brought about in Belarus using existing political mechanisms and instruments.
This is not the case.
Change cannot be brought about in this way because these instruments are designed for democratic countries, or countries where the process of democratic transformation has already begun.
It would be impossible to promote the start of democratic transformations in any country in the world by means of the instruments to which the Commissioner refers.
If we were to try to do so, we would risk sacrificing the European Unionâs political credibility, as well as running the risk that political declarations would in future no longer be followed by actions.
While all this is going on, presidential elections will take place in Belarus shortly, or in other words next year.
We need to help the Belarussians make their choice.
It is therefore enormously important that they are provided with reliable and independent information, mainly via radio stations.
I would note that projects have been launched in Poland and Lithuania to establish independent radio stations.
These projects were initially in competition with each other, but are now working together.
It is for this reason that the resolution refers to a network of radio stations for Belarus.
The national governments have already lent their backing to these projects. They should also have the backing of the European Union, however, and current attitudes must change.
The Commission has been considering the possibility of such backing for eight months already, and this cannot go on.
This motion for a resolution is concerned with precisely this problem.
Â Â  Mr President, what we are doing today amounts to nothing less than describing what could be termed the stagnation of a crisis.
News of this crisis has reached us, and we have all seen the pictures of demonstrations, victims and people who have been beaten up.
These people later go to prison, and we send protests and wait for the next pictures to appear on television.
What all this means is that we are in fact incapable of doing much at all.
We cannot do much, and we should at least have the honesty to admit that to ourselves.
Todayâs debate on the media deals with only one small aspect of the harsh reality that prevails in all areas of life in Belarus.
On behalf of my group, I should like to call most emphatically on the Commission to take the compromise resolution which has been drafted, and which will be tabled tomorrow, as an inspiration for its actions.
There is one additional point we should not forget.
Despite the fact that it is so late, and that we have such a small audience, we should be honest with ourselves and admit that the European Union, by which I mean all of us in this Chamber and the Member States, will be powerless and helpless until we hold talks with Russia on the issue of Belarus.
We hold talks with Russia on various matters, the most popular of which are gas and various profitable interests, but we have not asked Russia for its real opinion on the situation in Belarus.
It is very convenient for Russia and for President Putin for there to be a country that they can look down on in that part of Europe, and for there to be a regime that can be seen as the black sheep of Europe.
Lukashenko and his exploits are tolerated and subsidised by means of cheap gas and oil, and the European Union agrees to it.
We should at least admit to ourselves that the Lukashenko regime is convenient for Russia, and that we agree to this.
Khodorkovskyâs imprisonment pales into insignificance in the face of what is happening in Belarus.
We tear our hair out and protest about Khodorkovsky, but precious little is said about Lukashenkoâs anonymous victims.
Unless we take concrete steps to strengthen civil society, these people will lose their most important asset, which is hope.
That really would be the end.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, you gave a very lively description of the current situation in Belarus.
Things are heading in the wrong direction there, and it is of course all the more depressing because, particularly in other countries of the former Soviet Union, there is a mood of renewal which we do not see at all in Belarus.
You mention a long list of programmes that are under way.
I believe, however, that MrÂ Klich was quite correct in saying that many of the EU programmes are intended for neighbouring countries with some form of democratic structure.
It is different when we are dealing with a dictatorship, as in the case of Belarus.
Other instruments are needed for that country.
As is well known, Tacis has many resources for solving environmental problems and resolving issues of border surveillance.
How do we know, however, whether President Lukashenkoâs management of these resources is in the EUâs interests?
I therefore think that the proposal contained in the resolution on which we are to vote tomorrow is perfectly correct.
It is a document that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can support fully and unreservedly.
It is important for us to support the right to free opinion-forming in Belarus, and we have an obligation, pure and simple, to get down to some of these projects which, from a financial point of view, will be extremely modest but which will mean an incredible amount for the morale of those in Belarus who are fighting for democracy.
They need to hear and understand that there are people who are aware of their situation, who are behind them and who will support them wholeheartedly.
In fighting, they are putting themselves on the line and are in great danger of their own lives.
We must support them from outside.
We have a responsibility, and I think you should explain to us how, in practical terms, you will go about matters.
Â Â  Mr President, in recent weeks the Lukashenko regime has made yet another addition to its list of dubious practices.
It has started playing the nationalist card against the Polish community in Belarus, even though the latter has lived in the country since time immemorial.
The Union of Poles in Belarus has been persecuted ever since a new democratic leadership was elected, despite the fact that the organisation stays well out of domestic politics in Belarus.
The Polish-language newspaper was closed down, and the state-run media use official propaganda to portray Poles as agents of foreign powers, financed by NATO and the CIA, who are virtually preparing a bloody revolt against the Belarussian state.
EU policy must provide a response to such goings-on.
In my opinion, it would be worth thinking about an increased level of solidarity between countries at intergovernmental level, as well as solidarity in terms of EU and transatlantic policies.
As far as the Commission is concerned, policies must be targeted at implementing very specific projects, such as support for independent media.
Commissioner, there is one issue I should like to highlight in particular at this point.
There can be no question that this House will have no understanding for any passivity and sluggishness by the Commission during this parliamentary term.
If you continue to act as you have done in the past, you will do nothing but create further areas of conflict between Parliament and the Commission.
You leave us no other choice, Commissioner.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus, is successfully creating a totalitarian regime, learning from the classics of Soviet totalitarian communism and praising them; this time he is not using the dictatorship of the proletariat and communist ideology as a mask but is methodically destroying the civil and political liberties of the people of Belarus, and destroying the right to freedom of speech and truthful information.
The people of Belarus receive minutely detailed reports of the dictatorâs heroic deeds from the enslaved media.
Songs of joy come from the radio and a propaganda machine worthy of Goebbels is crippling the confidence of society.
The need for democratic freedoms is being destroyed, hopelessness is degrading peopleâs dreams and belief in their own strengths.
How can this process of mankurtism be halted?
How can we preserve those shoots of civil society that still remain intact?
How can we create anew an internal demand for honest and truthful information?
We can do this if the European Union fulfils its own rights and obligations.
By fulfilling the right and obligation to create a free information space with budgetary funds that have already been voted this year.
I call on the European Commission to stop playing at its exaggerated diplomacy and to carry out its obligations.
The launch of independent radio broadcasts currently depends purely on the goodwill of the European Commission.
Financial, technical and organisational issues can be resolved during the course of this year.
Professional journalists are standing by at this moment to create objective content.
This work would be an even greater honour to them than the Sakharov prize presented by the European Parliament last year.
I call on you to support this resolution.
Support it and carry it out, so that Belarus does not become a totalitarian state.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner does not need any of us to tell her what is going on in Belarus.
At the same time, I believe that you are on our side, Commissioner.
However, please let us get things going.
That is the plea that we are all jointly making.
Rules are a means to an end, not an end in themselves.
We cannot tell the people in Belarus that we cannot help them at the moment because we have to comply with difficult rules.
Let us change the rules.
One of the major players in making the rules and ensuring their observance is Parliament.
Let us see what we can do.
We would all like to establish concrete commitments with regard to the radio station project, direct assistance for the families of victims of the regime â they are in dire straits â and thirdly and most importantly, a concrete, realistic timetable.
I understand what you mean when you refer to a timetable which will begin, hopefully, after the summer and continue for the foreseeable future, but we should have a concrete timetable of specific events over the next 12 months.
Â Â  The European Humanities University which was closed in Minsk a year ago was recently reborn in Vilnius.
Historically, the universities of Europe were the forerunners of the European Union.
The true roots of the European Union are in the universities, while the universities are founded on freedom of thought.
This is why we welcome the revival of the European Humanities University in the resolution that we are presenting to the Parliament on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations.
We also derive joy from the efforts of the Republic of Lithuania, which are aimed at spreading democracy, freedom of thought and human rights through education, by preparing a trained generation for a new country, one which is a neighbour of the European Union, but still in the grip of a dictatorship.
Therefore, we address the European Commission, the Member States of the European Union and urge you to follow the example of donors in Europe and the United States of America and to support this university in every possible way.
We are sure that this is how we will really broaden the realm of freedom, in which a nation's freedom, solidarity and cooperation serves a person's dignity our own dignity.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a long-standing interest in Belarus and I have never advocated completely cutting off contact with the Belarus authorities in areas of mutual concern such as people trafficking and trade matters.
It is also true that current EU policies have not paid any dividends.
The regime of President Lukashenko has retreated into a siege mentality, in which increasing paranoia about the intentions of the EU, the USA, and even Russia at times has resulted in mounting repression and authoritarian responses.
Democracy has been effectively terminated, with sham elections and an end to limits on the presidentâs term of office, although CIS observers would claim otherwise.
Human rights are trampled on, with unexplained disappearances of opposition figures.
The judiciary is far from independent and does not question the campaign of Deputy Attorney General Paval Radzivonaw as the principal architect of the crackdown on newspapers such as and .
The criminal conviction of opposition figures such as Mikhail Marinich is further evidence of this.
Press freedom is virtually non-existent now, with newspapers being suspended and journalists, including foreign correspondents, harassed or fined.
Theoretically, Belarusians can even be sent to labour camps for daring to criticise the president.
One journalist, Veronika Cherkasova, was mysteriously murdered last year.
In terms of media freedom, Belarus is now on a par with some of the worldâs pariah regimes, such as Cuba, Burma, North Korea and Iran.
The EU and the USA stand together in condemning this brutal regime and imposing smart sanctions on officials of the regime.
I strongly support independent radio broadcasting into Belarus from the EU and also financial assistance for Belarus journalists and for civil society.
I hope that that ghastly regimeâs days are numbered and that it will soon be off the map of Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think in fact we have no difference.
It is a regime where freedom is being trodden on, so we have to do something, which I have explained three times already.
It was the Commission that agreed to go to Lithuania with a few Member States to work together and find the right strategies.
The right strategies are there, the problem is our financial regulations.
These financial regulations were introduced because Parliament asked for them in the past.
Why?
Because there have been irregularities, but we are now very constrained.
It is very difficult for me to go against the financial rules, which is why it takes a lot of time.
I cannot just go and give money to any NGOs.
This has to be done according to the rules, and the rules are very difficult and strict.
If we want to change the rules â and I would not mind starting to simplify them â then frankly I need Parliamentâs support, otherwise I cannot do anything.
I do not wish to be accused of irregularities, as colleagues have been in the past.
I am always flexible and open.
I will look into the matter, but it takes a long time.
It can take months to get things in place, but we will go in the right direction.
I do not think it is correct to say that the Council has different ideas.
The Council came after us.
We started to work with a few Member States and with many NGOs, but the Council is not responsible for implementation.
Implementation has to be done by us, according to the Financial Perspective and rules and according to our constraints.
This is the real crux of the problem.
You should know this; therefore I clearly and openly say so.
It is also untrue to say that we are not communicating with Russia on this issue.
Of course we are.
The reality, however, is that Russia has not changed anything up to the present time and it seems to be difficult for it to do so.
But I completely agree â and we agreed at the seminar â that we should make moves towards the media and make direct contact with the society there; we should train journalists.
We should also work via Ukraine.
We have been working with our Polish and Lithuanian friends, and we will also work a lot with Ukrainians, as they have better access than us.
It is true that Lukashenko is now imposing stricter measures because he is fearful that movements could start similar to those in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan.
This is the reality of the situation but I cannot give you any more information at this stage.
We are working on the implementation but unfortunately it takes more time than I would wish.
In my former role as Austrian Foreign Minister, I gave an instruction and the instruction was followed and perhaps within the next few months it was implemented.
In the Commission, it is more complex.
We have to be very careful to ensure against any irregularities.
But I am ready, if you are, to look into this situation.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question (B6-0329/2005) to the Commission by MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on rules of origin in preferential trade arrangements (COM(2005)0100 final).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on International Trade, I would like to begin by welcoming Commissioner KovÃ¡cs and tell him that we would be delighted to receive him in the Committee on International Trade to hold a first debate on the issues we are dealing with together.
I am saying this to him directly in this very intimate atmosphere so late at night.
I would like to express my satisfaction and that of my Committee with the approval of the GSP Regulation in April, although it is regrettable that it was not adopted on the scheduled date so that it could benefit the countries affected by the tsunami.
And, with regard to rules of origin, although it is true that Parliament does not have powers of codecision or consultation in relation to the Regulation implementing the Customs Code, pursuant to the Council Decision of 1999, laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission, we have the right to be informed regularly about the procedures carried out by means of comitology.
This would mean that, as in the case of the Trade Directorate-General, from which we regularly receive documents from Committee 133, the Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union will send our committees the drafts of implementation measures, as well as the results of votes and the minutes of meetings.
This is in accordance with our competences laid down in the Rules of Procedure, which do not relate strictly to commercial issues, but also to economic and commercial relations with third countries.
We are therefore keen and prepared, Commissioner, to consult our respective agendas with a view to establishing sensible relations with you involving dialogue, debate and control.
With regard to the proposed reform, we believe that the range of issues raised from the point of view of simplification, flexibility and control are important; I shall comment on them very briefly.
With regard to simplification, we believe the elimination of a long list of conditions imposed upon exporters and the extension of the certificate of origin solely on the basis of the added value criterion to be positive.
With regard to this point, we would like to receive the impact studies or simulations that have been carried out demonstrating the economic repercussions of the establishment of added value thresholds on commercial exchanges and beneficiary countries as soon as possible.
With regard to increasing flexibility, we believe that to allow regional cumulation amongst countries of the same region will promote economic integration amongst them, which is consistent with our fundamental philosophy and also may have beneficial effects.
Finally, with regard to control, we must produce a proposal to establish new control mechanisms in order to ensure that there is no accumulation of excessive bureaucratic and administrative procedures which may discourage the use of the mechanisms for using preferences.
At a time when a very lively debate is taking place on the achievement of the Millennium Objectives and the fight against poverty, both in this Parliament and in the UN, the OSCE and the G-8, we believe that this is the most appropriate time for a reform of rules of origin which opens up our markets and benefits the countries that need it most.
That is the objective of this question and we would like to know the Commissionâs views at this point.
Â Â  . Mr President, the communication of 16 March 2005 defines general orientations for the future of the rules of origin in preferential arrangements.
It is a three-pronged approach, which should be seen as a package: firstly, simplification and appropriate relaxation of the substance of the rules; secondly, improved procedures for their implementation and enforcement; thirdly, a secure environment for legitimate trade, in particular through a targeted monitoring of the functioning of the arrangements.
While the orientations should be applied progressively to all arrangements, their priority focus is firstly on the arrangements devoted to the development of each GSP.
The Commission considers that formal simplification could be achieved by placing the current numerous and complex rules for determining the origin of products that are not wholly obtained in a country by a single, across-the-board method based on value criteria.
That method also offers the flexibility, through the setting of the value threshold, to adjust the origin requirements according to the desired results in terms of market access and development for beneficiary countries.
It would apply both for determining what sufficient processing is when materials not originating in a country or in a cumulation zone are used, and for allocating origin, but in the context of cumulation, using different value thresholds.
Let me take the opportunity to address your second question.
The need for relaxation has, taking into account my preliminary remarks, to be considered against its desired effect, not only in terms of growth of exports under the GSP, but mainly on the actual development of the beneficiary countries.
In that context the criteria to be taken into account in order to define the value thresholds lie in the impact of the new rules on development.
The use of a value-added method is therefore a starting point.
The Commission is launching studies to measure its impact on certain products that are key commodities for developing countries, such as textiles, agriculture and fisheries âuntil now the determination of their origin has not been based on value â and which are sensitive for the Community in tariff and market terms.
The study will help in defining the criteria and in verifying whether a value-added method with the appropriate thresholds for both sufficient processing and cumulation is actually in line with the principles of simplification and development-friendliness.
Should this study demonstrate that the value-added approach would not deliver the expected results for certain sectors, the Commission will adopt another approach to better achieve these objectives.
Referring to your first question, the Commission is ready to explain in more detail to representatives of Parliament.
However, the terms of reference of the study are how the products and countries will be selected for the simulations and the steps to be followed in evaluating its results.
With regard to the definition of thresholds, that will be part of the process of drawing up and adopting the Commission regulation to amend GSP rules of origin.
Parliament will be involved, in accordance with the comitology procedure.
However, once the Commission is in a position to formally start the examination of the draft regulation within the Customs Code Committee, the draft will be made available to Parliament.
With regard to your third question, the Commission has carefully considered the idea of allowing global cumulation between all GSP beneficiary countries.
That goes far beyond the cross-regional cumulation.
Cumulation of origin, to have a real impact, should be an additional opportunity to source materials from countries that are real economic partners, with lower constraints than from other countries.
Expanding sourcing possibilities to all developing countries would result in denying the very concept of cumulation, assuming that most of the supplies used by developing countries to manufacture products to be exported to the EU under the GSP come from other developing countries.
Such a global cumulation would, in fact, replace the normal origin requirements.
The main beneficiaries of such a situation would again be the biggest exporting countries and not the poorest and more vulnerable ones, whose interests would be better served by appropriate value thresholds.
To make an impact, cumulation and its facilitation must remain targeted in groups of countries with mutual and balanced economic interests.
As highlighted by the communication, that does not exclude extending existing cumulation zones or merging existing groups such as ASEAN and SAARC.
However, that must correspond to needs expressed by the groups of countries themselves and it must be supported by the necessary instruments for administrative cooperation in origin matters.
The Commission remains at the disposal of Parliament to keep it informed of the further development of this important file.
I should like to say to the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade: I am at your disposal and the disposal of your committee whenever you invite me to participate in your proceedings.
Â Â  . Mr President, when we talked about the system of trade benefits for developing countries back in March, we asked the Commission to review the rules of origin, mainly to promote better use of the scheme, and so we are pleased that it is in the process of doing just that.
It kicked off in March and we can expect the final proposals this coming autumn.
I have three questions to ask in this respect.
The first concerns cumulation.
The Commission has already indicated that it would like to enhance regional cumulation, which I consider extremely important, and that it would like to further develop cross-regional, or possibly, global cumulation.
Can the Commission say any more about that at this stage?
The second question concerns the use of the Generalised System of Preferences.
The biggest benefits are mainly enjoyed by only a handful of countries, including China.
The challenge we face is to incorporate the adjustments in such a way as to ensure that the countries that need this system the most will, and can, actually avail themselves of it.
How does the Commission think it will achieve this?
Does the Commission consider a lower regional cumulation threshold for the LDCs?
I should like to finish off by saying a few words about the possibility of potential misuse and fraud, which is a real problem.
It is hoped that readjustments can be made by simplifying the criteria of origin and simplifying administrative procedures, as well as by making the conditions for regional cumulation more flexible.
A risk analysis had been provided for in this respect.
I would like the Commission to tell us whether this analysis has now been carried out, and whether the Commissioner is able to comment on it.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the report on the generalised system of preferences and shadow rapporteur for the reform of rules of origin, I would like to stress the importance of the preferences recognised by the Union being applied effectively and truly benefiting their recipients.
Parliamentâs main interest is to ensure that this purpose is achieved and therefore, while I share the objectives of your communication, I would like to raise certain issues.
With regard to simplification, I would like to stress firstly that special treatment is necessary for the least-developed countries and lower thresholds and the possibility of minimal rules in their favour must be recognised.
At the same time, the establishment of added value thresholds as the only criterion requires that certain collateral problems be tackled, because this requirement may be very costly for companies in the least-developed countries, which would need sophisticated accounting and auditing systems.
If we relate this criterion to the net cost of production in the different countries in relation to exchange rates, salaries and prices of raw materials, the system may become more complex and may lead to exclusion in the least-developed countries with cheap labour.
With regard to making rules of origin more flexible, I would like to stress the need for countries that are subject to the same preferential treatment, although they belong to different geographical or commercial regions, to be able to cumulate amongst themselves.
We believe that this would be a consistent rule and that, at the same time, it would be necessary to recognise the possibility of bilateral cumulation with the European Union, so that products finished in a beneficiary country that contain materials originating from the Community may also benefit from preferences.
With regard to the control measures, I would insist on the need for us to receive impact studies and simulations, I would ask you to listen to the views of civil society and ensure the monitoring of the system, keeping Parliament duly informed.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have taken note of the great interest expressed by Parliament in the substantial review of the rules of origin launched by the Commission.
We clearly share the same objectives.
While GSP rules of origin come first, the orientations of the Commission communication will also inspire the definition of the revision of the rules of origin in other arrangements, in particular in the negotiations of the EU economic partnership agreements with the ACP States.
I would again insist on the fact that, while the formal involvement of your institution is based on the legal framework for the definition of rules of origin in the various preferential arrangements, I consider it extremely important that your committee be kept fully informed and have the opportunity to express its views on the charges to be introduced for the benefit of better market access and development.
For products to be considered as sufficiently processed in a country on account of regional accumulation, it is none the less necessary to determine in which country of the region the product originates.
It is essential because there can be developing countries in the same region which benefit from different preferential arrangements on the GSP, and diversion of those preferences should be avoided.
For that purpose, an accumulation threshold will be fixed in order to decide whether the products originate in the country of final manufacture.
This threshold should be lower than the threshold imposed on non-originating inputs in order to favour sourcing in the accumulation zone and, at the same time, high enough to avoid any diversion of preferences.
The threshold will be more easily reached by the developing countries.
Reform of the rules of origin is of great importance for improving trade opportunities for the worldâs poorest and most vulnerable countries.
We must ensure that we deliver our promises.
As far as some other details of the questions are concerned, we will give a written answer.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the European Union and Iraq - A framework for engagement [2004/2168(INI)] (A6-0198/2005).
Â Â  . â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my thanks to my honourable friends in the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their cooperation, which means that today you have before you a report which, I believe, is an integrated report laying down certain substantial guidelines on how relations between the European Union and Iraq need to move in future.
Without doubt, since combat operations ended, the situation in Iraq has been difficult and, unfortunately, is deteriorating by the day.
Thus, the first comment I have to make concerns the security situation, the most important problem identified in Iraq today.
It is important not only because it costs thousands of human lives every day, but also because nothing else can be done unless the security problem is addressed.
Of course, this conclusion is not enough.
Very specific measures also need to be taken.
One of these is, of course, the restoration of the Iraqi security forces and, on the other hand, the restoration of the Iraqi army, which is no easy matter.
At the same time, as certain security problems are caused by the presence there of foreign military forces, I consider that replacing the military forces with a UN peace force would be an important step.
This is one of the basic proposals in my report.
Of course, it is something which cannot be achieved in 48 hours; of course, it is a decision which requires debate; of course, it is a decision which must be based on a UN Security Council resolution.
However, in my opinion, it is necessary.
The third comment I have to make concerns reconstruction.
Following the war, Iraq is a country in which the entire social fabric has broken down.
Thus, reconstruction must not be examined as a mere logistical construction process; there is, of course, the question of construction, but there is also the question of reshaping and orientating a society, and reshaping and orientating a society includes political, economic, social and cultural issues.
The epicentre of the overall reconstruction process is, without doubt, a procedure which has just started, by which I mean the drafting of the new constitution.
It is clear â and it must be clear to all of us â that the future of Iraq is primarily in the hands of the Iraqi people, and that is how it should be.
On the other hand, however, it is very important for the European Union, with its tradition of democracy, to propose â through the procedure to draft the constitution of course â that care be taken to ensure that there will be a democratic, progressive society, with social awareness; a society which reflects the pluralism of Iraq.
Finally, and this is my last point, the presence of the European Union both in the reconstruction and in the entire course of events of Iraq, which is a country with an important history, is something for which provision is made in this report and something which should be supported.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a very great honour for me to be here today.
It is the first occasion on which I have addressed this great body.
Thank you very much for the opportunity to do so, first to make a brief speech now in respect of Iraq and later in the morning at greater length on Africa and globalisation.
I begin by thanking the Committee on Foreign Affairs, particularly its chairman, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, for its report and for the presentation this morning.
Apologies for my pronunciation. I did Ancient Greek at school, but of course that was written rather than oral.
The disagreements within the European Union over military action against Saddam's regime in Iraq are a matter of record and we all acknowledge that strongly held views remain on both sides.
Given the strength of feeling, I am particularly grateful to your Committee for the way in which it has looked forward for a future for Iraq rather than backwards to rehearse the arguments over it.
Since the end of military action, the European Union has recognised its strong and common interest in supporting the new Iraq that is now emerging.
I think we all condemn those who want to determine Iraq's future through extremism and violence.
We condemn all killings and kidnappings, but, given the nature of this body, we particularly condemn the recent kidnapping of the Egyptian Ambassador in Iraq, Mr Ihab al-Sherif, and the attacks on other diplomats from Arab countries.
We are determined to see the success of a peaceful, stable and democratic Iraq, which responds to the needs of all its citizens.
Just over a year ago, the European Council endorsed the Commission's communication setting out medium-term objectives for the development of the EU's relationship with Iraq.
That strategy is bearing fruit.
Last November, the Council presented a package of European Union assistance to Iraq's then Prime Minister, Dr Allawi.
That included a longer-term commitment to starting negotiations on a third country agreement and to promoting EU trade and political cooperation with Iraq; a reminder of the Commission's offer to implement the generalised system of preferences and financial support.
Experts from the Commission worked with the United Nations and the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, and helped to make a success of Iraq's first democratic elections on 30 January this year.
Several Members of the European Parliament also observed those elections.
The General Affairs and External Relations Council in February agreed to build on this package of assistance with further support for Iraq's political process, including the drafting of a new constitution.
It agreed on a new Community aid package of EUR 200 million and the launch of an EU integrated Rule of Law and Police Training Mission for Iraq with offices in Baghdad and Brussels.
That mission began training Iraqi police, judiciary and penitentiary officials yesterday and is making a valuable contribution to the Iraqi Government's efforts to increase its authority and to entrench the rule of law.
Overall, the European Union is today delivering an impressive and comprehensive programme of assistance to the Government and people of Iraq as they seek to build a peaceful and democratic future.
Last month, along with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, the High Representative, Javier Solana, and the President of the General Affairs Council, Jean Asselborn, I visited Baghdad.
In my view, and I hope Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner shares this view, it was a very important visit, symbolising the European Union's commitment to the new Iraq.
There the Commissioner reiterated the Commission's intention to open an office in Baghdad as soon as possible, so as to strengthen the EU's dialogue and technical assistance.
At the International Conference on Iraq in Brussels a fortnight ago, hosted jointly by the United States and the European Union, representatives from 87 countries and international organisations gave a similar and strong message of support to the new Iraq.
Let me just respond in opening to one absolutely key point.
I will make my first apology for referring to the rapporteur as the chairman.
If this is regarded as a slight on my very good friend Elmar Brok, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I apologise to him too.
MrÂ Dimitrakopoulos rightly said that the security situation was the key to everything else and the security situation is serious.
There is no disguising that. He also intimated that the sooner the Iraqis were able to take control of their own security the better.
Let me say, as one of what were the two formal occupying powers in Iraq, the United States and the United Kingdom, and someone with his own personal responsibility for the war, we share this aspiration.
Leave aside the arguments of the past.
All of us believe that the quicker the Iraqis are able to take responsibility for their own security the better and the quicker the coalition forces will then be able to leave.
The security situation is poor.
The better news is the increase in the training and ability of the Iraqi security forces.
Now there are 168Â 000 individuals in the Iraqi security forces overall. More and more of them have a proper capability and are being used.
We are well aware that under Security Council Resolution 1546 the mandate for the foreign forces in Iraq will come to an end in December this year, unless it is renewed in some way, and that in any event, as 1546 makes clear, we the coalition forces are only there at the invitation of the Iraqi Government.
Were the Iraqi government to ask us to leave, we would leave immediately.
On the issue of whether there could be a United Nations 'blue-hatted' force, I have no difficulty with that in principle.
The only issue is encouraging other countries to come forward.
Whether we can achieve that remains to be seen.
However, on the overall objective of coalition forces being reduced and then leaving and the Iraqis taking full control for themselves, we are absolutely in agreement.
To sum up, the United Kingdom will look during its presidency to pursue a growing relationship between the EU and Iraq, building on what we have already achieved.
I welcome the Committee's endorsement of the goal and particularly their call for the Commission to open its office in Baghdad and for the EU to send an observer mission to the elections to be held in Iraq in December.
I greatly welcome the Committee's suggestion that the European Parliament should build on its relationship with the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly.
I look forward to today's debate
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by welcoming Mr Straw to the Presidency.
I congratulate Mr Dimitrakopoulos warmly on his report. It is an excellent and timely report and gives us a good opportunity for an update on the intensive developments over the last few months.
Iraq is still a huge and multiple challenge to all of us. It really is âwork in progressâ and we have a lot to do there.
Significant events have taken place, one of which was the troika visit to Iraq on 9 June, because we, the 25, showed that we are all united now in reconstructing and assisting Iraq.
It was not easy, because there have been times when we have not been united.
It was also very well received by the Iraqis themselves.
I also think it was very important that we had the international conference in Brussels.
Many members of the Iraqi Government were present and they were able to present their ideas and wishes and suggest where we could assist them.
The deplorable abduction of the Egyptian diplomat and other recent kidnappings have driven home to all of us the conditions under which people are living.
I decided, therefore, that the Commission should also have a presence in Baghdad and, as Mr Straw has already mentioned, we will be setting up a delegation.
We will, of course, do that under the protection of the British and we hope that safety can be guaranteed as far as possible.
We know it is not an easy undertaking, but I think it is important that politically we also show our flag and help the Iraqi people.
The situation in that country is still very difficult and I agree with Mr Dimitrakopoulos that ensuring military and civilian security must be the main priority of the new Iraqi administration.
The only way to establish security is to address the underlying causes of the violent attacks by some sections of the Iraqi population.
I see two concrete prerequisites for this.
The first is an inclusive and broad-based constitution and the second is an environment in which reconstruction can bring visible improvements to the daily lives of the Iraqi people.
I would even add that, thirdly, it is very important that neighbouring countries also contribute to more unity in the country and less conflict.
I shall say a few words about the new constitution.
This must represent the interests of all Iraqis and was a central topic of our Iraq Conference in Brussels.
It must be a product of inclusive, broad-based consultation and all Iraqis must feel it belongs to them, can protect them and guarantee their rights.
The inclusion of Sunnis in the main drafting body is therefore a promising start, but, as we know, the process will not be easy.
We in Europe know from our recent experience the myriad difficulties a constitution can pose and, by the way, we also discussed that very frankly with the Iraqis.
We are also ready to offer technical expertise if requested.
We already provided technical expertise in the last elections, especially for the United Nations, and we have said that we will assist the United Nations experts again this time, especially with funding, but also by providing some of our own experts.
Of course that always depends on whether the Iraqis want us to help.
We rely very much on the United Nations to advise the Iraqis on compliance with the principles of international law.
Once the Constitution has been drafted and elections are scheduled, we also intend in principle to offer the Iraqis an election observation mission to oversee them, but it depends on the security situation.
We have not yet taken a final decision on that.
The Iraqi people need to see concrete improvements in their everyday lives.
Since 2003 we in the Commission have been working on health, education, basic needs, sanitation and water, and also on creating jobs, because what is most important is that people themselves are able to feed their families.
Of the EUR 200 million committed we will soon have finalised EUR 145 million, to be channelled through the World Bankâs International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq to meet basic needs.
The forthcoming donor conference in Amman will then offer an opportunity for the Iraqis themselves to take the lead, based on the last conference in Brussels, in setting up a real donor coordination mechanism.
They already announced it at the conference and we would like to work with them.
In addition to reconstruction aid, the international community also needs to do more to reduce or reschedule Iraqâs debts.
The Commission will be pushing EU Member States on this, because we think it is fundamental.
It is a prerequisite that neighbouring countries especially contribute more and more, because they will really play a central role in shifting the balance in the region.
These countries need the assistance and cooperation of their neighbours.
The neighbours have made this commitment in principle, but now we have to see whether it can be put into practice.
Iraq is an extraordinary country with a great but turbulent past.
It is now the inspiration for a new era of international cooperation.
We know that the agenda that we have set out is very ambitious, but I think we can deliver if we just stay the course.
The Iraqi people have shown tremendous courage and resilience, particularly in turning out in such large numbers to vote, but also in their everyday lives against a background of violence and intimidation.
They deserve compassion, but also solidarity and financial and other assistance.
That is what we have to do on moral and also political grounds.
Â Â  I can inform the Council and the Commission that Parliament offers courses in modern Greek, if needed, in order to help with the pronunciation of Mr Dimitrakopoulosâs name.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in the slightly ridiculous position of being the only person to have abstained from the opinion issued by the Committee on Development.
There were no votes against the opinion.
To be quite frank, my abstention was the result of the rejection of two paragraphs that I consider important, namely the reference to the military occupation and to the rejection of the war with the resulting withdrawal of occupation troops, as well as the criticism of the rule and the loss of economic sovereignty connected with Ambassador Bremerâs corrupt and negative management.
Mr Straw, the present is a consequence of the past.
The deaths occurring daily and the killing of Mr Calipari, the secret agent, bear witness to this fact.
Yesterday, representatives of Iraqi civil society were received; they are present in the Chamber today and I welcome them with great respect.
These are people who live in insecurity every day, but who do not give up on their commitment to fight for an Iraq free of the military occupation, terrorism and armed resistance.
They live in Fallujah, Basra and Baghdad, they believe in justice and democratic participation by the people and they were victims of Saddam Husseinâs dictatorship.
Yesterday, I realised how important it is to give these people power.
As our opinion states, it is necessary for the reconstruction process to provide for their involvement and financial support for their projects.
Our opinion also strongly emphasises the promotion of development measures in favour of women, who must acquire and not lose rights, and of children traumatised by the dictatorship, the embargo and the war, as well as measures designed to help the country to clear the mines and cluster-bombs and to place control and reconstruction projects back in the hands of the Iraqi authorities.
Our opinion also calls for the involvement of the United Nations.
Above all, it calls for respect for human rights, which have been tragically and shamefully violated, and a continued commitment by the European Union through its presence in Iraq, as the Council and the Commission have also called for here.
Finally, since the time available to me has ended, I urge that the debt cancellation that Commissioner Waldner believes necessary should not be considered a substitute for aid.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after years of oppression and deprivation of freedom, and the prevailing difficulties notwithstanding, the people of Iraq now have a chance of a peaceful and free future.
It is an opportunity we must do everything in our power to seize.
What does this mean in terms of trade policy?
Firstly, my committee welcomes the strategy proposed by the Commission for involvement in Iraq, calling on all parties to help transform the country into a diversified market economy.
Secondly, Iraqâs planned accession to the WTO is a crucial step in integrating the country into the global economy, although the economic and administrative structures for this have yet to be created.
Thirdly, reconstruction must involve a leading and coordinating role for the United Nations.
Fourthly, Iraq possesses many natural resources, particularly its reserves of oil.
It is not least in our interest that the trade in oil and natural gas be resumed; as it will help secure our energy supplies to a considerable degree, it is important to both sides that legislation be approximated in the energy sector, too, and that adequate conditions under which investment can take place be established.
It has to be said, though, that sustainable reconstruction is inconceivable if the proceeds are not reinvested in Iraq.
Fifthly, as regards international financial aid or the cancellation of debt, there must be close cooperation between the partners involved.
There also â and this is my sixth point â needs to be close cooperation between Iraq and its neighbours, on which the development of a favourable investment climate across the region as a whole depends.
I will conclude by thanking the members of the lead committee, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for adopting our opinion with scarcely any reservations.
The window of opportunity that we have for change in Iraq will not be open for ever.
Let us make good use of it for the peopleâs benefit!
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Dimitrakopoulos on the excellent work he has done on Iraq, a tough, complex and difficult issue, as we can see from the events that have taken place recently: the murder of more than 40 people this weekend, the kidnap of the head of the Egyptian diplomatic mission in the street in broad daylight, the standstill in oil production and the spectacular increase in violence over the last year.
Nevertheless, Mr President, I believe that the task of rehabilitation, reconstruction, democratisation and pacification of Iraq is not a task that should fall to the countries most closely involved â and I can see Minister Straw, who is with us today, and we welcome him as well â but rather it is a task that should fall to the whole of the international democratic community.
The European Union must give decisive support to the tasks required in Iraq at the moment: a Constitution that will have to provide a prudent and sensible balance in terms of the nationalist and religious factors, the holding of new elections, the establishment of a new government and the trial of Saddam Hussein.
And all of this, Mr President, must accommodate the Sunni community and allow it greater participation in the structures of power.
If I had to emphasise one aspect of MrÂ Dimitrakopoulosâs report, it would be that it looks to the future, because the future cannot be built solely by talking in the past tense.
If we do not have a clear view of our ambitions and our projects for that country, we will not be able to build the future and we will not be able to understand the past.
It is therefore very important, Mr President, for the European Union to clearly promote peace, understanding, concord and reconciliation in that country, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said and as the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers of the European Union has also told us.
But I believe, Mr President, that we will have to try, amongst all of us, to turn the discords of the past into the harmonies of the present, as suggested by the rapporteur, MrÂ Dimitrakopoulos.
Â Â  Mr President, I have been told that the page must be turned.
I am turning it.
I shall not speak about the mass graves in Fallujah. I shall not speak about the dozens of people killed each day.
I shall not give any figures. I shall not speak of the ghetto to which foreign nationals are confined.
I shall not speak of the journalists who have been kidnapped or of my Iraqi friends who have been murdered.
I shall not speak of this chaotic, free Iraq which often seems like hell.
I shall not speak of the appalling corruption and the misappropriation of oil revenue.
Above all, I shall not say that this war has been a tragic mistake from beginning to end.
I am turning the page.
Do not ask me, however, to say that all those Iraqis who are resisting have become terrorists.
Yes, alas, there are terrorists, but there is also a popular uprising.
Do not ask me to shut my eyes to the appalling management of the conflict when even Bush himself is coming under attack for this within his own party.
Do not ask me to hide the fact that European Union money is lying unspent in MrÂ Wolfowitzâs World Bank Trust Fund, despite the call made by the European Parliament, in its resolution of September 2003, for all of its donations to be managed by the United Nations.
You have been an excellent rapporteur, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, but do not ask me to give yet more ground and forget our Amendments 11, 12 and 13.
That is our bottom line.
Why?
Quite simply because the Iraqis are watching us and reading us and because they expect from Europe not only hope but also truth.
Commissioner, your words were well chosen and full of compassion and we support you.
We want to rebuild Iraq, but with the Iraqis, for the Iraqis and for them alone.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, Foreign Secretary Straw, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I wish to welcome you here and wish you good luck with your work.
Scarcely a day goes by without new attacks in Iraq being reported.
Suicide attacks, acts of terrorism, kidnappings and other outrages directed against Iraqi and foreign civilians, journalists and soldiers are unfortunately now becoming everyday fare.
Most of us only need see it on TV, but the Iraqi people are living in the middle of this situation.
It is a priority task for the whole of the world community to support the Iraqi authorities in bringing the violence to an end, rebuilding the country and introducing democracy, peace and stability.
Europe has a big responsibility to support this process through its presence and through money, trade, aid and all other possible forms of help, for example police training and training in the holding of elections.
We have had many harsh exchanges in this House about the American invasion, but we must look to the future now.
On behalf of my group, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Dimitrakopoulos, for his work on the report and for trying to be so constructive and forward-looking.
We do not need to dig ourselves into trenches.
We do not need to harp on what is past.
I wish to appeal to all the groups to try to look forwards.
To demand now that all the troops be withdrawn would be a disaster for the Iraqi people. people are needed in Iraq, and we genuinely support the call to try to bring about a UN-led force with a European presence, if that is possible.
The Iraqi people are courageous and patient.
They showed this during the election, and they show it every day.
With its constitution, the Iraqi Government has ambitious goals.
We naturally support the work on creating democratic institutions, strong protection for women and minorities and support for a society founded on the rule of law.
We would also appeal to Iraq to abolish the death penalty in the longer term.
If required, the EU can help in making expertise in constitutional work available.
The road towards democracy and security is difficult and long.
Success would turn Iraq into a fantastic model for the whole region, but that will require increased aid from Europe and from ourselves here in the European Parliament, involving contact with the elected Iraqi Members of Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by congratulating the rapporteur on his reportâs strong points, for example, the replacement of American and British troops by UN security troops, which will, in time, improve the security situation to a vast degree.
I think the rapporteur is right, and I would like to urge Mr Straw to show more commitment in this area, not only telling this House that he is in agreement, but also, among other things, by adopting a tougher line in the Security Council.
Another strong point is the need for national reconciliation and for no crime to go unpunished.
I appreciate the fact that, in his report, the rapporteur refers to a number of positive developments in Iraq, including the elections in January 2005.
Having said that, there are two important failings in the report that I would like to mention.
The first one is the deteriorating security situation.
Although this will, in time, be improved by troop replacements, at the moment, the speed at which things are being done is simply too slow and the direction too unclear.
I am entirely convinced that there will be no fundamental improvement in the security situation without a more radical and a more rapid transfer of powers.
Secondly, I simply have to return to the issue of the ambiguity surrounding the start of the war, particularly in the first recitals.
Like the rapporteur, I believe that both the European Union and this House will need to focus on the future and future cooperation between the European Union and Iraq, but not even in this House can there be any effective and concerted action without an objective assessment of the past.
That is why my group has tabled a number of amendments that underline this, addressing, among other things, the lack of legitimisation by the UN.
The overwhelming majority of my group will not vote to endorse the report unless those amendments are adopted.
If we do not learn from past mistakes, we risk repeating them, and that is something we should avoid at all costs.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the report that has been submitted to us on the European Unionâs engagement in Iraq states, as early as its first paragraph, and I quote, that we âneed to move on from past events and to look towards the futureâ.
In other words, keep mum about the war, those responsible for it and its consequences.
This approach seems to me to be ethically irresponsible, politically suspect and strategically unrealistic.
It is ethically irresponsible.
What right do we have to write off the unspeakable suffering that this war has already brought to the Iraqi people: the 100 000 innocent victims, the destruction, the total lack of security, the deprivations and the humiliation of the occupation?
Let us remember once again that this war was started against the wishes of the international community and on the basis of a twofold lie: that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that Al-Qaeda had been in the country before 2003.
We can no longer regard as insignificant the legitimate anger of many Americans, British and others towards their leaders, whom they do not intend to forgive for deceiving them and drawing them into this bloody and inglorious venture.
Covering up the origins of the present fiasco would also be politically suspect.
The current leaders of the Commission and the Council are precisely those who were among the most ardent supporters of the American President.
Let us imagine that the vagaries of scheduling had forced the recent transatlantic summit to be put back by two weeks.
We should have had a startling photo of the meeting: Mr Bush, Mr Blair and Mr Barroso, almost a repeat of the Azores Summit of 2003.
Would they then have had nothing to say to us about their assessment of the consequences for Europe of the decisions they took then and the lessons that they have now learned?
It would be too easy, Mr Straw, to welcome the new spirit only, in so doing, to pay off such a heavy liability.
Far from eradicating terrorism, this war has transformed Iraq, according to the CIA itself â and I quote â into a terrorist laboratory where the Jihadists come to train in urban warfare, and this for maybe another twelve years, according to Mr Rumsfeld.
You owe us some explanations!
Finally, I believe that it is unrealistic to believe in the lasting success of a political solution in Iraq, which would save us from condemning this war.
Neither Europe nor the United Nations has the authority to provide back-up troops for occupiers in difficulties.
Now is the time to send this entire battered region some strong political signals, such as a decision to proscribe all recourse to war in future as a way of resolving the worldâs problems, or the implementation of the Quartetâs commitments, that have never been kept, to restore the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, or substantial aid for the creation of civil society â and I salute the representatives of civil society who were welcomed by my group yesterday â and a totally free and sovereign authority in Iraq.
Mr President, we are told that Europe urgently needs to engage in a major project and this is one!
Â Â  . Mr President, among the elements slowing down Iraqâs reconstruction are the ongoing suicide attacks.
The European institutions can make a substantial contribution to keeping this almost exclusively Arabic jihadism under control.
How?
By finally giving Iraqâs closest neighbour, Syria, a clear warning, because to date, Syria has acted as the perfect springboard for Islamic terrorists from Mesopotamia.
What I would say to both the Council and Commission is that we cannot, surely, under these circumstances, entertain the idea of an association agreement with Damascus.
Moreover, I would like the Council to tell us to what extent Al-Qaeda jihadists are being recruited from within the European Union, and to what extent terrorism against Iraq is being funded by mosques based in Europe.
Although Mr Dimitrakopoulos, in his report, fails to spell out the disruptive Arab influence on Iraqâs general reconstruction process, I do welcome his unambiguous request to the Commission for a meticulous justification of all EU projects in Iraq.
Indeed, that is something that taxpayers in the EU Member States have every right to have at their disposal.
Mr Dimitrakopoulos does, however, address another, second, obstacle to Iraqâs reconstruction in the shape of the widespread evil of corruption within that countryâs administrative apparatus.
Once again, the European Union can make a valuable contribution to Mesopotamiaâs prospects.
Corruption and security are closely related.
âOnly transparency can get us out of this quagmireâ, said the Kurdish politician Mohammed Toufik, and he was right.
This represents a new set of aid tasks for the European Union in Iraq.
I would like to add that I have a great deal of respect for the US, British and other international troops, and wish them much strength in their endeavours to achieve a better âŠ
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, during the Communist era in Poland, a joke did the rounds about a travel agency that allegedly used the following advertising slogan; âvisit the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union visits youâ.
An updated version of this joke might be; âlet us take care of Iraq before Iraqi terrorists take care of usâ.
The EU Special Representative for Afghanistan recently said that our political presence and substantial financial involvement in the country were necessary because the EU had made the mistake of failing to take any interest whatsoever in Afghanistan between 1990 and 2001.
We should avoid making the same mistake with Iraq, and we should not leave the country to the Americans.
In my opinion, both supporters and opponents of US intervention in Iraq â and I include myself in the latter camp â can and should agree on the fact that the EU must act as a stabilising force in Iraq and the surrounding region.
The EU committed a grave error by failing to send observers to the January 2005 elections in Iraq.
He who is absent is always in the wrong, and has no say in how he would like events to unfold.
I should like to end by thanking MrÂ Straw for our meeting last Thursday in London, and to tell him that the Committee on Foreign Affairs still has the same chairman, namely Elmar Brok.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, a fortnight ago, our committee welcomed a delegation from the provisional parliament of Iraq, led by its President and his deputy, and including all factions â Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds together.
I was pleasantly surprised to note the interest these leading representatives of their communities had in finding a solution that would include reconciliation and would join the religious and ethnic groups together, and the way they engaged in serious discussions to this end.
The chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was also present.
One thing on which, or so I believe, the long-term peace of this country depends, is a balance of power in the form of a sort of federal structure, one secured, in bad times and good, by means of a constitution.
We could thereby arrive at a way of doing things that would give everyone the feeling that their interests were secure, as was also, though, their religious and ethnic identity, and that would also have an influence in the cultural sphere.
On this, I believe, the success of the enterprise largely depends, for it was often the case, in these states formerly under colonial rule, that a small group held the reins of power, and in Iraq, this was the Sunnis, something I regard as one of the main reasons behind this terrorism, and we must â as you, Commissioner, said â succeed in spelling that out, or else it will not be clear to the public where the benefit for them lies.
They have to see that the terrorists are attempting to make democracy and power-sharing impossible; that they do not want stability, for stability will bring the investments that will improve conditions in the country.
It is by these means that they seek to regain their former positions of power, or for purely ideological reasons, to nip democracy in the bud.
At the time, I was an opponent of the war, but that is now irrelevant.
What matters now is that we, together, win the peace and establish democracy.
We have to bridge the gulfs by which we have long been divided and, by means of a multilateral approach, make it possible for this country to become stable and democratic, with consequent benefits â not least for us â right across the region.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report could have and should have been more courageous, since what we are discussing are issues of life and death and of the strategic future of our Union.
The text has certainly been improved, but in too many places it has become detached from the reality on the ground.
This war is now lost, and it has done much to aid the jihadist terrorists, instead of weakening them.
If Mr Bush were wise, he would announce a wholesale withdrawal, without maintaining any strategic bases, and he would implement it in accordance with a precise timetable.
As always, in asymmetrical conflicts there is no military solution, but only a political solution.
The new Iraqi Government is demonstrating this to us.
In point of fact, it is not negotiating with the terrorists, but with the resistance, including it in the reconstruction process.
For this reason, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, it is important to insert the word âresistanceâ into the report, since today in Iraq there are both insurgents resisting the occupation and terrorists, and their objectives are different.
In addition, it was also important to point out that the war against Iraq was cold-bloodedly sought by Mr Bush and deliberately sustained through a tissue of lies.
Iraq, in fact, did not possess weapons of mass destruction, nor did it have links with Al-Qaeda.
Once the invasion had been completed there was a moral duty to reconstruct Iraq, at least in physical terms, but political and military arrogance, incompetence, corruption and ineptitude have prevented this.
Thus, even passing over the disgrace of Abu Ghraib, they have lost, without winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.
I therefore also address the Council and Commission representatives: now is the time to abandon the weaknesses of past divisions and to focus even more firmly on a common policy in order to escape the impotence that dogs minority coalitions.
Europe is worthwhile only if we think, decide and work together.
Otherwise, it is just a charming collection of little bonsais crushed by the first passing elephant.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the war in Iraq Europe has experienced one of its greatest divisions of opinion, and because of this the Dimitrakopoulos report accomplishes a semi-miracle in seeking a possible equilibrium.
Many deficiencies, however, still remain.
The actual situation on the ground unfortunately confirms all the doubts expressed by those who declared themselves opposed to military intervention.
We waited for the turning point with the fall and capture of Saddam Hussein, and later we hoped that the turning point would come after the elections in January, and that the Allawi government would actually be able to stabilise the country.
In reality, we know that things have turned out differently.
If we look at the civilian victims of the suicide attackers, the unrecorded acts of violence by Iraqis on Iraqis and the increase in the weekly attacks on the occupying forces, Iraq is the largest terrorist training ground on the planet.
Today, however, we should not look towards the past but concentrate on the future, which is why we have given the Allawi government our endorsement, committed ourselves to the reconstruction and supported the recent resolutions.
On this point, we have set ourselves three objectives, namely the prior commitment â as the Solana doctrine calls it â with neighbouring countries, which can lend us a hand, not only not to export terrorists but also to help Iraq to emerge from the abyss; the training of the security forces, who are vital in planning the withdrawal of the occupying troops; and, finally, the constitutional agreement.
This is truly the last turning point.
Either we are able to keep the country united with the constitutional agreement, or an inexorable civil war will break out.
The signs of tension that are also present in Kurdistan give us cause to believe that this is really the last chance Europe has to achieve a better situation in the coming months.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, ladies and gentlemen, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
What I mean is that if accounts are not settled with the past, the past will sooner or later come back to haunt us, presenting us with a very expensive and dramatic bill.
If we do not condemn the war today, it is not possible to understand what is happening in Iraq at the moment.
The war and terrorism continue to feed off each other.
Before the war in Iraq there was no terrorism.
We have to have the courage to say that the occupying armies are an element producing insecurity and not security.
We have to have the courage to say that the United States and its allies went into Iraq because there is oil there and because they wanted to get hold of it, and certainly not to spread democracy.
Yesterday we met representatives of civil society, human rights organisations, trade unions and womenâs organisations, who explained to us that this society is active and wants to have a say in its own future.
Europe should look at this issue too, and not just at its relationship with a government voted in in elections that were held under foreign military occupation.
Â Â  â Mr President, are we afraid or are we ashamed of the truth?
Are we afraid or are we ashamed of it, Giorgos?
The simple truth is that we have an occupying army and we have an irresponsible invasion by the Americans, British and Spaniards.
That is the truth.
With the occupation which we went through and which you went through in 1940, we too had executions and abductions.
That is what we did to the victor and that is what the people of Iraq are doing today and rightly so.
The occupying forces must leave.
They must leave this country free to find its way.
They must pay compensation for the wrong they have done.
They must leave them the oil, and with oil at 60 dollars a barrel they will find their way.
As long as there is an occupying army, there will also be crimes.
They need to understand that.
That is the real truth.
We have lived through it.
When Stalin interfered in Greece's internal affairs from 1944 to 1949, we slaughtered each other for many years.
The occupying army must leave.
That is the right thing to do.
Let us speak the truth.
We should not be ashamed.
We should not come here and legislate from the safety of Strasbourg and Brussels.
Let us go and say what we have to say in Vasora.
Let us go and say what we have to say in Baghdad.
That is where the people are, that is where the truth is, that is where the problem is.
Long live democracy.
Long live freedom.
Long live self-determination.
Â Â  Mr President, that the alleged presence of weapons of mass destruction was used by the USA as a pretext for forcing their way into Iraq, and that the Americans are currently engaged in forcing their conception of democracy onto the Iraqi people, are matters of common knowledge.
It is not only the duration of this intervention, but also its cost and side-effects that were underestimated.
Iraq is now a lawless place, offering extremists the ideal opportunity to regroup and amass combat experience.
The American invasion has turned the country into a training camp for terrorists from every corner of the world, and these have now only to wait for the opportunity to put their newly-acquired skills into practice on our soil.
Even now, then, we all have to pay the price for Americaâs mistakes, be it in the shape of more terrorist activity or of a constant increase in recruitment by extremist Islamic groups.
The idea that Europe should cough up even more, by sending troops, for this aberrance on the part of the USA, is quite unacceptable.
It is because Iraq will know peace and a resolution of its problems only if these things come from within itself that we should rather give our support to the restoration of education, the reconstruction of the economy and the fight against rampant corruption.
Those are things Europe could do, and they would bear fruit.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by congratulating MrÂ Dimitrakopoulos on the huge amount of work he has put into this complicated but extremely important issue.
After years of Saddam Husseinâs regime, the Iraqi people have now been given the opportunity to construct their country in a free and democratic way.
The parliamentary election, which was conducted under great pressure from forces that were interested in neither democracy nor free elections, was the first step in the democratisation process.
It was also a chance for politics to triumph over terrorism and violence, but that did not happen.
Even though a transitional government has been formed and work has begun on devising the new constitution, the security situation in Iraq has not been stabilised as it should have been.
On the contrary, the situation is such that, for a long time to come, efforts will have to go on being made and a strong international presence will be required.
Obviously, the earlier Iraq itself guarantees security in the country, the better.
On the basis of what we have learned from other conflicts in our own neighbourhood, for example the wars in the Balkans that I myself experienced, we cannot however expect any quick results.
Constructing peace and democracy takes time and would do so even if all the forces in the country were well disposed towards these goals.
Still more time is required in countries such as Iraq or Bosnia where there is a variety of groups opposing the democratisation process.
We need time and patience, however, for, if we were not to show sufficient support for Iraqâs efforts at political democratisation or too quickly to withdraw the international forces from Iraq, we should be jeopardising the peace not only in Iraq itself but also in the surrounding region, and that is something we cannot afford to do.
Therefore, our only alternative is to continue to support Iraq, both politically and through a strong international presence for as long as that is required.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner pointed out quite correctly that Europe now stands united in its efforts to rebuild Iraq.
In my opinion, unification is precisely what would make it possible to stabilise the situation in Iraq and to overcome the problems we have there at present.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, we have before us a difficult compromise, which has emerged after many weeks of debate.
I should like to call on all the rabble rousers in the Chamber, for whom time stopped two years ago and who still use the language of that period, to study this compromise and to ask themselves whether Iraqis will gain more from this compromise or from their rabble-rousing.
Anyone who fails to differentiate between anonymous, civilian-killing criminals and the coalition forces, made up of soldiers risking their lives in Iraq, is quite simply a liar, and I would protest against such lies.
I have two suggestions for the Council and the Commission.
Firstly, more pressure should be brought to bear on Iraqâs neighbours.
Previous speakers have already referred to Syria, and recent events both there and in Iran have shown that these countries must bear responsibility for what is happening within their borders.
The international community must put pressure on them, and they must also bear part of the responsibility for what is happening in Iraq.
These countries cannot pursue policies in secret, while sending out misleading signals.
Secondly, we must strengthen our dialogue with the political leadership in Iraq.
Even though deep-rooted ethnic and religious divisions exist within the interim parliament, we must still talk to these people.
Those who do not fight are our partners.
Finally, the suggestion to send peacekeeping troops to the country is a splendid but naÃ¯ve idea.
Which army would be able to go out in blue helmets and protect the Iraqis?
This is a task for a well-armed and well-prepared Iraqi army, as they are the only ones capable of protecting their own people.
Â Â  Mr President, reports before this Parliament seldom contain jokes, but there is some humour, if unintentional, in this one.
Paragraph 43 suggests that the European Union âoffers its expertise and assistance with a view to the drafting of the Iraqi Constitutionâ.
Iraqis might think that the European Unionâs expertise and experience in this field leaves something to be desired.
Its last attempt produced a Constitution that was opaque and confused and ran to almost 500 pages.
On the other hand, the United States of America has a clear and concise Constitution that runs to just a few pages of paper, with only about 27 amendments needed over the past 200 years.
If the Iraqis need some help, they might prefer to ask the Americans to lend a hand.
If the EU becomes involved it might even offer to organise the constitutional referendum for the Iraqis, and that could lead to all kinds of unwanted problems.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Iraq is the frontline of the war against terrorists.
These terrorists have made it quite clear that their goal is to force foreign powers to withdraw from Iraq, and then to crush the beginnings of democracy in the country.
The world cannot allow them to achieve their goals or to carry out their plans, and the EU Member States cannot afford to allow such a thing to happen.
The war on terror is a global challenge with which the world was confronted at the beginning of the 21st century.
This is a war that we must win, because our opponent does not understand the meaning of such words as treaty, agreement, compromise, dialogue or peace.
The aim of modern terrorism is to destroy the civilisation in which we live.
Its current target is the United States, but it will be Europeâs turn in a few monthsâ time.
The EU should therefore resolve to take joint decisions that are both courageous and practical, as it is no longer enough to provide EURÂ 200Â million in aid.
The EU should start by responding to the basic problems faced by the Iraqi population.
These include a lack of water, to which two million Iraqis have no access, a lack of food â according to the latest UN report, one in four children goes hungry â a lack of work, with unemployment standing at 70%, a lack of security and the fear of terrorist attacks.
The destruction of pipelines and other oil installations by saboteurs has meant that Iraq has suffered losses of USDÂ 11Â billion over the past two years.
These are issues that should be included on the EUâs list of priority areas for aid to Iraq.
We cannot allow our most notable effort towards reconstructing Iraq to be the announcement that a Commission representation will be opened in Baghdad, or the sending of an observation mission to the December elections.
It is ordinary Iraqis who are waiting most impatiently for concrete assistance.
We must step up our involvement in Iraq, and this involvement must be better organised.
We need a vision that is worthy of a community comprising 25Â Member States.
The cost of failure would be high.
A defeat for the democratic forces would strengthen the terroristsâ position, and this would have a knock-on effect in the shape of a new wave of terrorism, not only in Iraq but all over the world.
Peace in Iraq will be key for the development of transatlantic relations and for peace in the region as a whole.
Pressure must be brought to bear on Syria and Iran to ensure that these countries no longer provide support to terrorists there.
Â Â  For some time now we have been hearing that we should not be referring to the past and that there is no need to talk about the reasons for the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its ad-hoc coalition and allies.
IÂ am sorry, but IÂ disagree deeply with this view, because the ad-hoc coalition created and led by the Americans invaded aÂ sovereign state without any international or legally acceptable mandate.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Straw, history has shown us on numerous occasions that mankind could have avoided many of its mistakes if it had carefully analysed its errors and moral failures.
Unfortunately, we seem to be unable to learn from our own mistakes.
Mr. Dimitrakopoulos, not only am IÂ able to pronounce your name, but IÂ respect you as aÂ colleague from the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Yet, IÂ cannot support your resolution, even though IÂ am aware of the amount of effort you have put into it, and I agree with MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser, that without the passage of our draft amendments, this resolution would have no authority whatsoever.
Â Â  Mr President, first I want to pay tribute to Mr Dimitrakopoulos, a name which I have become familiar with in recent months.
He has worked extremely hard to get this report right, seeking compromise from all sides to create a report that I think represents the views and aspirations of the vast majority of this Parliament.
That is not an easy job when it comes to Iraq.
One of the positive aspects of this report is the recurring theme of the need for us all to look forward with Iraq; concentrating on what can be achieved as Iraq moves ahead into the future and not constantly referring to mistakes and decisions made in the past.
The rapporteur has not allowed this report to be hijacked by those who want to rehash the debate on the basis for war in Iraq and the legalities surrounding that decision, or lack of them.
This is a valid debate but it adds nothing positive to this report at this stage.
Instead, the report concentrates on what the EU's role will and should be in the future, assisting the new authorities in Iraq.
Many issues are dealt with; I want to refer to three of them.
First, in relation to political support, I was glad to hear Mr Brok referring to the visit of representatives from the transitional National Assembly to this Parliament recently, and it was a welcome event.
They called for assistance, support and help in relation to the drafting of the new constitution in Iraq, which is something I think we should do wholeheartedly and enthusiastically.
Primarily, we need to ensure that there is full participation of all groups in the drafting of that constitution.
Second, in relation to security, we should not forget that, as we speak, there are European citizens in Iraq trying to provide security in difficult circumstances.
We need to look forward to see what the EU can do collectively.
To that end, I welcome the fact that we are going to see an EU delegation in Baghdad in the near future.
I also welcome the Rule of Law and Police Training Mission, which will add considerably to the security situation in Iraq, and the new call for a new UN Security Council Resolution on Iraq, which is outlined in detail in the report.
That is a brave new call.
Finally, we should not forget our human rights principles, despite the very difficult and extreme circumstances that continue in Iraq, particularly in relation to the death penalty.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the emphasis of the rapporteur and of Amendment 12, by the PSE Group, in supporting the EUâs positive commitment to the social, economic and political reconstruction of Iraq, to the success of the January elections, to the doubling of international partners for Iraq, as represented at the Brussels Conference, and to our united condemnation of all violence, kidnappings and human rights abuses within Iraq.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party cannot support those amendments that seek to rekindle the divisions of the past.
In that context, I note that Amendment 3, by the Verts/ALE Group, seeks to delete this Parliamentâs commitment to fighting both terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Everyone should vote against that amendment.
Finally, there is a link between this debate and the next on development.
Twenty years under Saddam Hussein left five million Iraqis suffering from chronic poverty, the fastest increase in child mortality of any country in the world, access to safe water for less than half the people in rural areas and 60% wholly dependent on food handouts.
Today the European Parliament reaffirms its commitment to the right for development for the Iraqi people, as well as their right to peace.
Â Â  . Mr President, the post-Iraq-war phase can be compared to some degree with the period after the Second World War, even if it is not on the same scale.
However, we have to get over all our past differences and quarrels and look to the future. That is the only solution.
We cannot just talk about the situation, we have to take action, we have to turn the page.
That is why the Commission has been seeking over the past two years to contribute, through its support for reconstruction, to promote reconciliation within Iraq and in the international community.
As Mr Brok and Mrs Morgantini pointed out, we must also ensure that the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq produce benefits for all Iraqis.
That must be an inclusive approach.
Of course we have to look to the constitution.
It has to be a constitution that gives ownership to the Iraqis, that really protects the territorial integrity of Iraq but, at the same time, looks to the federal possibilities.
That is the only way to secure the right balance between the different ethnic elements.
It also has to look to the future, creating a modern society in which women and religious communities must be given an appropriate stake.
Therefore, the constitution is of the greatest importance.
It is also very important to build the institutions of the new Iraq.
There has been a great deal of talk about energy and trade.
I believe that, in order to restore the possibility for Iraqis to develop themselves, there has to be capacity-building with the Ministries of Trade and Energy.
We supported the elections and we will support the next elections if the security situation will allow it.
It is also very important to ensure the further development of the Iraqi police and judiciary.
The âEujustlexâ mission that began on 1 July will be of great importance and will hopefully make a significant contribution.
This involves the training of 770 policemen and judiciary members.
We also have to refocus on the social services, such as education, health and sanitation.
People must be allowed to live their lives.
At the moment they only have electricity for a few hours per day, in a climate where temperatures reach 50 degrees centigrade.
We know how difficult it is.
Conditions on the ground are exceedingly difficult.
We are also aware of delays in some implementation because of the difficult situation.
We therefore have ongoing discussions with the World Bank, the UN and the Iraqis themselves.
