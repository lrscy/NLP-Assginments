Surveys show there are differences in the way in which men and women use Internet services.
Similarly, we have worrying evidence about the small percentage of women Internet users in the accession countries.
In order to increase the number of women in education and training in the new technologies, my report proposes the inclusion of computers and the Internet into primary schooling from an early age, so as to encourage young girls to take up lessons in a positive direction.
Surveys show that contact with science and technology at an early age could change the attitude of women before stereotyping starts to affect their behaviour.
The Lisbon strategy and the employment guidelines should be applied in order to limit the gender division of labour, with women concentrated in certain professions with low qualification requirements, low pay and no prospects of advancement.
That is why both the Commission and the Member States should undertake the commitment, with the full use of Structural Funds and in particular the Social Fund, for training in the new technologies, particularly with regard to the entry or return of women to the labour market, always in the context of the Lisbon objectives.
At the same time, sexual equality policies and programmes need to be implemented that aim especially to vocational training, lifelong learning, compatibility between professional and private life and the equal division of family responsibilities between men and women, which will facilitate women's access to the information society.
Special attention should be given to the content of the multimedia, in order to promote positive images of women, such as the amazing performance of women at all levels of education.
We are calling on the European Commission and the Member States to promote the full and equal participation of women in the media, including the administration, planning, management, education and projection sectors.
At the same time, policies need to be adopted that will improve working conditions in new sectors, such as teleworking.
Special attention needs to be given to improving women's access to the Internet and new technologies by creating an extensive infrastructure and by providing technological equipment in rural and suburban areas, which are poorly served today, especially in the poorer areas and the accession countries.
All the policies of the European Union should promote a strategy to safeguard the basic infrastructure which will provide access, equipment and connections for every house, school, public building and library.
In order to combat social exclusion, priority must be given to vulnerable groups of girls and women, immigrants, the disabled, the destitute, unmarried mothers, women farmers etc. Similarly, the Commission needs to collate additional statistics on structural differences in the IT sector, so that we can investigate the real participation of women, their representation and trends in the job market.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities emphasises that, up to now, the gender dimension in the new technology sector has been completely ignored.
That is why, within the framework of the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society to be held in Geneva in December 2003, we are calling on the Commission and the Council to submit practical strategy proposals and contribute to the incorporation of horizontal policies for gender equality.
The digital economy offers both opportunities and challenges to women, challenges which differ from the challenges to men and are based on their different roles and places in the family and society.
Integrating the gender dimension into the development of new technologies does not only raise the question of access, quantitative participation and the equal representation of women; it also raises a deeper question and presents an opportunity for a critical evaluation of the culture of the information society, with its values, development strategies and objectives and the involvement of human resources.
I hope that my report will contribute to the public dialogue on the kind of information society we want.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I wish to thank MrsÂ Karamanou for her work on this report on women in the new information society.
As we know, globalisation and the information and communications technologies (ICT) have dramatically changed all areas of social and professional life in Europe.
More than half of all people working today use computers in their professional lives, 40% of Europeans use the Internet and, in the last five years, more than 60% of all new jobs created in the Union have been in the high-tech sectors.
One fact leaps out from these figures: there will be no real need for workers who do not have the necessary education to use the new technologies.
Progress has been made in the field of gender equality, with almost as many women (46%) using computers as men (54%), and the situation is similar as regards the Internet.
The gap between men and women is growing within disadvantaged groups, however.
The new technologies offer new opportunities for jobs and for peopleâs working lives, including teleworking which, at least in theory, can help women and men better to reconcile family and working life.
Although women appear to be more interested in teleworking now, they are still not making great use of it, so much remains to be done in this area.
Men occupy two-thirds of all jobs in new technology sectors. Only 15% of professionals in this sector are women, and the figures are more or less the same when it comes to education.
In some countries, less than 30% of women go on to study the new technologies in higher education.
Women account for 19% of doctorates in computing, and the percentage of women setting up their own businesses is much lower.
In the world of business, the higher up the decision-making ladder you go, the fewer women you find in the new information sector, although I believe this is to some extent the case in all sectors.
In this context, the Lisbon strategy and the European Social Policy Agenda and the Employment Strategy have played a significant role in promoting womenâs access to the information society, including all the steps adopted by Education Ministers at national and European level.
By the same token, the Framework Strategy for Gender Equality encourages an employability-oriented approach and womenâs access to jobs in the new technologies sector.
A number of other Community-funded programmes also promote gender equality, and the social partners have a key role to play in supporting womenâs participation in the information society.
If we want to achieve results, all of these policies clearly need to be consolidated and, in this, the Commissionâs role is crucial, but all parties involved at all levels must seize the opportunity represented by the new knowledge-based society to ensure that men and women are equally represented in the sector.
To my mind, all future action should hinge on three priorities.
First of all, it should focus on finding a place for women everywhere and in all social situations.
Secondly, emphasis should be placed on education and training.
Thirdly, work must be done to improve the rate of employment for women and the percentage of women setting up their own businesses in the new technology sector.
As I said at the beginning of this speech, particular attention must be paid to women who risk being excluded from the information society, including women who are older, unemployed or on a low income, women who are immigrants or who have disabilities and, above all, women who have not received sufficient education.
The necessary infrastructure must be established in towns and at regional and local level.
Improving access to broadband connections can prevent exclusion in both urban and rural areas.
Access to the new technologies in all areas must not be confined to helping women to find new jobs.
By promoting new working methods, new ways of organising work, such action will also create the conditions necessary to bring about change in current employment practices.
I have already mentioned teleworking, but the quality of work and the level of work satisfaction could also be improved. Finally, it could further integrate women into the labour force.
Increasing the participation of women in the labour market is crucial to attaining the objectives set in Lisbon and significantly improving enterprise creation could make a real change to the hand women are dealt.
We must improve the role women are given in the fields of ownership, supervision and management in the ICT and media sectors, by providing the necessary assistance to women who set up their own businesses, by funding projects and by cooperating on implementing action plans, particularly in knowledge-based sectors, by supporting awareness-raising campaigns and by encouraging women to grasp job opportunities in the new technologies sector, once they are trained.
We must establish conditions that will enable all women to participate in employment, including mothers of young children, older women and women with disabilities.
In order to achieve equality between men and women, womenâs representation in the market must be improved, but in itself, this is not enough.
Women must also play a major role in decision-making bodies and in society in general.
As regards the new technologies, real changes in the field of gender equality will only be truly effective when women also occupy senior positions in this sector.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this action requires partnership and practical action.
Increasing the participation of women in the information society is an issue that concerns everyone.
The Commission, the European Parliament, governments, regional and local authorities, the unions and employers all share this responsibility, which the Commission hopes everyone will shoulder.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of this evening's debate is not just one aspect of women's modern professional life; it is particularly important to the development of the European Union, the success of the Lisbon objectives and, of course, the future of women themselves.
The whole world is developing into an information society and our experience shows that those states, areas and citizens most familiar with these new opportunities have greater chances of employment and advancement.
That is why the new technologies do not by themselves constitute a market sector with a constant increase in jobs but do affect the development of other sectors.
The European Union is lagging behind the United States in research and the use of new technologies.
However, even inside the European Union there are discrepancies between the Member States, between the regions and, unfortunately, between the two sexes, as both the rapporteur and the Commissioner have pointed out.

My honourable friend Anna Karamanou has taken a highly positive initiative in drafting a report on this subject; a report which will give us a better understanding of the problem and the need to take suitable, efficient measures with suitable cooperation at European, national and local level.
The rapporteur's proposals touch on a broad range of policies to promote the participation of women in the world of new technologies; policies which relate to the workplace, the business world and the world of education and rightly point out that, in order to achieve this objective, women need to participate in the planning of and decisions on the relevant policies.
I should like to comment in particular on facilitating Internet connections for housewives, because this will make life easier for women themselves.
At Community level, the averages vary perceptibly: 48% of men and 38% of women have a home connection.
Our experience tells us that access for women may have multiple benefits for society.
And as this year is the year of the people with disabilities, I should like to refer in particular to the initiatives taken by mothers in order to deal with their children's health problems.
Today, we can find websites on the Internet where mothers exchange experiences and promote solutions to an impressive degree.
Take, for example, the Dyspraxia Foundation, which was set up in 1987 by two English mothers, Stella White and Marion Owen. Their names deserve to be mentioned.
Today, this initiative is a reference point for mothers and an example which has been followed in various European countries and elsewhere, in Canada and in Japan, where mothers are setting up similar websites with positive, specific results in the application of new methods to deal with their children's physical and mental health problems.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0344/2003) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Hellenic Republic with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on the creation of an immigration liaison officers network (9870/2003 C5-0260/2003 2003/0817(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, the conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20Â June expressed the need to speed up work on adopting, before the end of 2003, a legal instrument intended officially to create a network of âImmigrationâ liaison officers (ILOs).
The idea is that all these âImmigrationâ liaison officers of the Member States, located in the same foreign country, should work effectively together, within networks, in order to contribute to the gradual establishment of the coordinated and integrated management of our external borders.
The regulation proposed by Greece is needed to provide a framework for formalising and strengthening the informal cooperation that already exists between liaison officers.
The ideal situation would be to have Community âImmigrationâ liaison officers with their own duties, who are trained and paid by the Union, but unfortunately neither the jurisdiction nor the budget for this yet exists and some States remain unconvinced.
Liaison officers symbolise the external representation of the Member States, and some people do not look favourably on any loss of their national prerogative.
In the meantime, this new proposal for a regulation is, to my mind, a step towards achieving greater transparency.
There are essentially three types of task that would be given to the liaison officers: they would help to prevent illegal immigration and to combat the traffickers, they would help to return illegal immigrants and would contribute to the management of legal immigration.
This last point is still rather vague, however, since the form that this management might take is not set out in any of the regulationâs articles and yet is, I believe, a crucial matter.
This is, therefore, a shortcoming that needs to be remedied and, in fact, contrary to what some would have us believe, foreigners are not dangerous; they are in danger themselves.
People who leave their country, their friends and family, to immigrate to the European Union do so for significant reasons that are often matters of life or death.
Each one of us would probably, in the same economic, social, psychological and emotional conditions, do the same.
We must, therefore, disseminate information on the possibilities of legal immigration in the countries concerned.
To achieve this, I believe we must all be clear about our immigration policy, which is not currently the case.
We must also warn people about the risk that they face of falling into the hands of unscrupulous smugglers or of finding themselves involved with a slave-trading network.
In order, however, for these measures to be truly effective, I call on the Member States to ensure that they are not themselves the cause of some illegal activity.
To this end they should, as I see it, act on two fronts: firstly, on the status of temporary workers.
Studies of the black labour market in European farming indeed show that undeclared overtime and the use of illegal methods of recruiting for the farming labour force, which sometimes border on slavery, are increasing in the Member States.
Often, the major distribution chains put pressure on producers, who then use unemployed and illegal workers and it is unthinkable that we should accept contracts that place workers beyond the law.
I wish to emphasise that, very often, making legislation tougher reduces the number of legal workers and increases the number of illegal workers, whom it in no way prevents getting through.
Furthermore, it is crucial that we avoid making a link between immigration and organised crime.
Illegal immigrants are not criminals, but human beings who have not been fortunate enough to be born in the right place.
A clearer distinction should therefore be made between the roles of liaison officers, âImmigrationâ liaison officers, airport liaison officers, documentary advisers, technical advisers and consular services, all of which deal with immigration issues, and it would also appear appropriate to delineate the area of activity of liaison officers and precisely define their tasks.
There should also be some harmonisation, even if only partial, of the training they should receive.
Some ILOs interviewed when the Danish Presidency report was being drafted see this as a for the creation of a genuine network.
This training could normally be given in the form of seminars and workshops, which would have the undeniable advantage of fostering personal contact â the very essence of a network.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that in no case must immigration be seen as a threat.
In no case must illegal immigrants be seen as criminals.
They are victims, because they have had the misfortune to be born in a beleaguered country. They are victims because they are desperate and are looking for compassion.
If the European Union is incapable of understanding that, then we can only despair of progress and of the civilised world.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its communication of November 2001 on a policy for combating illegal immigration, the Commission set out, in the chapter on measures to be implemented within the Unionâs external border, the need for a network of immigration liaison officers.
The Commission is of the view that this network must ensure the necessary exchange of information between immigration liaison officers and also the coordination that the Member States must develop with third countries in order to work together in the field of European immigration policy.
The action plans adopted by the Council on illegal immigration and on the management of our external borders, as well as the conclusions of the Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils, also express the need for the creation of such a network.
The Commission, therefore, looks favourably on the initiative adopted by the Greek Government to table this proposal.
We share the idea, as emphasised by the rapporteur, Mrs Honeyball, that some rules contained in this initiative, in particular as regards the system of information exchanges between liaison officers, are sometimes excessively vague.
Taken as a whole, however, we believe the text provides a good working basis for more structured and better coordinated cooperation with third countries in the field of immigration.
This coordination will become even more important in future with the new requirements that will shortly be adopted on the policy of visas being issued in third countries.
Once this regulation is approved, immigration liaison officers posted to third countries must form effective networks for cooperation at local or regional level on the basis of the positive precedent set by the network established in the Western Balkans at the initiative of the United Kingdom and which has shown positive results in regulating immigration from that region to the States of the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has discussed the proposal for a regulation implementing an initiative by the Hellenic Republic, as decided at the Thessaloniki summit, on the crucial social and political issue of illegal immigration.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs has unanimously accepted certain amendments, most of which have also been accepted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and will, I hope, also be accepted by Parliament, and which improve the regulation.
There have been previous proceedings on the matter in the European Union at previous Councils, but there was no agreement, meaning that our debate today positively ratifies a political wish of the European Union.
This directive, without bringing a final result as a whole and a full political answer to the issue, is nonetheless a first important step forward.
In one way, it communitises this policy and creates prospects for further improvements.
The proposals by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, will, I hope, improve the regulation, making it more transparent and more democratic, with the safeguarding of parliamentary control and with cooperation which respects the legal order in the countries which will operate these networks.
The operation of these networks will allow for better management of the resources made available by the European Union for this issue, will improve relations between the European Union and the countries in which the networks operate and may facilitate the foreign policy of the European Union by unifying it on this issue and by making it transparent to the countries, thereby facilitating our relations with them.
In addition, given that various other illegal and criminal activities are carried out alongside illegal immigration which violate basic human rights and debase human dignity, such as trafficking in women and drugs, the modern slave trade etc., the proper application of the present regulation will offer positive services here too.
Honourable Members, we constantly witness thousands of drownings on our shores or in our border rivers, deaths in containers, on the shores of the Mediterranean or the Channel or in inaccessible mountains.
I hope that the proper application of this regulation, together with other supporting policies to develop and democratise the countries of origin of illegal immigrants, will significantly improve the deeper social and political problem which affects our societies and provides a breeding ground for a climate of racism and xenophobia which is an insult to the humanitarian and democratic values of European political and social civilisation.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and also thank her for the good relationship she has had with the rapporteur for this group, accepting many of the amendments and proposals we have presented in committee.
I agree that this proposal is important, and the creation of this network of liaison officers is important, particularly in view of the fact that we have decided we have discussed this here many times on the importance of communication and communication strategy in the countries in which immigration originates, providing information on the means of legal entry and on the dangers and deceptions surrounding illegal immigration.
I would like to point out that in this very Parliament we recently approved a resolution on the European Union's information and communication strategy, and that RecitalÂ N stated that immigration policy and respect for human rights were considered a priority within the Unionâs information policy, and furthermore called on the Commission to make its offices in the countries in which immigration originates partly an antenna for informing these countries of the means for legal access to Europe and of the dangers involved in illegal immigration.
I therefore believe that the amendments which have been introduced in this regard into the rapporteurâs report are particularly important, and oblige the Commission to participate, in some way, in the meetings of liaison officers, and provide it with the opportunity to inform citizens of these countries in which immigration originates of the means for legal entry and of the dangers of illegal immigration.
On the other hand, I believe that perhaps one of the amendments presented by the Committee on Foreign Affairs is rather over the top insofar as it could constitute a first step towards the creation of a European Union foreign service, but it is the case that these liaison officers, with the support of the offices of the Commission in relation to information and coordination, are without doubt a first step towards the creation of this Community immigration policy which we all want to see.
In this way, we want the countries in which immigration originates to see Europe as a single region and for the offices of the Commission to act as a coordinator to some extent of the immigration policy which we all want the European Union to have.
Finally, I believe it is important and I wish to address this to the Commissioner to accept that the countries which do not have representatives in the countries in which immigration originates may delegate that task to liaison officers from another country which does have representation in that country.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have on several occasions expressed our concern that the Unionâs external borders constitute one of the weakest links in the system for creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
We therefore support all initiatives that could contribute to strengthening control of the Unionâs external borders, which is crucial.
As Commissioner Vitorino pointed out, the Seville European Council called for a network of immigration liaison officers to be created and the Thessaloniki conclusions stated the need to speed up work on adopting a legal instrument by the end of 2003.
Hence the report that we are examining today and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate MrsÂ Roure on her work.
Informal cooperation between immigration liaison officers already exists and this initiative is intended to give this cooperation a framework that will formalise it and strengthen it.
This network of officers can and must contribute to preventing illegal immigration and to combating this phenomenon, to help in the return of illegal immigrants and to the management of legal immigration.
We want to develop a proactive policy for legal immigration, and at the same time effectively combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.
I must once again express my regret that, because trafficking in human beings falls under the third pillar, it cannot be included in the scope of this regulation amongst the responsibilities of liaison officers.
Once again, we are facing an absurd situation due to the division of issues between the three pillars, a distinction which, once again, is pointless and counterproductive.
I also wish to emphasise that preventing illegal immigration requires the existence of legal channels of immigration and properly-targeted information campaigns in order to act as a deterrent to potential candidates for immigration.
We can and must avoid further tragedies such as some that are still fresh in our minds.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0361/2003) by Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, on behalf of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union (2003/2179(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech by stressing the importance and significance of the recommendation we are debating today.
What we are dealing with today is the first initiative, in the form of a Green Paper, aimed at considering, together with other instruments, the future proposal for a framework decision which will regulate â as its title states â the minimum rules on the procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union.
Judicial cooperation between the States of the European Union, in both the civil and the criminal fields, is reaching levels which were unimaginable a few years ago.
These levels will reach their peak when, at the beginning of 2004, the European arrest warrant enters into force, if things go to plan and despite certain difficulties which appear to remain in certain Member States.
This is why, at the moment, when the construction of the European area of freedom, security and justice is making progress, and concern about terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration is increasing, we are seeing greater cooperation between police and judicial bodies of the Member States and it is becoming essential that we do not continue to ignore the necessary safeguards which suspects and defendants must enjoy during the criminal proceedings so that their right to a fair and impartial trial is guaranteed at all times.
The purpose of the recommendations we are debating today is, therefore, simply to achieve a degree of unification of procedural practices in the Member States, on the basis of the rights established in the European Convention on Human Rights, the case-law of the Strasbourg Court and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and within the framework of the judicial and criminal convergence which today is being achieved in the European Union, based on mutual recognition, described as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in the civil and criminal fields in the Union by the Tampere European Council.
It was at that same important European Council that the foundations were laid which have led us to be here today discussing the minimum procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings in the Union, since there was insistence there on the need to carry out work in relation to aspects of procedural law with regard to which it is considered necessary to have minimum common standards in order to facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition, respecting the fundamental legal principles of the Member States.
The Green Paper sets out the reasons why the proposals have been restricted to the five rights which appear in it: legal aid, translation and interpreting, information about rights, the protection of vulnerable suspects and defendants and consular assistance.
I wonder, Commissioner, Mr President, whether it would not have also been useful to have in some way considered the types of crime which affect all or the majority of States, which, to a certain extent, would have complemented the necessary unification of procedural practices.
The admissibility and weight of evidence, judgments in absentia and the regulation of bail are being left for a subsequent occasion and I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner how that work is going â and these are issues which certain groups have been determined to include in the recommendation, despite the fact that that is not its purpose.
I believe that the approach which has been taken in drawing up the Green Paper is sensible, because it is still an undeniable reality that criminal jurisdiction is the central core of the sovereignty of the States, and is therefore very inflexible when it comes to establishing substantial common procedures and systems.
And, although the idiosyncrasies of each European society and their own legal cultures must be seen as reasons for this resistance, it is also the case that the criminal process is a system which imposes limits on the State, which is a measure of the quality of that State in terms of the Rule of Law and respect for the citizen, something which this House, as the ultimate expression of its will, must always defend.
There is, therefore, no question that this is a timely proposal, something which cannot lead us to think that the instruments approved so far â such as the European arrest warrant â have meant any undermining of the fundamental rights and safeguards of our citizens, but which nevertheless does make it necessary for progress in this direction to be complemented by a degree of unification of procedural safeguards.
That aside, I must reject the two amendments presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, which are aimed at making the entry into force of the European arrest warrant conditional upon the entry into force of the framework decision on procedural safeguards.
I reject these amendments because the scheduled date for the entry into force of the European arrest warrant is January 2004 and because the arrest warrant in itself is based on reciprocal trust between the different judicial systems of the Member States, even though it is essential that the implementation of the minimum standards imposed by the framework decision is carried out urgently and as soon as possible.
I just wanted to stress the most controversial point and the point which has given rise to the greatest discrepancies between certain political groups.
Finally, I do not want to miss this opportunity to thank the political groups for the practically unanimous support this report has received in committee and which I hope will be reproduced tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, for his excellent report.
The Commission shares his view about the crucial importance of setting common minimum standards on procedural safeguards.
This is vital to ensure the mutual trust which forms the basis of the measures set out in the mutual recognition programme of which the European arrest warrant was the first to reach political agreement.
A common set of minimum standards on safeguards is necessary to ensure that the fundamental rights of European Union citizens are respected in an equivalent way in the 25 Member States.
A proposal for a framework decision is planned by the Commission as a follow-up measure to the Green Paper if the main ideas that we have put forward deserve the support of this Parliament.
A measure of this sort was envisaged at the Tampere European Council, hence the references to protecting the rights of individuals.
This measure does not, in fact, go further than the already existing provisions the European Convention on Human Rights and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
It will highlight what is seen at EU level as essential for a fair trial and it will make mutual recognition measures operate more smoothly, since Member States will be more willing to accept that other Member States have proper safeguards in place.
Regarding the recommendation made by the rapporteur to include provisions governing other fundamental rights such as the right to bail, or rules on the admissibility of evidence, the Commission explains in the Green Paper that these two very important areas will indeed be the subject of separate measures of their own in order to do them justice.
The work on the right to bail, which also covers detention conditions, forms the subject matter of a measure in the mutual recognition programme and will be more appropriately dealt with as a single issue.
I can even tell the honourable Members of the House that the Commission has presented a questionnaire to the Member States on this specific issue.
We have received the first answers and we will be presenting a first evaluation of these to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will meet tomorrow morning here in Brussels.
A communication on the subject is included in the Commission's work programme for 2003.
In the work programme for this year, there is also a Green Paper on the approximation, execution and recognition of criminal sanctions in the European Union.
This is designed to ensure equality of treatment for convicted persons throughout the European Union so that, for example, those sentenced in a Member State other than their own are not discriminated against by virtue of their foreign nationality.
Regarding fairness in handling evidence, this area is too vast to be covered in a Green Paper that already proposes several rights, as does the current one.
The Commission therefore decided to devote more time to this topic and conduct a specific study as soon as the first stage of the procedural safeguard work was complete.
The Commission has now started work on a study of safeguards on fairness in the gathering and handling of evidence.
This will cover, inter alia, the right to silence, the right to hear witnesses, the problem of anonymous witnesses, the right to disclosure of exculpatory evidence, how the presumption of innocence is to be understood, whether there are circumstances where the burden of proof may be reversed, and many other aspects of the law of evidence.
This is one of the most complex issues in penal law.
Regarding the principle, an initiative tabled by the former Greek presidency is currently being discussed in the appropriate Council bodies and, once again, the Justice and Home Affairs Council will discuss this Greek initiative tomorrow.
Finally, on the questions of the conditions of prisoners in the European Union, the Commission recently prepared and sent a questionnaire on this issue to the competent authorities of the Member States.
The replies to this questionnaire are now arriving and are a useful source of information which is being taken into account in the process of preparation of the two Green Papers mentioned on pre-trial detention and approximation, mutual recognition and enforcement of sanctions.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have taken the floor to stress the importance of this Green PaperÂ âÂ for I feel it is my duty to do soÂ âÂ and, therefore, to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the contribution he has made with this Green Paper to the building of an area of freedom and justice.
I would also like to thank Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar for incorporating the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which was the fruit of extensive, in-depth analysis, extensive debate and great understanding of the issue.
He reiterated just now that we need to call strongly for criminal procedure to provide substantial criminal , because that is the way to be able to provide safeguards, to achieve, indeed, what we see as a minimum level of reliability and minimum safeguards.
The intention of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in producing this opinion was to stress and emphasise the need to protect the freedom of defendants.
We are aware that the institutions describe themselves in these terms, that legal civilisation, the rule of law, prevails, and these safeguards are essential to and representative of a fair trial, which is the subject of so much discussion and, I believe, must be our ultimate goal as regards procedure.
The Green Paper represents a change of course, Commissioner Vitorino, a radical change of course from tendencies which are not quite democratic, giving precedence to powers of investigation and investigation alone, also in a supranational form.
The European Prosecutor for criminal protection against fraud is an example of this point, which I have already made on other occasions in this Chamber and in other debates.
All the provisions laid down have already been mentioned, but the right to immediate defence, the right to assistance, the language guarantee and other similar matters form the essential elements of this measure, and I would stress them once again.
What we must emphasise are not just cooperation and coordination between the Member States but definitive recognition of final criminal decisions, and the Committee on Legal Affairs is working to this end.
To sum up, Mr President, we must ensure that the level of protection of rights provided is higher rather than lower.
To this end, we must take into account the safeguards provided by some Member States and ensure that Europe as a whole focuses its approach on that dimension and those rights.
The Europe of rights and freedoms demands it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating the rapporteur, MrÂ HernÃ¡ndezÂ Mollar, on the merit, quality and enormous usefulness of his report.
In building an area of freedom, security and justice, citizensâ fundamental rights must always be fully respected and safeguarded and the principles governing a fair trial must be duly confirmed.
This initiative consequently represents a further important step towards creating a genuine European area of justice by defining a set of minimum standards in the field of procedural safeguards in the Member States.
This is an attempt to ensure homogenous protection throughout the Union of the individual rights of those accused, sentenced or convicted in criminal proceedings.
Adopting these common standards is crucial to increasing the confidence and the faith which members of the public and the judicial authorities in one Member State have in the legal systems of all the other Member States.
The Community judicial instrument on which these common standards will be based is intended to improve procedural safeguards throughout the territory of the Union without lowering the level of protection that is guaranteed in the various Member States.
MrÂ HernÃ¡ndez Mollar has already referred to some of the relevant areas but I would like to highlight legal aid, the right to an interpreter and/or translator, the protection of particularly vulnerable categories â such as minors, persons with disabilities, the illiterate consular assistance and the duty to inform everyone of their rights.
The problem with these standards is not, in many cases, that they do not exist but rather hinges on the shortcomings in the way they are applied.
The framework decisions must consequently include provisions that can be implemented effectively and sanctions, and must consider other fundamental rights of suspects and defendants in addition to those that have already been mentioned.
In this context, the PPE-DE will, of course, vote in favour of the HernÃ¡ndezÂ Mollar report.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that the motion for a resolution contained in Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollarâs report considerably enhances the Commissionâs Green Paper on procedural safeguards, thanks, not least, to the contribution of numerous amendments by all the political groups.
I would therefore like to thank Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar for his work.
As I have said, it considerably enhances the report, not just because the resolution contains a clear call for the adoption of a framework decision on common minimum standards, and not just because it also points out the elements still lackingÂ âÂ as the Commission, itself, recognisesÂ âÂ in the building of a complete system of common minimum guarantees securing the basic European rights ensuring a fair trial.
The list of these rights must be extended to the issues related to admissibility and weight of evidence, to the criteria for pre-emptive detention, to the actual conditions of detention, as well as to the right of appeal, which is important especially in terms of individual freedom.
The principal contribution made by the draft resolution is the detailed identification of the specific content of the rights already examined by the Green Paper: legal assistance and defence, which must be free of charge for those who need it and be provided by expert professionals; the guarantee of full, adequate interpreting for speakers of other languages; the right to consular assistance and to adequate protection for vulnerable persons, especiallyÂ âÂ but not solelyÂ âÂ minors.
Then, particularly innovative and of particular interest is the proposal for a written letter of rights stating the rights of suspects and defendants, to be handed to the defendant or suspect at the first contact with the authorities in proceedings concerning them and which must be detailed and available in several languages.
As we know, all the Member States are bound to abide by the European Convention on Human Rights and the Court of Justice, with its elaborate case law, monitors respect for the Convention, but that is not enough.
The irreconcilable differences between the systems, procedures and legal traditions themselves raises concerns that undermine the confidence that the European citizens must be able to place in the Member Statesâ legal systems if the necessary cooperation based on mutual recognition of the judicial measures of the different countries is to develop in a territory which no longer has internal borders.
To this end, there is an urgent need, in order to ensure both the freedom and the security of the citizens, for minimum common standards to be introduced to establish at European level the high standards of procedural safeguards which Europe prides itself on guaranteeing to allÂ âÂ both citizens and non-citizensÂ âÂ who come into contact with its legal systems.
I can therefore inform you that my group is going to vote for the HernÃ¡ndez Mollar report.
Â Â  â Mr President, my group is delighted with the report and we would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ Hernandez-Mollar, on his work.
I should also like to congratulate the Commission on its efforts in this area, and I hope that it will maintain a high level of ambition, both in terms of the ultimate framework decision on minimum standards for the rights of suspects, and in decisions that will subsequently need to be taken.
I sincerely hope that we can look forward to sound proposals in the near future, also in respect of research methods, admissibility and weight of evidence.
My group takes the view that European agreements on matters of this kind are vital, because the Member States decided in Tampere to recognise each other's judicial decisions and to implement them unconditionally.
The most poignant example of this is the European arrest warrant, to which a number of references have been made.
This means that Member States implement each other's requests for extradition almost automatically, without verifying whether the evidence has been obtained lawfully or checking whether the suspect can rely on a fair trial in accordance with the standards of the extraditing state, because this is all done on the basis of trust.
Mr Hernandez-Mollar, you stated that this trust is in place, but I think that this trust, which is desirable especially in a political context, is not sufficiently in place or sufficiently substantiated.
For example, looking at it from my own country's perspective, there has been a great deal of protest against a sentence passed on a Dutchman in Austria on the basis of only one witness statement and against the long-term detention of British and Dutch plane spotters in Greece.
There will be similar examples like these in various other countries too.
This shows how important it is that we first conclude agreements on minimum standards for the rights of the suspects before we start extraditing our own nationals in this way, without prescribing any further conditions.
I would therefore urge you to reconsider our amendment.
I know that many Member States would actually like to raise objections and that they are a little nervous about the European framework decision on procedural law.
I find this really regrettable and also incomprehensible.
I put it down to unnecessary interference from Brussels, but surely it is absurd that they themselves have already taken that step of a European arrest warrant, which is a very far-reaching measure on the road of European cooperation in the judicial sphere, and are now refusing to restore the balance between repression and civil rights, in respect of which civil rights agreements should be made at European level too.
It is therefore up to us MEPs to ensure that these civil rights are not brushed under the carpet, but that the balance is restored.
Â Â  Mr President, on the eve of the entry into force of the European arrest warrant, Parliament is expressing its opinion on a European Commission communication on procedural safeguards and the rights of the defence.
Despite your efforts, Commissioner, the planned framework decision on the matter has not yet been formally presented and, in its initial discussions, the Council has proved to be extremely divided over the need for and content of harmonised rights of defence.
This is the context in which we are operating, and, in this context, we want to point out the position adopted by the Italian Minister for Justice, who, after personally endorsing the European arrest warrant in the Council, stated that he finds it unconstitutional in form and an out-and-out mistake as regards content.
I believe that there would have been no legal or political grounds for these worrying statements if the Commission and the Council had listened to Parliamentâs requests regarding the harmonisation of procedural rights.
I am afraid, however, that it is too late and that the European arrest warrant will enter into force in a European climate marked by reluctance and delays in implementation on the part of the Member States.
Despite the excellent work of Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar and taking into consideration the powerful arguments put forward by the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, the Radical Members will only vote for the motion if the amendments calling for the entry into force of the arrest warrant to be made subject to the adoption of procedural safeguards are adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all there is a debate over whether the European Union should be discussing things in relation to common standards on procedural law.
In reality, however, we also have to realise that a lot of oppressive legislation has been brought in recently just one of the things mentioned tonight is the European arrest warrant and at the very least we need something to counterbalance that to ensure the rights of suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings.
This goes some way towards ensuring that in methods of investigation, for example, there is some sort of standard.
There also needs to be an assurance in many Member States in relation to the right to bail: I believe people should have this right.
As many speakers have mentioned, we know that in many situations there are problems regarding access to legal representatives before and during trials.
We need to ensure that this is not the case.
Something needs to be put in there to guarantee the rights of suspects, because at the end of the day they are suspects: they have not been convicted and therefore their rights should be protected.
When we take into consideration the fact that a lot of repressive legislation has been passed by the European Union in recent times without any public debate or any real participation by the citizens in the Member States, the very least we can do is ensure that the rights of people are protected.
The same goes for interpretation and translation for many defendants.
This is the situation in many countries as a result of the legislation has been brought in under the guise of combating terrorism.
Many of these people who are suspects do not have the right to proper interpretation or translation and, therefore, these people cannot be guaranteed the right to a fair trial, or the right to be assumed innocent until proven guilty beyond any doubt.
Unless we in the European Union actually ensure that these kinds of measures are protected, we cannot push for any other oppressive legislation.
As some people here have mentioned in relation to the European arrest warrant, there should be pre-conditions attached to that.
I do not actually favour the European arrest warrant but, at the very least, minimum guarantees have to be put in place before any more legislation is agreed by the European Union.
The Union has, over the last months and years, infringed on people's very basic rights, which are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.
The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are basic things that anybody in a democracy would feel entitled to.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall be very brief.
First of all, I should like to reiterate my congratulations to Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar for his report and say that everything concerning the work on evidence will be done during 2004.
This is clearly stated in our legislative programme, and that is what I said to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs during our structural dialogue on the priorities for next year.
In parallel terms, I can say that the Green Paper on bail is ready and will have to be discussed by the Commission.
I believe it will be adopted in the first few months of 2004.
To Mr Turco I should like to say that I do not even dare to imagine what would have been said if I had presented the Framework Decision before seeking the opinion of this Parliament on the Green Paper: first things first!
Provided you vote favourably as regards the Green Paper tomorrow I can guarantee you, Mr Turco, that the Framework Decision has arrived.
I can assure you that we have not been sleeping, but if you endorse our ideas the legislative instrument is ready to be presented to the Council.
Finally, this is not the best hour of the day to disagree with Mrs Buitenweg or Mrs McKenna about the European arrest warrant.
This has been a long-standing point of difference between us.
Nevertheless, I will clearly say that I would not call a European arrest warrant 'oppressive legislation'.
I do not intend to subscribe to such an approach because legislation that aims to reinforce law enforcement cannot be considered purely as oppressive legislation.
There might be misuse of legislation, and that is precisely why we are adopting these minimum rules on procedural safeguards.
That is also why we have an ambitious programme to bring together the legislation of Member States as far as procedural guarantees are concerned.
I hope that Parliament will endorse Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar's report tomorrow.
That will help the Commission to bypass some of the resistance expressed by some Member States as far as this initiative is concerned.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0360/2003) by Mr Blak, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharges to be given for the financial year 2001 to: 1. the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (C5-0102/2003 â 2003/2046(DEC)) 2. the European Environment Agency (C5-0098/2003 â 2003/2044(DEC)) 3. the Translation Centre for the bodies of the European Union (C5-0100/2003 â 2003/2045(DEC)) 4. the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (C5-0096/2003 â 2003/2043(DEC)) 5. the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (C5-0094/2003 â 2003/2042(DEC)).
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is the first time that we are to give discharge to these five agencies, and it is a new situation to which both parties must accustom themselves.
The agencies must firstly be responsible to Parliament, and that entails obligations.
I have had a constructive dialogue with several of the agencies.
I have had good, profitable meetings with the Working Environment Agency in Bilbao, the Monitoring Centre on Racism in Vienna, the Environment Agency in Copenhagen and, in particular, the Business Education Centre in Turin.
All these agencies deserve special praise for their very proactive approach.
I wish to recommend that we give discharge to all the agencies concerned.
We have no major, outstanding problems with the individual agencies.
We do, however, have an outstanding problem with the Environment Agency which has had several contracts with firms that have also had contracts with Eurostat firms that are at the moment being investigated by the Commissionâs internal auditing service for involvement in the Eurostat scandal.
The internal auditing serviceâs final report confirms that the Environment Agencyâs contracts with these firms are very worrying.
The service has promised to investigate the matter more closely, and that is something we are obviously pleased about.
It is generally true to say that all the agencies are in a transitional phase, and they must adjust to the new Financial Regulation.
The different agencies have chosen different models, but what is common to all the agencies is that they themselves are now responsible for financial control.
There will no longer be external, independent control of the agencies.
That is something we in Parliament have accepted as part of the new Financial Regulation.
I am, however, concerned that a gap in control will come about.
The Commissionâs internal auditing service has absolutely no resources for looking at the individual transactions.
MrÂ Muis made this very clear at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The internal auditing service has no resources at all for investigating the control procedures in the agencies.
The Court of Auditors carries out very few control checks.
We are therefore very dependent upon the agenciesâ internal control operating properly.
It will be up to the future discharge draftsmen to assess whether the system will work in practice.
I want, however, right now to sound a warning.
The agencies will have no controllers.
An internal auditor, functioning as a consultant, is excellent now at the beginning, when the agencies are to set up new systems, but it is much better in the long term to have a controller rather than a consultant.
Parliament must have more influence on the appointment of the agenciesâ directors, and I am therefore pleased that we are asking the Commission to produce a proposal, something that is to be done before December of this year.
That is something we approved unanimously in the committee.
The agencies have had many important tasks transferred to them, so we must also ensure that they are led by competent people.
I am therefore in favour of Parliamentâs being consulted on the appointment of the directors.
I am not perhaps as much in favour as some of my fellow MEPs of Parliamentâs approving all the directors in turn, for we should then be attaching too much importance to the agencies.
We do not, of course, even approve the Commissioners on a one-by-one basis, but if, for example, my esteemed fellow MEPâs, MrÂ BÃ¶schâs, proposal that we should be involved in appointing them directly were to go through, I should have absolutely nothing against that.
I would, however, recommend us to vote in favour of the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, proposing that Parliament be consulted but that it be the Commission that takes the decision.
I am well aware that my fellow MEPs may perhaps be rather opposed to this amendment, believing that the Commission would be given too much power if it had to decide by itself, but I do in actual fact believe that it is primarily the Commissionâs task to appoint its own people.
We must not get involved in too many internal micromanagement decisions.
We must instead devote our energies to monitoring the Commission, and that is something for which there is of course an absolute need in view of the way in which the Eurostat scandal has developed and the way in which all the Commissioners are disclaiming any form of political responsibility and are blaming the system.
Basically, we should ask ourselves whether, in the end, we are good enough to control these agencies and whether we, generally speaking, have need for them all.
This is an issue concerning which they have agreed to produce a cost-benefit analysis.
I should, then, like to conclude by saying that the Business Development Centre in Turin has suggested that it might itself easily undertake more tasks, instead of our setting about establishing more agencies.
Let us listen to what it says, and let us hope that the Commission will make a point of listening to ourselves.
Â Â  .
Mr President, the Commission is committed to satisfy, as far as possible, Parliament's requests regarding recurrent issues such as Commission proposals aiming at fostering better functioning of Community bodies.
Decentralised Community bodies have specific missions according to their respective founding regulations.
Any modification and/or addition of tasks would require an amendment to the legal acts setting up the agency, which requires legislative procedure to be followed, in some cases falling under co-decision.
The Commission considers the composition of the administrative boards of agencies to be a cross-cutting issue which should be addressed in the follow-up to its communication on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies.
In view of enlargement, the communication argues in favour of an administrative board of reduced size with a composition reflecting the balance between the executive functions at Community level and the expertise of Member States' executives.
The Commission is expecting a reaction to this proposal from Council and Parliament before deciding on its final line.
In this communication the Commission proposed that a director should be appointed, depending on the case, by the management board or by the Commission.
Parliament should be involved in this appointment procedure.
At the moment this document is under consideration by the European Parliament and by Council.
A possible action in this field ought to be undertaken in the light of the forthcoming discussions with those institutions.
As regards the internal auditor proposal, according to the Financial Regulation, the Commission's internal auditor shall exercise exactly the same powers in the agencies receiving Community financial support as he does within the Commission.
Only two agencies which do not receive subsidies from the Commission are not concerned, those at Angers and at Alicante.
As regards the proposal to use the European Foundation for Training's expertise in relation to programmes such as Tempus and Erasmus Mundus, according to the new general Financial Regulation, the Commission can in fact call for technical assistance to be delegated to existing agencies.
However, recourse to an agency does not relieve the Commission of its obligations under the Treaty, in particular, to implement the budget under its own responsibility.
It must therefore be able closely to circumscribe the action of the body responsible for technical assistance tasks and maintain real control over its operation and, in particular, its governing bodies.
The governing bodies of the decentralised agencies are composed of representatives of the Member States: the Commission is in a minority and there are questions as to whether this enables it to exercise the requisite level of accountability and control.
In accordance with the provisions of the framework regulation on executive agencies, the Commission is at present examining the creation of a dedicated agency to assist in the implementation of Community programmes in the field of education and culture, such as Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, Youth etc.
A cost-benefit analysis is being carried out with the help of external experts, also taking into account the functions and mandate of the European Training Foundation, the localisation of technical assistance functions for all these programmes will be decided by the Commission next year in the light of the results of the cost-benefit analysis and, in particular, the considerations of effectiveness, efficiency, control and accountability.
The Commission will endeavour to follow up on all these issues as well as resolutions from the European Parliament in due time.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I am pleased that todayâs agenda also includes the discharge of the Agency for Safety and Health at Work.
This meets our central demand from last year, namely that there should be an individual discharge procedure for all decentralised agencies, thereby at last having equal treatment for the agencies.
My committee is of course in favour of discharge for the agency in Bilbao, just as is the Committee on Budgetary Control.
We therefore also agree with the verdict of the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the Council.
Let me say a few words about this Agency, which was created in 1997.
Bilbao has now become the driving force in the field of safety and health at work.
I need only mention its outstanding work in implementing the special programme for SMEs in 2001 and 2002.
The splendid work it has done was also confirmed by an external evaluation.
It was therefore only logical that in our resolution on the Community strategy for health and safety at work for the period 2002-2006 in October last year we called on the Commission to prepare a multiannual programme for small and medium-sized enterprises in the future.
It is of course clear that there must in future too be the best possible coordination between the agencies in Bilbao and Dublin.
Even though there are no grounds for criticism from our point of view, we welcome the fact that the two agencies have concluded a specific cooperation agreement in order to improve complementarity and banish all danger of overlapping in their work.
But we shall remain very vigilant here, especially in the light of enlargement and a possible redefinition of agency policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I cannot tell you how excited I am to be here this evening to talk on behalf of the PPE-DE Group on this subject.
I can see that it is a subject that brings great excitement to the rest of the parliamentarians and indeed the massive audience that we have here tonight.
One actually wonders whether these late-night sessions put our European taxpayersâ money to good use.
I shall bend over backwards to do my bit and I will start by giving thanks to the rapporteur for all the work he has put into this.
I welcome the fact that the new Financial Regulation gives us the power to scrutinise these agenciesâ accounts and I also welcome the cooperative way in which they all worked with the European Parliament in this process.
Because of this autonomy from the normal management framework of the Commission, the choice of director, I believe, is a crucially important one.
The appointment must be by open process and must involve the European Parliament.
Indeed, Parliament should have the right to give its assent to such appointments and that is why the PPE-DE Group will vote to reject the Liberal amendment.
Although it contains some interesting ideas about the structure of hearings in the Parliament, it only proposes to give the European Parliament consultative status.
The PPE part of the PPE-DE Group is in favour of discharge for the agencies for numerous reasons, many of which I do not understand, considering in general terms that the state of the Commissionâs accounts is just a pile of pants I am using colloquialisms to give the interpreters a test at this time in the evening.
Although the bulk of the PPE Group is for discharge, there are, however, some concerns that we would like to lay on the table for the future.
We want to ensure that there will always be the highest management standards, in particular by these agencies cooperating fully with OLAF, by sharing best practice amongst themselves because many of the management challenges are very similar and by ensuring that their boards are an effective instrument to hold management to account and are not just a bureaucratic and cosmetic gesture.
Some boards are already too big, especially that of the Agency for Safety and Health at Work, and enlargement risks making this worse.
If boards become too big to assume their responsibilities in practice, agencies become vulnerable to become private fiefdoms an example of which we have seen in Eurostat.
We would like to see people cooperating closely to avoid duplication for example, the Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living Conditions.
I think the Commission should look at this.
The highest standards of financial management should be ensured in particular by strengthening internal audit capacities.
We would like to see the European Court of Auditors conducting more checks.
I thank the rapporteur for all his work.
The British Conservative delegation the hopefully ever-growing DE will not be voting to grant discharge, but the PPE will be doing so, and we thank you for all your work.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Blak on his report.
I agree with the essence of what Mr Heaton-Harris has said.
The new Financial Regulation makes it possible to include the Agency for Safety and Health at Work, the Environment Agency, the Translation Centre, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in the European Parliamentâs discharge procedure for the first time.
I expressly welcome the fact that all the agencies are now discharged by Parliament, as the most recent cases of internal irregularities in the Commission clearly show how important it is to have ongoing checks of the institutions.
This innovation is doubtless important, but can be only the first step.
A second innovation, an equally essential requirement, is that Parliament must be given a power of codecision in the appointment of directors.
It is a contradiction for Parliament to have a say in appointing the ombudsman and the Commission President, while having no such right in respect of the agencies.
We know there is a tendency for agencies to proliferate.
There are more and more of them.
These agencies are evidently to be given their own legal personality.
As a Parliament, therefore, as taxpayersâ representatives, we must insist on having a power of codecision in them, in the way they are appointed.
I have had a printout made of the various agencies we have at the moment.
There is a first generation, to which Thessaloniki and Dublin belong, then a second generation with Copenhagen, Turin and I do not know who else, agencies not receiving a subsidy from the new budget, which you have already mentioned, Alicante and Angers, Codecision EP and Council, Brussels, Brussels temporarily.
That is all those agencies like the European Food Safety Authority or the European Maritime Safety Agency, where they have said they will do something but they do not yet know where or when or how.
That is an offence against Europeâs taxpayers.
That is not addressed to you, but we do of course know that these agencies will have to start work somewhere sometime, and the Member States have proclaimed at the tops of their voices that they will, but they do not know when, they do not know where and they do not know how much it will cost.
We have to be concerned about that, and the Social Democrats in this House, like the Christian Democrats, as Mr Heaton-Harris has said, will be insisting that we have a power of codecision here and we shall be pressing very hard for it.
Reiterated congratulations, by the way, to Mr Blak on his report.
Â Â  Mr President, I too am concerned that there is so little interest in discussing this type of matter, but I wonder whether this is a consequence of the way in which our activities are timetabled or of our approach to these matters.
Ultimately, what is at stake is basically the use of taxpayersâ money.
I therefore believe that the European Parliamentâs discharge of the budget must always allow for meaningful political debate.
Fortunately, this has to some extent happened â quite recently â thereby contributing to the credibility of Community budgetary policy.
Our examination of the budget of the five agencies that are the subject of this report should be seen in the context of these objectives and is geared towards achieving these priorities.
All of the reportâs proposals to grant discharge are accompanied by Parliamentary motions for resolutions and it is precisely in these motions for resolution that Parliament must exercise its political power.
It can do so by drawing up recommendations or by expressing the hope that the activities of the agencies take a particular direction, both as regards the need to improve internal operations and supervision and the urgent need to increase their effectiveness in undertaking these activities.
The report makes various observations and suggestions â which I will not list, because I have so little time â praising the words and the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the European Agency responsible for health and safety in the workplace.
There is, however, one aspect of a general nature that I believe warrants particular mention.
This is the reportâs proposal to change the composition of the agenciesâ boards of administration, so as to ensure that they have more of a role.
There are many financial reasons for such action, and in some cases operational reasons, which would mean that these boards could not function if they were larger than a certain size.
Symptomatically, these concerns arise, as the Commissionerâs speech has just made clear, at a time when we are rapidly approaching a process of welcoming â at political level â new countries into the Community family.
Without denying the validity of these concerns, the European Parliament must cautiously reflect on the true nature of the positions it will be adopting, because options that take a purely economic view are quite unacceptable.
Safeguarding the principle of representativeness and total equality between Member States is, in the current context, absolutely crucial.
Â Â  MrÂ President, just a brief comment.
I was very pleased with a lot of what the Commissioner said, but I really have to say how deeply disappointed I am that, following the debate in the committee, the bombshell has been dropped that the Commission wishes to set up a new agency for education and culture.
This work could easily, of course, have been done by the other agencies.
This means that horse-trading of one kind or another is now to be engaged in.
We should like to have been informed of this in the committee, rather than get to hear about it in this House today, just before the whole matter is to be decided.
It is disappointing.
Really disappointing.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0265/2003) by Mrs Honeyball, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on taxation of passenger cars in the European Union (COM(2002) 431 C5-0573/2002 2002/2260(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to present my report on taxation of passenger cars and echo the concerns of MrÂ Heaton-Harris about the lateness of the hour and the inevitable lack of an audience here.
However, I thank those of you who have stayed.
I would like to start by making it absolutely clear that this report is not about tax harmonisation.
This report is about the internal market.
It is about ensuring that the internal market operates fairly in terms of passenger cars and that the current obstacles which are there, in part, in the range of taxation currently levied, are evened out so that the internal market in this particular area is enabled to function much better than it does at the moment.
The other issue in this report is environmental.
It is actually about CO2 emissions from passenger cars and the way in which taxation can be used to deal with this and to improve our environment.
I turn first to the internal market questions and particularly the issue of registration tax on cars which I recommend should be abolished.
This report suggests that it be phased out over a long period.
At the moment, the different levels of registration tax in differing Member States distort very markedly indeed the price of cars.
In Finland, for instance, registration tax for new vehicles is over EUR 700, in Portugal it is over EUR 2Â 000 and in the UK we do not have a registration tax at all.
What inevitably happens is that people who sell cars vary the prices to take account of registration tax in various Member States.
The way to deal with this and to make the internal market fairer and more of a level playing field is to do away with this tax altogether, but to do it gradually.
One thing that we need to avoid is for the Member States to be out of pocket as a result of this measure.
Therefore it needs careful phasing-in and it needs to ensure that it is actually tax and revenue neutral, and no country is worse off by implementing this.
This can be done, but obviously it will take time.
No-one is suggesting that this be introduced tomorrow, but I recommend that the process be set in train so that as far as sales on new cars are concerned, we will eventually get to the position where registration tax is phased out.
We need to look at the same issue in terms of second-hand cars and cars which go across borders.
The same principles apply, although again this will need to be looked at and phased in.
We are looking at doing the same kind of thing, so that the current restrictions and difficulties that people within the EU have in crossing borders with cars and needing to re-register etc., are eventually also phased out.
This, of course, will aid not only the internal market, but also free movement of people and labour within the EU.
On all levels it is something which we would welcome.
As far as the environmental aspect of this report is concerned, this is something which concerns me very much as a representative of London, one of the major cities in the EU, obviously contending with car pollution all the time and always looking for ways of dealing with it.
Members may or may not know that there is a tax in the UK on petrol to take account of CO2 emissions a green tax which works very well.
This can be done because it is very self-contained, it is tax on a particular product.
If we did this throughout the EU it would go a long way towards reducing CO2 emissions and would be a very positive benefit to our environment.
Those are my two recommendations in this report.
I believe we are doing a good thing here: it is not about tax harmonisation, it is about the internal market and our environment.
Â Â  . Mr President, the operation of 15 different systems for the taxation of passenger cars within the European Union has resulted in tax obstacles, distortions and inefficiencies which prevent both the European citizens and the car industry, and trade, from fully benefiting from the advantages of the single market.
As a result, Commission and Parliament are receiving numerous queries and petitions each year on this one particular issue.
On 9 September 2002 the Commission presented a long-awaited communication on taxation of passenger cars, which received a warm welcome at the time from all parties concerned.
The communication aimed, on the one hand, at providing options for action at Community level which would remove tax obstacles on the movement of new and used passenger cars, which would not incur any revenue loss for the national budgets and would not increase a total burden for the citizens.
On the other hand, it also provided some policy measures which would establish a more direct relationship between taxation levels and the polluting emissions of passenger cars, thus contributing to the Community's environmental objectives under the Kyoto Protocol.
The Commission considered it necessary to launch this debate with the Member States, the European Parliament and with important stakeholders before launching any proposal on passenger cars.
This pragmatic approach allowed for a more favourable position on behalf of the Member States on a potential fresh proposal compared to the position they took in 1998 on the previous proposal which still remains on the table in the Council.
The Commission hopes that the European Parliament will provide strong support to the policy measures included in the communication and thus reinforce the Commission's position during future discussions at the Council.
I am happy to see that strong support already appears in the opinions provided to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs by both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I regret to note, however, that this support is not as strong in the final version of Mrs Honeyball's report as adopted by the ECON Committee.
Finally, I should like to thank Parliament and the rapporteur, Mrs Honeyball, for their efforts to conciliate and strike a balance taking into account the complexity of vehicle taxation issues.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we know that CO2 emissions from road traffic will increase by 31% by 2010, rather than falling by 8% as we agreed in Kyoto.
That is why, six years ago, we agreed a CO2 strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from traffic.
The first pillar was a self-imposed commitment by the motor industry to reduce emissions to 140Â g by 2008.
That seems to be working.
The second pillar is consumer information, labelling for new cars, and that is not entirely working yet because it has not yet been implemented in all Member States and thirdly, tax incentives for low-consumption cars.
I have to say that this is not working because we have in fact a patchwork of different registration taxes or annual taxes in the European Union.
In that respect, the Committee on the Environment â and I think Parliament as a whole â would like to have a framework for tax incentives for low-consumption cars so that this third pillar of the CO2 strategy can also be implemented and we will really manage to reduce transport-related CO2; this will enable us to keep to our Kyoto target and get greenhouse gas emissions, and with them global warming, under control.
I believe we also need a change of heart for the sake of the consumer, however, because we really do have a patchwork of tax legislation.
Reforming the group exemption regulation has not helped.
The price advantage is not being passed on to consumers because the effect is being absorbed by this patchwork of taxes in the European Union.
That is another reason why, more than ever, we need a framework for sensible motor vehicle taxation in the European Union to enable consumers to benefit from this internal market advantage.
I therefore support Mrs Honeyballâs report.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to borrow from Hamlet, it is by no means just in the state of Denmark that there is something rotten with regard to car taxation.
Many Member States still illegally tax removal vans, which impedes the movement of the workforce in the EU.
Furthermore, however, when a car is sold for transfer to another Member State there are actually a good number of problems.
Ten years ago the Court of Justice of the European Communities stated in the famous Nunes Tadeu case that in no single case may the tax levied on a car be more than the proportion that car tax makes up of the market price of a similar used car.
In Finland especially, and you will be well aware of this, MrÂ Bolkenstein, this has fallen on deaf ears.
I myself brought an old CitroÃ«n van into Finland a few years ago and I paid EUR 17 000 â this was for bringing my own vehicle into one Member State from another.
Later the Court of Justice called on Finland to amend its Act relating to motor vehicles tax at the start of this year.
I just rang a certain Finnish person who brought a Mercedes, registered in 1995 and bought in Germany, into Finland.
He paid EUR 7 000 for it in Germany and in Finland just a month ago he paid EUR 12 000 in tax.
That means that in Finland you pay an additional EUR 12 000 on a car bought for EUR 7 000.
This, moreover, is an eight year old Mercedes!
This is how the internal market works in Europe.
MrÂ Bolkenstein, we still have a lot of work to do regarding this matter before the people of Europe see that the EU actually works for the good of them, the private citizens of Europe.
In general I support the Commissionâs basic position that registration and circulation tax should be reimbursed when a car is bought for transfer to another country.
Furthermore, removal vans should not now be taxed more than the equivalent of the administrative costs incurred, although the situation in Finland, for example, is totally different.
In the longer term we also have to say goodbye to registration tax.
Only in this way can we guarantee that the internal market will function properly and that people can buy a car in the country they wish and vote with their feet.
Only in this way can consumers force the government in each country to change its ossified systems.
Let circulation tax, however, be considered nationally, as it does not upset the functioning of the market.
I would furthermore like to say something about MrsÂ Honeyballâs report, which, in itself, is excellent.
I disagree on the question of safety.
We do, however, need safety-based tax concessions without delay.
The annual European death toll of 40 000 is the indisputable reason for that.
Finally I would like to say that motoring is taxed much too highly in Europe compared to other forms of transport.
The EU is certainly no tax haven but reasonable motoring costs should be permitted in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, reducing the administrative obstacles to the freedom of movement of vehicles and persons and defining a direct link between the current annual circulation tax applied to light passenger vehicles and a vehicleâs environmental impact are only two of the concerns expressed by Europeâs citizens and are concerns to which the Commission wishes to respond positively.
The passenger vehicle market in the European Union today is fragmented into fifteen completely different national segments, which creates distortions and penalties that affect not only the citizens but also the automobile industry itself.
The real reason for this situation, however, lies mainly in the unequal tax policies applied in each of the Unionâs Member States.
It will not be easy to harmonise these policies completely in the next few years not that this is the issue today partly because we know that some States that tax vehicles are concerned not so much about the harmful environmental effects of these vehicles as about the volume of tax revenues that they can channel towards their budgets.
Furthermore, it is worth emphasising that this report is important and useful and that its proposals and recommendations are balanced and broadly correct.
It could have gone further in its proposals for an annual reform of the circulation tax, linking these to a more rapid abolition of the registration tax.
The issue is not, however, to totally eliminate competition in the field of vehicle taxation between Member States: the issue at stake is the need to promote the rapid completion of the single market for cars with all the benefits that this entails for the citizens and businesses and for improving the functioning of the internal market.
The solutions proposed in this report focus largely on achieving this aim, although they give priority, by repeating them, to the concerns that this Parliament has expressed on several occasions; such as concern at the emission of particulates that are harmful to the environment.
Harmonising vehicle taxation is a complex issue that cannot be solved in isolation from other, extremely varied political considerations.
This Community initiative and the support it gives Parliament, following the approval of the new regulation on automobile distribution despite the fact that this regulation has proved to be ineffective in harmonising basic car prices represents a pivotal moment in the development of this process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I wish to thank MrsÂ Honeyball for her well thought-out report.
The fact that this is an explosive subject is something of which we have become aware in the course of the committeeâs reading.
For a number of my fellow MEPs, the word âtaxâ appears to be enough to give rise to great indignation.
We are concerned here with coordination, not harmonisation, so you do not need to be so frightened.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believes in the need to take great care with tax legislation at EU level.
That is quite clear.
We can, however, imagine a few exceptions, and one such is environmental tax, which is one of the things being indirectly proposed in this case.
It is also of course a question of simplifying matters for the individual citizen, of providing better basic conditions for peopleâs freedom of movement and of reducing costs, as in the case of Mr Vatanenâs example involving the hugely expensive car in Finland.
There should in all likelihood be almost complete agreement in this House about creating greater mobility for individuals and less bureaucratic rules in the internal market.
Allow me to say a word or two about the environmental aspect.
We know that road transport accounts for a very large proportion of carbon dioxide emissions.
We also know that road transport, and thus the quantity of emissions, is on the increase.
Matters cannot continue like this.
That is something we ourselves have acknowledged.
Through the Kyoto Protocol, the EU Member States have promised considerably to reduce, rather than increase, emissions.
It is therefore probably a good strategy to devise simple and clear tax systems capable of benefiting the environment.
Those of us who legislate have significant opportunities to influence the behaviour of both producers and consumers.
A premium must be placed upon environmental considerations.
It is a question of encouraging those motor manufacturers which produce cleaner engines and those consumers who exchange their dirty old cars for cleaner ones.
It is also a question of buying the cleanest form of fuel.
I also believe that use, rather than ownership, should be taxed in the first place.
The issue of tax on diesel fuel is also interesting.
Diesel engines have more efficient combustion and therefore release less carbon dioxide than petrol engines.
Diesel, as a fuel, should not therefore be treated unfairly from a taxation point of view, as has also been pointed out in this House.
These are important points of view.
The ELDR Group has tabled an amendment rejected by the committee.
It is about being able to put safety into the equation, as MrÂ Vatanen mentioned.
We know that 45Â 000 people are killed each year on EU roads, in addition to all those who are injured.
All this means enormous human suffering and considerable financial costs to society.
If we can produce safer cars through favourable taxation, that is something it should be possible to experiment with.
I therefore hope that you are able to support AmendmentÂ 2.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Commission on its initiative and MrsÂ Honeyball on her excellent report.
Today the taxation of passenger cars in the Union is undoubtedly, as we say in Catalan, a real , in other words, a ârag bagâ.
As the report rightly emphasises, the functioning of the internal market is affected by the diversity, the heterogeneity and sometimes the complexity of tax systems.
The Commission and the report are, therefore, quite right to address this issue, in order to ensure that competition takes place in the best conditions possible.
Indeed, it appears extremely appropriate to consider taxing the use of vehicles rather than their acquisition, and the Commission is, therefore, right to propose abolishing the vehicle registration tax and establishing or increasing taxes on circulation, fuel and the use of some road infrastructures.
We need to give priority to environmental criteria in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives, as the report rightly reminds us.
On the other hand, as regards diesel vehicles, I agree with MrsÂ Honeyball that they should benefit in terms of taxation.
Studies in this field appear to conclude that emissions from diesel engines are generally lower than emissions from other types of engine.
The logical consequence of the âpolluter paysâ principle would be to levy less tax on something that pollutes less.
We must never forget, however, that from the environmental point of view and also for geopolitical reasons, the final objective must be to replace current fuels with non-contaminating and non-conflicting sources of energy.
To this end, we should welcome all research efforts conducted into new energies, such as hydrogen.
Â Â  â Mr President, the prices faced by car drivers and the car industry due to levies imposed on car ownership and use are an inevitable fact of everyday life.
There are too many kinds of levies on car ownership but also on use.
In my view, it is better to apply a transparent system of levies with different, but clear goals, such as levies on car ownership to finance road maintenance and levies on car use to restore environmental damage.
The effects of any levies to curb car use and to promote new environmentally-friendly technology need to be assessed.
In saying this, I am not arguing in favour of a European tax system for cars, but for a system whereby the reasons for levying taxes and the goals of the Member States are consistent with an internal market, thereby not overlooking the interests of a healthy living environment.
I therefore support Mrs Honeyball's report.
Finally, I should like clarity from the Commission on the question as to how it now wants to make progress in the complex issue of mobility taxation.
Yesterday, Tuesday, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected the proposal on the harmonisation of diesel excise.
As you know, both proposals were discussed at a hearing and are complementary.
In view of the proposals for harmonisation of diesel excise and passenger car taxation, what options do you, Commissioner Bolkestein, see, by means of an exchange of interests between the Member States, of reaching a compromise with which the Council and Parliament could agree?
I particularly have the reaching of a common position on levy grounds and goals for the application of levies in mind.
Â Â  Mr President, I am going to have to interrupt this consensus debate, because I am afraid I cannot support Mrs Honeyballâs report.
Despite the protestations of the Commissioner, it is plain that this report is about harmonising taxes: it seek to produce a harmonised regime for vehicle taxation in the European Union.
I do not think we need that for cross-border trade; there is no necessity there.
I strongly believe that taxation is a matter that should remain within the remit of the Member States.
It is of fundamental importance to ordinary people across Europe that they are free to elect the people who set their taxes.
Real democratic accountability on taxation therefore requires that decisions about our taxes be taken by the governments that we elect, and not by the European Union.
I find it surprising that Mrs Honeyball is supporting so warmly a report that promotes tax harmonisation on the very day that Gordon Brown is all over the Daily Telegraph saying that he does not like tax harmonisation.
Our government and our Labour MEPs should try to ensure that they have some kind of consistency, because indeed Richard Corbett, as recently as this week, said 'Tax harmonisation?
What is all the fuss about?!'
I say this is a fundamental constitutional principle.
Time and again, the Commission comes to this House and claims that this is just a technical matter, that it is just about the internal market.
We are assured that we need not worry and that it does not really affect our democratic right to set our own taxes.
The cumulative effect of these proposals is to strip the Member States of very real and serious powers regarding setting taxes and to remove democratic accountability from the setting of taxes, which is dangerous for democracy and is certainly unacceptable to those who elected me to represent them in this House.
Â Â  Mr President, the previous speaker will probably be amazed to find that I agree with everything she said.
I was surprised to discover that Mrs Honeyball, an MEP for the UK Labour Party, is calling for a Commission directive on annual road taxes in the European Union, and on the structure of car purchase tax on the grounds of completing the single market, when the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer is quoted on the front page of today's newspapers as saying 'We must explicitly reject old flawed assumptions that a single market should lead inexorably to tax harmonisation, fiscal federalism and then a federal state'.
Has Mrs Honeyball consulted Mr Brown, I wonder?
Her stance hardly fits in with Mr Blairâs 'red lines' vis-Ã -vis the Constitution.
The tax matter should continue to be subject to a unanimous vote.
Mr Brown also points to the rigidities, inflexibilities and lack of competitiveness of the rest of Europe compared to the more flexible and open economy of Britain, precisely because we have control of our own taxes and currency.
Ironically, in her report Mrs Honeyball underlines the belief that the annual circulation tax paid by users of private cars should be the competence of national authorities with which I would wholeheartedly agree.
In short, this is a confused and confusing report and its aim, in my view, along with the Commission communication, is to use fiscal initiatives to impose harmonisation on the grounds of environmental objectives, despite this not being an area of competence for the EU.
For my part, taxation is sacrosanct to each Member State.
Â Â  â Mr President, it would seem the expressions of support by these political groups conflict a good deal with regard to this issue.
I actually support Mrs Honeyballâs commendable report on the taxation of passenger cars.
I think the Commission communication should be welcomed and I hope that the Commission will promptly reform European car taxation.
As my colleague, Mr Vatanen, has already described so expertly, the current situation where such a key consumer durable good as a car is one of the most difficult things to move around within the Union area is totally untenable.
There are considerable barriers to transfer of cars from one Member State to another, which are still being caused by differences in tax legislation as well as inflexible administrative practices.
In the matter of car taxation the citizens of the Union are being treated totally unequally, as it depends on the country in which they live.
The Commission proposal to phase out registration tax would be a solution to most of the tax-related problems, and it should be done as quickly as possible.
It should be noted, however, that the European Parliament on an earlier occasion supported proposals by the Commission to eliminate double taxation, but the Council has not as yet approved it.
The Council should seriously consider what in the final analysis serves the interest of the citizens of the Union where these issues are concerned.
Secondly, the main focus of taxing motoring should be made to move away from the notion of ownership.
In some Nordic countries, such as Finland, it is dreadfully expensive to buy a new, ordinary family car, just because of the registration tax.
As a result, you see on the roads in our country incredibly old cars which in other countries of the Union would be deemed fit for the scrap heap.
That is why the emphasis of car taxation should move more in the direction of taxation on use.
Taxation on use, however, must also be reasonable, and the overall burden of taxation of motoring must not be allowed to become too great.
This is especially important in sparsely populated areas like those in the north, in Finland and Sweden, where the car is often the only possible means of transport, public transport services being very limited.
For the same reason I do not support abolishing the favourable tax treatment for diesel fuel.
Removing the tax incentive on diesel would result in considerable costs for long-distance journeys for the peripheral areas of the Union, which already suffer in other ways.
What is more, the latest studies show that carbon dioxide emissions from diesel cars are considerably lower than from petrol cars.
This was something my colleague, MrÂ Schmidt, of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, also referred to.
Emissions from passenger cars are nevertheless a significant source of greenhouse emissions, which is why we must act in such a way that, where possible, consumers are steered in the direction of environmentally sustainable and favourable products.
Thus, for example, the taxation of fuels should take account of the environmentally friendly aspect by lowering taxes on liquid fuels in this category.
Car taxation could also take account of the environmentally friendly aspect either in the form of reductions in possible circulation taxes or tax benefits for optional environmentally friendly devices.
I furthermore take a positive view of MrsÂ Honeyballâs proposal regarding tax benefits for safety devices.
Support for, and encouraging the use of, safe, environmentally friendly and, from the consumerâs point of view, durable vehicles in the Union area in this way are welcome moves.
Â Â  Mr President, I come to this debate with divided loyalties.
On the one hand, there is no doubt that simplifying the existing vehicle tax system to remove obstacles and distortions to the free circulation of passenger cars within the internal market is long overdue.
In fact, the prospect of a free market in cars was one of the most talked-about issues dangled tantalisingly in front of our citizens as we embarked on the single market in Ireland, in any case.
My country is one of the ten member states with a vehicle registration tax.
It is a very high one: I think Finland may beat us but we are certainly up there with them.
This keeps the prices of passenger cars and all road vehicles amongst the most expensive in the EU, including imports of used cars.
We have no indigenous car manufacturing plants, not even assembly plants.
Our cars are all imported, contributing nothing to employment and adversely affecting our balance of payments.
Our road network, notwithstanding Structural Fund generosity over the years, is creaking at the seams and our main towns and cities are gridlocked as our car population has increased dramatically in the last decade or so, and the graph continues relentlessly upwards.
In fact, the price of bullocks and the number of new car sales, in no particular order, have long been yardsticks of economic performance in Ireland.
Add to this the fact that our Kyoto CO2 emissions are now at 1990 levels plus 22% already 10% over target for 2010, and the fact that there will be little or no decrease in car prices even if there is a removal or reduction in VRT because car manufacturers have had to reduce their prices to offset our high tax regime - and they will revert their prices if the tax burden is lightened - and you have altogether a very complicated field of play.
On the other hand, the Irish Exchequer obtains over EUR 800 million annually from VRT, this equates to a 2% increase in the standard rate of income tax and indicates the problems that would ensue if VRT were to be reduced or abolished.
If it were to be replaced by additional petrol taxes, an increase of 36 cents per litre would be necessary to make up the difference in tax take.
This would be inflationary, as would any commensurate increase in our already high annual circulation tax, resulting in car owners who had already paid VRT on existing vehicles being hit by a double whammy.
While I object to paying such high rates of VRT in a so-called single market, I recognise that VRT is a once-off tax capitalised in the value of cars.
There is no evidence that the problems with it, such as they are, would warrant a large intrusion into the domestic tax arrangements as contemplated by this Commission communication.
While I can distinguish between indirect taxes such as VRT and direct taxes such as income and corporation tax, Member States are entitled to order their affairs so that motorists contribute to the cost of providing public services, especially to the cost of road and rail construction and the maintenance of our roads.
Far better that than to increase income tax by 2%.
Commission involvement in Member States' tax arrangements must come with a serious health warning.
An ongoing flirtation in this sensitive area is a serious threat to the continued acceptance of the great European project by an increasingly Eurosceptic citizenship.
I should like to point out to the Commissioner that he meddles in the tax affairs of Member States at his peril.
In conclusion, the future for our single market must lie in a car taxation system which is visibly CO2 modulated, but without central prescription.
The rate of this tax should fully reflect each Member State's requirements environmental, economic and physical.
We will not truly have a single market in the area of passenger cars and road vehicles until we all start driving on the same side of the road so that we can all have either left-hand or right-hand drive cars.
But that is a detail for another day.
Â Â  . Mr President, political realism has led the Commission to initiate consultation with the Council, the European Parliament and important stakeholders on passenger car taxation before drafting any legislative proposal on this issue.
I understand that many Members of Parliament would have preferred a more ambitious report, especially as far as the measures to be taken against the fragmentation of the internal market are concerned.
The Commission will take the conclusion of this report seriously into account before taking any initiative in this area.
The fact that a number of different approaches have been voiced in this room tonight provides an indication of how difficult it will be to reach a unanimous decision in Council on such policy measures.
With reference to the conclusions of the report, the Commission would like to express its gratitude to the European Parliament for the strong support it has given to policy measures, such as those necessary to abolish registration taxes (paragraph 16), to bring forward changes in order to introduce an environmentally-oriented tax system (paragraphs 12 and 13), and to use tax differentials as a tool to promote passenger cars producing less than 120 grammes per kilometre of carbon dioxide emissions (paragraph 7).
Additionally, the Commission agrees in principle with a large number of paragraphs, such as 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 21.
Concerning paragraphs 2, 3 and 15, the Commission does not share the view that existing barriers to free circulation of passenger cars within the internal market are due only to administrative practices or procedures.
The Commission considers that a clear reference to tax barriers, and particularly to double taxation caused by registration taxes, should be stated in these paragraphs, as is the case under the relevant part of the explanatory statement.
With regard to paragraph 5, which refers to the Annual Circulation Tax, the Commission does not share the view that this tax does not affect the functioning of the internal market.
Diversified tax bases and important divergences in ACT levels can provide an incentive to citizens to register their car in a Member State other than the one where they normally reside, which means this tax does affect the internal market.
With regard to Amendment 2, the Commission does not support including safety of passenger cars among its objectives.
The danger would be that the possible effect of fiscal incentives would be watered down.
Moreover, the problem of road accidents could be better addressed by other instruments such as speed cameras, fines, education, separate bicycle lanes and so on.
I listened with great interest to the brief altercation between some British Members of Parliament, whilst thinking of Minister Dawn Primarolo, who spent four years ironing out harmful tax measures.
If one really were in favour of unlimited tax competition, why would one want to iron out so-called harmful tax measures?
Next time such Members of Parliament who have spoken on this matter meet Minister Primarolo, they might perhaps give her a piece of their mind and tell her that she has wasted four years of her time in trying to stamp out fiscal competition.
That said, I should like once again to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for their efforts and their supportive report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.(1)
Â Â  I am very pleased this afternoon to have the opportunity to welcome here to the European Parliament the President of the Republic of Lithuania, Mr Rolandas Paksas.
It is a happy coincidence that we should have the Head of State of an Accession Country to speak to us on an afternoon when we hear from the European Commission on the annual progress reports on the question of accession to the European Union.
In that regard the progress of Lithuania has been remarkable.
It was not in the first group of states to begin their journeys towards the European Union but, in the course of this afternoon, we will hear an account of how substantial and how successful that journey has been in a very brief period of time.
In Lithuania there was also very powerful positive support in the referendum indicated by both high turnout and a very high percentage of the voters who said 'yes' to a European Lithuania.
Against that background it gives me great pleasure now to invite President Paksas to address our Parliament.
Â Â  (1). Mr President, thank you for your warm reception and this invitation to speak at the cradle of the European Union's representative democracy.
I am the first leader of Lithuania to have an opportunity to address the European Parliament.
Among the Members of this House there are many devoted friends of Lithuania who supported my country's independence.
We recently marked the anniversary of European Parliament resolutions which prevented the world from forgetting the struggle for freedom of Lithuania and the Baltic States during the Cold War.
Your support inspired us when we were making the first steps towards membership of the European Union and I thank you for your support.
My personal thanks go to Mr Cox, the President of Parliament, who, among other things, also contributed to the success of the referendum for membership of the European Union.
I welcome the observers from the acceding countries here in the European Parliament.
Although you represent different nations and different political parties, you have managed to integrate smoothly into the family of parliamentarians.
I hope that our states, too, will equally successfully join the family of Member States.
In the church of Saint Pierre-Le-Jeune in Strasbourg there is a fresco depicting the march of nations towards Christianity.
It depicts a march towards the cross, and the cavalcade of nations is led by Germania, which is followed by Gallia, Italia and Anglia.
The last in this column of nations is Litavia that is, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
For us, this reflection of fifteenth century Europe is an important and symbolic sight.
Metaphorically speaking, this means that Lithuania integrated into the European Union hundreds of years ago.
This summer, during the celebrations for our state's 750th anniversary, we unveiled a monument to the first and only king of Lithuania, King Mindaugas.
I am proud of his ability to see the future and, therefore, I would call him Lithuania's first European.
The Grand Duke of Lithuania, Gediminas, followed in Mindaugas' footsteps and invited craftsmen and artisans to come to Lithuania from all over Europe.
Throughout the history of Lithuania we were fated to go through two occupations, the first lasted for more than the whole of the nineteenth century, while the second covered 50 years of the last century.
After World War II, freedom fighters in Lithuania resisted the occupying forces for 12 long years.
The struggle, which demanded a huge sacrifice, helped preserve, in the conscience of the people, their aspiration for freedom.
During the decisive moments in Lithuanian history, our nation has been helped by its ability to mobilise itself.
In January 1991 unarmed civilians succeeded in defending the newly-regained independence in the face of a brutal attack by the occupying forces.
In spring 2003 90% of those voting in the referendum came out in favour of Lithuania's membership of the European Union.
We are moving towards membership of the European Union with a clear vision of Lithuania as an active and responsible member of the European family.
Our goal is to create a democratic state, and this is enshrined in this strategy for the country's development, approved by Parliament.
External and internal security of the state and the wellbeing of the citizens are the cornerstones of our membership of the EU.
I have been taught a painful lesson over the past few days, but this will only give me additional energy to pursue progress and democracy in Lithuania.
By no means should successful integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures be slowed down.
Our plans to become party to the Schengen Agreement and European Monetary Union between 2005 and 2009 may seem ambitious, yet they are an important part of our agenda and they will be implemented.
This new stage in the history of Lithuania opens up vast possibilities to promote and implement our national interests.
I am sure that Lithuania is ready to be an effective and reliable partner of other Member States.
Our country has 2.5 million inhabitants, territory twice as big as Belgium, and we have the best roads in eastern Europe.
Our greatest asset, however, is the people of Lithuania who, regrettably, have been through too much suffering.
Although World War I was a great blow to Lithuania, in the inter-war period we managed, in two decades, to reach a level of economic development that was equal to that of Denmark.
Presently, however, we are a model for the whole of the region.
The volume of financial investment is currently growing rapidly.
The private sector and free enterprise account for over 80% of GDP which, last year, grew by 7%.
Our aim is to complete land reform next year.
We already have a number of large farms that are working productively.
We are a country of rapidly developing advanced technologies.
IT sector growth in 2002 was as much as 30%.
There is no truth, however, that one learns by comparing and I admit that Lithuania and other post-Communist states are moving towards membership in the European Union in the face of a big gap in economic development between 'old' and 'new' Europe.
This gap has never been as great in previous enlargements and this cannot be masked by declarations or resolutions.
This gap is also reflected in the transitional periods that are enshrined in the Accession Treaties.
We take this as a reality but we are not intending to give in to it.
Our primary goal is to bridge the gap in economic development between the old and new Member States.
The sooner the new Member States catch up with the older ones, the greater the competitiveness of Europe will be, and the stronger Europe will be.
To achieve this without the support of the present Member States would take too long and that is why it is a duty for us to use the support promised to us to the best advantage for our people.
On the other hand, we must actively take advantage of the benefits of the single market and the four freedoms.
We have no transitional periods as far as the freedoms are concerned, with the exception of free movement of labour and I would like to express my thanks to those countries who are going to open up their labour markets to Lithuanian citizens in a few months' time.
The development of the single market will not be affected if we fail to link up the telecommunications, energy and transport networks.
Investment in infrastructure is of special importance here.
We have made some progress in this area: we have implemented the Via Baltica project, and that and the power bridge between Poland and Lithuania have been included in the list of priority projects.
This would become an important element in the Baltic region's economic development strategy.
The decisions on how to develop the Baltic Sea region must be taken now, and I expect European Parliament support in this matter.
It would be a big mistake to see a difference drawn between the core of Europe and the periphery of Europe and I am talking not in terms of geography, but in terms of economic and social development.
I am sure that the new Member States will be able to contribute to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
The European Union is and will remain a very important factor in building Lithuania as a welfare state.
That is why it is important to provide measures in the European Union to bridge not only the economic gap but also the gap in social development.
Lithuania supports simple and transparent principles for the formation of the EU budget.
In the discussion on the new financial perspective, Lithuania will seek to ensure that its interests are taken into consideration.
We will be responsible for one-fifth of the new external borders of the European Union and we also have a neighbour in the form of the Kaliningrad Region.
The same is true about the specific features of Lithuania's agriculture.
I am sure that, if we use the possibilities of regional cooperation, the region of the Baltic Sea has a good chance of becoming a centre of a fast-growing economic entity.
The new neighbours initiative may also contribute considerably to the development of that region.
Lithuania will be responsible for one-fifth of the external border of the European Union.
As Head of State I will do my best to ensure that this border is secure and transparently controlled.
Our experience in dealing with our neighbours will be transferred to the older Member States.
History tells us that without good neighbours a Union cannot be strong.
The European Union must open up to the countries east of the new borders. It should do so to the extent that these new Members are ready to align their legislative frameworks with those of the European Union.
The greatest achievement of Lithuania in the past decade has been to achieve good neighbourly relations in the region.
Let me emphasise, separately, the importance of Russia as a strategic partner of the European Union.
The Kaliningrad Region has a special place in this partnership.
Although quite a lot has been said about the would-be strategy for the Kaliningrad Region, it has not yet been prepared.
I suggest that we focus on the social and economic development of the Kaliningrad Region, and we are ready to share our experience gained in dealing with Kaliningrad and also with the whole north-western region of Russia.
We must not forget the Ukraine either, nor the states in the South Caucuses.
They have to be offered a vision of relations with the European Union.
I have written to President Cox and other leaders of the European Union about this.
The draft Constitutional Treaty proposed by the European Convention provides a good democratic and institutional balance which is acceptable to Lithuania.
This document, however, still needs to be amended and made more precise.
We must find solutions to sensitive and open issues and also launch a discussion on issues that were not discussed by the Convention.
The main challenge faced by the IGC is agree on the institutional reform of the Union.
If we fail to do that, the European Union of 25 Member States will not be able to become a strong leader.
Europe is not just about votes in the Council of Ministers, or equal status Commissioners from every state.
It is also about a spirit of compromise.
It is necessary to find a balance.
Every state must have equal rights and possibilities in the Union.
The search for compromise, which is a characteristic feature of the European Union, will be particularly important in the enlarged Union.
It is important that we base our existence on common values, democracy, respect for human dignity and transparency.
We must respect each other's culture and identity.
All of this will serve to guarantee long-term success for the European Union.
A reference to Christian roots in the preamble to the Constitution would have a unifying and symbolic meaning, because modern Europe was formed on the basis of specific values.
Alongside institutional issues, the IGC faces an important discussion on common foreign security and defence issues.
We must avoid any duplication of the existing NATO structures.
The political developments in the world and the Iraqi crisis have demonstrated that, in the area of foreign policy, Europe must be able to coordinate its actions and speak with one voice.
It is of particular importance that we maintain the viability and indispensability of the transatlantic link.
The future security strategy of the European Union must enshrine these principles.
In February 2003, while being sworn in as President of Lithuania, I outlined the main strategic goals of the Lithuanian State.
I promised the Lithuanian people that our country not only seeks shelter in Europe but will participate in deciding the destiny of Europe.
I also said that, while in Europe, Lithuania will expand the area of stability and security.
I can subscribe to these words today.
To conclude, I should like to remind you of the words of Robert Schuman, the father of the European Union, in his book .
He wrote that 'Europe is searching for itself.
It knows that its future lies in its own hands.
Never again will it be that near to achieving its aim.
It should not allow the hour of its fate to slip away it is its only chance for delivery'.
These words not only summarise the underlying notions and philosophy behind the unification of Europe, but also help to perceive the spirit of Europe.
Â Â  I should like to thank President Paksas for his remarks today, which underpin our growing connection and bond with the future states of the European Union.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on employment prospects in the EU automobile sector.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the ever-increasing speed at which technology advances and the increasing pressure of competition on global markets are compelling car manufacturers to adapt their production methods and also their business structures to changed conditions.
It is important, in this context, that firms should learn how, at an early stage, to recognise what measures and investments are needed to secure the continuity of their economic activity, and to actually put that knowledge into practice.
Restructuring, though, is often synonymous with job cuts, and frequently associated with dire consequences for the social fabric, especially in regions that have little or no potential for job creation.
This is especially true of the motor vehicle industry, in which changes in production processes and the opening up of new markets have significant effects on employment.
The Commission is very well aware of how difficult this balance is and of how much citizens and workers need a minimum level of security in these difficult times.
We are persuaded that dialogue at every level, founded on comprehensive and transparent information, is of the essence if they are to adapt successfully to change.
The Commission has invariably acted in accordance with certain principles, which it has repeatedly emphasised.
The first is that decisions on restructuring are and shall remain the prerogative and task of management.
What this means is that enterprises, when planning courses of action with potentially significant social implications, are meant to actively seek out a solution that is as compatible as possible and does the least damage.
Secondly, when redundancies cannot be avoided, everything possible must be done to enhance the employability of those affected.
This will require foresight, and these procedures must be prepared in good time and managed in an appropriate way.
Thirdly, if an employer neglects to fully and effectively inform and consult employee representatives in good time before publicly announcing such steps, then that can in no way be justified.
Employee participation is, in every case, and especially when an enterprise is restructured, not merely a fundamental right, but also a necessary precondition if such measures are to be regarded as socially acceptable.
At European level, we have laid down minimum rules with which all Member States and all enterprises must comply in the event of large-scale job reductions or other measures potentially affecting workers.
The directives on collective redundancies, the transfer of undertakings, and European Works Councils constitute our legal framework for protecting workersâ rights and for guaranteeing fair standards for information and consultation at national and supranational level.
Most recently, we have also enacted the Information and Consultation Directive.
All these measures enable us to help Europeâs workers successfully rise to the challenges of change, by making it possible for their employability and adaptability to be developed at an early stage.
The development of effective procedures for information and consultation will also be among the main elements needing to be discussed by the social partners in Europe when the Commission begins revision of the European Works Councils Directive.
What is even more important is that the Commission very much hopes that Europeâs social partners will find a way to devise proven restructuring procedures throughout the EU, as they decided to do when they responded so positively in last yearâs consultation on this issue.
These tried and tested procedures will make for further advances in the information and consultation of workers, including, among other things, the anticipation of market trends or technological developments, as well as long-term investment in people and the encouragement of employability by the use of education and training, careers advice, alternatives to closure and redundancies, and, wherever this is possible, the redeployment within the enterprise of workers affected by restructuring measures.
It is to be hoped that these procedures will help the Ford workers, too, to deal with their present difficulties.
More knowledge about the future prospects of the motor vehicle industry ought to benefit all interested parties.
The Commission is currently examining developments in this sector in order to identify the elements required for restructuring and the long-term competitiveness of industry in the EU.
It is planning to make the results of its analysis available in about a yearâs time.
It is the most recent restructuring operations that are our immediate concern today, and I need to make it clear to you right at the outset that I share your deep regret and grave concern at the potential social consequences, for the persons concerned, of the decisions to close down plant and cut back jobs.
I hope that every effort will be made, by means of a dialogue between the parties concerned, to avoid, or at least to alleviate, them.
Â Â  â Commissioner, the tragedy caused by the drastic streamlining measures at Ford Genk has exposed a number of painful areas in the European car industry.
There is the slump in sales, 5% since 1999 to be precise, the environmental burden against which Europe may have taken various, but insufficient, measures, as well as the powerlessness of the Member States to have any impact whatsoever on international company strategies.
This is why I urgently call for a European initiative to support the further development of the industry within the context of a policy, instead of waiting passively for yet another reorganisation.
This European initiative should consist of a number of elements; first of all, the further development of a concept for a sustainable car.
Whoever is the first to introduce this onto the market and is most advanced in this respect will achieve the highest sales figures.
If China and India switch over to generalised car traffic, the environmental burden will become untenable.
Secondly, new technological developments need support and staff.
Europe must take on the competition with quality and added value as its main assets, rather than cost control.
For the latter is beyond our powers!
For this to happen, it will have to anticipate the ever-growing component of electronics in the added value of a car.
Thirdly, large-scale reorganisations have a social dimension.
By 2006, the next programme of structural funds must be approved.
I hope that the Commission, during the revision of the European structural funds, particularly in the light of Limburg, will inject more resources into providing support during far-reaching industrial transformations.
Following that, there is something to which you have already alluded, namely the issue of the Renault Directive.
It must be evaluated as an absolute measure.
People on the ground tell me that the procedure established would lead to the mechanical application of the directive.
Employers are so frightened of making a procedural mistake that consultation is actually prevented from the word go.
We should therefore evaluate this directive as an absolute priority.
These are only a few initiatives; there are still many more around which Europe could work.
Finally, it is not all doom and gloom in Belgium's car industry: Volvo, Opel and Volkswagen are continuing to invest and Ford has decided to further develop the new Mondeo in Genk.
In principle, we should not fear the relocation of the European, and hence the Belgian, car industry.
After all, the products involved are highly technological with an ever increasing knowledge component, the end production of which will take place ever more closely to the market.
Commissioner, I truly hope that it will be possible to develop a policy for industries for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has just described the ways in which industry, especially the motor industry, must constantly be modernising its plant.
We know that there is no getting away from this and that every investment in technology results in the loss of between 9% and 25% of jobs.
We must indeed find the means to counteract this loss of jobs, which occurs as a result of technology.
I was interested to hear the Commissionâs statements to the effect that we had minimum rules for workersâ rights.
Such a statement is, of course, no use whatever to the workers in Genk.
I hope, though, that the Commission will remember this statement when it amends the European Works Councils Directive, as it is shortly to do, and will at last take account of something that has, in some places, become common practice, that is, making the European Works Council responsible when European mainstream issues are under discussion in a firm, and will also extend the rights of information and consultation in such a way that rights of participation â and I am not talking about consultation, but about participation â are built in.
Thirdly, it is essential that the Commission should learn how, in the social dialogue, to make it clear to the social partners that they have to expect penalties for failing to abide by these agreed ground rules, or else such rules will become a joke.
Â Â  â In the automobile industry, a number of painful decisions have been taken recently, and one of those has resulted in very painful consequences for thousands of people in the region where I was elected.
They have resulted in nothing short of tragedies, both on a personal level and for the region.
This has forced us to examine not only the role of the automobile industry, but also the role of industry as a whole.
I agree with the Commissioner when he states that a company must be able to reach its decisions independently, but I think that companies should also deliver on their promises.
If they claim at some stage that investments will be made, then they cannot simply delay these investments, because that is very detrimental to both their workers and the authorities of the region where they are active.
Companies require from the government a stable business climate.
I think that we can also ask companies to aim for the highest possible level of stability and transparency: why do they take certain measures and why do they take them at a certain location and not at others?
The implications for a region can be very serious indeed and, as Mrs Smet mentioned a moment ago, I think that when we revisit the structural funds, we should, for example, also look at what we can do for the Limburg region.
This is, after all, a very badly hit region, which, in fact, also has a very painful history on that score.
We could list a whole host of things.
In any case, people say that in the next couple of years, there will be further cutbacks in employment in industry.
I think that if you, Commissioner, were to examine the state of the automobile industry, this might be a little late, and if you were to focus on the automobile industry alone, that this might be a little restricted, that you should take a much broader view.
It is often said that we are heading towards a service economy, but I take the view that a service economy without an industrial basis is a very precarious matter, because products and marketing go hand in hand, and the same applies to services.
Should we not, therefore, closely examine the developments within the industrial market and the link with the service industry as a matter of urgency?
In that way, the European Union does not lose its industry and can match it with a very strong and better manned service industry.
In the European Union, we have previous experience of a situation in which an industry saw its employment dwindle, namely in agriculture, an example with which you, Commissioner, are very familiar.
Despite all the measures that we took in that sector â democratic staffing, subsidies, and so on â we have not been able to prevent employment from going down.
Let us therefore take a more sensible and global approach this time round than we did then with regard to agriculture.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the collective redundancies at Genk announced by Ford are not the first of their kind and no doubt they will not be the last.
They simply reflect, I believe, the current business philosophy of global enterprises.
Collective redundancies are almost invariably a means of compensating for the reduction of profits as a result of diminished demand, a purely managerial and, I might add, unimaginative approach which the economic order must, as a matter of policy, counteract if increased demand is to be ensured.
Looking at current policy, one can see that the cutbacks that are made in all areas of society do not stoke up demand, but, on the contrary, stifle it still further.
One particular demonstration of the truth that management can secure employment strategies by means other than collective redundancies is to be found in the motor industry, in the works contracts at VW or, most recently, at Opel, which reduce working time to thirty hours and thus share out the work among more people.
If current reports in the media are to be believed, though, it is evident that other, politically motivated considerations are involved in what is going on in Genk.
According to these reports, at any rate, Ford is concentrating collective redundancies on locations â of which Genk is one and Cologne another â in those countries that did not acquiesce in US policy in the war on Iraq.
The reason why the debate in this House today is so important is that the planned redundancies are not in line with Parliamentâs resolution on the social consequences of industrial conversion â not in the way they have been thought out and not in the manner in which they are being put into effect.
Let the Commission re-examine how the rules have been complied with.
Redundancies on this scale are anything other than a milestone on the way to fulfilling the Lisbon Agenda and result in devastating upheavals in the regions concerned.
If we really want not only to become the strongest region in economic terms by 2012, but also, as was stated at Lisbon, to create full employment, then the Commission, too, has to go about things in an entirely different way.
Â Â  â It is true that the automobile industry is in crisis, but there will always be a need for individual transport.
The set-up may be different in future: there is a market for more environmentally-friendly cars and there will be a market for hydrogen-powered cars, so there is a new market that can certainly be opened up, and this industry certainly has a future.
In times of crisis, we need to handle these crisis situations intelligently, which we have not done in the past.
In Belgium, we had the tragic case of Renault, the closure of the factory in Vilvoorde, now Ford Genk, and there are also other cases.
However, there are also examples of a better approach: at Opel in Germany, for example, people have opted for a shorter working week of thirty hours.
This is a method that we Europeans should defend and spread as an example for other factories.
I think that this could also be a possible solution for a case like Genk.
Â Â  â A few years ago, the CEO at Renault, Mr Louis Schweizer, who had, incidentally, been the principal private secretary in the cabinet of France's Socialist Prime Minister in a previous life, decided, in the interest of his shareholders, to close down the Renault factory in Vilvoorde and make a few thousand Flemish workers redundant in the process.
Today, with the drastic streamlining measures at the Ford Genk factories, Flanders is yet again facing a tragedy in the car-manufacturing sector.
Although I hope that Mrs Smetâs optimism will prove to be justified, many people fear that the dismissal of 3Â 000 workers in Genk is simply heralding the factory's final closure and relocation.
You sometimes hear fatalists claim that, due to increasing globalisation, nobody can prevent these relocations, but we should still maintain that the Belgian Government has a massive responsibility in this area.
Commissioner, the truth is that the Belgian Government has known since January 2002 that the Genk car manufacturer was in serious trouble.
After all, different media, including the weekly magazine , have also reminded us that Flemish managers warned the Belgian Government that Belgium, and thus Flemish industry â which is already being weighed down by excessive labour costs â has been placed in a bad light in the United States.
Many people in Flanders suspect that the ill-considered action by, , the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, may have played a part in the decision of the Ford management to streamline the Genk assembly works.
If Europe wants to avoid tragedies of the kind that have unfolded in Vilvoorde and Ford Genk in future, far-reaching measures will need to be taken across all EU Member States in order to guarantee to industry, too, the , Community preference, which has, quite rightly, been applied in agriculture for decades.
If they are not, a region like Flanders should be able to outline socio-economic policy of its own.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly, may I say to many colleagues here who are directly affected in the Limburg region, that I represent a region in the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has probably been more affected by structural change in the automotive industry than any other region in Europe.
I want to say to colleagues from Limburg that we have had that experience and we now have a thriving automotive industry in the United Kingdom; we have more international car manufacturers assembling cars in the United Kingdom than any other country in the European Union.
If colleagues from Limburg would like to come and talk to me about our experience in the West Midlands, we can show you the programmes we have put in place, not just to retrain and redeploy people, but also to help those smaller companies in the supply chain affected by changes in production.
So please colleagues, do not be overly depressed about it, there are ways forward.
It is important that we are having our debate today in the context of the future of the automotive industry because the issues surrounding the decision that Ford was forced to make at Genk go to the heart of our thinking on how we need to secure a long-term sustainable future for automotive manufacture in Europe, the technology and the jobs that go with it, and I and many colleagues here have a huge interest in that.
We know that the car companies will continue to make and must make huge investments in the next generation of lighter and more fuel-efficient cars that we want, and our colleague from the Green Party made that point earlier; but those investments will come from profits â there is not going to be any state subsidy for those â and what we want are profitable car companies.
I want to give you an important figure which relates to the Genk issue. 70% of the world's car industry's profits are generated in the United States market because that is where they sell larger cars.
The reason for the lay-offs at Genk is because demand for one of Fordâs largest models has fallen off dramatically.
Ford has announced that it is going to make the next generation Ford Mondeo at Genk and our job is to ensure that we have a demand for that car.
My conclusion for you, Commissioner, is that we want joined-up policy.
If your colleagues in DG Environment continue to press the industry to make smaller, lighter cars without any commercial regard for what is going on, then we will be back here again.
If we have joined-up policy-making, however, we will have a long-term, sustainable future for automotive manufacture in Europe.
Â Â  â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of this debate, I should like to ask you two urgent questions in connection with the reorganisation at Ford and, more specifically, the collective dismissal of about 3Â 000 workers in Genk.
I do not think that I have to convince anyone of the fact that this is a real tragedy, not only for the people at Ford Genk, but also for the suppliers and for the region as a whole.
However, Commissioner, the way in which this reorganisation is being managed is shocking, and in my view, contravenes European rules.
The fact is that Ford has been in breach of contract on two occasions, the first time by failing to comply with the collective labour agreements that were concluded with the workers in 2002, and in which investments were planned.
The second case, Commissioner, is, however, for Europe to deal with, as it has to do with a failure to consult the European Works Council in this matter.
The reorganisation at Ford is clearly a European matter, because the cancellation of investments at Ford Genk has repercussions for two other establishments in Germany.
Moreover, jobs have also been scrapped in Cologne and the Jaguar factory in Barnsley is being closed down.
This clearly illustrates, therefore, that this reorganisation is a European matter that should be dealt with by the European works council.
However, as it happens, Commissioner, the works council was not consulted in this matter.
Ford is deliberately entering into negotiations on a company-by-company basis.
This, in my view, clearly contravenes legislation concerning the European works council for which we voted here in 1994.
After all, no attempt whatsoever is currently being made to find a solution for this reorganisation at European level.
As my fellow MEPs have already pointed out, this could have yielded alternative solutions, for example, by spreading the work among various people in, for example, the framework of a shorter working week.
My first question to the Commission is whether it intends, on the basis of European legislation on European works councils, to require that the Ford management start negotiations within a European framework at this stage.
A second question on this subject, Commissioner, concerns the following.
The regulation concerning Ford's European works council is apparently based on the notorious Article 13, the so-called voluntary agreements, to which the directive and annex with minimum provisions do not apply.
Would this not yet again constitute a reason for the Commission to impose these famous minimum rules on all agreements concerning European works councils?
Â Â  MrÂ President, all those who are not resigned to the absolute domination of unrestrained capitalism are disgusted by the successive crises in our industries and, in particular, by that in the automobile sector.
In my country, Catalonia, this sector saw 31 so-called social plans â , in Catalan â in 2001-2002, as a result of which 5Â 200 employees were made redundant.
The closures of companies manufacturing automobile components, such as Lear and Valeo which have shut up shop, are deeply shocking for my fellow countrymen.
One does not have to be an expert to understand that competition with Eastern European countries is now unviable.
Automobile companies, and others, are relocating because, over there, the costs of skilled labour are much lower than ours and, in this area, our companies cannot compete.
If, some day, these countries succeed in genuinely converging with our own, companies will relocate still further to the east, outside the EU, following the cold logic of the market economy.
We are told that, in order to avoid such evils, greater flexibility in the employment market is required.
Greater flexibility means fewer guarantees for workers and, hence, less social cohesion.
For all those who believe in the European social model, that is unacceptable.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the theory that made its choices about restructuring according to political criteria seems to me to be very tenuous.
Italy is a country that is home to a large automobile manufacturer, which is Italian and which has restructuring policies that it implements, of necessity, in Italy.
The issue is, as has been said, that the automobile market is a mature market; automobile production has shifted, little by little, to many countries, in particular countries in the Far East, and there are probably lots of Members who have bought Korean, Japanese or even Indian cars.
The issue is that firms need to be restructured because the market changes and greater competitiveness is needed in the sector.
I do not think that it will help us to discuss the choices made by individual firms; in my view, these choices should be left to the firms themselves, for the sake of competitiveness of the system and long-term employment: there is no point thinking that you can sustain employment today when there is a risk of losing it tomorrow.
What can be done is to guarantee a great deal more than the institutions do today; a lot more than the European CommissionÂ âÂ which currently assigns its budget to agriculture and declining sectors and not into innovative sectorsÂ âÂ has done to date; to insist on the quality of the workforce in general, on training and on technological innovation.
We need employment and we cannot expect it to come from declining sectors that need to be restructured.
We must create the conditions for the workforce to be in the sectors of the future and not those of the past.
Â Â  The Commission does not allocate funds; the Commission follows what the governments decide regarding agriculture and other sectors.
Â Â  â In this debate, a great number of references have been made to agreements between Renault and Ford, but I do not think that these agreements actually exist.
For what was the case at Renault?
It is true that the provisions with regard to the European and national works councils were completely ignored.
That was the big problem.
It was, above all, an issue between the workers and the company.
Here, we have, in fact, another problem.
There is, of course, also a problem between the Belgian Government and the company.
That is the crux of the problem and, in my view, there are two or three reasons for this.
The first reason is, I fear, the very complex system of Belgian social security.
It is simply the case in Belgium that, relatively speaking, the whole surreal business is funded by social security to a far greater extent than in other countries, but that, of course, leads to a bad competitive position compared to those other countries.
It is not, however, for Ford to solve this; it is a task for the Belgian Government.
The second reason, of course, why matters have been brought to a head, is that it has taken far too long to comply with Ford's requests to do something about the shift bonus.
Then it suddenly transpired that the German companies were more competitive, although wages there are higher than in Belgium.
Who then is to blame, is it the workers?
No, it is the Belgian Government.
The Belgian Government should take responsibility for this and should prevent this from happening again.
This, I believe, is the main conclusion that we can draw from this.
If there are problems with legislation, it is fortunate that there is a directive, so they should refer to it and start legal proceedings.
In the case of Renault, it has transpired that this can have a positive outcome.
That is the method, but we must in this matter look for a solution that is different from that in the case of Renault.
Â Â  Mr President, although I am of course unable to make any statement about the state of affairs at Ford in Genk in the brief speaking time available to me, but I would like to make it perfectly clear that there has been no breach of the European Works Councils Directive.
The European Works Council has been notified, and there has been a breach of Belgian law on collective labour agreements.
As regards the European Works Councils Directive, I can explain it to anyone, as I was its originator.
I was myself chairman of the works council of Ford Europe for six years.
I would recommend waiting to see what comes out of the discussions between the trade unions and the European Works Council, as I am sure that Ford Genk will get compensation for what it was promised in the collective labour agreement.
There is no wages bargaining in the European Works Council; that is a matter for the parties to the collective labour agreement and not for the European Works Councils.
Â Â  â Mr President, whether or not this or that piece of legislation has been breached, I think it is appropriate to express our solidarity with the people who are being hit by Fordâs decisions, first of all, of course, the workers of Ford Genk, but also the people who work in the supplying companies and in other companies that have been affected.
The Commission has told this House that it will carry out a study into the future of the sector.
Even though, of course, studies have already been carried out and their results have been made available, I am surprised that the Commission has announced that it still intends to go ahead with this.
In Belgium, however, there are economists who claim that employment in the western European car assembly sector is set to halve within the foreseeable future, because the potential market is unable to follow increased productivity.
Similar predictions are being made for other sectors in industry.
Assuming that the Commission has collated some research material of its own, I should like to ask it whether it shares these gloomy expectations.
I hope that they are a little less gloomy, but industry is in any case facing a few changes.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether it is not necessary after all for the government to provide some support while industry is going through this transition.
The social partners should definitely be involved as well.
In my view, however, the government has a role to play here, as do the European authorities, which certainly have a coordinating task.
I have another two specific questions.
Reference has been made to the Structural Funds, and to the fact that they will be subject to a review in 2006.
The current programming periods are still running.
I have asked the Commission what scope the Structural Funds could offer Limburg at this stage.
I was told that there is still a percentage of 4% in reserve that can be tapped into at any time.
My question is whether, further to the problems at Ford Genk, the Flemish Government has asked the Commission to tap into those 4% or whether it has been silent on that score.
Finally, I should like to say the following.
This issue has naturally been discussed in the Belgian Parliament, and the Finance Minister has stated there that he would contact the European authorities to see whether it would be possible to join forces again with 'conversion partnerships'.
These are partnerships that receive certain fiscal benefits during a certain period of time.
On that front too, I should like to find out from the Commission whether or not the Belgian Government has been in touch to date.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to make a personal statement, given your extremely polite reference.
I assure you that the comment on institutional responsibilities as regards the budget of the European institutions did not pass me by.
I was referring to the budgetÂ âÂ and also to the Commission, but not just to the CommissionÂ âÂ however, the objective is to reformulate the European budget.
Â Â  I was absolutely certain that you were perfectly aware of the functioning of the institutions.
I was giving the information to our visitors, to our guests, not to you, MrÂ dellaÂ Vedova.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I have closely followed this debate, in which a range of issues have been raised and ideas have been put forward.
I will pass them all on to the Commissioner responsible so that they may be carefully examined.
I mentioned most of the points that have been made in my opening remarks, and I do not therefore wish to repeat them.
There seems to be general consensus as to how to deal with the crises resulting from the need to adapt and from industrial change and restructuring.
Let me reiterate one thing, and do so clearly.
Effective, timely and comprehensive information for, and consultation with, workersâ representatives constitutes a key element in our response to situations such as these.
Another important element in this context will be following up the ongoing consultation with the social partners on the restructuring of enterprises.
I am sure that you all understand how necessary it is to identify good practice for this, at European level, and, where necessary, to develop it further.
Further to Mrs Van Lanckerâs and Mr Kuckelkornâs discussion, I would like to point out that the Commission has not, to date, received any complaint from the responsible workersâ representatives in relation to this matter.
Moreover, if the directive in question has indeed been breached, then that is a case for the Belgian courts; it is they who must then consider the issue.
As I have already announced, though, we will in any case be launching a revision of the directive.
Nor must we overlook the fact that, while changes in industry have economic effects and consequences for employment and social cohesion, they can also offer opportunities, especially when they are anticipated, prepared for and managed.
In relation to this, Mrs Weiler, you mentioned the need to make a financial request or to examine the possibility of applying structural funds for this purpose â my experts here tell me that no such application has as yet been made to the Commission.
Dialogue, transparency, genuine worker participation, foresight, risk avoidance and the encouragement of employability â such are the key elements in a European response to all these occurrences.
Let us all work at them and do our utmost to create the instruments â whether legal acts or in some other form â to further develop these concepts.
Â Â  â However much I admire the Commissioner for his agricultural policy, I do not think it right that there should be nobody from the Commission following these proceedings, given the huge importance of the debate on the automobile industry's future and the relevant social dimension.
Although I am grateful to you for being here and congratulate you on everything you do for agriculture, I have to say that, normally speaking, a Commissioner should be here for industrial policy and social policy who can reply to the questions.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0412/2003) by MrÂ Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Mid-term Social Policy Agenda Review.
Â Â  . Mrs Smet, thank you for the comment you made a moment ago; I agree with it, and that also applies to this subject.
Naturally, we cannot deal with the mid-term social policy agenda review established in Nice in her absence.
Incidentally, it is nice to see that Mr Fischler is present, and therefore the Commission too.
I would have liked to have had her answers, particularly because we had already discussed the mid-term social policy agenda review with her in our committee.
Nevertheless, there were still a number of questions left unanswered, and that is why we are putting these questions verbally today, without a resolution.
The Nice social agenda is very important for the perfectly simple reason that Europe and European citizens are expecting the social side of Europe to develop further after the introduction and coming into force of EMU, the euro, and the stability and growth pact.
This is indeed necessary; it not only costs money, it also delivers benefits; this has been clearly demonstrated by the Commission in its study.
This agenda naturally includes creating more and better jobs, anticipating working environments, fighting poverty and social exclusion, modernising social protection, promoting gender equality and ultimately social policy as part of enlargement.
At the end of my speech I would like to ask a few questions which we would like the Commission to answer.
In the meantime, I note that the European Parliament has already expressed its objections relating to this social agenda three times during the annual scoreboards.
Each time, we asked that attention be paid to the points brought forward by Parliament â some existing points relating to the social agenda, some new points connected with current events, such as the events currently taking place at Ford Genk.
In other words, therefore, we are asking for the new policy initiatives to be properly implemented, but also for an indication as to the means by which this will be done.
We are also of the opinion that there is often a great deal more to be done â including legislative activities â than is currently being done: deliberation, consultation, expert groups etc., all of which takes time.
When I came in here, I thought we were going to deal with the European works council, but this will still not have happened by the time I leave, and it may not even happen during the next legislature.
This is causing us problems all the time in practice; today's debate is proof of that!
In other words, we are not satisfied with the way in which a number of proposals on this agenda are being dealt with at the moment, and I would like to list a few examples.
The most important is naturally the question of the European works council.
We have already let it be known that we believe that consultations have been going on long enough, including in the area of social dialogue.
The partners have had more than enough time to exercise influence on this.
Now it is time for measures!
We had already expected these in 2002, but they have still not arrived!
This is in fact nothing new for the Commission, and it is nothing new for the Commissioner.
The same applies to the working time directive.
We asked that attention be paid to this area as well.
At the moment, a number of countries in Europe are avoiding the working time regulations, and that is exactly what we do not want, as it distorts competition.
We want to see measures introduced in this regard, and as soon as possible!
The Commission should take the initiative on this point, and it should do so quicker than is currently the case.
We could go on like this for a while, including with regard to aspects such as the new occupational diseases.
I could give you a whole list of rapporteurs we have had on this subject: Mrs Van Lancker, Mrs Smet, Mrs Hermange and finally Mrs Figueiredo.
New occupational diseases, the social sides of competition policy, intervention procedures in the area of the delocalisation of companies; we have been asking for these for some time now.
These points seem to be repeatedly left off the agenda, however.
As far as social and fiscal measures are concerned, we want to put the effects these have on cross-border working on the agenda as soon as possible.
We want the regulations to address the question of gender inequality.
We could go on like this; the legal basis for what we call the âcivil dialogueâ is also one of these points.
In other words, what I said was not yet exhaustive.
Taking all this into consideration, we would like to ask the following two questions:
How does the Commission intend to use its right of initiative (in other words its right to take active steps) to implement the social policy agenda, both with regard to the old points and with regard to the points we have put forward on behalf of the European Parliament?
In doing so, we must bear in mind that these should contribute to creating full employment, the fight against social dumping and discrimination and improving the quality of employment in Europe.
That is our first question.
