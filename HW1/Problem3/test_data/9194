They want protection, and they need protection.
It would be the EUâs first big test as to whether this military capacity is to be used for good or for something else.
Let us protect the Palestinians.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the report before us is undoubtedly a well-intentioned document.
It is very long, and not one understanding or balanced remark is missing from it.
It can justifiably be said to be a very long report, considering how little it has to say that is new.
The whole thing could be summarised in the words from recital A: âwhereas the time has come to end the violence and widespread terror that has existed in the region since well before the launch of the United Nations partition plan in 1947 and the founding of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948â.
â[T]he time has come to end the violenceâ.
How very true, its having so far been going on for some thousands of years.
It is nice that the European Parliament thinks it knows exactly what should be done, but it is not particularly nice that this cannot, and will not, be done.
This report might usefully be kept, for it could also be used next year and the year after that, for nothing will come of what it contains.
Another document has been published in the last few days, contrastingly more interesting than this report.
The document is entitled âArab Human Development Report 2003â and has been issued by the UNDP, that is to say the United Nations Development Programme.
This comprehensive report, written by Arab scholars, explains why the situation in the Middle East continues to go off the rails.
It is an account of the massive suppression of knowledge, political freedom and freedom of expression that characterises the Arab world. It is an account of the brainwashing of children and of the way in which women are deprived of control over their own affairs.
It is an account of 270 million people living in the darkness of the Middle Ages.
Let us debate peace and dignity in the Middle East in the light of the UNDP's report.
To do so requires far greater effort than the showy but ultimately vacuous offerings that the European Parliament has come up with in its own report.
It is a matter of urgency, moreover, for the time bomb is ticking in the Middle East.
Â Â  Mr President, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the rapporteur and I have crossed swords on a number of occasions.
This was, incidentally, done in a peaceful and â I sincerely hope â dignified manner.
These key words âpeace and dignityâ are what MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle is striving to achieve in the permanently haemorrhaging Middle East â an honourable endeavour in which I would like to be alongside him.
I can see two enormous barriers blocking the Roadmap to peace and dignity in the Middle East, and I believe that the rapporteur greatly underestimates them.
They are the Islamistsâ urge to destroy the Jewish state of Israel, and the interference in the region, which causes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to escalate.
Over the past year, Israel and its citizens have been increasingly faced with the deadly combination of these two factors.
To quote but one example: the Lebanese Islamist terrorist movement, Hizbollah, closely linked to Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran, has for years been actively building its own terrorist network on the West Bank.
I therefore again ask the Council and Commission, as a matter of urgency, what conclusions they draw from this with regard to entering into association and trade agreements with the countries I have named.
After all, both European institutions are in favour of fighting international terrorism.
Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle, allow me once more to cross swords with you.
At the end of paragraph 25, you express your hope that you will be able, as soon as possible, to welcome the new Palestinian Prime Minister to this Houseâs Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Why are you overlooking his Israeli counterpart?
An invitation to both appears to me to be a parliamentary approach that would have a more balanced, peaceful and dignified effect on the Middle East conflict.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we must take note of the fact that this is a very serious and unambiguous report, which is indicative of an extremely European and, I would say, age-old culture: Monaco culture, Vichy culture, Mussolini culture, the culture of the Jerusalem Mufti.
This is the respectable culture that is represented here.
There are some interesting points that I want to mention in the minute and a half that I have left, and I quote: â[âThe current disturbing situation in Iraq is a further factor of destabilisation in the Middle East, which makes even more urgent and necessary a concrete perspective of peaceâŠ AlasâŠâ] Alas, MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle, of course, you are an orphan of Saddam Hussein!
The Middle East was more stable then, but let us move on.
It is an interesting fact that, after three years of , 60% of Palestinians live on less than two dollars per day.
Two dollars per day, MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valle, is what your CAP, your Europe, gives to any four-legged creature born between Finland and southern Sicily.
Here, however, you are offering peace: not work, nor even dignity.
I agree with MrÂ Belder, who spoke before me.
The UNDP, which does have some knowledge of the matter, has raised a problem: the right to democracy.
The Israeli people choose; you do not like their choices, and I do not like them either, but do you want to take them away from them?
We want democracy for the Palestinians, but for which ones?
You want immediate elections, like those in Cambodia, which you, to your shame, applauded, and now there are murders, as we predicted.
I am sorry, MrÂ President, for having taken a second or two too long, but I know, and not from today, that I am working in a parliament that descends directly in line from Vichy, with a faint echo of the parliaments of the European Far East: you know which ones I am alluding to.
Â Â  Mr President, in the explanatory statement to his report, Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle says that in relation to the Israel/Palestine conflict too many debates have been held in this Parliament and too many reports adopted.
I wonder, therefore, what the point of the report is and whether it is really helpful, particularly as it does not take a truly detached position, as we have heard from the rapporteur already this evening.
In fairness, though, through amendment in committee it is now more balanced than it was.
Its theme is the call for urgent implementation of the Road Map, a point on which we can all agree.
But I have difficulty with the rapporteur's frequent insistence on a greater role for the European Union.
He proposes introduction of the euro, an international mandate in Palestine and deployment of an international force on the ground.
There seems to be some indecent haste in trying to invent roles for putative EU-badged military forces, which is all part of some other agenda and little to do with the Middle East peace process.
We should recall that United Nations monitoring and observer forces have been in the Middle East for 50 years and they have singularly failed to prevent either conflict or terrorism.
The experience is that an international force does not secure peace but provides cover for its violation.
Let us not forget that this area of the Middle East was under a mandate, a League of Nations mandate, for some 26 years, from 1922.
It was then the United Nations which divided the area into a Jewish state and an Arab state.
The fundamental problem is that, with the honourable exception of Egypt and Jordan, the Arab and other states of the greater Middle East have refused to recognise the existence of the state of Israel.
A key element of phase III of the Road Map is Arab state acceptance of full normal relations with Israel.
This is long overdue, and Iran needs to be there as well.
Arab states have also, along with the United Nations, helped institutionalise the Palestine refugee question, so that it has provided fuel for hatred, instability and terrorism for over 50 years.
Unrealistic expectations are still being kept alive.
The UN Relief and Works Agency began providing the basics of life for Palestinian refugees in 1950 and now has over 4 million on its books.
Why in the name of humanity have the Arab states allowed this situation to persist?
Â Â  Mr President, we have come a long way, if I might put it like that, and we have moved a long way from the rapporteurâs original draft, which adopted a global approach, and which due to its lack of balance, failed to make any significant contribution to the cause of peace.
In other words, the report that is now being proposed, which has been discussed, amended and is more moderate, puts my mind at ease and even satisfies me on many points.
I thank the rapporteur for having added some water to his wine, if I might use that expression.
Having said that, there are still at least three paragraphs that I cannot accept: paragraphÂ 18, which calls both the Palestinian attacks and Israeli military repression terrorist acts and lumps them together, and I also wish to speak out against my communist fellow Member who has just called the United States a terrorist nation. I am also unhappy with paragraphÂ 40 which, in a dishonest and shocking way, sets the Palestinian and Israeli education systems on a par with one another and lastly, paragraphÂ 65, which once again, as I often have to say, raises the threat in this Parliament of suspending the agreement, a measure that would be counter-productive for the little chance of peace that exists.
It is for the sake of balance that I will be voting against most of the amendments, not, for example, because I approve of the Israeli raid into Syria, but because I would have liked those who denounce it here and now to condemn the horrific attack in Haifa â which caused nineteen deaths â with the same virtuous indignation. Nothing has been said about this, however, or about the anti-Semitic words of the Malaysian Prime Minister, which are scandalous and unprecedented at this level.
We are very far from having the balance that preceding speakers have advocated, MrÂ Poos in particular.
I wish to say one final thing, Mr President, on the Swiss agreements which, of course, I welcome, as I welcome any initiative for peace.
I do, however, have a closing question: why did we not applaud Taba to the same extent, where the proposals on the table were more or less the same, but on that occasion made by the elected Israeli Government?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to thank MrÂ MenÃ©ndezÂ delÂ Valle very much as well as all of the members of the committee, who worked together to draft this document, which is, indeed, the product of a European culture, but of a European culture that is, perhaps, the and other things, certainly not the one referred to earlier.
I have the impression that the sleep of reason, as FranciscoÂ deÂ Goya said, produces monsters, and, sometimes, I also feel that these monsters, which are, in actual fact, the result of the dehumanisation of mankind, are among us.
I sense in this House the inability to understand the suffering of others, the inability to understand that time is running out and that, whilst we have been discussing what solutions to adopt for months, for years, people are, in fact, still dying in Palestine and Israel.
The inhumanity that I sense here is one that does not understand the daily suffering of living under military occupation, the injustice that children suffer.
Of course, there is talk of the pain and suffering of Israeli children that are killed by human bombs but, for Heavenâs sake, we must stop this and start seeing things as they are.
There are United Nations resolutions that are not enforced.
Let us begin to think about these things and experience them, see the people, go to the places and understand.
This is why I said that the sleep of reason produces monsters.
I fully agree with the report, which is very important and quite clearly stresses its refusal of violence, but stresses just as clearly the right to live in peace, to build.
Time is short and I believe that two initiatives are extremely important.
Today, we have had NaomiÂ Kazan and JamalÂ Zakut here; we are going to have YossiÂ Beilin and YasserÂ AbedÂ Rabbo here.
These are the courageous ones, the people that have the courage to say: let us build, let us work, let us plan; just as all those Israeli voices are courageousÂ âÂ and they are those that we should listen toÂ âÂ like the pilots that refuse to go and bomb.
This is something of great importance.
There is an extremely serious problem: the wall.
MrÂ Poettering said this at the last Parliamentary sitting too: the wall is a disgrace.
The wall is destructive, but, above all, it is an annexation of territory.
One cannot annex territory and colonise and then want peace.
There can only be peace where there is mutual respect.
We are giving a strong signal with this report and I believe that we must continue in this direction.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the situation in occupied Palestine is a disaster.
The number of people living in poverty has tripled.
The Palestinian people are starving, when they are not being killed by Israeli bullets.
The social and economic crisis is worsening in Israel too, and even the most vulnerable communities are not spared.
The situation in Iraq is a further factor for destabilisation in the region.
The European Council of 16 and 17Â October confirmed that the Mediterranean region was of crucial importance.
We should also support the democratic process, assist social and economic development and strengthen political dialogue to ensure that the region is finally able to enjoy peace.
As MrÂ MenÃ©ndezÂ delÂ Valle states in his report, there can be no military solution.
We must break free of this downward spiral of violence and get back on the track of negotiations and of ensuring that the law is observed.
We must force Israel to end this process of establishing settlements and this military occupation, which lie at the root of this appalling situation.
It is equally crucial to exert all possible pressure, including economic and trade pressure, not only to stop the construction of this apartheid-style wall, but also to destroy it.
This wall is a human and environmental disaster, and is also an affront to the values that we hold dear.
These actions run counter to the commitments given in the road map.
It is our duty to encourage all peace initiatives and in this area, we should attach particular importance to the peace plan known as the âSwiss agreementâ.
We believe that this is a moderate and balanced plan, even if many, who are being asked to make further compromises, find it hard to accept.
Although it provides no real answer to the refugee question, this agreement is needed, in order to restore confidence and to give new hope to the two peoples.
As we have often said, only the existence of two democratic, sovereign and viable States, as recognised in the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as the capital, will allow the justice and dignity crucial to peace to be established and provide for a future that offers real possibilities.
This agreement allows the legitimacy of international law to be re-established.
We must do everything we can to ensure that this is supported by the Quartet, particularly by the Europeans.
I would like to express my fear to you, my fear of seeing a new hope dashed, leaving the way open for an even more radical approach, which would only benefit those who prefer violence to the law and war to peace.
We have a major political responsibility: we must assume this responsibility in the eyes of history and in the eyes of the world and we must break this silence, which would make us just as guilty for this new crime against humanity.
Lastly, I wish to pay tribute to the courage of the progressive forces in Israel and of all those who refuse to carry out missions that they consider to be illegal and which cause civilian deaths.
We must offer them our utmost solidarity.
To conclude, we must emphasise civilian missions, in which international organisations play the role of moderator and protector: as a result of their action on the ground, they successfully conduct a citizensâ diplomacy, where our international diplomacy is unable to act.
We must ask the Commission and the Council to ask the UN Security Council to send a peacekeeping force to protect the Palestinian people, their heritage and their environment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate MrÂ MenÃ©ndezÂ delÂ Valle on his report and especially on the fact that he has submitted an amendment that takes account of the Geneva Agreement.
Whether this agreement becomes an historic turning point, as I sincerely hope it will, or else a fiasco will now depend entirely upon the reception given to it by the Israeli population and upon the international reactions, especially the EUâs.
We have here for the first time a unified plan dealing with all the problems of the conflict: the division of Jerusalem, the rights of the Palestinian refugees, the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall, the settlements and the way in which the borders are drawn.
This agreement may still manage to rescue the otherwise almost defunct Road Map.
As the Geneva Agreement looks, so too can peace come to look.
Most importantly of all, the composition of the Palestinian delegation, representing a broad cross-section of the Palestinian leadership, has now given Sharon the negotiating partners that he has until now maintained did not exist and that he succeeded in making the Israeli population believe did not exist.
The EU must now strongly support the Geneva Agreement.
It has shown that there is still life in the Israeli peace wing, which now genuinely has the chance of being strengthened.
Both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples want peace.
The Geneva Agreement seems to be the surest way of achieving it.
Â Â  Mr President, the Oslo process is dead, the âroad mapâ has led to a dead end and the downward spiral of violence is maintaining the status quo. This violence has risen to a new and particularly dangerous level for the region and is causing misery for the civilian populations.
We have come a long way from the stone-throwing of the first Intifada: what has succeeded this are the suicide attacks against Israelâs civilian population and this terror is met by the systematic use of intelligent weapons of targeted destruction, which also kill civilians â this time Palestinians.
Some sort of balance in terror is achieved, prospects for a political solution tend to disappear and the dead are counted, Given these circumstances, the Geneva Israeli-Palestinian initiative does well to return the issue of peace to the very heart of the debate.
In an attempt to escape the feeling of inevitability surrounding the spiral of violence, the leading players have chosen boldness, in stark contrast with the pre-election paralysis afflicting the US and with Europeâs structural lethargy.
Instead of proposing small steps, the âGeneva Agreementâ wholeheartedly embraces the fundamental issues, which have been studiously ignored both by the Oslo Agreement and the Road map, but follows the approach set out at Taba.
No area is considered taboo and even the most contentious points are examined: Jerusalem, the Holy places, in particular the Dome of the Rock, or Temple Mount, which would be placed under Palestinian sovereignty, the recognition of Israel, the renunciation of the right of return to Israel of the 1948 refugees and their descendants, a viable Palestinian State, the settlements and land sharing.
I would add in this regard that the parallel drawn just now by the rapporteur between the Berlin and the Israeli walls does not stand up to scrutiny: the Berlin wall divided a single State, the artificial division of which we never recognised, the Israeli wall, although we can dispute the line it follows, can be considered to be the outline of a border between two States, which we dearly wish to see established instead of the current situation of occupation.
The Israeli and Palestinian authors of the Geneva Agreement have decided that tensions run so high today that, in order to encourage the two main players to leave behind the mindset of reprisals in which they are currently locked, small steps in the field of security would be more difficult to define and would generate even more misunderstandings than presenting an overall peace plan.
The political basis underpinning this plan is undeniably flimsy: its authors are, it must be admitted, not highly representative of Israeli and Palestinian public opinion.
We must, therefore, focus on the method that has been selected: that of not swerving from the ultimate aims. It is the substance of the proposals that must take priority.
Our debate tonight, Mr President, can make a contribution to this.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, scarcely a day goes by without the Middle East being drawn further into the downward spiral of terrorism and violence.
It is therefore quite right to call for peace and dignity in the Middle East.
It must apply to everyone equally â Israelis and Palestinians alike.
The time has undoubtedly come to seek a way out of the hopelessness of the situation.
However, the signs are not very encouraging.
The Oslo process has run its course, and the Quartetâs Road Map is at risk of becoming bogged down in the no-manâs-land of hatred and mistrust as well.
What we are witnessing every day is an obviously divided Palestinian leadership which is either unable or unwilling to tackle terrorism effectively â a leadership which does not condemn the suicide bombings for the murderous attacks that they really are.
On the other side, we have military reactions and over-reactions which claim the lives of the innocent and the guilty alike, but which contribute nothing to resolving the problem.
The security fence is an expression of both power and powerlessness, and under no circumstances should it pre-empt the drawing of a final border.
Naturally, there are peace plans, such as the Geneva Accord and other initiatives, which we in Parliament welcome.
They have just one disadvantage: they appear, at least so far, to be a minority programme.
The political goal of two states â Israeli and Palestinian â co-existing peacefully must continue to be pursued by all political and diplomatic means.
There must be no retrograde step towards an international mandate for Palestine, and nor must there be any suspension of the Association Council, which is and must remain an important bridge for dialogue.
Although Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valleâs report has been substantially improved by the motions proposed by my group, I will recommend to my delegation that it abstain from voting.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ MenÃ©ndez del Valleâs report is a bad report for three reasons: its one-sidedness makes it intellectually indifferent.
It espouses Arafatâs argument unreservedly and completely overlooks what is todayâs most pressing question: how can a democracy combat kamikaze terrorism effectively? Then it is morally reprehensible because it puts terrorists and the victims of terrorism on the same level.
And you get the impression that some people think the idea that the Jews should respond instead of doing nothing and letting themselves be killed like in the good old days is rather shocking or scandalous. Lastly, it is politically sterile because it locks Europe into a position of powerlessness on the grounds that it cannot be recognised as impartial and therefore capable of acting as mediator.
That is why this reportâs fate can be predicted even before it has been adopted, which, unfortunately, it will be; it will join the countless other plans and texts that have been stillborn.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done, for it cannot have been an easy task.
There is, as I have always said, an element missing from the Roadmap.
The events of last weekend and this week have once again illustrated that the Roadmap cannot lead to peace without any foreign help.
The idea is being mooted that NATO should intervene in the area.
I am not a NATO fan, but anything is better than standing by idly.
Even medical personnel are now being numbered among the victims.
The mutual violence defies all imagination.
What is happening in Haifa is terrible to my mind.
We visited the area with the delegation and what is happening there is absolutely dreadful.
An intervention force is needed to organise the disarmament of all resistance groups, as was done in Bosnia.
However, Prime Minister Sharon will only accept this under American pressure, which is absent.
The only alternative is a change in policy or in the government of Israel, which the new Geneva peace plan can bring about.
Discussion of this in Israel is gathering pace.
The plan requires major sacrifices on both sides, as well as courage.
However, we need to skip certain steps of the Roadmap; otherwise, we will never reach our goal.
As Vice-Chairman of this Houseâs Israel delegation, I support this new peace plan, and so I would be glad to be present when it is signed.
Our group is asking for Parliamentâs support in Article 13(b), on which we will vote tomorrow.
This afternoon, Parliament welcomed as its guests two initiators, and the interest was overwhelming.
These people are bearers of hope in these anxious days.
Next month, a delegation of the Knesset will be paying us a visit, and it would be good if we were to organise a joint debate on this.
I should like to conclude with the words of Naomi Chazan, who stated this afternoon: to be pro-Israel, you need to be pro-Palestine and .
Only the creation of a viable Palestinian state can bring about peace.
Â Â  Mr President, I must acknowledge the difficulties involved in producing a document in a situation of stress and constant change in the Middle East and it is therefore extremely difficult to update the document in this turbulent and tragic situation, in the knowledge furthermore that MrÂ MenÃ©ndezÂ delÂ Valleâs skill is always to bring positions together in an open spirit or at least to ensure that the âgoodâ sector triumphs â so to speak â the good in things and in life.
Nevertheless, although this document promotes the application of the Roadmap, and its main aim is to promote the peace process, I do not believe it is an objective document.
In the assessment of the facts I note many biases in favour of the Palestinian Authority, a position which will contribute to confusing and weakening Europe's role in future negotiations, since if we want to contribute to peace, we must have credibility in both sectors and this must be recognised.
I believe that this bias is reflected, for example, in the successive condemnations of the Israeli Government and in the great silences on the behaviour of the Palestinian Authority, and I repeat, the great silences.
For example, in paragraphÂ 4 it says that the Palestinian Authority is congratulated on having publicly and unconditionally accepted the Roadmap, when we know â and we have evidence of this â that Arafat, having rejected peace in Taba, has refused to accept any measure which may undermine his power, both in relation to the organisation of a single security system and in relation to the transfer of powers to Abu Mazen firstly and now, to the Prime Minister designate, Abu Ala.
Furthermore, we know that some of the recent attacks, which have created many victims, are directly or indirectly related to the martyrs of Al Aqsa and to events at the Muqata, and I am not accusing anybody here.
And above all I am worried about certain paragraphs which are only going to serve to increase the tensions and reduce Europe's credibility, such as, for example, the ambiguity in relation to condemning Palestinian terrorism and the clear desire to separate it entirely from the Palestinian Authority or even worse alliances, more dangerous than those made between democratic parties in the open, documented by means of extreme tolerance towards terrorists, and the lack of a firm, clear and transparent security policy.
Furthermore, apart from certain condemnations of Israeli methods â which I approve in the document, such as the construction of the wall, which I cannot accept, or the aggressiveness of the armed responses in Palestinian territory, as well as the destruction of infrastructures and other forms of reducing the Palestinian standard of living â I believe that the text does not insist sufficiently on the Palestiniansâ commitment to accepting democracy and to build a government capable of taking on its responsibilities.
And the first part of the Roadmap includes the development of the foundations for a democratic system.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I welcome the rapporteurâs laudable efforts in such a difficult area.
It is true that we need peace right away â it is urgent â it is true that we need to show the prospect, as has been said, and that we need to re-humanise this debate and avoid turning the parties into monsters.
That was said with a great deal of humanity just now.
I would, however, like to make a few brief comments on this report, but first to add my voice to the protests that have been raised against the Malaysian Prime Ministerâs racist remarks.
I want our Assembly to note that and take strong initiatives in this regard.
I would also like to express my strongest indignation at what Mr Gahrton said just now in justification of terrorist violence and to say that while the occupation must be condemned â it is questionable and I have many criticisms of Israeli policy in that respect â it does not justify terrorism and never will.
Terrorism is a crime against humanity, it is absolutely evil, without equivalent, and must be condemned.
I really would like to know what the connection is between young people who blow themselves up in discos or people who are murdered in restaurants and the occupation.
I think the comparison is absolutely outrageous.
Personally, it makes me want to throw up.
Coming back to the three things I want to say about this report, first of all, as I said, terrorism really cannot be put on the same plane as the criticisms that might legitimately be made of Israeli policy.
They are two different things, different in the moral hierarchy and in the hierarchy of evil.
Then I would like to mention sanctions, in particular the breaking off of the association agreement.
Breaking off that agreement is a sanction against a people, and since our Assembly called for the embargo against Iraq to be lifted on the grounds that a people should not be punished for the acts of its leaders, I do not think we should punish the people of Israel, especially when we have just voted for an association agreement with Lebanon, which can tell us a lot about occupation, being a country that is occupied, annexed by Syria, whether we condemn it or not.
Finally, my third comment is about the international mandate, which takes us back 50 years.
I would like to point out, however, that what was passionately refused yesterday is being demanded passionately today: the 1967 borders, the division of Palestine into two or the Clinton criteria.
That is what is being called for today after overturning the table.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I think the Minutes show that I reject all violence.
As a Green and pacifist, I obviously reject all violence, but I also note that international law draws a distinction between violence on the part of occupying forces and the forms of resistance directed by oppressed peoples in colonies and occupied countries against the occupying powers.
I personally am, however, a pacifist and prefer to see non-violent methods used even against an occupying power.
This may be seen from the Minutes, and it is the view I take.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy:
- A5-0347/2003 by Mr Langen on entrepreneurship in Europe â Green Paper and
- A5-0328/2003 by Mrs Zrihen on industrial policy in an enlarged Europe.
Â Â  .â Mr President, my task today is to report on the deliberations on the Green Paper on entrepreneurship in Europe.
There are actually three documents: the Green Paper itself, the Commission communication entitled âThinking small in an enlarging Europeâ and the Commission report on the implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises.
This House has confined itself to discussing the Green Paper, and I would like to begin by paying tribute to the Commission for presenting â with these three documents â an overview, appraisal and evaluation of the current debate about entrepreneurship and the promotion of business start-ups in the European Union.
I would also, however, like to thank my fellow Members who ensured, during the deliberations, that the lead committee has presented to this House a comprehensive list of fifty points which gives the Commission a number of tasks to address, while also making it clear that we fully support the Commissionâs basic line on this issue.
The committee endorsed the draft report with the proposed amendments by a substantial majority of forty-one votes in favour and just four against, which shows that there is a broad consensus in Parliament on these issues.
Commissioner Liikanen, what we want to do, on the basis of your Green Paper, is to support and undertake everything that helps to increase the number of self-employed persons in the European Union, encourages small businesses, and thus establishes conditions conducive to growth and innovation, especially in the services sector.
This Green Paper rightly defines entrepreneurship and discusses why it is important for jobs and growth, for competitiveness, for the realisation of individual potential and for society as a whole.
On this basis, we agree that we must improve the framework conditions.
That includes measures in the field of research and development, and it also includes measures to alter the different attitudes towards starting a business and peopleâs willingness to assume risk.
It is striking, Commissioner, that your Green Paper â and, indeed, every other assessment â makes it clear that the willingness to assume entrepreneurial risk and start a business is high in some European Union countries, although not as high as in some non-European states â with the exception of Ireland â but that in the majority of European states, it is well below the global average.
It is also striking that your index naturally takes account of agriculture, while the international index used includes other criteria as well.
It is also apparent that the European Union States with the highest level of public expenditure as a proportion of GDP, the most serious problems with unemployment and the greatest difficulties complying with the Stability and Growth Pact are also trailing well behind on business start-ups.
So there must be a correlation between generous provision by the State, the social system, attitudes towards claiming state benefits, and the willingness to become self-employed.
This is the starting point for our proposals, which I do not want to discuss in detail.
You have all read them; there are fifty of them in total.
We have achieved a broad consensus between the groups in this House, and Commissioner, we do not want this European Parliament report and the Green Paper to suffer the same fate as the Green Paper on trade, which was debated and then quietly disappeared before the appropriate action could be taken.
I would like to thank all my fellow Members in particular as well as the Commission for the document, which was of extraordinarily high quality, which is not always the case.
Nonetheless, Commissioner, you should not be tempted to extend this praise to industrial policy just yet, for in my capacity as my groupâs rapporteur, I would like to conclude by commenting on the report by Mrs Zrihen.
It is a very good report on industrial policy, but we do not agree on all points.
There are widely divergent views, also within my group, on one key issue in particular, namely the future role of open coordination, and whether everything can be coordinated or whether in many areas it should be the Member States which take responsibility and fundamentally improve the framework conditions for business start-ups and industrial policy decisions.
On that note, I would like to thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will not repeat Mr Langenâs excellent introduction, which clearly sets the context of our report.
A few years ago in Lisbon, the European Union set itself the objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
I am convinced that this objective concerns industry most of all, manufacturing industry in particular, because the industrial base is the backbone, the economic engine for growth in the European Union.
That is why the Commissionâs communication, which gave rise to this report, is vitally important.
It is to be welcomed.
Over the past few years, however, we have had the impression that manufacturing industry had rather been forgotten, with all attention being given to the service sector or new information and communication technologies.
Industrial policy as such had not been mentioned for several years.
This communication at long last raises the question of what the European authorities can do to help our industry.
According to the Commission, industrial policy can have only one objective: competitiveness.
There is some logic in this.
Indeed, in an increasingly open world economy European industry can only have a future if it is able to integrate successfully into the global economy.
But we have to agree what competitiveness means.
Let us remain true to the spirit of Lisbon and Gothenburg.
The balanced three-pillar approach â economic, environmental and social â really must be our guide in our analysis of competitiveness.
European competitiveness must be competitiveness in research, skills, manpower training, productivity, respect for the environment and, last but not least, the quality of industrial relations.
Any quest for competitiveness by continuously cutting costs, especially labour costs and/or through environmental laxity, would be totally fanciful.
As for the means of achieving that objective, we know that industrial policy results from the interaction of policies in a number of fields: research, training, competition policy, the internal market, taxation, employment and social affairs, and many other fields besides.
While the European Union has a considerable involvement in many of these fields, it is essential that we find the best way of coordinating all those different instruments in order to arrive at a genuine industrial strategy for the European Union.
The Commission communication asks the right questions but fails to offer enough definite answers.
The communication opens a genuine debate, as we shall see this evening.
The Council has already made its views known.
Parliament will do so through this report.
We must, of course, as Mr Langen said, make this a useful exercise by following it through with specific measures.
That is why we are asking the Commission to embody the ideas expressed in this communication in an action plan, which will then be submitted to the Council and Parliament for adoption.
The main points of the action plan will be as follows.
Firstly, the aims of industrial policy must be incorporated into all the Communityâs common policies, especially the policy on competition and the control of state aids.
Secondly, the objectives must include the harmonisation of national taxation systems, which are adversely affecting the single market.
Thirdly, the plan must also include major administrative simplification for setting up new businesses.
Fourthly, research and how to make the most of it for industry and innovation must be a central issue.
The question of the three per cent for research and the question of the European patent are clearly far from insignificant.
Fifthly, the questions of finance for businesses, especially SMEs and risk capital, cannot be overlooked either.
Sixthly, implementation of this industrial policy must include the dimension of dialogue between management and labour: a good industrial policy can only come about in cooperation with employers and worker representatives and certainly not in opposition to them or without them.
Finally, other crucial factors we should mention are education, training and skills: human resources or human capital are in fact increasingly important for industrial competitiveness.
That is why I am proposing that the European Union launch an ambitious initiative, such as setting a target figure for expenditure on lifelong learning.
The role of large European industrial projects involving private operators and public funding, like Galileo, should also be underlined where key sectors like alternative or renewable energy, nanotechnologies, space and steel are concerned.
The technology platforms initiative seems to me to be a step in the right direction.
We are also all aware of the need for a good transport, energy and communications network if we are to make the most of the potential of the large single European market.
With the Union expanding to include regions that are not so well served, we need to give some thought to the necessity of increasing significantly the resources available to pay for the major works required.
I think last weekâs European Council also confirms this view.
A good European industrial policy must not only take the opportunities offered by the new sectors of the future, but must also be capable of anticipating change in the traditional sectors so as to best manage the restructuring at both social, territorial and economic levels.
The Commission has sketched out a sectoral analysis.
That is a significant and welcome change from the purely horizontal approach.
It would, however, be desirable not to stop at the sectoral analysis but to use it as a basis for sectoral action.
The subject of industrial policy is therefore at the heart of our debates.
You only have to read the conclusions of the last European Council.
I join my colleague in hoping that we will get past the stage of incantatory declarations and move on to determined and fruitful action.
Â Â  . First of all, I want to thank both rapporteurs, Mrs Zrihen and Mr Langen, for their excellent work.
Let me start with industrial policy before I move to entrepreneurship.
It is important to know that you share the view that the manufacturing industry needs to be put back at the top of the policy agenda.
Manufacturing drives the growth of the service sector.
Therefore it is also important as ever in the knowledge and service economy.
We need to work towards a balanced approach to sustainable development, where the three pillars â economic, social and environmental â are balanced and progress in parallel.
If we fail with the economy â if we do not have competitive companies â the whole of sustainable development is in danger.
If economic development is poor, we fail to meet social and environmental objectives.
Needless to say, such competitiveness relies, above all, on the specific assets of Europe, such as skilled human resources and technological advance, two points which your report rightly emphasises.
The draft report also calls for further action to implement the ideas contained in the communication.
Let me summarise briefly what the Commission has done so far, before turning to how we view the future.
First, on the screening process, it consists of looking at how various EU policies contribute to the objectives of industrial policy, and how this contribution could be improved or reinforced.
The screening process is well under way.
We have already identified a number of policy areas where synergies could be greatly improved.
I will give you three examples: regional policy, which can be mobilised more systematically both to promote a culture of innovation and to facilitate the management of industrial change; employment policy, where the social dialogue, at horizontal and sectoral level, has a useful role to play in helping to deal with industrial policy issues; and research and development policy, where the implementation of the so-called â3% action planâ has direct relevance from an industrial policy standpoint.
With regard to industrial policy at the sectoral level, the Commission is putting together a package of activities to address the sectoral dimension of industrial competitiveness.
The Commission will strengthen the analytical basis of our policy through constant monitoring of sectoral competitiveness, and in-depth analysis of selected sectors.
When necessary, specific initiatives aiming to improve the competitive situation of the sectors will be proposed.
We are already working on a number of specific, sectoral initiatives, for example in the area of pharmaceuticals, aerospace and biotechnology strategy, with others to follow.
The textile sector is one of the first sectors undergoing an in-depth competitive analysis of the type described in the communication.
Next week the Commission will adopt a communication on the future challenges of the textile and clothing sector.
I know that there are many Members of Parliament for whom this is an extremely important priority.
At the same time the maritime industries will also be the subject of such an initiative and next week the âLeadership 2015â programme will be presented.
The Commission will make a communication on that basis.
We have also launched a technology platform on the future of mobile technologies and systems in Europe.
That report will be ready in January.
This is just an example of how horizontal policies and vertical sectoral solutions complement each other.
Turning now to the future, the Commission will need to report on the steps it has taken to implement the ideas and principles contained in the communication.
We will do that early next year.
We need to address in more detail and in a more operational way, issues such as: mobilising the appropriate policy tools to deal with the industrial consequences of enlargement; the international dimension of industrial policy, for example in the context of the Commission initiative âWider Europe, Neighbourhoodâ.
We need to deepen the reflection on how to improve the linkage between EU industrial policy and the industrial policies of the Member States.
In that area the Member States retain the bulk of responsibilities.
The Commission is currently working on an integrated competitiveness strategy at the request of the Competitiveness Council.
I hope we will be able to present that in November.
This will combine various elements, such as R[amp]D policy, the internal market and competition policy, with industrial policy.
It is clear that there is a need to ensure close coordination between these various policy areas.
I hope that we will be able to continue to count on Parliamentâs support in our endeavours to ensure that industrial policy stays at the top of the EU policy agenda.
When we have economically challenging times, we are more serious.
We must make this a permanent approach towards industry.
Concerning entrepreneurship, I agree with Mr Langen, throughout all of his speech.
The encouragement of entrepreneurship and business creation is essential to building European competitiveness.
To understand better how we might exploit Europeâs entrepreneurial potential and to help establish a European agenda for entrepreneurship policy, we published the Green Paper âEntrepreneurship in Europeâ.
It called on national and regional policy-makers, business organisations, advisors, academics and think-tanks to provide their own opinions and suggestions in a subsequent consultation.
This raised a number of questions with regard to two issues for Europe which, to my mind, are critical.
First, why do so few people start a business, when a relatively large number of individuals express their appreciation and respect for entrepreneurship?
Why do so few make an effort themselves?
Secondly, why do so few European SMEs see growth as an opportunity instead of pure risk?
We need more people to start enterprises and we need more SMEs that want to grow.
The consultation stirred the interest of a large number of stakeholders across Europe and beyond.
Now we are working on an action plan on the basis of this consultation.
The action plan will be presented at the end of this year.
We expect to build the Action Plan around three priorities: first of all, reducing barriers for Europeâs existing entrepreneurs, an issue of particular concern to SMEs; secondly, unlocking the ambition of these enterprises for growth; and thirdly, encouraging more new entrepreneurial initiatives.
The Action Plan will suggest a limited number of key actions to be undertaken both by the Commission and the Member States.
The role of the Member States is fundamental.
For many policy areas where action is needed, competence lies at national or regional level.
Appropriate follow-up mechanisms and supporting measures will have to be in place in order to trigger or monitor progress.
For this purpose, one should build on existing or adapted reporting mechanisms, such as the Charter Implementation report, which we have discussed here today.
I look forward to the debate in the House today, even though it is late at night.
I call on the European Parliament to support this important initiative.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets I would like to say that the Lisbon objectives must remain the priority of the Unionâs economic and social policies, especially on the eve of enlargement, and that it is therefore essential that the Member States make available to the European Unionâs budget the resources necessary for achieving those objectives.
While we note that the execution of these budget lines is generally acceptable, quantitatively speaking âÂ the rates of execution are perfectÂ â the same cannot always be said of the quality of budget execution, especially as regards very small businesses and the craft trades.
It seems to us âÂ and you know we have already said so on a number of occasionsÂ â that the Commission is having difficulty in finding ways of channelling funds to this kind of business, be it funds from the European Investment Bank for normative and environmental investments and investments in new technologies, or the experimental funds, especially in the matter of employment law in the enterprise.
We therefore consider it very important that this gap should be filled, because very small businesses and the craft trades make up more than 90% of European enterprises and they are both the creators of jobs and the sources of innovation you want to see.
All such businesses are therefore actively involved in achieving the Lisbon objectives and in the spirit of those objectives.
These entrepreneurs, both men and women, deserve the Commissionâs special attention given their importance for the stability of the socio-economic fabric, the continuity of employment and the risks that they take.
These initiatives are not simply the work of individuals who are prepared to take risks, they are also the fruit of a general environment that provides equality of opportunity.
It is also up to us to encourage entrepreneurship by creating the conditions that are favourable to business creation.
I hope that in the years ahead we will be able to provide the means for achieving these objectives, which are essential for the fulfilment of our great dynamic vision for the Unionâs economic development.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, industrial policy is very much on the agenda today: we have had the Commission communication, Mr Prodiâs conference, the joint letter from Mr Chirac, Mr SchrÃ¶der and Mr Blair, and the deliberations of the last European Council.
I can only say, it was about time.
Our compatriots are worried.
They have the feeling that our industrial fabric is unravelling day after day.
They note bitterly that too many businesses are closing or moving elsewhere, often to the Far East, to neighbouring Member States or to the future Member States sometimes.
What is Europe doing, they ask us, what are you doing?
I believe this concern is justified and the question is a legitimate one: do we not speak of a social market economy, of social cohesion?
They therefore judge the situation in the light of our laudable objectives.
That is why Mrs Zrihen should be congratulated for writing her own-initiative report: it is a difficult subject.
The rapporteur has included most of the opinions of the committees consulted, in particular our own, that of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I cannot criticise her for doing that, but it has sometimes resulted in something like a PrÃ©vert-style inventory and the poor Commission is sometimes asked to work miracles.
Especially as there are many obstacles to an effective industrial policy and some of those obstacles are outside its competence.
The first obstacle seems to me to be that the Union puts too much faith in market mechanisms.
Moderate protectionism, a greater acceptance of public intervention and a distinction between competition and predation ought to be enough to correct the mysterious handâs perverse effects.
A second obstacle is fiscal and social differences.
Sadly, social and fiscal dumping hang over the Union.
But essentially that is a question where the Member States retain full sovereignty; competition will not be fair until there is harmonisation.
A third obstacle is the low level of expenditure on research and investment: we spend 1.07% of GDP while the Japanese, it appears, spend 3%.
Finally, I am not convinced that enlargement is the answer to all our ills.
Perhaps we talk about it too optimistically.
In the face of all these obstacles and difficulties, I can only wish the Commission and ourselves good luck and good courage.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank my colleague, Mrs Zrihen, for the excellent work she has done and, at the same time, to welcome the willingness of both the Council and the Commission to again consider industrial policy as one of the European Unionâs major concerns.
We should not forget that we are back here with the very foundations of European integration.
It was the integration of the key industrial sectors of the time, coal and steel, that sealed our destiny as a Community.
Since then, our industrial policy ambitions have, however, fallen short because only the commercial approach, that of competition and free trade, has prevailed, and I concede that this has brought benefits.
One of the results, in the context of the far-reaching and inevitable industrial changes we are experiencing, has, however, been a complete failure to anticipate their effects, especially in terms of employment, and the waves of collective redundancies we are seeing everywhere in the Europe of the Fifteen bear witness to that, as has just been underlined.
Tomorrow, it will affect the countries joining the European Union if we do not respond.
Our declared ambitions for growth, more and better jobs and social cohesion, to quote the Lisbon objectives, need us to define a new industrial policy for the Union.
That is crucial both for employment and for the Unionâs social and territorial cohesion.
Both sides of industry are willing to participate in defining those objectives as part of a genuine action plan, as the report recommends.
I would like to stress two points on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, first of all the question of industrial competitiveness.
This is central and cannot be reduced to cost cutting alone, as some seem to think.
It is a composite idea that must take full account of the principles on which the European social model is based, namely all the social factors mentioned by Mrs Zrihen just now, and I am not going to repeat them.
Those factors are quite different from objective costs.
They are productive factors in their own right and must be given the same attention as the development of research and the application of new technologies.
The second point is the need to promote an integrated industrial policy: major European projects, the promotion of technology platforms, etc. must go hand in hand with territorial approaches in terms of territorial balance and consistency with employment policies, whether it be in the framework of the open coordination method or of more binding procedures, as Mr Langen seems to want.
Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the lack of an industrial policy and therefore of the benefits that might be expected from it, is one of the reasons why many of our European fellow citizens are increasingly losing confidence in our institutions, including this one, since we are supposed to represent them in their most legitimate interests, the first of which is employment.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I studied business management for five years and during that time, I identified one precept as the guiding principle for my entire course of study, and it is this: at the end of the year, you must be in the black.
That means that the company must be in credit, but it also means being in the black yourself, in the interests of your family and your own self-esteem.
I worked as a blacksmith for fifteen years, and during that time, I learned that it is not just a matter of being in the black; the most important thing is by how much you are in credit.
In other words, how much equity can you build up in the company?
Is your family happy with the income you have achieved, and how much provision for the future can you make through your own efforts?
In reality, when considering entrepreneursâ income, we must distinguish three separate factors.
First of all, there is the fair wage for the work.
If someone is working 40, 50, 60 or 80 hours a week, a fair wage basis must be applied.
I think that in this respect, the entrepreneur should be treated the same way as an employee, in that the minimum wage should always be tax-free.
The entrepreneur has invested capital.
The Green Paper says nothing about the fact that equity should really be interest-bearing and how it should be taxed.
Ultimately, the entrepreneur bears the risk, the risk of the many liabilities he has to assume.
But nor does the Green Paper mention the liabilities which entrepreneurs have to assume today as a result of the ââ.
What is needed here, therefore, is a fair assessment of performance, and here we need the Competition Council, which will make it possible, quite simply, to shape these fair competition conditions in future.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on this excellent report.
As we have heard, the current challenge for the European Union is to identify key factors for building a climate in which entrepreneurial business activities can succeed.
People's attitudes towards involvement in entrepreneurship vary widely across the European Union, as we have heard from Commissioner Liikanen, although on average the European Union has no lack of business owners.
In Lisbon, the European Union made a commitment to become more competitive and dynamic, but this commitment is still an abstract concept, and implementation is well behind schedule.
While I fully support the Lisbon aims, we need a stronger commitment by the Member States.
The entrepreneurship paper clearly has a central role to play in this.
However, we need to be aware that Europe still underperforms compared to the US and Australia in terms of number of new businesses.
Clearly, if the European Union is to achieve the Lisbon goals for employment and prosperity, the situation for entrepreneurs will need to be improved.
One way of doing this is to tackle the main barriers.
Many enterprises are facing obstacles such as cultural and social barriers, barriers posed by regulation â both from the European Union and national legislation, access to finance and education and training, and, of course, some of the negative media impact.
My concern is that these barriers are currently damaging the potential contribution, both economic and social, of small firms within the European Union.
But why is it that entrepreneurship is important?
In my region, in the West Midlands, I have seen how SMEs offer us an opportunity to engage in issues of productivity and competition and, at the same time, they give us the tools to empower disadvantaged groups, reduce social exclusion and contribute to regeneration.
But we cannot see this just as an end in itself.
It has to be a means to an end, and it is important that entrepreneurship focuses.
It enables emerging firms to be more efficient and more dynamic and continue to thrive.
How are we to achieve this?
Some steps have already been taken to remove some of the barriers faced by entrepreneurs.
However, we need to give stronger direction to the Commission and Member States on many of the issues.
My concern is that although the stigma of failure for entrepreneurs is widely recognised as a problem within Europe, this is not being effectively tackled.
Entrepreneurship is first and foremost a mindset, and it is very difficult to legislate for a mindset.
You cannot force peopled to become entrepreneurs, but we can legislate and create the right framework.
We heard from Mr Langen about the EU citizen being more risk-averse than his American counterpart.
We need to look at other communities within the EU to make sure that we learn the lessons.
A couple of months ago, I chaired a conference for the Commission for involvement of ethnic minority entrepreneurs.
That is a very good way for us to learn why certain communities are more entrepreneurial than the Europeans.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Liikanen and the rapporteurs for their contributions.
It takes some courage to say there is a very serious risk of de-industrialisation.
The desire to build a powerful industry was at the heart of the ECSC and then of the European Economic Community.
But we have not had an industrial policy for more than ten years now.
How can we fail to question a profoundly biased position, which sets the creation of the single market against the role of the State, horizontal action against sectoral action?
Each of our Member States is managing its restructuring as it is able.
There is no desire to promote the European productive system as a whole.
The definition of an industrial policy is therefore becoming a matter of public interest.
We must make it a social choice.
It will be impossible for European growth to recover without boosting industry.
It would, moreover, be foolish to count on services alone, because it is innovation and productivity, in industry and around it, that create the added value necessary for services to grow.
If national policies continue to diverge, Europe will be incapable of being a base camp for our enterprises in globalisation and the challenge of competitiveness will be lost.
So I am for entrepreneurship, without a doubt, but I think enterprise can only develop if we create the collective conditions for growth in Europe.
That is the advantage of the action plan that has been suggested to us, that is why we need sectoral European projects, a revision of the guidelines for competition policy and Community aids, a commercial policy that is more favourable to our development, and the ability to create partnerships around territorial communities.
So far as small businesses in particular are concerned, creating them is not enough.
Europeâs problem is that they are not growing.
Finally, it is good to measure the effects before legislating, but we must not over-regulate either.
The important thing now is to try to build European leaders that will be the foundations for sustainable development.
I will end with a word about method.
This recovery will not be possible without involvement and I therefore call for a strategic dialogue between both sides of industry, public authorities and the Community institutions.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need an industrial policy in Europe, but an industrial policy that looks to the future, a green industrial policy.
The Greens are grateful to Mrs Zrihen for reminding us that Europe used to be based on three pillars: environmental, social and economic.
We find that quite a number of our conservative friends, some liberals and unfortunately also some socialists are forgetting, or are trying to forget, Gothenburg and the need to include the environment.
We cannot go back to the scientism of the 1960s and industrial policies that included no risk assessment or ecology, which are the very foundation of the twenty-first century.
That is why, as Greens, we want a better targeted research policy and are very much looking forward, impatiently, to the DG Environmentâs document on environmental technologies, which has been promised for December, because environmental technologies are one of the responses to future world markets.
Another thing we need is social cohesion.
One point on which there really is a dividing line in our Assembly is that some believe that creativeness can be created by confusing a large proportion of European citizens.
As Greens, we believe that Europeâs strength lies in its fabric and its social cohesion: we have to preserve that.
Another thing we must maintain and develop is the non-market sector.
It is absolutely clear that the market sector rests on the non-market and that Europe lacks a non-market policy in areas like education, infrastructure and creativeness.
Finally, world trade policy.
I think that with India, China and Russia we are witnessing a new momentum in world politics: these are countries with a very good level of education.
They are therefore going to have engineers, but for decades they will be paid much less than ours.
How are we going to deal with this reality in a world where we give priority only to competition instead of partnerships?
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the Commission's efforts to address the need to promote entrepreneurial activity within the European Union.
The Green Paper on entrepreneurship in Europe tackles many of the important issues and points the way to the essential growth and job creation that are required at the present time.
This is a key element of the Lisbon strategy: aiming to become the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economic region by the year 2010.
The international index of entrepreneurs indicates clearly that there are shortcomings in the EU that must be dealt with.
Last week's European Council discussed the Lisbon agenda, and I particularly welcome the key issues of investing in human capital, innovation, research and development and skills that were addressed.
As a public representative coming from one of Europe's most peripheral regions, I am heartened to read in the Council conclusions that recognition is given to the special needs of such regions.
Specific attention must be devoted to the needs of innovative SMEs that operate on the technological boundary and to technology transfers to peripheral regions.
In the new information society, peripherality need not be a drawback.
If the right infrastructure is put in place, notably broadband, and adequate investment is made in providing skills training, then regions like the west and north of Ireland can compete on a more equal basis with central locations.
Such an investment is crucial for Europe's growth potential.
If we are to reach our Lisbon goals, we must concentrate on mobilising investment and getting the right regulatory conditions.
We must seek to provide research infrastructures such as science parks, industrial innovation, research and development projects and information and communication technologies.
Member States will also need to work towards the 3% budget target posed by the Commission.
In conclusion, what we need is a joined-up approach which goes across a range of policy areas.
I am convinced that it is the small, local project that offers the greatest potential and that we must particularly aim at an improved framework for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, let us be under no illusions: many people are fully aware and understand the importance of SMEs in Europe, just as they recognise that high taxes and an overblown bureaucracy are stifling the growth of our companies.
Yet when it comes down to brass tacks, many politicians â national and European â forget what they are supposed to stand for and ultimately vote in favour of tax increases, more bureaucracy and more complex legal provisions.
That is also a major reason why small and medium-sized enterprises are not growing in the way that we would expect.
Todayâs motion for a resolution on market rules for the self-employed is a vivid example of this game with marked cards.
It claims to work in the interests of stakeholders, and yet in reality, it is intended to achieve exactly the opposite effect.
Both market access and the operation of new and smaller freelance business are likely to be substantially impeded as a result of this initiative.
I regard the postponement of todayâs vote on this motion as a positive sign that some of our fellow Members have recognised this hypocrisy and are taking action against it by lobbying for genuine improvements for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, implementing the Lisbon strategy with a view to improving the competitiveness of our companies is a key element in terms of relaunching the economy and preserving the European social model.
Achieving this objective requires the existence of a broad and dynamic company fabric essentially composed of small and medium-sized enterprises, since these are best suited to the challenges of an environment which is constantly mutating and thereby responding to the concerns of the citizens in relation to employment.
In order to guarantee the maintenance of this fabric, it is not sufficient, however, to guarantee the smooth operation, for example, of the internal market, or to implement a commercial policy which ensures the opening up of third country markets in a reciprocal fashion, or to implement an industrial policy which takes account of the specific needs of the different sectors, however important all this may be.
In this regard, Commissioner, please allow me to express my satisfaction at your announcement of a forthcoming communication on the textile and clothing sector.
As well as all these aspects I have referred to, we must also encourage the entrepreneurial spirit and promote the creation of companies and a favourable climate which allows them to develop and grow; without companies there can be no entrepreneurial fabric.
Hence the timeliness of the Commission's Green Paper and the Langen report, which is the subject of this debate, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent work.
We must reaffirm the importance and value of small and medium-sized businesses as a basic pillar of the European economy and promote the establishment of an environment which guarantees the appropriate training of entrepreneurs, stimulates the creation of companies, promotes their growth, their competitiveness and eliminates the legislative, administrative and fiscal obstacles which hinder entrepreneurial activity in line with the very appropriate proposals in the Langen report.
Otherwise, the Lisbon objectives, which â let us not forget â should lead to the creation, between now and 2010, of 15Â million jobs and greater social cohesion, will be reduced to mere wishes that are impossible to achieve.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union needs an industrial policy.
Enlargement makes it even more necessary, and that policy cannot be reduced to competition policy alone.
Competition policy alone can neither respond to the social challenges and to the risk of sudden relocations to areas of low taxation and low wage costs, nor can it satisfy the ambition of having an excellent innovative industry with a high level of skill and added value providing a large number of quality jobs.
This ambition of excellence ought to be ours for the present Member States as for the candidate countries.
We must reject any kind of fatalism that says Europe is doomed to de-industrialise or to see its industries concentrated in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe alone.
As MrÂ Herzog said, I do not believe that the answer to this vision of renunciation or to the illusion of a European economy that will remain strong if it concentrates exclusively on services but loses many technological trump cards lies solely in entrepreneurship; we must also look for the answer in genuine industrial strategies, which are still hard to discern in the Commission communication.
A real industrial policy must be based on large projects and sustained strategies in sectors combining, for example, research and development efforts with the creation of European champions.
By encouraging groupings, for example, we could create champions capable of acting on a world scale, drawing after them a whole sector of job-creating SMEs.
When that has happened in the past, it has been on the basis of intergovernmental and not Community initiatives.
We can think of Airbus, the defence industries or Arianespace, while there are many other fields â you mentioned several â where much more aggressive and vigorous action would be required.
I think it is up to the Commission to take initiatives in this respect, although, it is true, we need to give it the competences to do so.
Perhaps we should have an industrial policy Commissioner alongside the competition Commissioner.
Finally, as Mrs Zrihen has said, this industrial policy, including the aspect of competitiveness, must form part of a social vision.
There are essential questions that cannot be avoided here.
I will mention tax harmonisation, the conditions of social harmonisation, especially after enlargement, and worker representation in large European groups, without which there will be no real social dialogue.
In this connection, the revised directive on European works councils is still blocked, even though it has been approved by Parliament.
Finally, I will mention policy on lifelong learning.
I will end on this point by pointing out that in our businesses, in our countries, it is easier to give training opportunities to people who are already very highly qualified than to the least well qualified persons.
That is why I hope that our Assembly will vote by a very large majority in favour of Mrs Zrihenâs report and that the Commission will take note of it.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Langen has done European enterprise a great service in his report.
He will have my full support, but what we need most of all, if Europe is to provide the environment which will foster entrepreneurship, is a complete change in attitudes to success and to failure.
In America, the down-and-out who passes by the tycoon's lavish mansion will aspire to match him.
In Europe he would probably pass snide comments or call on the government to tax him out of business.
Envy and disparagement are the enemy of success and of a successful enterprise economy.
In America, the entrepreneur who fails will be given credit for trying and gaining experience for the next time.
The bankrupt will be helped to recover his self-esteem and the determination to try again.
In Europe, he would be abandoned in legal and financial limbo.
He will be pilloried and shamed, his chances of a second try constrained.
Seldom will the innovator, the inventor or the enterprising individual possess all the necessary financial means and business skills which are necessary for full and enduring success.
This is where the business angel, the friendly adviser, the non-executive director become essential.
That is why I am particularly pleased that paragraph 34 of Mr Langen's report highlights the role of business angels.
That is why I ask the whole of Parliament for its support for Amendment 7, which expresses our concern at the tendency to persecute non-executive directors who are such an essential ingredient in a successful enterprise.
Let us be forgiving of honest failure.
Let us encourage that first try, that second try, the will to keep on trying.
Let us praise success and be pleased to see the rewards of success in our most enterprising fellow citizens.
Only then will we achieve a true enterprise culture in Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, in countries such as India, China, Thailand and Argentina, the level of entrepreneurship displayed is truly remarkable.
In the vast majority of EU Member States, on the other hand, the prevailing attitude is one of risk-averse pessimism as a result of poor economic data and many heralded but unimplemented reforms.
Europe will be more capable of holding its own in global competition if there are far more business start-ups, for example.
Mr Langen has presented a very sound analysis of the Commissionâs Green Paper and proposed substantial improvements.
Let us learn from best practices, for example from Ireland, which is among the world leaders, in terms of its business start-ups, thanks to lean bureaucracy, a simple taxation system, and active promotion of entrepreneurial spirit.
Support must not only be given to new start-ups, however.
Existing companies, crafts and family business also need to be promoted â an issue on which the report touched only marginally.
We are in favour of an action plan for entrepreneurship, to be produced by the end of 2003, with feasible proposals, a binding timeframe, and the Charter for Small Enterprises as an integral element.
Ask an expert, the President of SME Global, our fellow Member Mr RÃŒbig!
Let us be clear: enterprises need direct and uncomplicated access to funds, from the provision of risk capital to loans from the EIB and the EDF.
When starting up, they need tax breaks, and when problems subsequently arise, they need relief from taxation and bureaucracy.
They need the requisite transfer of innovation and technologies, and as our friend Mr Purvis has rightly pointed out, they need support from business angels.
I know many of them.
We also need support for European networking.
Given the rising unemployment figures, we have no more time to lose.
The political framework conditions must be in place so that enterprises can actually act in an enterprising manner again.
If managers and workforce alike have clear prospects, they will be willing to be more flexible and mobile.
Â Â  .
Mr President, it is late, and there are other items still to come, so I just want to thank once more the rapporteurs, Mrs Zrihen and Mr Langen, for their excellent work and also all honourable Members for their contributions.
We will carefully study all of this in the follow-up both to the industrial policy communication and the action plan for entrepreneurship.
So I look forward to seeing you back in this House in early winter next year.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  . I welcome the Commission initiative on the Green Paper on entrepreneurship with particular satisfaction and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on the detailed, cohesive work which he is presenting to us for the vote.
We must clarify that, if entrepreneurship does not develop at a fast rate in the EU, we shall have to definitively forget the Lisbon objectives as of now.
Only if entrepreneurship develops can the scourge of unemployment be combated and the wealth of the EU increased for the benefit, mainly, of the less well off.
In order to achieve this, governments must simplify bureaucratic procedures now, create company-friendly tax systems and take pains to create a temperate business climate in which new companies will flourish and develop.
Banks must stop being the oppressor of small and medium-sized enterprises and must undertake the useful role as their advisor and supporter.
Finally, the social perception which the leftist ideology has been cultivating for years now, that profit is the demon and enemy of society, must be overturned immediately and definitively.
It must become the common conviction that profit means recompense for the person making an effort, taking risks, working day and night, who is ambitious and capable of something better.
Profit is the driving force which creates entrepreneurship and results in the advancement of individuals, peoples and states.
Â Â  Small businesses play an essential part in terms of dynamism, innovation and employment throughout the European internal market.
That is why I am pleased to see the growing and increasingly visible recognition given by our Parliament to these key players in the European economy, and in particular by the Committee on Industry, which now never misses an opportunity to encourage this phenomenon.
My colleague Mr Langenâs report says a lot about the part played by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which has brought about definite improvements to the Commission Green Paper on âEntrepreneurship in Europeâ, thanks among other things to the many amendments we put through together with my colleagues from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Finally, the spirit that drives entrepreneurs, large or small, is given a definition that will enable measures to be put in place to simplify the red tape involved in the creation and operation of businesses, their transfer and the essential forms of tax relief.
There is, however, still much to be done, like drawing up a European specification for businesses, better representation for SMEs in Community think tanks, aid mechanisms for their internationalisation, etc. and I expect our work will continue in this direction.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0330/2003) by Mrs Angelilli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on compensation to crime victims.
Â Â  MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the report which I am about to present is the Commission proposal for a Council directive on compensation to crime victims.
This initiative follows on from the Green Paper on compensation to crime victims with which, in September 2001, the Commission began to promote the debate on this issue and which, a year ago, was the subject of a report, which I had the honour of drafting, and also a Parliament resolution.
On several occasions during debates in this House on the issue of justice and combating crime, a judicial system emerged at European level that centres almost exclusivelyÂ âÂ and I would say quite rightlyÂ âÂ on penalties, punishment and control.
Only to a lesser extentdoes this system deal with the rehabilitation and social reintegration of the defendants and, more generally, with a crime prevention policy.
At the bottom of this list are, I am sorry to say, the victims of crime: innocent citizens who, despite having suffered an injury, at times serious, are, all too often, denied adequate protection and compensation.
Thus, we need to put the protection of victims at the centre of the debate on justice.
The most urgent problem to solve is the existence of major disparities between the national compensation schemes, enormous differences as regards the level of compensation and related procedures in each individual Member State.
Such a situation cannot be considered compatible with the principles underlying the creation of a single area of freedom, security and justice.
There has been a great deal of progress during the course of the year.
The European Union has selected possible objectives to pursue, criticised the difficulties associated with the various legal systems of the Member States, identified the different kinds of needs of crime victims and established the minimum Community measures to be enforced.
The most eagerly-awaited and most important step forward is, however, the desire now to adopt a binding legislative strategy, at Community level, to actively realise the Tampere policy objectives.
Thanks to this directive, it will be possible to take an initial step towards harmonisation of the European criminal law systems as regards the treatment of crime victims, guaranteeing them, with all due respect for the principle of subsidiarity, sufficient attention, recognition of the necessary support and reparation for the harm inflicted, including when the person who committed the crime has not been identified, has disappeared or is unable to pay.
Identifying common categories to define crime victims, compensation beneficiaries when the victim has died and the common procedures and formalities for payment therefore constitute the minimum legal base that the European Union is called upon to have to provide, so that it is no longer the case that the amount of compensation or the possibility of receiving it depends on the place of residence or on the place where the crime was committed.
To this end, although I generally agree with everything that the Commission proposed, we added a more explicit description of the type of damage for which compensation is to be provided and the time frames laid down for compensation than is contained in the original text.
We specified a minimum threshold for exclusion from compensation; we proposed, in order to avoid linguistic difficulties, to introduce harmonised forms and translations, where appropriate, into the language that the victim can understand.
The priority objective is to guarantee the fundamental principle of non-discrimination for all citizens and legal residents in the Union and the desire to limit, as far as possible, the effects and suffering of victims of unjust damage, who are victims a second time when they are denied support by inadequate, or sometimes non-existent compensation systems
I will conclude MrÂ President by thanking my fellow Members who contributed to the good outcome of the work.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the European Unionâs primary objectives is guaranteeing freedom of movement.
This freedom of movement can only be exercised, however, if the Union also adopts all measures necessary to protect its citizens, especially if they fall victim to a crime, irrespective of their nationality within the EU and also irrespective of the Member State where they fall victim to a crime.
The citizens of the European Union like travelling, and they do a great deal of it, working in other Member States and also exercising their right to freedom of movement in the EU in a variety of other ways.
Yet any citizen can fall victim to a crime or a terrorist attack in another Member State, or indeed in their own country.
Until now, national legislation has varied widely, as Mrs Angelilli has explained.
In other words, two persons who have been victims of a crime in very similar circumstances but in two different Member States may receive wildly varying compensation for similar damage, and in an extreme scenario, a victim may receive no compensation at all.
That is why, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I greatly welcome the Commissionâs proposal and thank Mrs Angelilli for her report, which is intended to establish rules for victims of intentional criminal acts or terrorist attacks within the European Union.
With the entry into force of this directive, all EU citizens and all persons who are legally resident in the EU will receive appropriate compensation if they fall victim to a crime.
This also means that anyone who is the victim of a crime within the EU will have the right to approach an authority in their own Member State in order to seek assistance.
This ensures that victims have easier access to compensation, even if the crime was committed outside the personâs own Member State.
It ensures that victims of crime will at last enjoy appropriate protection and compensation, which, paradoxically, is still not given due consideration in many jurisdictions and systems of criminal law to the present day.
I am convinced that there will be a substantial majority in favour of this report in the House tomorrow, and I am gratified that this is the case.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ Angelilli, on the report we are debating today.
The high degree of consensus achieved in the Committee on Citizenâs Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is undoubtedly essential in such an important area as the one we are debating today; compensation for the victims of crime.
The judicial systems of the Member States of the European Union do not pay enough attention to the victims of crime, and what is more, they often do not provide them with appropriate protection or compensation.
As a result of this situation, in recent years criminologists and people responsible for judicial policy have paid particular attention to the situation of the victims of crime, within the context of criminal violations, and the protection of their interests.
I believe that the report we approved in November 2000, on the status of the victim in the judicial process, was the first step in this legislature towards resolving this problem.
It was an important step towards filling the immense legal vacuum which represented, in my opinion, a form of discrimination against the millions of citizens who move freely about the European Union, at risk of being victims of crime, but who are faced with 15 judicial borders, which, in practice, have shown themselves to be incapable of protecting their rights.
I am happy that today we are closer to being able to guarantee compensation to victims, not only in order to alleviate the damage and suffering they experience as much as possible, but also in order to pacify the social conflict resulting from crime and to facilitate the application of a rational and correct judicial policy.
I would also like to stress that, although reparations or compensation should fall to the person who has committed the crime, as the person directly responsible for the damage, in practice, full compensation by the perpetrator of the crime is rarely achieved, either because they have not been identified, or because they have disappeared or are insolvent.
As I have indicated in the amendments approved, it is necessary to restrict the unjust effects resulting from the current varying levels of compensation in the Member States and to guarantee that the citizens of the European Union receive suitable compensation for the damage suffered when they are victims of crime in any part of the Union.
This support for the victim must involve two types of measures which complement each other. Firstly, material, psychological, health and social assistance and, secondly, compensation for the damaged caused, both material and emotional, to the victim or the persons dependent on them.
There is no doubt that this would represent great progress, with a view to achieving the political objectives which the European Union set for itself at the Tampere Summit and in the Vienna Action Plan.
The creation of a genuine area of freedom, security and justice and the exercise of the right to free movement will not be possible unless the Union adopts the necessary measures to protect the citizen when they are victims of crime in any part of its territory, regardless of their nationality, and unless they are compensated for the damage suffered.
This initiative by the European Commission and the work of Commissioner Vitorino is, in my view, the right way to achieve that.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again we have on the table a measure geared towards creating an area of freedom, security and justice â a measure which attempts to respond to the day-to-day concerns of citizens.
This is the great aim we have set ourselves and through which all citizens must see their integrity protected, have access to justice and see their rights ensured, regardless of where they are, and as easily as if they were in their own country.
It is important to set minimum standards for state compensation, as well as better access to such compensation in cross-border situations, thereby also establishing a last-resort guarantee for victims who are unable to gain access to compensation from the offender or by other means.
We know very well that victims are often not successful in obtaining full compensation from offenders, either because the latter do not have sufficient funds, or because they have disappeared or never been identified.
We want to prevent the substantial differences between the various Member States from causing unjustifiable variations in the compensation to which citizens are entitled, simply as a result of their having been victims of crime in one part of the European Union rather than another.
That would be incomprehensible, especially in view of the existence of a common area of freedom, security and justice.
I welcome this proposal for a directive, therefore, as well as MrsÂ Angelilliâs report.
This proposal aims not to harmonise but to introduce minimum standards, enabling those Member States which so wish to maintain or introduce provisions that are more favourable to victims of such tragedies.
In the first place, the principle of territoriality should apply, so that the Member State where the crime was committed is responsible for paying compensation.
At the same time, the victim should have the right to submit his or her application for compensation to an authority in his or her Member State of residence, with a view to avoiding secondary victimisation.
I would emphasise that the principles of social justice should be respected, and each Member State should be called upon to provide compensation not just to its own citizens, but also to other victims of violence carried out within its borders, such as migrant workers, students, tourists and others.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe it is true to say that there is little that matters to citizens as much as feeling safe and secure in the country in which they live or reside.
There is no point at all in us promoting the free movement of workers across the European Union if our citizens do not feel that they will be protected from crime in whatever state they may find themselves.
If EU citizens are to believe in the European Union â and let us face it, some of them do not at the moment â it is essential that they are confident of receiving the same standard of protection from crime and the same treatment as victims of crime as they would expect if they were in their own country.
As others have said, this legislation seeks not just to help anyone who might be unfortunate enough to be a victim of such a crime, but to try to ensure that there is consistency.
To be a victim of a crime is bad enough, but the problems of personal and emotional torture will continue if they do not get fair and appropriate compensation.
This is all the more important when we know that the legal systems vary from one country to another, and the ways and workings of the different police forces and the actions they take are not the same from one country to the next.
I applaud this proposal.
I believe it will provide a central body in citizens' own Member States, which would apply to the country where the crime occurred to get compensation on their behalf.
We should not forget that violent crime can take place anywhere, in any country.
It is right and proper that we do everything to level out the system to make certain it works in favour of the citizen and the victim of the crime.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank MrsÂ Angelilli for the high quality of her report and express my satisfaction with the support this House has expressed for this initiative, which is based, as you all know, ladies and gentlemen, on ArticleÂ 308 of the Treaty, and which enjoys such broad support as this in Parliament.
I welcome MrsÂ Angelilliâs draft amendments and agree with the underlying thinking.
With regard to these amendments, I would just like to draw attention to the fact that, to my mind, Parliament should preserve the essence of an initiative such as this, based on common minimum standards.
I too would like to be more ambitious, but I would draw the Houseâs attention to the fact that excessive ambition might render this initiative difficult to approve, whereas I would like to see it approved in the shortest possible order.
For this reason, in order not to delay matters any further, the Commission will not table an amended proposal but will opt for the compromise of fighting to put forward the intention underpinning the overwhelming majority of MrsÂ Angelilliâs draft amendments, 53 out of a total of 77, in its negotiations with the Council on adopting this proposal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0326/2003) by Robert J.E. Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, concerning the prevention and control of trafficking in human organs and tissues.
Â Â  . Mr President, over the last few years scientific progress has transformed human organ transplants into a routine medical procedure with over a 99% success rate in western Europe.
However, the serious shortage of donors means that many patients still die unnecessarily.
To counter this shortage, sadly an abhorrent phenomenon has developed â the illicit trade in human organs.
There are several well-documented cases of EU citizens who have travelled to poorer countries in the world in search of vital remedies for their own failing health.
This rise in so-called "transplant tourism", whereby rich EU citizens, rich EU patients, are purchasing organs from living donors in developing countries, is on the rise and is to me completely abhorrent.
I appreciate that anyone dying of kidney failure will be desperate.
Indeed, they are themselves a victim of the current failing system.
But it cannot be right or acceptable that someone with money is able to buy a better life for themselves at the expense of someone else's health.
Make no mistake, while in many cases a living healthy donor may be alright after an operation, in many other cases the donor's health will be critically affected.
It is already illegal in 14 out of 15 EU countries for citizens to buy an organ from anyone else.
So, if we outlaw it in our own countries, why can anyone think it acceptable to buy human organs from other countries?
We do not permit, say, someone from the south of England to go to Scotland to purchase a kidney, nor is it legal for a Parisian to go to Marseilles for the same purpose.
So why can it be acceptable for any European to go to India or Pakistan or indeed any European Union citizen to travel to Moldova or the Ukraine?
I know there may be considerable consensus tonight on this debate, but I also know that there are alternative views in my own country and indeed elsewhere.
Furthermore, many of us have read reports in the international media suggesting that there are criminal gangs out there trafficking and murdering and even suggestions or allegations of children being bred in order to remove their organs later on.
The Schengen system, which we applaud, makes it easier, however, for criminal gangs to move freely around the European Union where they can exploit the divergences between Member States' legislation.
The very welcome accession of the new Member States of the European Union will make it possible to tackle cross-border issues such as trafficking more effectively.
However, if the area of free movement is extended, common rules such as these are essential in order to ensure that criminal groups are not able to further exploit the differences in Member States' laws to their own benefit.
My report also calls on the Commission to evaluate the feasibility of a comprehensive European Union directive regulating the legal use of organs for transplant, including a database of legally available organs and the creation of an EU-wide database of patients in need of an organ transplant.
Member States may also wish to consider whether the current practice whereby citizens opt in to donate their organs in the event of their death should be changed to one where, unless they have opted out, their organs will be available for medical transplant.
I will certainly be urging the British Government to consider this possibility.
The Greek proposal before us lays out common definitions of offences to be included in the scope of trafficking in human organs.
It sets a minimum ten years' imprisonment for offences committed in aggravating circumstances and introduces a much needed element of extraterritoriality, whereby individuals who seek to purchase organs from third country nationals, even outside the EU, would be committing an offence under EU law.
I support the main aims and principles of the Greek proposal.
I am suggesting, however, a few amendments.
I would like to add to the title the words 'parts of organs and tissues', which removes any ambiguities.
Also, adding the word 'illegal' would eliminate any suggestion that legitimate medical purposes might be adversely affected.
If the title is modified to clarify that the proposal is concerned only with illegal trafficking, then reproductive and embryonic organs and tissues and blood should also be included in the scope of the proposal.
Furthermore, I do not believe that living donors should be held criminally responsible.
It is not appropriate for the EU to criminalise a donor who, in the vast majority of cases, will have been persuaded or coerced by criminal networks in the hope of escaping from extreme poverty.
With these remarks and the proposed amendments that I have put before you, I commend this report to colleagues and I hope that as many of you as possible will be able to support this report tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Evans for his very comprehensive report on a very sensitive issue.
The Commission shares the view of the rapporteur that trafficking in human organs and tissues is a serious violation of fundamental rights and in particular of human dignity and physical integrity.
The prevention and control of trafficking in human organs is a very complex issue, both ethically and technically, and requires careful consideration and debate.
I believe that your contribution to this debate has been crucial.
I would like very much to congratulate you not only for the report but also for the fact that this debate will definitely contribute to clarifying some of the key elements of this initiative taken by the Greek Government.
I agree in particular with three important major amendments.
Firstly, the exclusion of the liability of the donor; secondly, the inclusion of a reference to intentional commission of offences; and, thirdly, that it should be made clear that financial gain also covers any comparable advantage and that certain types of payment are acceptable.
But I would like to call you attention to the need for further reflection on two specific points.
I note that it is proposed that the list of body parts excluded from the application of the initiative in the original text should be deleted.
I can see that this is an issue which requires further consideration, particularly since similar exclusions apply under the Council of Europe protocol concerning transportation of organs and tissues of human origin.
The exclusion of certain body parts is still under discussion, and the Commission will follow these up very carefully in the on-going discussion.
I also consider that some of the wording proposed in relation to the issue of jurisdiction, particularly shared jurisdiction, might be better addressed in the context of a horizontal initiative.
With regard to the broader context of this initiative, I note that the report calls, as the rapporteur has just said, for more action in respect of the legal use of organs for transplant, especially the shortage of organs.
The Commission agrees that organ shortage is a major obstacle, and I am pleased to inform you that my colleague, David Byrne, is currently compiling information on the basis of a recent survey in respect of the current situation of organ transplantation in the Member States, acceding states and applicant countries.
When complete, the Commission will be in a position to evaluate whether a further initiative is called for and to assess the legal base and scope of any such proposal.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Robert Evans for his report.
He has addressed a very important issue, and the activities of the criminal gangs engaged in the trafficking of human organs are one of the worst examples of organised crime.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy supports the Greek initiative, and we have raised a number of additional points, the majority of which have been accepted by the lead committee.
Our primary concern is to make the impacts on public health even clearer than in the proposal by the Greek Presidency.
Secondly, in this context, we also see a connection with legislation which we are currently negotiating with the Commission and the Council, and which deals with the issue of quality and safety of cells and tissues.
Here too, Parliament voted by a large majority to reject any trade in unmodified cells and tissues.
Unlike the Commission and the Council, we believe that there is a legal basis here too so that we can discuss this issue, in part, in the codecision procedure.
The committee made this very clear once again.
I agree with the rapporteur and do not share the opinion of the Commissioner as regards the exceptions.
We should not allow for any exceptions in this text.
As a matter of principle, all types of trade in cells and tissues should be punishable by law.
However, we need more precise provisions here, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy submitted a motion, which, unfortunately, the lead committee rejected.
Nonetheless, we will table it on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats again tomorrow for a vote.
We would like to make a clear distinction.
We believe that whenever financial gain is involved, the trade in organs and unmodified cells and tissues should be banned.
However, I emphasise the phrase âunmodified cells and tissuesâ, because if drugs are produced from cells and tissues, then of course the investments made by industry in these drugs have to be refinanced, and for this reason, we need to provide for the opportunity for these products to be sold.
I would therefore ask you to support Amendment No 49 tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the purposes of clarification.
Â Â  Mr President, the despicable and illegal trade in human organs is one that we must endeavour to address.
In his report Mr Evans does this and adds useful points that complement those made by the Council in the initial proposal.
I have however, along with my colleague Mr Liese, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, tabled supplementary amendments aimed at clarifying the text.
The most important of these concerns penalties.
We felt it was necessary to send out the right signals both to traffickers and donors.
It is for this reason that we have suggested the reinstatement of Article 2(2)(d).
This paragraph states that it is a punishable offence to receive or demand money for organ removal.
My committee deleted this proposal, but I feel that it should be included in the text so as to discourage unregulated organ donation whenever possible.
In order to avoid penalising those who have already suffered enough through exploitive organ donation, we have suggested the insertion of a provision under which penalties may be reduced in certain circumstances.
Organised criminals should not take advantage of either naive or opportunistic people in order to create a market of unsafe and unregulated organs.
It is far preferable to encourage legal and legitimate organ donation.
It is for this reason that I wish to underline the importance of voluntary organ donation.
The underlying cause of organ trafficking is a lack of available organs.
In the UK alone, 5700 people tonight are waiting for a transplant but less than 3000 transplants are carried out each year.
Last year nearly 400 people died in the UK waiting for a transplant.
An EU-wide crack-down on organ trafficking must go hand-in-hand with information campaigns on organ tissue and cell donation at European and national level.
We should encourage European citizens to join national donor schemes and to make their wishes known to their families or their legal representatives.
I have carried my donor card for many years.
I actively support the NHS organ donor campaign.
I encourage others to support similar campaigns in their Member States.
This is an area in which we really can cooperate with one another in order to achieve the most important result of all, the result of saving many lives.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that the initiative by the Greek Government to table a proposal on the prevention and repression of trafficking in human organs is very important if we are to combat this scandal of the trafficking in bazaars of human organs and, above all, stamp out action by internationally organised criminal networks which engage in abductions and murder, especially of children, in order to sell their organs.
I think that the report drafted by Mr Evans, while supporting the basic objectives of the Greek proposal, at the same time supplements them and provides safety valves so as not to discourage donors.
We all know that there has been a reduction in the number of transplants over recent years in the European Union.
In Greece, the average waiting time for a kidney transplant is over 8 years.
The biggest problem is mainly with liver and heart transplants.
In this case, we know that many patients die waiting for a transplant.
This situation, of course, is exploited by organised crime, which offers a way out in the form of transplant tourism and by dealing with complicated trafficking networks.
It is an open secret that the biggest organ bazaars operate in India, Brazil, South Africa, China and Pakistan.
Nonetheless, acute phenomena of speculation and violations of human dignity are also appearing in the European Union and in the candidate countries, where the exertion of economic pressure on financially impoverished groups contributes to the flourishing of illegal and repugnant action by dark networks.
In addition to this, serious account also needs to be taken of the repercussions on public health, as the relevant amendment points out.
I also agree with the amendment by the European Parliament that trafficking also affects citizens' rights to equal access to health services and undermines confidence in the legal transplant system.
Without doubt, we need a common stand at European Union level on the approximation of criminal legislation, which varies from one Member State to another, strict sanctions and international cooperation to combat the repulsive phenomenon of trafficking in human organs.
At the same time, however, we need to develop action at the level of informing and raising the awareness of the public.
There would certainly be no illegal trade in human organs if more citizens were willing to donate organs and tissues after their death.
That is why information campaigns are needed at national and European level in a bid to persuade people to become donors and to make their wishes known to their families and close ones well in advance.
The issuing of a Community directive will create the appropriate legal framework in order to put the problem of thousands of people on waiting lists for organs on a new basis.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to extend warm thanks to Mr Evans for his report.
I think it is an important initiative of the Greek Presidency, as has been stated by various fellow MEPs.
A shortage of donors lies at the heart of the problem.
In my country, for example, there has for twenty years been a shortage of organ donors.
Moreover, not every donor is suitable.
A donor should, in most cases, be brain-dead, but their heart must still be beating.
As a result, many donors do not qualify.
For a long time, road victims were, and still are, a source of donors, but the numbers are decreasing, which only exacerbates the problem.
This should never lead to the illegal trade in human organs.
It is too dreadful for words to be faced with the trafficking of human beings, including women and children, with the intention of removing their organs.
These are invariably poor and powerless people from poor countries, but also from China and India.
Some have their organs removed in the hope of a better existence, and others are simply taken advantage of.
It is a good thing that this will be regulated.
In this context, it is actually a disgrace that the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of 1997, which entered into force in 1999, has to date been ratified only by Denmark, Spain and Portugal.
My country should take this to heart.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is of the opinion that it is only by adopting a coordinated and tailored approach to the illegal trade in organs that human dignity can be protected.
We therefore hope that this proposal will contribute to this. It is for these reasons that we support the proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, the transplantation of organs, parts of organs, tissues and cells, can save lives and is an important method in courses of treatment for many different disorders and illnesses.
In future, the transplantation of cells, for example, will play an ever more important role in regular medicine.
The transplantation of adult stem cells is a case in point.
There are, however, two aspects which the European Union should regulate in this framework.
The first is the guarantee of quality and safety of donation and transplantation, and the second is the prevention of trade in organs, tissues and cells.
The former is currently being dealt with in the Liese report, the latter in the report we are discussing today, which, to put it briefly, receives our unqualified support.
It is good that these immoral practices are being tackled.
It is good that the report asks for extra attention for the encouragement of voluntary donation.
We cannot follow the report in one area: we think that â as is, in fact, mentioned in the Greek initiative â the offering and accepting of money for organs, tissues or cells should also be punishable.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Bolivia.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission followed very closely and with growing concern the dramatic and tragic events which shook Bolivia last week.
We deplore the fact that as many as 80 people were killed and hundreds were injured in the violent clashes in El Alto, La Paz and other cities and I take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families concerned.
We firmly hope that the persons responsible for the deaths and injuries will not go unpunished.
We regret the chain of events which led to the resignation last Friday of the democratically elected former President GonzÃ¡lez SÃ¡nchez de Lozada.
I nevertheless welcome the orderly transition which has resulted in former Vice-President Carlos Mesa Gisbert assuming the presidency of the Republic of Bolivia in compliance with the provisions of its constitution.
My colleague, Chris Patten, made a statement on Monday wishing President Mesa every success at what we surely all agree is a particularly critical moment in Bolivia's history.
The Commission has called upon all Bolivians to work together in an open and constructive spirit to find consensual solutions to the many challenges facing their country.
We are fully committed to assisting the Bolivian authorities during the period of transition.
Recent events have underlined the need to take steps to ensure the effective participation of Bolivia's citizens in democratic and constitutional governance.
In this context, the Commission is ready to devote resources, building on its long tradition of cooperation with Bolivia, to support concrete measures which can improve the capacity of key actors to prevent and manage conflict in this very complex and divided country.
Before the escalating crisis during the last month, the Commission was already very concerned indeed about the potential for further outbreaks of serious and violent political conflict in Bolivia following the events of 12 and 13 February 2003, when the police rioted in response to the former president's budget proposals and the subsequent clashes left 33 people dead and nearly 200 wounded.
Making use of its rapid reaction mechanism, the Commission initiated a conflict assessment mission, which completed its field work at the end of June 2003.
As a result we are considering drawing on the rapid reaction mechanism budget line, up to EUR 1 million, and are examining ideas and proposals for concrete short-term measures in the field of conflict prevention and management, which we hope to discuss in the very near future in close coordination with the new government of President Carlos Mesa.
We are particularly interested in supporting measures which could strengthen the capacity of the Congress and Senate to respond effectively to the many and often conflicting demands of Bolivian citizens before they become unmanageable and spill over into further episodes of violent conflict.
The Commission also intends to explore with the new government the possibility of re-orienting a limited part of those funds which have not yet been committed from our country strategy paper envelope for 2000-2006 towards a longer term programme with an explicit conflict prevention focus.
The recent events and their dramatic dÃ©nouement prove the need for the European Union to continue strengthening its long-standing partnership with Bolivia, to promote respect and trust for democratic principles, to assist with desperately needed economic recovery and to support Bolivia's efforts to alleviate poverty and stamp out social exclusion.
Â Â  Mr President, in view of the grave events which have taken place in Bolivia, I believe nothing could be more dangerous than to take a simplistic and demagogic view of them, since this would lead us to make serious errors in our interpretation of the situation.
I believe that, in order to approach this problem in a correct manner, we should work on the basis of two premises: firstly, the situation of horrendous inequality, social exclusion and poverty.
Let us not forget that Bolivia is the poorest country in South America, with an imperfect, incomplete democracy, which is far from being the effective and functional democracy it should be, and neither must we forget, Mr President, the long tradition of military coups in that country.
These factors, amongst others, create a very fertile breeding ground for the emergence of populism based on social frustration, which has been very well described by such a widely respected person as the writer â and one time politician â Mario VargasÂ Llosa, following the frustrated privatisations in the Peruvian city of Arequipa.
What is certainly the case â as VargasÂ Llosa also tells us â is that a sort of re-emergence of populism is taking place, as a result of the failure of certain reforms for opening up the markets and for privatisation, in some cases presented falsely as neo-liberal, and the only alternative is the old nationalist and Statist model of development with a domestic focus, to which â together with dictatorships â these countries owe much of their marginalisation and misery.
I therefore believe it is important, Mr President, that we are able to distinguish, because many believe a war is being waged on corruption and in favour of justice when, in reality, a battle may be breaking out in favour of more backwardness and poverty.
That is what happened in Arequipa and, although the two cases are not exactly the same, there are consequences from this Peruvian phenomenon which could perhaps explain, or be applied or extrapolated within the context of Boliviaâs experience.
There are two worrying elements to the situation: one of them is the three months that the leader of the opposition and coca-grower, EvoÂ Morales, has given them to resolve the situation in the country, and the other is the holding of a referendum on privatisation and the sale of gas.
I believe that the European Union, as the Commissioner quite rightly said, must appeal for moderation and good sense, so that a constructive dialogue between all the parties may be initiated in order to generate a climate of trust and understanding.
I also believe, Mr President, that we must reiterate our firm and decisive support for the democratic system, for the Rule of Law and for constitutional order and also express our condolences â as the Commission has done â to the people and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia, for the loss of human lives.
In the compromise resolution we also call for this Parliament to send a delegation to the Republic of Bolivia to analyse the situation on the ground and stress the need to increase efforts aimed at the physical, political, social and economic reconstruction of the country in order to make it governable.
We take a positive view of the efforts announced by the Commission, but we believe that these efforts must be increased since the mobilisation of a sum of EURÂ oneÂ million is entirely insufficient, given the poverty afflicting that country and we believe that the funds requested by this Parliament, and included in the European Unionâs budget for 2004, in order to create a regional solidarity fund, could be a very useful instrument for dealing with crises such as the one which is regrettably unfolding in Bolivia at the moment.
Â Â  Mr President, on 17Â October, the Brussels European Council included in its conclusions a statement on Bolivia containing four points.
This statement said, amongst other things, that the European Council reiterated its support for the democratically-elected government of Bolivia in its efforts to find a peaceful and constitutional solution to the current crisis and added that the European Council called on the political, social and economic forces in Bolivia to renounce violence and begin a responsible and constructive dialogue with the Bolivian Government.
This was said at a time when, as Commissioner Vitorino himself has acknowledged, the Bolivian Government had been responsible for the deaths of more than eighty citizens and for injuries to hundreds of people and material damage to their property.
At that time I was ashamed to read that the European Union, together with the US Government, was one of the few sources of support left to the President who acted in such an irresponsible way, after having tried to appropriate the countryâs scant natural resources.
The question I would ask the Presidency, represented by the Commission at the moment, and I am not sure whether it will be able to answer, is what kind of information the European Council had when adopting this statement, given that on that same day, before it had been possible to translate the Councilâs statement into Spanish, the President of Bolivia was delivering his letter of resignation to the Bolivian National Congress.
What type of representation do we have?
Is there no communication between the Commission and the Council?
Did the Commission not know what was happening?
What kind of information was there?
How could the Council have adopted this statement without the support of the Commission?
In other words, we cannot act in such an irresponsible manner, because in this case the European Union has made a fool of itself.
It has made a fool of itself before the public and â I repeat â I was ashamed to read in the newspapers that we were supporting this statement, together with the United States.
But the Americans behaved more intelligently, because, when they saw that things were going badly, before 17 October, they told SÃ¡nchez de Lozada to go.
Mr President, I apologise for taking such a critical tone, but I really feel hugely indignant at the moment, because it is not acceptable for our Union to be supporting this type of policy.
I would like to add that I agree with MrÂ Salafranca that this is a time to stay calm, to support the new Bolivian Government, to do everything possible to ensure that this government succeeds, and I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information he has given me on emergency aid.
Well, I do not believe that the emergency aid will be enough.
Bolivia is the poorest country in South America.
Millions of country people are living in misery.
The situation is truly horrendous and I believe that that country needs a very particular form of help, and we should avoid repeating past mistakes.
We must not rob these poor people of the only natural resource remaining to them, having first taken silver from Bolivia and then tin.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Unionâs relations with Latin America have almost always been characterised by a favourable attitude to the peaceful and negotiated resolution of all types of conflict, as well as trying to ensure that commercial, social and political relations take special account of human rights and the eradication of poverty and inequality.
The recent conflict in Bolivia therefore reveals all the aspects characterising this situation.
It is possible to establish a direct link between the abusive and unacceptable intervention of the United States, with its interference in the last electoral campaign in favour of SÃ¡nchezÂ de Lozada and against EvoÂ Morales, and the subsequent shameful delivery of Bolivian gas to the Americans, bringing the poorest country in America even closer to ruin.
Our joint resolution attempts to intervene positively, strengthening democracy, defending the right of people to their own energy resources and condemning the use of excessive violence on the part of the previous government against demonstrators.
Our group also criticises the Council for those statements â which MrÂ Medina has also mentioned â and proposes three amendments which we believe improve the joint text itself.
Firstly, it demands that the President, who has resigned, answer to Bolivian justice for crimes he may have committed during his mandate.
Furthermore, we believe that the European Union and its Member States should act in a coordinated way within international financial institutions in order to resolve the serious problem of Boliviaâs external debt.
We also believe that we should call on the authorities to provide information for the families of people who have âdisappearedâ and to quickly release those who have been unlawfully arrested.
Finally, we believe that we should call on the Organisation of American States to take measures to protect the lives of the social leaders who have been threatened, such as EvoÂ Morales.
Â Â  I have received 5 motions for resolutions on this subject pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 00.05 a.m.)(2)
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking Mrs Stihler, for her report.
On Monday, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) published its new scientific recommendation for 2004 and has now, unfortunately, been obliged to confirm the disastrous state that cod stocks are in, including in the waters to the west of Scotland, in the eastern English Channel, in the Skagerrak and in the Kattegat.
ICES has now advised that fishing for these four stocks be closed down.
This, of course, puts us in a massive dilemma.
Can we justify basing our decision solely on ICESâ argument in favour of replenishing stocks, which would result in our having to prohibit not only fishing for cod, but also for a whole range of other fish, and, in due course, in thousands of fishermen facing oblivion?
Or could we find a way out by improving our plans for stock recovery, so that, although stocks would recover more slowly and would also involve some elements of uncertainty, fewer fishermen would be forced to abandon their trade?
This is certainly a difficult decision, but it is one we will have to take before we can adopt any kind of plan to replenish cod stocks.
The outline that we are debating today is a general one, and serves as a good basis for a cod stock recovery plan that would secure us the chance to revert to normal management conditions.
It starts by identifying the lower limit below which scientists regard a stock as threatened with collapse.
The plan contains formulae for calculating total allowable catches (TAC) on the basis of scientific estimates of current stocks.
If the stock is larger than the lower limit, the TAC will be set in such a way that the stock can increase by 30% in the following year.
It introduces limitations on the fishing effort, allocated to the Member States in proportion to their share in the total allowable catch of cod.
It also contains measures to improve the monitoring and control of the vessels whose fishing effort is subject to management measures; these include provisions on prior notification and on the requirement to land cod in designated ports.
Â Â  . Mr President, the issue of cod stock recovery is an important one.
It affects not only my own country of Scotland, but also the rest of the UK, Ireland and Denmark.
Last week, the International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES) warned us that young North Sea cod measured in early 2003 were at their lowest level in 20 years.
Worries over repeating what happened in Newfoundland, where the cod never returned, haunt us all, and the ICES advice is stark: 'These cod stocks are at such a low level that we have had to resort to recommending zero catches as a final line in the sand'.
Zero catches means no fishing in the North Sea.
The Commission's proposal sets out a package of measures which, if followed, is believed to allow the safe recovery of this valuable stock within five to ten years.
The Commission is not alone in this objective.
Yesterday's cod recovery proposal from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation also stated that: 'restoring cod to its historic level of abundance remains an important objective for fishermen, since a revitalised cod fishery would transform the economics of the whole demersal fishery'.
The Commission proposal attempts to achieve an absolute minimum size of stock, sets guidelines for setting total allowable catches (TACs), introduces fishing limitation through Kilowatt days and deals with the monitoring, inspection and control side of fisheries management
As rapporteur, I have tried to say to the Commission that all action must be taken to recover stocks.
We cannot use a one-size-fits-all approach across the areas covered by the plan.
We need a flexible approach based on scientific assessment allowing fishing to continue for other species.
Where it can be proved that fishing for other species in a particular area does not adversely affect cod recovery, fisheries should continue to be allowed and the concept of spatial management needs to be fully investigated.
On research, we need to look seriously at the interaction of cod and other commercial fish species such as haddock and whiting.
This evidence should involve fishermen as well as scientists.
The impact of industrial fisheries also requires a thorough investigation.
We constantly receive mixed messages on this issue and we need clarity.
Regional advisory councils are vital to the future of a sustainable EU fishing policy.
If we are going to be successful in our objectives of cod recovery, we must work with fishermen.
I was happy to see this week's Commission proposal providing a blueprint for these regional advisory councils and how they would work, with two thirds of the membership of these new organisations coming from those active in the fisheries sector.
I hope we will be able to improve dialogue and cooperation between all those concerned in order to secure a sustainable future for our industry.
On the socio-economic impact of these measures, the Commission's proposal does not go far enough.
Some of the communities most directly affected are in remote areas truly on the periphery of the European Union.
Parliament has already recognised the importance of the socio-economic issues in its resolution of March 2003.
To be fair, so too have some of the Member States.
The Scottish Executive has given GBP 50 million, with GBP 40 million for decommissioning and GBP 10 million for the direct socio-economic impact.
However, we have to be very clear that it is up to national and regional authorities to take up the possibilities available to them in assisting the sector during this difficult time.
I would like to see Member States carrying out socio-economic impact assessments on the recovery plan.
On the basis of these reports, we would better be able to assess the problems and to mitigate any negative effects.
I would like to see Member States having these in place one year after the implementation of this programme.
On fishing effort limitation, the principle of proportionality must apply.
The reference period used must take into consideration the pain the industry has already suffered through any decommissioning process.
On inspection control, we need to extend satellite vessel monitoring, as suggested by the House of Lords report of May 2003.
It seems a sensible measure and I welcome the fact that the Commission intends to come forward with a separate proposal on satellite monitoring.
In conclusion, the revised cod recovery plan will be painful for the fishing industry and dependent communities.
There is no point inflicting a lesser degree of pain or indeed any suffering at all if the measures implemented do not bring about the desired result.
Yet, if stock recovery is not achieved, the outcome will be increased socio-economic hardship in any event.
Successful recovery of the stock must be the priority.
What is needed is a package of measures which is both effective and minimises the pain to the sector.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I appreciate the Commissionâs proposed recovery plan for depleted cod stocks.
It means that the Commission is complying with its commitments under the common fisheries policy.
I also appreciate Mrs Stihlerâs work and her report, together with the cooperation that she and I have enjoyed, in my case as draftsmanof the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
That committeeâs amendment according to which the precautionary principle would lead to drastic measures being taken and to the Member States having the opportunity to take measures in addition to the common ones in order to protect and preserve stocks has been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, and that is something I am pleased about.
As we heard earlier, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) will tomorrow present its annual report on the fish stocks in our oceans.
Again, a total moratorium is recommended, which should make the doubters realise that measures really must be taken.
We know that the Council, which can no longer put its head in the sand, must take action and adopt this plan.
It is the fourth version that the Commission is presenting to the Council.
Even though I am satisfied with the Commissionâs proposal and believe that it is a move in the right direction, I should also like to have seen the Baltic Sea included, because we know that cod stocks are just as threatened there.
The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission has, moreover, come up with further plans, which sounded quite good in October.
I therefore withdrew my amendments concerning the Baltic Sea in the Committee on Fisheries.
At a later meeting in October, the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission deviated from its own principles concerning what should be done.
It is completely ignoring the scientific advice and states that the catch is 45% larger than what international advisers claim.
That is very serious.
Not taking the measures recommended by the international advisers is a waste of fisheries resources.
The advisers consist of 1Â 600 researchers from 19 countries, and not listening to these researchers constitutes a waste of what could be flourishing fishing communities and a flourishing industry.
In the Baltic Sea, we could have fished three times as much as we are doing today.
Take a genuinely sound decision here in the House now, as I hope will also be done by the Council and the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report and thank her for her hard work on this highly controversial issue.
As we have heard once again, the ICES has stated that cod stocks are in such a dire state of collapse that it is recommending the complete closure of the cod fishery in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the West of Scotland.
It claims that years of stringent conservation measures have failed to rebuild stocks and that only the total shutdown of these fishing grounds will enable any meaningful recovery.
Of course, we know from bitter experience, that when the scientists once again call for the complete closure of the cod fishery, they also mean the virtual closure of the haddock, whiting, plaice and prawn fisheries, where cod is caught as a by-catch.
Let me say this now to Commissioner Fischler and say it very clearly, because if there are any more cuts at the December Council meeting this year, it will spell the end of the UK white fish fleet.
And I do not mean any more drastic cuts like last year, I mean any more cuts at all.
The two previous massive decommissioning rounds have reduced the British white fish fleet by around 40%.
The harbour workers and ancillary staff who rely on the white fish fleet for a living are now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
Any further cuts will be fatal.
It would mean that, even if cod stocks ever do recover, there will be no UK fishermen there to catch them.
I do not intend to attack the scientists.
There is nothing to be gained from shooting the messenger, but this most recent ICES report once again highlights the vital importance of listening to the advice of the fishermen as well as to the boffins.
Last year scientists told us that haddock stocks were dwindling.
The fishermen said this was rubbish.
Now the scientists agree that there are an estimated 400 000 tonnes of haddock spawning stock biomass in the North Sea.
So who is right?
Could I in addition say that it appears the scientists are not listening to each other when arriving at their grand conclusions.
According to new scientific research from the respected Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation in Plymouth, which has been monitoring the North Sea for the last 70 years, stocks of cold water plankton, on which cod larvae feed, have been driven hundreds of miles to the north by an unprecedented rise in water temperatures.
This perhaps explains why there is a great abundance of cod being caught around the Faeroes, Iceland and Norway, but none left in the North Sea.
So for heaven's sake, let us start listening to the fishermen as well as the scientists.
The fishermen have a vested commercial interest in seeing cod stocks recover.
That is the only way we are going to get a decent living for our fishermen in the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists is glad that finally the Commission, in accordance with Parliamentâs request, is presenting a specific recovery plan for cod, separate from the recovery plan for hake, since, as we have always maintained, the situations of the respective stocks differ considerably.
As the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, points out, for three years the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has been saying that the cod populations in the North Sea and off the west of Scotland are in serious danger of total collapse.
The Socialist Group calls on the Commission to promote the best possible scientific opinions in order to provide knowledge at all times of the state of each resource in each fishing ground so that, on the basis of these rigorous scientific opinions, we can implement recovery plans, which may or may not involve drastic measures which â we must not forget â always lead to the scrapping of ships, unemployment for fishermen and other workers dependent on the fishing sector, and furthermore represent a serious blow for those European regions most dependent on fishing.
We therefore believe that the precautionary approach must be a residual criterion to be taken into account only when reliable and safe scientific opinions are not available, but under no circumstances must it replace these scientific opinions.
The fishing communities, as Mr Stevenson said a moment ago, demand a clear position, on the part of both the Commission and Parliament, in favour of prior, safe and well-founded scientific opinions, which take account of the sectorâs opinions and which, as well as the state of resources, calculate and evaluate the socio-economic consequences of the conservation measures, and we have been asking the Commission for this for a long time.
Over-fishing is a determining factor, but it is not the only cause of the problem of scarcity of resources.
Knowing the causes is essential if we want the recovery plans â this plan for cod and other future ones â to achieve their objectives, since if we restrict ourselves to reducing catches without tackling causes other than over-fishing â and I would mention the disruption of the food chain or sea pollution â we will perhaps find that the years will have passed and fish populations will not have increased.
We need to ascertain the effects on the cod populations in the Irish Sea and the North Sea of the extraction of more than a million tonnes of fish of species other than cod, but which are, however, a source of food for cod.
We also need to know the impact of industrial fishing on other populations of white fish, because that may perhaps provide the key to explaining the decline of cod and hake.
We want the Commission to investigate the causes of this collapse of the species.
We support the idea of a recovery plan which makes it possible to re-establish the stock and my group therefore supports the idea that the highest annual change, upwards or downwards, in any total allowable catch (TAC), should not exceed 15% after the first year of application of the recovery plan.
Â Â  Mr President, I begin by endorsing the points that colleagues have already made.
I would say that Mrs Stihler's very clear and comprehensive report improves on the Commission's proposal in three major respects.
Firstly, it introduces greater flexibility by allowing amendments to the geographical areas covered and by providing for additional Kilowatt days in response to appropriate technical measures.
Secondly, it calls for certain reports.
These are variously on the effects of industrial fishing, on the socio-economic impact of the regulation and on how far the regulation itself is achieving its objectives.
Thirdly, it seeks the close involvement of regional advisory councils.
The Commission's recent announcement of its proposal for establishing such bodies is welcome and we look forward to speedy progress in this regard.
These measures, together with the emphasis on constraints on fishing effort being proportionate between the Member States and on improved satellite monitoring, are essential if our beleaguered fishing communities are to engage with the regulation in any positive way.
We must, however, look beyond the regulation to other means of helping cod recovery and of moving to sustainable fisheries overall.
The Scottish Fishermen's Federation's proposals for spatial management deserve serious consideration in this regard.
Although the Scots are hardest hit, the impact is much wider, including the Irish, Danish and the Dutch, and we can learn from each other.
One example is the self-monitoring currently practised by the latter.
This again goes to show just how important a role regional advisory councils can play.
I hope that the House will support this report, which seeks to make the regulation far less of a blunt instrument than that fashioned by the original proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, my group supports the Commission's proposals.
It has been clear now for many years that cod needs to recover from the excessive pressures put on it by modern-day fishing.
Like many other species, stocks are far below sustainable levels, and this has led to massive socio-economic problems in coastal communities.
People are losing sight of the point here and putting the cart before the horse.
The socio-economic problems have arisen from an ecological problem.
If you tackle that you are tackling the socio-economic problems, instead of going at it in the opposite direction.
There has been over-fishing for many years because of the TACs being set too high, and, basically scientific advice has not been followed.
The Council has asked for a proposal for a recovery plan, which the Commission proposed in 2001, but the Council still does not seem to have the courage to adopt it.
This is the fourth attempt.
The proposal has many good ideas including: outlining conditions under which fishing can be permitted; rules for deciding about fishing, given various levels of stock abundance and also attempts to improve control and surveillance requirements and an initial management of the effort.
The ICES press release of Monday, which Mrs Stihler has already mentioned, shows that stocks are in grave danger.
This is a clear illustration of the danger of setting excessively high quotas, but this has been going on for years and it is still continuing.
Last year, several TACs were set higher than ICES advised.
The extreme example is the Irish Sea, with TACs set on average 28% above scientific advice over the past ten years.
Is it any wonder that stocks are actually in trouble?
ICES talks of drawing a line in the sand, but ministers and industry and many of the politicians even seem to be burying their heads in the sands, and this is the problem.
Ministers actually have to move away from this Luddite position of ignoring scientific advice and take the scientific advice on board.
It is claimed that the common fisheries policy is getting on to a sustainable basis as a result of the reform of 2002.
There have been some advances, such as better provision for control with improved cooperation among Member States and the possibility of effort limitation, in addition to classic limits on the amount of fish caught and recognition of the precautionary approach which is essential.
But it is not all good.
The MAGPs, which we will come back to later today, have disappeared and there is no further requirement for reduction.
This all sounds good on paper but it depends entirely on the political will to implement.
The Commission is making a sincere effort to improve things, and the Greens will, as usual, support the Commission.
However, there is a crucial level for the survival of the stocks.
But in the Irish Sea the Commission's proposal would allow fishing below a stock level of 6000 tonnes, whereas ICES is now advising closure until stocks reach that level.
It is vital that the Commission reflects ICES advice when recommending TACs for the next year on these stocks.
We can no longer ignore ICES.
Mrs Stihler has mentioned the situation in Canada.
That will happen here if we do not take a progressive position.
Â Â  Mr President, I take the opportunity offered by the Stihler report to remind the House that the common fisheries policy has evolved greatly over the last 20 years and is now a fully-fledged Community policy with specific objectives.
However, the draft of the future treaty contains no separate provisions relating specifically to the CFP.
In the conclusions of the Convention, fisheries policy has been downgraded to being a mere accessory of the common agricultural policy, instead of being openly acknowledged as having a distinct and separate existence.
I ask all my colleagues in this House to impress on their national governments the need to find a formula to rectify this, by defining the specific objectives of the common fisheries policy in the final version of the future treaty.
This is something that will not unravel anything, nor will it upset balances in the final outcome.
There is still time for this to be done.
'Where there is a will there is a way'.
I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her excellent report, which supports the main thrust of the Commission's plans, as would I or anyone who has the slightest interest in conservation.
Like Mrs Stihler, however, I believe there must be greater flexibility.
There must be far greater local participation in these decisions.
Member States and regional advisory councils must be able to propose alterations both to the geographical scope of the plan and the exact arrangements designed to reduce fishing efforts.
I say to the Commission: questions will be asked and answers sought if this recovery programme is used as some form of covert operation to introduce a secondary decommissioning programme.
Commissioner, will you please confirm to this House this morning that you will be proposing adequate compensation to offset some of the socio-economic effects of this proposal?
That is what my fishermen and fishermen from the remote communities of the periphery of Europe want to hear from you.
Why is it that the least culpable are bearing the brunt of these proposals and other proposals that emanate in the name of conservation?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, if we are to prevent North Sea cod from disappearing completely, a âsave the codâ campaign is urgently required.
The question is how.
In its definitive recovery plan for cod, the Commission introduces an effort limitation system.
This system has already been proving its worth in the Netherlands for a long time in the form of the âdays at seaâ system, a system that enables effective control of fishing pressure.
Nevertheless, the plan also has the inevitable drawbacks.
It only applies to vessels over tenÂ metres in length, even though shorter vessels do play a part in cod fishing.
The same goes for sport fishing.
Industrial fishing, which regularlyÂ makes large by-catches of cod, is even left virtually untouched.
The proportionality of the measures to be taken is unclear.
The recovery plan should be less of a hindrance to the activities of fishermen whose by-catches of cod are small than to those of fishermen whose contribution to the problem is comparatively great.
Incidentally, the impact of the various types of fishing can only be gauged accurately if the discards, too, are landed.
There is no proposal to do this.
Â Â  Mr President, it is fortunate that the Commission has finally come around to the idea of separating cod and hake, having initially intended to deal with the two species under the same recovery plan, which would not have allowed for an understanding of the characteristics specific to each of these two stocks.
The extremely drastic action that the Commission proposes for the long term âÂ five to ten yearsÂ â is based on a particularly alarmist diagnosis made by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).
Two types of consideration cast a serious shadow, however, over the scientific rigour and objectivity of this analysis.
The first is the failure to take account of the realistic observations made by the professionals, who claim that there has been a geographical shift of cod towards the northern part of the North Sea. This migration is attributed to the significant and undisputed warming of the waters.
Scientists have failed to study this phenomenon and instead concentrate solely on the size of fishermenâs catches.
