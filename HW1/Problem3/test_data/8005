On the agenda are the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy and the annual audit of the sustainable development programme.
These two go together.
Sustainable growth and competitiveness cannot be achieved without the highest possible levels of environmental and social protection.
The mid-term review of the sustainable development programme undertaken this year must see the creation of an ambitious strategy that reaches far into the future.
It should be directly linked to the Lisbon strategy and it should also serve to guide different policy areas within the European Union.
The spirit of Cardiff needs to be revived and we should examine the sustainability of the European Unionâs various policies more closely, confronting those factors that are leading in the direction of unsustainable development.
Special attention needs to be paid to energy production, transport, land use and agriculture.
New, more ambitious steps have to be taken to prevent climate change.
We must look ahead to the time after the Kyoto Protocol and achieve targets for the year 2020 that we can keep to and monitor.
We also have to put a price tag on sustainable development.
We have to estimate how much doing absolutely nothing will cost.
Now of course all attention is focused on what environmental protection measures will cost.
The European Union must continue to be the organisation that shows the way globally in environmental policy.
Ambitious legislation linked to the right means of financial control is also a good combination for creating demand for the new environmental technology.
Â Â  Mr President, in the referendum on the EU Constitution which was held in the Spanish state, the Basques and Catalans clearly confirmed that we wish to be fully involved in Europe.
Within the Hispanic map, the percentage of 'no' votes cast in Euskadi and Catalunya was three times as high as in Spain.
Europe must take account of this political reality, especially if the goal is to build a closer and stronger Europe that counts for all the people of Europe.
It would be very undemocratic to neglect the different realities that exist in Europe's stateless nations.
We cannot be so hypocritical as to claim plurality in Europe and deny it internally.
At a time when several Spanish MEPs have been complaining of alleged discrimination against the Castilian language, in the same period, Manuel MarÃ­n, the President of the Spanish Parliament, forbade a Catalan MP from speaking a few words of Catalan in his introductory remarks.
Different criteria cannot be applied to equivalent situations.
One cannot claim rights, justice or different standards of morality when in Europe and, on the other hand, insist on a pragmatic approach based on financial practicality when in Spain or Italy.
If we are truly committed to multilingualism, if we want the Castilian language to be used at all committee meetings, press conferences, etc, we must first be honest and safeguard everyone's linguistic rights, including those of the Catalans and Basques as well as, for example, the Welsh and Irish.
Â Â  â Mr President, as the President-in-Office of the Council said a short time ago, the spring European Council will focus mainly on the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon strategy, a strategy which is considered to have failed and to need review.
It needs review because the number of unemployed in Europe today has now reached 20Â million, with 70 million people at risk of poverty, wages paid to women are, on average, 16% lower than wages paid to men and real convergence has not therefore been achieved.
Unfortunately, Lisbon puts social policies in second place.
With the changes proposed to the Stability Pact and to the Lisbon strategy itself, the strategy cannot be made into a pro-grass roots strategy.
It is a paradox and it is absurd for us to talk about creating the most productive economy on the planet, on the one hand, and to want reductions in budgets and, hence, less cohesion, on the other.
Only with a series of radical measures, which also include increased resources for social growth, can the Lisbon strategy become a more pro-grass roots strategy.
Â Â  Mr President, before I move on to the Stability and Growth Pact, I would like to make a comment or two about the financial situation in general.
I am a little disappointed to see that Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, seems to have disappeared, because he is going to hear a comment from a representative of the United Kingdom, which is the second biggest contributor to European Union funds.
To date, we have contributed some GBP 180 billion.
We have received back around GBP 105 billion by way of subsidies of one form or another.
Well, we believe that very soon there is to be a general election in the United Kingdom, and I think the voters are going to want to know what has happened to that GBPÂ 75Â billion deficit in our contributions.
Is there going to be an answer from our current Prime Minister or Chancellor of the Exchequer?
Is there going to be an answer from this House?
When we remind them that the European Court of Auditors has, for the tenth year running, refused to sign the books because billions of pounds have gone missing, they might well put two and two together as regards what has happened to our 75Â billion.
Have we got a Stability and Growth Pact or not?
The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, recently said to reporters in Brussels: âI am beginning to seriously consider the option of not changing the Pact at allâ.
He added: âWe are not excluding the scenario of leaving the Pact as it is; that is now a distinct possibility.
I have no goal of replacing a Pact that does not work well with one that seems to function but goes wrong laterâ.
Previously he had said that the Pact was dead.
So what about this Stability and Growth Pact?
Is it not ludicrous that countries that run up a deficit of over 3% are then fined enormous sums of money, making their position worse?
Of course the Stability Pact is wrong.
It is useless!
Dump it!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council is going to deal with crucial reforms for the future of the European Union, including reform of the Stability Pact.
This reform is unfortunately enveloped in mystery.
In fact, we go from general news about a possible nineteen points to make the Pact more flexible to the possibility of leaving the Pact unchanged.
In that respect, all that remains is regret at the opportunity that Parliament has wasted through being unwilling for this Chamber to directly enter the debate on how to reform the Pact.
The President of Parliament and also the main political groups are to blame for that.
It seems that we are reaching a possible compromise, as usual, characterised by tactical manoeuvring and political balancing acts.
That is not what Europe needs right now.
Instead, it needs bolder and more pragmatic approaches to the key objectives for revitalising the economy, that is to say investment in research, innovation, competitiveness, infrastructure and structural reform.
That is also why I stress that I am baffled at the refusal by the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency to consider applying the so-called golden rule, which could have done a great deal to boost our economic growth.
We owe it above all to the younger generation to make a practical commitment to the future of our economy.
In that respect, we need a genuine Pact for young people.
The young need to be able to look forward to a future of stability, security and social cohesion, thanks to measures helping them to enter the workforce and to have access to credit, as well as measures directed towards the right to a home and a family.
To conclude, I believe that the European Union needs to make a strong commitment to guarantee effective opportunities for Europeâs younger generations.
That is what we are calling for, and that is what young people above all are expecting.
Â Â  Mr President, right now, it is not difficult to feel some sympathy with the Commission and the Council as they try to find a sensible solution to the problem of the Stability Pact.
They have become victims of the EUâs self-chastisement and self-imposed captivity.
This Stability Pact was brought into being for reasons that were very transparent, particularly in the case of Germany, which later turned out to be the country that had the greatest problems with it.
I think one of the lessons we ought to learn for the future is that rushing these things is not the way to get them done, for the damage is now greater than the former short-term benefit.
The whole thing is a virtual ruin and has precipitated another crisis of confidence in Europe.
For the sake of the young and of all those who still, with a certain euphoria, believe in Europe, I really do hope you will manage to cut this particular Gordian knot.
It will be very difficult, but a lot of trust has been lost â and it was that trust that the Stability Pact was originally intended to build.
So, quite seriously, I wish you every success at the forthcoming Council, and at it, may you succeed in getting this stumbling-block out of the European Unionâs way.
Â Â  Mr President, the Spring Council will no doubt be dominated by the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda.
This is a matter on which I have spoken on a number of occasions in recent weeks, and one that should be at the heart of the European agenda in the coming years.
I simply wish to emphasise the support of the European Democrats for strong action to reinvigorate that Agenda.
We want to see a stronger commitment by national governments to real and enduring economic reform.
The President of the Commission has our full support for an enterprising Europe, committed to growth and prosperity.
However, I also want to make it clear that we are concerned about some recent developments and emphasise the need for President Barroso not to weaken his stance on EU market liberalisation by in any way undermining the Services Directive, which is a fundamental part of the Lisbon Agenda that he himself redefined only recently.
There is also the Working Time Directive: it seems to me extraordinary that there are still politicians and governments who consider that a level playing field is one in which all EU Member States are equally uncompetitive.
It is fundamental to our vision of Europe that employers and workers should, as far as possible, decide on their own terms and conditions and working hours, and not have governments or the EU decide for them.
It goes against the whole spirit of economic liberalisation and flexibility that so many of us believe in.
The Council will be considering other matters too, including the international situation.
I wish to comment on one aspect of this: the reinvigoration of the transatlantic alliance.
The visit of the President of the United States to Europe last month heralded a new chapter in the world's most important geopolitical partnership.
There is a real prospect now of a fresh start to that relationship, which is crucial for world security.
Some recent comments, including those by the German Chancellor, are of great importance and need to be taken seriously.
His implication that NATO was no longer the pre-eminent vehicle for military defence is an issue which I feel needs to be further examined and about which I am concerned.
If Europe wants to be a serious partner alongside the United States in the fight against terrorism and the spread of WMD, then it must work more closely with our American friends.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to say something about the Stability and Growth Pact, because it is regrettable that the ECOFIN Council failed to reach agreement on it earlier this week.
I hope, and very much trust, that Mr Juncker, who will attend both this extra ECOFIN meeting and the summit, will be able to carry on his work.
Indeed, it is with sorrow that I look upon the Pactâs reform being turned into a .
I fear that it will be reduced to common horse trading between Member States, particularly the large ones, something we have experienced all too often in the past.
It is time our Heads of State or Government displayed real vision and leadership.
My group has indicated many times that it is in favour of the Pact being reformed, which would result in growth, without putting the euroâs stability at risk, and so I think it would be useful if a quality assessment were to be made of Member State budget spending.
This was borne out this morning during the discussion of the Lisbon strategy.
In Europe, there is too little investment in the education and research that will enable it to become the competitive knowledge economy we desperately aspire to be.
The Pact should not obstruct us in those endeavours.
In industry, businesses would be out of the running if they failed to invest in the future.
I should, however, add that in industry, investments are not written off over one year.
So why do we do this in the Pact?
What is stopping us from applying a longer depreciation period to the Lisbon investments too?
This would involve a change to the substance, which would create space without putting discipline at risk.
Another change that must be made is for us to start thinking more along European lines.
It is wholly acceptable that government influence should impact on the economy, provided that it is done at European, rather than national, level.
It seems that the leaders at the summit predominantly want to create a catalogue of excuses which will help them escape discipline and which they can use for all possible kinds of policy.
My group favours a strong role for the Commission and considers that the rules of the game and the assessments should be drafted jointly, from a European perspective.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to ask the Council what happened to Gothenburg and what now remains of Gothenburg, because in my view the answer is: very little.
If the Council had stuck to its commitments, it would not be looking, as you did this morning and again this evening, for a new impetus to dispel Euro-pessimism, because Gothenburg showed the way and gave new hope by proposing that each year, in spring, a special summit should be held to track the progress made on sustainable development; Mrs WallstrÃ¶m knows what I am referring to.
What have you done with the enthusiasm of Gothenburg to face up to the new threats and challenges worrying our fellow Europeans?
What are your innovative, compelling and concrete plans to combat climate change and to counter the decline in biodiversity?
In four years, what progress has been achieved and where are we with social harmonisation?
Where are we with European public services?
In my view, you have distorted the objectives of the spring summits which were supposed to provide a response to all those questions and bring about a refocusing of policy.
And now you are asking for a charter on the new criteria!
MrÂ President, these criteria exist, and you have cast them aside, perhaps because they were too limiting, too troublesome.
What about the biodiversity criterion, for instance: has the Commission kicked it into the long grass?
There is no need, MrÂ President, to go on reinventing the wheel day after day.
Get back to the spirit of Gothenburg; restore this innovative project to its place at the heart of the spring summits, an innovative project long-awaited by our fellow citizens and which will pull Europe out of its state of stagnation.
Â Â  â Mr President, the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy does not set new objectives; it repositions so that it can become more competitive with the United States.
It calls for closer cooperation and coordination between governments and for them to be monitored, in order to overcome delays caused by their opposition.
Consequently, new storms against grass-roots incomes and other grass-roots achievements are brewing at the spring Council.
This is guaranteed by the final outcome of the first five years' application of the Lisbon strategy, with increased poverty, unemployment, inequality, uncertainty for workers and greater wealth for the oligarchy.
The leaders of the Member States will decide to proceed more aggressively and at a faster pace in making industrial relations more flexible, in cutting workers' incomes and grass-roots rights, with a new insurance system, with full liberalisation of the market and with across-the-board privatisations.
At the same time, they will take decisions which will speed up the political and military presence of the European Union in more countries and they will seal the joint front of the United States and the European Union in the war against the peoples.
These are measures which reduce social and employment rights in order to increase the profitability of European capital.
This is the mediaeval working environment which they are preparing, this is the policy of the European Union and its parties.
They are calling on the workers to make sacrifices in order to make their lives worse.
However, there are also sacrifices with the prospect of a better life, by which I mean the organised fight against the barbarity and exploitation of the European Union and the governments.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, the forthcoming Spring European Council has two main topics: the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and the review of the Lisbon Strategy.
Looking beyond the current compromises, inevitable hypocrisies and tiresome tactical manoeuvring between those who want rigour and those who want flexibility, between grasshoppers and ants, the essence of the debate on the Stability and Growth Pact still remains the golden rule, or how to introduce flexibility into the budget rules honourably, without resorting to opportunistic or artful means.
The compromise that is emerging appears to be useful, but it will not solve everything.
A golden rule applied will do little for development, while it is liable to lose us our credibility and reputation.
A clear strategy of deficit spending on objectives at a European level would be more useful, but we are probably not yet mature enough to make that kind of choice.
The same may be said for the review of the Lisbon Strategy.
Redefining the objectives will be of little use if the toolkit still consists of subsidiarity, open coordination, peer pressure and moral persuasion, particularly during a slump.
What is needed are direct-action instruments, such as European action plans, but we are not yet mature enough for those either.
I feel, therefore, that we need maturity in order to have more Europe, that is to say in order to be able to decide once and for all what kind of economic constitution we want for our Europe, over and above our selfish national interests.
The challenges of globalisation really do not leave us much time any more.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the stalemate that has been created in recent days over the review of the Stability and Growth Pact shows that we have to learn how to manage flexibility.
The long list of major exceptions prepared by the Luxembourg Presidency, which would allow the deficit reference figure to be exceeded on a temporary basis, has obviously opened up a Pandoraâs box of national requests.
If we continue like this, nothing will be achieved and we will resign ourselves to keeping the Pact as it is, as something more or less nonsensical.
Instead, we need to follow the obvious path of having a single important exception, allowing the possibility of derogation only for precise, circumscribed European initiatives in the areas of training, research and major physical and intangible infrastructure networks.
We therefore need to tie any flexibility in the Pact to real European added value through investment.
The experience of recent days also teaches us that the Unionâs economic policies need to be properly coordinated.
I have the impression, however, that the Member Statesâ governments are adopting a strategy of slowly and gently weakening the Commissionâs role.
We shall probably also be able to see this during the debate on the Financial Perspectives in June, when it is not difficult to foresee a fresh attack on the credibility of the Community aspect of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish the European Council every success in its review of the Lisbon Strategy.
A decisive effort is needed to boost competitiveness not only through good programmes but also in real economic activities, because sustainable development and more jobs can result only from more growth.
We also need to enhance the credibility of this Union for entrepreneurs as well as citizens at large.
Not only the governments but also these people need to be motivated to contribute actively to achieving the Lisbon goals.
One solution lies in opening up the EU market in services.
If we really intend to enhance efficiency and motivation, then we must open up without further delay.
This could prove to be one of the most important and productive reforms of this organisation.
Conversely, watering down the Services Directive could deliver a devastating blow to the principles of equality and solidarity.
It was said in this Chamber today that free movement of goods and capital without free movement of services is nonsense.
In this context, the country-of-origin principle must be seen as an inseparable part of the directive.
I really hope that the new Commission will not weaken its stand on EU market liberalisation.
Instead of waging battles to further conserve the present unequal status quo, we should concentrate on the benefits that free competition would bring to all of us, both old and new Member States, and benefits there clearly are!
I hope that the European Council will show enough political will to make our citizens believe that Member States are serious about creating the conditions for dynamic growth.
This will also be a test for the EUâs solidarity.
Â Â  I would like to contribute to this debate as a Member representing a newly acceded country, and for whom the question of a social Europe is especially important.
We all of us know how great the difference in the standard of living is between the newly acceded and the older Member States.
We also know that this difference is unacceptable, and we must strive to eliminate it.
Among other things, the Lisbon Strategy was one of the most important guideline documents for us at the time of accession.
It was hugely attractive that we could be members of a Europe which could envisage as a target increasing economic competitiveness, job creation and at the same time the spreading of the values of a social Europe across the whole of Europe.
That set of views which sets growing economic competitiveness as a priority yet sees social dimensions as less important is not acceptable to the newly acceded Member States, where more than a third of the population lives in poverty.
It is true that the best way to fight poverty is to increase economic competitiveness and job creation, but this must be tightly linked to social cohesion, education, research and development, and protection of the environment.
Social questions belong among the responsibilities of Member States, but appropriate coordination among institutions at Union level is vital.
We cannot accept that we live in brutal market economies we must strive to bring about a socially sensitive Europe.
Â Â  It is true that the European Council will focus on the Lisbon Strategy and on the Stability Pact.
Let us admit, though, that in the background of this discussion, there will also be the question related to the financial perspectives that is linked to Lisbon and the Stability Pact â because in the end it is the financial means that the European Union will have for the coming years, which will determine whether and to what degree, we will be able to put into practice the vision of Europe to which Mr Barroso referred.
This is where we have to remember that the new Member States still have a low standard of living when compared to the European average and, despite this, are still expected to implement the reforms required by the Lisbon strategy as well as by the Stability Pact.
We also have to keep in mind that the new countries are experiencing a certain degree of tiredness, a certain fatigue, from the continuous reform process.
It is enough to say that they have been undergoing a reform process for a number of years â first to prepare to join the European Union and, now that they have joined, they are facing more reforms, this time having more of a budgetary and fiscal nature to prepare for the introduction of the Euro.
As if this were not enough, we now have the reforms needed by the reform strategy, which amounts to a non-stop reform process.
This does not mean that the reform process should be stopped.
Far be it from this case.
It means, however, that there is a need for the new countries to feel that they are not being left alone on this road; to the contrary, they should feel that there is somebody helping them.
This is exactly what the cohesion policy of the European Union could do, and this is why the financial resources that the European Union will have in the coming years will determine whether we really want the new Member States to be really integrated; if we really do want them to adopt the Euro and expand their economic development and create jobs as the Lisbon Strategy is telling us to do.
As Mr Barroso himself said, you cannot have more Europe with less money.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, any German in this House will find it particularly difficult to talk about the forthcoming Council and the Stability and Growth Pact, for you know how hard the Germans found it to abandon the Deutschmark.
The only way in which the German public could be persuaded to part with the Deutschmark was with the explicit promise that there would be a Stability and Growth Pact that would draw on the tradition of the Deutschmark and maintain the currencyâs long-term stability.
Of course, it is particularly problematic when, out of all the Member States, it is the larger ones, such as Germany and France, who, having compelled the smaller countries â including those in southern Europe â to accept this Pact, themselves breach it, breaking its rules and even altering it when they get into difficulties.
For that reason, I can only encourage the Luxembourg presidency to stick to its guns at the summit, and urge all the other members of the Council to do likewise.
Altering the Pact is certainly worth thinking about; here in this House, we have heard important arguments as to why it can be applied in different ways at certain stages.
The worst option, though, is to alter the Pact precisely when one has oneself broken the rules and got away scot-free, and so the sixteen-point list that Mr Juncker has put forward is the right way to go about reforming it.
Our position on this issue is that the Commissionâs hand must be strengthened, and it must continue to be a player.
It cannot be for the Member States to decide when and where this or that special rule should apply where the Stability Pact is concerned.
What the European Council should bear in mind, when coming to its conclusions on 22 and 23 March, is that the Commission must be put in a stronger position, and that there are several changes we can talk about.
As this Council is meeting in a special international situation, let me add the final comment that, in the Middle East, among our Mediterranean neighbours, a lot of things are in a state of flux.
There too, it is important that we should be alongside the democrats and supporting human rights.
For that reason, I would like to see this Council â in contrast to what we in this House have heard from it so far â send, by the way it votes, a clear message concerning the activities of terrorists, of Hezbollah, and everything associated with them.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that the debate on the Stability and Growth Pact has shown that there is a genuine need for action.
I was struck, in particular, by the comments of the last speaker, who gave us an encouraging message.
It would be extremely serious if the European Union, on an issue like the Stability and Growth Pact, should see divisions, for instance, between old and new members.
I view that as something very dangerous.
We must approach reform of the Stability Pact in a spirit which is also one of solidarity.
Any division would, in my view, be extremely harmful and dangerous.
I should also like to return to an idea which was mentioned, in particular, by the last speaker, namely the importance of the institutional aspect.
We must not weaken the Commission or the Commission's role in managing the Stability Pact, and there is no question as far as the Presidency is concerned of somehow withdrawing the Commission from its role in the area of budgetary surveillance.
Thus, this aspect appears particularly important.
The Presidencyâs proposals, on which agreement has still to be reached, clearly tend to introduce greater flexibility, because in some quarters greater flexibility is required.
However, at the same time, they aim to create a more precise framework specifically to enable the deficit to be assessed.
One deficit is not the same as another.
I believe we are all sufficiently familiar with economic rules and laws to know that no two deficits are necessarily identical in nature.
A deficit caused by consumer spending should not be considered as being identical to one resulting from productive investment, from investment in the future.
I therefore believe that this is the framework which the Presidency would like to create, to enable a more precise assessment to be made, avoiding any risk of arbitrariness.
Next, I believe the pact has to be more closely related to economic cycles, and that it should still be possible to modify any instrument of economic policy in the light of experience.
The rules adopted should be able to withstand the test of reality.
When they are tested against reality, we may have to conclude, where necessary, that the rules are perhaps not always totally appropriate.
Adapting the pact does not mean that deficits will be allowed to increase in the future.
Those who think that deficits could be allowed to run unchecked without consequences are wrong, because deficits spiralling out of control would very quickly be punished by rising interest rates, which would have an impact on the investment urgently needed in Europe.
We have also discussed the Lisbon strategy at length this morning â a strategy based, inter alia, on investment.
It is clear, therefore, that we cannot recommend, on the one hand, a strategy based on investment and, on the other, encourage practices which would lead to an increase in interest rates, providing a disincentive to that very same investment.
I believe that what we want is to have rules which are complied with â rules which can be respected by everyone; and so that everyone can comply with them, certain economic and political realities need to be taken into account.
Without wishing to refer to any one country in particular, although one has already been mentioned, we have to acknowledge that some countries have experienced fairly exceptional events, and it would not be acceptable for such exceptional factors not to be taken into account, to some degree.
Turning to sustainable development, I can say to MrsÂ Isler-BÃ©guin that we have firmly insisted on maintaining the environmental dimension in the Lisbon strategy â not only on maintaining it but also genuinely incorporating it in all policies right across the board.
Sustainable development cannot just be bolted on.
It is something which must inspire the whole range of policies, and all policies must be assessed against a yardstick of sustainable development.
Therefore, I do not believe that the Presidency is trying to neglect Gothenburg or consign it to oblivion.
We continue to regard the strategy of sustainable development as fully valid.
We recommend a horizontal approach to all environmental policy, as already set out in the Treaty and in the draft Constitution.
On this point, we believe that a charter could be useful because it would give us a certain number of guiding principles to be followed when implementing the various policies.
Finally, with regard to Kyoto, the Presidency is extremely keen to develop the Kyoto follow-up, and if there is sustainable development dimension, I believe it is based, in particular, on this aspect, namely preparing for the follow-up to Kyoto.
On this point, the Presidency would like the European Union to take a lead, to be at the leading edge of progress and to have a key role in the defence of the planet.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their valuable contributions to this debate and also for their concrete ideas.
This debate has shown the need for a coherent and consistent approach.
We must ensure that the policies on the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy go hand in hand.
During the debate this morning on the Lisbon Strategy you also made the point that the very concrete proposals we have been discussing for some time must uphold this balance.
We shall do all this in the European way, which is to ensure that the creation of growth and jobs does not happen at the expense of over-using natural resources or of social policy.
We must ensure that our policies include all three of those elements and that they reinforce one another.
Climate change is one example, as it is not only an environmental issue but also one with enormous economic and social consequences, meaning that our policies have to be designed accordingly.
This is exactly what incorporating the dimension of sustainable development is all about.
It brings the future and the rest of the world into the frame as well.
I wish to thank all those who have raised issues concerning the Lisbon Strategy and assure them that the Commission will take due note of all these issues.
Mr Bonde was the only person who said he was very happy.
I am glad he is happy, because his comments related to openness and transparency, which are things very close to my heart too.
I would remind you that we have enhanced transparency as regards expert groups in the context of negotiations on the framework agreement.
There is a new article on expert groups, and a list of the expert groups, their composition, activities, agendas and documents will be made available.
That is important.
Unfortunately, while some members of that Group put difficult questions, they have not stayed long enough to hear the responses as regards, for example, the Stability Pact, which is another important issue.
We sometimes seem to lose sight of what has been achieved through the Stability Pact.
Just a few years ago, the economic situation in Europe was totally different.
The Pact has helped us to re-establish financial stability in Europe and enabled us to cooperate rather than to drive our currencies against each other.
This is an important point which should not be forgotten.
At the same time, if we are prepared to increase the flexibility of our rules, we also need to take steps to improve the quality of our cooperation at European Union level.
The euro has brought our economies closer together, and national economic policies have become a common concern.
If we want to maintain a meaningful fiscal surveillance system then we should also strengthen our institutional settings and provide greater incentives for cooperation and sound fiscal policies in Europe.
The Commission will continue to work in a constructive way with the Luxembourg Presidency to ensure it is possible for the necessary changes to be made, to modernise and to harness the progress made to reinforce our other policies.
Thank you for the contributions to the debate on the Stability Pact, which the Commission considers does not need re-writing, but to be interpreted in a way that guarantees its effectiveness and credibility.
The Commission will look into the details of creating a charter for sustainable development, which must include very concrete policies and actions.
Indeed, nothing of what has been said about the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy or sustainable development will lead anywhere unless we start to take action.
The overall challenge for us is one of implementation: to maintain consensus, ensure best use of governance and secure the support of European citizens for what we are doing.
Those three issues must guide us in ensuring a successful summit meeting and, hopefully, successful implementation of what has been discussed today.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on health workers detained in Libya.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on the question of the health workers detained in Libya, the Council is extremely concerned for the safety of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor condemned to death on 6Â May 2004.
Throughout recent years, the Council has been keeping a very close watch on their trial.
It has intervened on a number of occasions with the Libyan authorities at the highest level, to ensure, in particular, that they were given a fair and equitable trial, especially in view of the fact that Professors Montanier and Collezzi in their final report on the HIV virus infection in Benghazi hospital had concluded that the five nurses and the doctor were innocent.
In all its actions, the Council has always worked in close cooperation with the Bulgarian authorities and has had the support of other international partners.
Bulgaria has thanked the European Union for what it has done.
I met the Bulgarian Foreign Minister yesterday to discuss this matter with him once again.
Bulgaria can count upon the Councilâs help in the future in seeking a positive outcome to this matter.
To this end, the Commission has joined with the Council so that the European Union can act in close coordination.
Irrespective of the question of responsibility for the contamination in Benghazi hospital, it is clear that the issue has aroused strong feelings, particularly among the victimsâ families, but also among the population generally.
This is why the Council has expressed its profound sympathy with the people infected with the virus at Benghazi hospital.
It has stated its readiness to show its solidarity by a humanitarian gesture on their behalf.
An action plan drawn up by the Commission is accordingly being implemented at present.
The Council now awaits a gesture from Libya.
At its meeting on 11 October 2004, the Council invited Libya to make a positive response to the European Unionâs proposed policy of engagement.
In this context, the Council insisted that Libya should meet the European Unionâs concerns, particularly on the question of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical personnel.
The Council feels that a review of the evidence will lead Libya to conclude that a rapid release of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor would be in the best interests of justice.
The Presidency assures the European Parliament that the Council will continue to treat this as a matter of high priority and will do everything in its power, in close coordination with the Bulgarian authorities, but respecting the rights of the authorities concerned, to reach the only positive outcome possible in this matter, namely the release of those sentenced.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the very difficult issue of the health professionals detained in Libya, which indeed casts a shadow over international relations with that country.
In order to fully address this issue, it is necessary to widen the scope of the discussion to also address the issue of the families in Benghazi affected by the mass HIV infection.
The Commission considers these to be two separate dramas, but they have been linked by the verdict pronounced in May 2004 against the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff currently detained in Libya.
I shall first address the issue of the Benghazi families.
They are confronted with this infection which, either directly or indirectly, has affected many people.
We have recently been reminded again of this tragedy by the recent deaths of some of the children and adults affected.
The EU has a deep understanding of the serious consequences of the kind of large-scale accidental infection that affected Benghazi.
Having faced similar tragedies in European countries, we have developed programmes to alleviate the effects of such tragedies and a system to prevent similar outbreaks from reoccurring.
We can use this extensive experience to help the Libyan authorities deal with this situation and contribute to alleviating the plight of the stricken families in Benghazi.
On numerous occasions the Commission and the EU have expressed their utmost compassion and solidarity as regards the situation in Benghazi.
On the basis of a technical assessment carried out by the Commission in August 2004 and endorsed by the Council, the EU is now implementing an action plan aimed at addressing some of the issues faced by the Bengahzi families and also at enhancing capacities in the health sector in Libya.
The implementation of this action plan is an act of solidarity aimed at expressing EU compassion by addressing specific identified needs in Libya.
It is the responsibility of all of us to make sure that the action plan is implemented rapidly, completely and efficiently.
In November 2004, the Commission organised an international meeting to launch the action plan and it is working closely with the Gaddafi Foundation to implement it.
Success will depend on contributions by various public and private donors from the international community.
I shall now address the issue of the five Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff detained in Libya since 1999.
The EU has repeatedly expressed serious reservations over the basis on which the trial was conducted, the treatment of the defendants, and delays in the process.
It therefore came as a great disappointment and a source of concern when last May they were condemned to death on grounds that remain, in the Commission's view, unclear and unsatisfactory.
Immediately after the verdict was pronounced, the EU and the Commission emphasised the importance we attach to a satisfactory and just outcome of the trial, and requested a reconsideration.
An appeal process will soon be examined by the Libyan Supreme Court.
The Commission has remained involved in working with the Libyan authorities to reach a satisfactory outcome to this issue.
The EU made two formal approaches, at Prime Ministerial level, on 12 June and 27 June 2004.
On 3 October 2004, a Commission official visited the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff to express its support for the detainees and to convey its concerns to the Libyan authorities.
On 11 October 2004, the Council again expressed its grave concern over the plight of the medical workers and asked Libya to consider the release of the medical staff on the basis of a re-examination of the existing evidence.
The Commission will continue to attach high priority to this dramatic issue and is constantly seeking ways to contribute to a positive outcome.
It will remain in contact with the Libyan authorities, the Gaddafi Foundation and the Bulgarian authorities.
I am convinced that all those concerned would like to turn the page on this tragedy as soon as possible.
On the basis of the existing evidence, that is what must be done.
At the same time, we will continue to focus on ways of alleviating the suffering of the Benghazi families and of helping the Libyan authorities build systems that will prevent a repetition of this contamination.
The EU has decided to embark upon a policy of engagement with Libya and has already given considerable recognition to the significant steps taken by Libya to secure reintegration into the international community.
Libya has been invited to move towards formal relations with the EU as a Mediterranean partner and as a close neighbour.
In this context, the issue of the medical workers remains a serious problem and one which, as Libya understands very well, needs to be brought to an acceptable end.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Frattini for their very helpful statements.
There is a double tragedy taking place in Libya at the moment.
On the one hand there is the awful plight of hundreds of children in Benghazi infected by the HIV virus.
We have the most enormous sympathy for them.
I very much welcome the decision of the European Union's General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 October 2004 to provide assistance to the Libyan health services.
This includes medical equipment and help in establishing a reliable and safe blood bank.
The other, quite separate tragedy is that since 1999 â for over five years now â Bulgarian medical workers have been imprisoned by the Libyan authorities on charges allegedly related to the HIV infection.
This situation was dramatically worsened on 6 May last year when a Libyan court sentenced the Bulgarian nurses to death by firing squad.
The most reputable international experts have testified that the problem of HIV infection was due to an in-hospital infection, which began over a year before the Bulgarians were hired by the Benghazi hospital.
There are no good grounds for the imprisonment of the Bulgarian nurses.
They should be released immediately.
This is what the declaration of this Parliament, already signed by over 100 Members, is calling for.
We ask the highest Libyan authorities to intervene in this matter, above all on grounds of natural justice and humanity.
There is also a very practical reason why this should happen.
Over the past year, important steps have been taken to improve the relationship between the European Union and Libya.
This has come about because of a number of very sensible decisions taken by the Libyan authorities to dismantle the Libyan WMD programme and to compensate victims of terrorist attacks in which Libya had been implicated.
The overall objective of EU engagement is Libya's full integration in the Barcelona process and subsequent progress towards an association agreement.
This will not happen without further action on the part of Libya to meet our concerns.
The most immediate of these concerns is the plight of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical workers.
We ask President Gaddafi to release them now.
Â Â  , . Mr President, like other speakers, my heart goes out to the 400 children who have been infected by HIV and to the parents of the 40 children who have tragically died.
I very much welcome the action programme that the Commissioner has outlined today.
We should do everything possible to assist the Libyan people.
However, the treatment by the Libyan authorities of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian medical worker makes it very hard to take seriously Libyaâs proclaimed desire to rehabilitate itself within the international community.
We should remind ourselves that those people were in Libya to assist the Libyans; to provide better healthcare for Libyans.
They have become scapegoats for the inadequacies of the Libyan health service.
It is clear that the infection at the hospital, as indicated by Mr Van Orden, already existed.
It was spread because of poor hygiene and because of the re-use of needles.
A number of experts has testified that the nature of that contamination makes it almost inconceivable that it was spread deliberately.
Rather than simply facing up to the facts, the Libyans have turned tragedy into a further tragedy and into a farce.
First, they tried to blame the CIA and the Israeli intelligence services, saying it was a conspiracy to undermine Libya.
Now, they have blamed the innocent Bulgarian nurses, at least some of whom were tortured before being tried; the trial was clearly unfair and not properly conducted.
I very much support what the Council has said and would ask it to continue to pressurise the Libyan Government to come to its senses, to release these people and to become a normal part of the international community.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am pleased that we are having this debate, which was instigated by the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
The situation of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor is truly a nightmare.
For six long years, these people â who have devoted their lives to saving lives and caring for their fellow human beings â have languished in prison in Libya in loathsome conditions.
The situation is Kafkaesque.
The charges against them are unfounded, as researchers have shown.
On 29 March, a court is finally to make a pronouncement on the death sentences against these six people, and this date is therefore incredibly critical.
The EU must do everything in its power to secure the immediate release of those concerned.
In just a few yearsâ time, Bulgaria will be a member of the EU.
We therefore have a responsibility to these citizens.
In our work on a gradual rapprochement between the EU and Libya within the context of the Barcelona Process, this case is a critical test of the direction that relations between us may take.
If the death sentences are carried out, I believe that any future cooperation will be made impossible.
At the same time, it is, of course, a terrible tragedy for the children who have been infected with AIDS and their families.
The EU can do more.
I am very pleased that the Commissioner supports the action plan and sees opportunities for the EU to support Libya in this way so that better care might be obtained in future for those infected with HIV.
Mr President, this is an incredibly important issue.
We expect the Council and the Commission to give it priority and to follow events extremely carefully in the period up to 29 March when the court once again pronounces on the case.
Â Â  We support the European Unionâs agreements with Libya, concerning the HIV epidemic, and we urge the immediate implementation of the action plans which sparked our solidarity with sufferers from the epidemic in the Benghazi hospital [and I thank the Commission for this package of intervention plans].
Before anything else I would like to express our concerns in connection with the situation of the Bulgarian and Palestinian health workers.
Six years ago they came under suspicion, were arrested, and were condemned to death.
We were not the first to become involved in the affair, since successive presidencies of the Commission and the Council have dealt with the matter in their sittings.
But again we must emphasise that the death penalty falls outside the values and fundamental principles of the European Union, and carrying out these death penalties would nullify the normalisation of relations between the European Union and Libya.
We hope that Libya reacts positively to the EUâs efforts and labours to advance long-term, close cooperation.
In light of this we hope there will be swift progress in this affair, and nothing other than a fair appeal hearing.
Delaying justice is nothing other than a repudiation of justice.
Because of this we call on Libya to respond to our concerns at the earliest possible date, and we ask the Council that they initiate a re-examination of the affair.
Â Â  Mr President, the standards of medical practice and care in Libya leave a lot to be desired.
There is a lack of local medical staff, medical expertise and training, as well as of proper medical facilities and equipment.
The problem is more prominent in large, overcrowded city hospitals serving largely poor, underdeveloped urban areas, like the Al Fatah Hospital in Benghazi.
It was in that hospital, back in 1998, that an outbreak of HIV infection was discovered, affecting approximately 400 children.
That outbreak was no surprise to western experts as they knew that the hygiene conditions in that hospital were abysmal and that it was only a matter of time before such a major infection catastrophe occurred.
The Libyan Government needed a scapegoat, which was found in the form of five nurses from Bulgaria and one doctor from Palestine.
In countries like Libya, getting signed confessions under torture and setting up staged trials is no difficult task.
While the international community stood back and watched, these six medical workers, who went to Libya in order to offer their services for the benefit of the Libyan people, were sentenced to death in 2004.
They were found guilty of the ludicrous charge of deliberately infecting the children in the Benghazi hospital with HIV.
It was alleged by Colonel Gaddafi himself that they did this as part of a CIA and Mossad plot to destabilise the country.
How can the situation now be remedied?
First of all, the EU must take concrete action.
I propose the following three steps.
Firstly, the President of the European Parliament should request the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to send a small delegation immediately to visit the imprisoned medical workers in Libya and to see Colonel Gaddafi and convey to him the strong wish of Parliament that these medical workers are pardoned and released immediately.
Secondly, the EU, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation, should immediately send a team of medical experts to Libya to assess the situation in relation to the HIV epidemic in the country and offer expert advice and help to deal with the problem.
Thirdly, the EU should take further drastic initiatives in order quickly to lead Libya out of the isolation imposed by the western world from 1992 to 2003.
Such actions, if effective, would be of mutual benefit to the EU in terms of trade enhancement, and to the people of Libya in terms of improving their standard of living.
Â Â  I do not think, Commissioner, that you need to be lectured about what needs to be done; I believe that you identified the right target when speaking about the strategy that needs to be used.
Kindly allow me to say such things as a person living in a country â I live in Malta â which is Libyaâs neighbour, just forty-five minutes away from their coast.
In my opinion, as a person who visits Libya frequently â and who knows the Libyan mentality, as it is in these countries â the point, the key to the solution, is direct contact with the people, direct contact especially with the relatives of the victims.
These people are experiencing a major tragedy.
I pronounce it as a clear statement â I am against any death penalty, be it in Libya, in the United States or in any other country of the world.
However, the key to everything is found in the victimsâ relatives and the work that needs to be done in general, in my opinion, with regards to the Libyan health system, but in a particular manner, also socially and psychologically with these families.
We have to remember that AIDS victims in certain countries â even, I believe, in Europe, but particularly in certain other countries â are highly stigmatised.
That means these people have already experienced the death of a relative, in many cases their son or daughter, they have experienced a big shock, and believe, and I say unfairly, that it is these five persons that killed their children and are experiencing this stigma.
Secondly, where a Court confirms these peopleâs guilt but changes their sentence, I believe that there has to be consideration of the idea, by both the Council as well as the Commission, of prisoner exchange, as long as the prisoners within the Member States of the European Union are willing, are ready, to serve their prison sentence in Libya.
I think that this is part of the solution for the things that could happen.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I think there is little to add to my previous comments and to the various points raised by Members of Parliament.
I agree fully with MrÂ Muscat.
We are indeed dealing with a genuine tragedy.
The problem of the infection of children with the AIDS virus, particularly in a country like Libya where AIDS is even more of a taboo subject than in most of our own countries, affects both individual families and the entire population.
I believe we also need to make efforts in this area.
We have to offer our help to Libya â this is now being prepared and implemented â in its fight against AIDS, and in order to improve its healthcare system so that it can, at least, cope with this tragedy which is affecting the people concerned.
Beyond that, we also need to send a very strong and clear signal to Libya and bring a degree of pressure to bear for justice to be done and for the health workers concerned to be released.
Libya wishes to develop and strengthen its relations with the European Union.
It cannot do so as long as it continues to persist in its determination to do nothing for these five or six people unjustly condemned to death.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to make two brief concluding remarks.
The European Union has very clearly held out the prospect of a Mediterranean partnership to Libya.
We have put forward a number of objectives, some of which have already been achieved, such as the ending of the embargo, while others are still to happen, such as full adoption of the .
Bulgaria is about to sign the treaty of accession to the EU, and Libya is well aware that the case of the six Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor is politically highly sensitive in Europe.
The Libyan authorities also know that the decision on whether it can join the Barcelona process will be made by unanimous vote at the forthcoming European Council, at which Bulgaria and Romania have the right to take part and to speak, even if they cannot vote.
Europe will continue to maintain direct contacts with Libya, including visits to the Benghazi families.
I share the view of a number of Members that we must show our solidarity with the civilian population in Libya that has been hit by the AIDS infection.
Our visits to the detained health workers will, of course, continue, and in this respect I hope that the Libyan Government will continue to authorise the prison visits without attaching any conditions.
Lastly, I can assure you that the Commissionâs action plan will continue.
We shall keep up our positive efforts with regard to Libya, which we consider an essential partner in the Mediterranean, and we shall work to improve the state of public services for the citizens â of which health is just one example â as a practical demonstration of how relations with Europe can be of real added value to Libya.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0019/2005).
We will be taking a series of questions to the Council.
Â Â  Madam President, the Council agrees with MrÂ Posselt that the development of the situation in Kosovo, under the auspices of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, will be of particular importance during 2005.
The Luxembourg Presidency will give full support to the UNâs efforts and to the actions of the Secretary-Generalâs special representative, Mr Jensen Petersen, with a view to stabilising Kosovo.
The Council was able to review the situation in that country in the presence of Mr Jensen Petersen during its meeting on 21 February.
The Mid-2005 review will be the first opportunity to fully assess progress on effective compliance with United Nations standards.
Progress towards a process for determining the future status of Kosovo, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, will be conditional on a positive outcome of that assessment.
The European Union has been closely involved in this process, with absolute respect for the role of the United Nations in determining the future status of Kosovo.
The Thessaloniki Summit clearly affirmed that the Western Balkans, including Kosovo, without prejudice to their future status, are destined to become future members of the European Union.
Consequently, the Union will have an important role in examining the status of Kosovo, in order to ensure it is fully compatible with the process of European integration.
The Council, in its conclusions of 21 February, stressed that Kosovo must not revert to the pre-1999 situation.
Its future can only be envisaged as a multi-ethnic and democratic state, guaranteeing effective protection for minorities, preserving the cultural and religious heritage of all communities and respecting the rights of refugees and displaced persons to return, thereby contributing to the stability of the region and adhering to the European Unionâs values and principles.
The Council has invited the Secretary-General and High Representative, and the Commission, in close cooperation with the Presidency, and in conjunction with the United Nations and other relevant bodies, to examine the possible future contribution of the European Union to the efforts of the international community in Kosovo aimed at implementing Resolution 1244, and to assess its potential contribution to the overall assessment of the implementation of standards and to later phases of the process, and subsequently reporting back to it.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, UN Resolution 1244 has absolutely nothing to say about the future status of Kosovo.
This resolution is already five years old.
Now that the Americans have announced their intention of resolving the status issue this year, the question arises as to whether the EU wants to take an independent initiative on this or passively await what others will come up with.
Unemployment in Kosovo is running at 70%, and people will invest in the place only as and when its long-term future is sorted out.
I would therefore like to know whether the Council is planning some kind of active preparation for this decision, which is evidently due this year?
Â Â  The approach adopted has been termed âStandards before statusâ or âStandards for Kosovoâ, and this approach still applies.
The European Union is also in contact with all partners with an interest in seeing a political solution to the Kosovo situation.
Therefore, the European Union is not waiting for others to take decisions.
We remain in contact with our partners, but I believe that a risky and precipitate solution that failed to take sufficient account of a certain number of problems still unresolved in that country, would ultimately run the risk of threatening the still very fragile stability in Kosovo.
Â Â  Would the President-in-Office agree with me that the decision by the now ex-Prime Minister of Kosovo, Mr Ramush Haradinaj, to resign and to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is a welcome sign of the growing political maturity in the country.
The response of the ethnic Albanians now is absolutely critical.
It has been reported that 1000 extra KFOR troops have been deployed in Kosovo because of the fear of rising tension.
If Kosovo can overcome this problem in the next day or two, I think that will augur well for a final political solution to the Kosovan crisis and allow the UN administration to withdraw.
Does he agree with that?
Â Â  I fully agree with that assessment. I believe that the Prime Ministerâs decision to go to The Hague is a sensible one and one which demonstrates a significant political maturity.
It will also have the effect of giving the Albanian inhabitants of Kosovo the right message, namely that the process is normal and that it is now a time for cool heads.
I believe that if this can be achieved, and if people remain calm, new prospects will open up for Kosovo.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council what the Council intends to do to protect minorities, given that the violently expelled Serbs and Roma have not yet returned home.
I also wish to ask how the Council believes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro will be protected at the imminent negotiations, as expressly stated in UN Resolution 1244 which, as you said, the Council continues to support.
Â Â  Firstly, in relation to the protection of minorities, I believe this is part â as I have clearly said â of the European Unionâs approach to a political solution in Kosovo.
There can be no political solution for Kosovo without the protection of minorities and without all refugees having the right to return home.
That much is clear.
With regard to the issue of sovereignty, I believe that it is on this issue that a political solution has to be found, although without predicting what such a solution will be.
We are conscious that the issue is highly complex and difficult; it must be the subject of negotiations to be entered into at the appropriate time.
Therefore, I cannot give you a clear reply, but what we are being guided by today is resolution 1544.
Â Â  Question No 2 lapses.
Question No 3 has been withdrawn.
The assassination of the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, has raised fears at international level that Lebanon and the surrounding region may be destabilised.
Statements by Condoleezza Rice reveal that the USA's view is that Syria is responsible for the assassination.
For its part, Syria, which has been described by the US President as a country forming part of the 'axis of evil', condemned the attack, claiming that it had no connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri.
What initiatives will the Council take to prevent any unilateral US action against Syria?
Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union provides for coordination between Member States which are also members of the UN Security Council. What do those Member States propose to do in this respect?
Â Â  The prospects for peace in the Middle East, which have improved significantly, nonetheless remain fragile and extreme care will be required if they are not to evaporate.
On this issue, the common approach of the United States and the European Union, reaffirmed at the meeting of Heads of State or Government with the US President on 22 February in Brussels, are a source of satisfaction.
The EU and USA share the same position on the Middle East peace process and on the need to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 in its entirety.
Moreover, that resolution was initiated by one of the European Union Member States together with the US.
It demands the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the disarmament and dismantling of all militias and the holding of parliamentary elections in that country, in accordance with a free and proper process without external interference.
The Council has roundly condemned the attack which took the life of Rafik Hariri, former President of the Lebanese Council of Ministers.
I think this has been discussed extensively in recent days â yesterday and during the previous sitting.
Responsibility for that attack has not yet been established.
The international community and the Council have demanded an international enquiry to establish the circumstances and attribute responsibility.
The Council has called upon the Lebanese authorities to cooperate fully to that end with the investigating teams, in particular the United Nations representatives.
The Council has also called upon all countries in the region to fulfil their international obligations, particularly in combating terrorism.
The United Nations Secretary-General has announced that, in the next few weeks, he will be presenting a report on implementation of the resolution, on the basis of which the Security Council will take a decision on future steps.
This will be done in close coordination with the various members of the Security Council and with EU Member States which are Security Council members, as well as the other Member States.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to insist, having thanked you for your reply, on one issue: following the discussions which the European Union recently had with the US leadership, is the Council in a position to assure me that there will be no unilateral action of a negative nature by the United States in the area, given the sensitivity which exists in the entire area?
Â Â  You are aware that, unfortunately â or perhaps fortunately, I am not sure â I am not the spokesman for the White House, and therefore cannot provide you with a clear answer on this point.
As I have just explained, the agreed approach of the European Union and United States favours the United Nations and a UN resolution.
Moreover, some positive signs are beginning to emerge from the country to which reference was clearly being made.
Â Â  The Council reminds the Member that the decision on the numbers of migrant workers to admit falls within the remit of each EU Member State, and I would add that it will continue to remain within the remit of each Member State even after the Constitution comes into force.
With regard to the regularisation process implemented by the Spanish Government and to which the question refers, the Council has not debated it formally and is not therefore in a position to respond.
In more general terms, the Council invites the honourable Member to refer to developments in the Hague Programme, the multiannual programme adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 4 and 5 November 2004.
By adopting that programme, the European Council, on the issue we are discussing here, based its conclusions in particular on the idea that the informal economy and unofficial employment may provide a stimulus to clandestine immigration and give rise to exploitation.
Additionally, in view of the specific problem of dealing with economic migration, the Council, at its meeting on 24 February had an initial exchange of views on the Commissionâs Green Book on a Community-wide approach.
At this stage, it is a discussion document covering a wide range of questions and envisaging a range of possible solutions.
The examination progress which has begun should provide a basis for the Commission to establish, at the end of 2005, a programme for legal immigration.
Â Â  â Whether or not this has been formally discussed, the fact remains that Otto Schily and Rita Verdonk have raised an objection.
I have the Commission's response from yesterday, which uses the same terms, and I am sorry to say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Commission's response was much clearer than yours.
You said that the size of the unregulated labour market will not be reduced, which amounts to saying that illegal immigration is being encouraged in some way, as the Commission said yesterday.
I would say, based on my own experience, that in addition to promoting illegal immigration, the 'call effect' is being supported, making life easier for mafia groups involved in human trafficking, encouraging the market in false documents and what is more, weakening the Schengen area.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this cure is worse than the disease.
Â Â  . The Hague programme, to which I referred, aims to combat illegal immigration and clandestine immigration, and also undeclared labour.
We must admit that this is a complex problem, because the illegal immigrants that are here, are here.
So, what are we going to do about it?
They are here and they are working illegally.
Are we going to accept that they will continue doing so?
That is the question.
I think the best solution is for there to be less illegal immigration and less undeclared labour.
Â Â  (We must not forget that the last Spanish Government undeniably made some very serious mistakes which resulted in a million illegal immigrants in Spain.
I would like to join the Commission â and now the President-in-Office of the Council â in asking, by way of extension to the previous question, whether the Spanish regularisation efforts are not tantamount to staking everything on legal, regulated immigration, on strengthening border controls and on combating the hidden economy, as so clearly stated by the President.
Â Â  . I think that what was decided within a Member State fell within the competence of that Member State.
The European Union clearly has an interest in seeing additional efforts made to improve border controls.
That, moreover, is one of the aims of the agency we are in the process of setting up.
We must combat illegal immigration, but also the opportunities for employing workers illegally and clandestinely.
There is a 'pull' effect in play.
If there were no possibility of illegal work, illegal immigrants would probably find Europe less attractive.
Â Â  Is the Presidency aware that the Maltese Government is not allowing journalists, either local or international, to visit detention centres where immigrants are being held?
Are you aware that there were damning reports on the state of those immigration centres by the Council of Europe?
I agree with the detention policy, but the state of these places is indescribable.
Do you think it is right that journalists should not be allowed to report, not just without restriction but even if they apply for permission to be given access to those places?
Â Â  . I do not think that this question is really related to the previous question.
All I can say is that, indeed, all countries with particularly exposed borders must make every effort to control those borders, in order to limit illegal immigration and combat this phenomenon effectively.
I will leave to the Council of Europe the responsibility that is incumbent upon it and to which you referred.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would point out to the honourable Member that, under ArticleÂ 5 of Regulation NoÂ 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10Â MarchÂ 2004 on the organisation and use of the airspace in the single European sky, the Council has no authority with regard to the creation of a functional airspace block, such as the one to which the Member referred in his question.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should merely like to ask one additional question.
Is this not a further example of something we discussed before, namely that the complex problems Kosovo faces cannot be resolved by means of the old âstandards before statusâ policy, and that the issue of status must finally be settled?
Standards will not be achieved if noÂ one knows what the status is ultimately meant to be.
I should also like to raise a point of order.
I indicated a short while ago that I wished to put a supplementary question, and even though I did so very early on, it would appear that noÂ one noticed.
Â Â  We did notice, MrÂ Posselt, but two other Members were even quicker off the mark than you were, and, as I can allow only two questions, I gave the floor to them.
Â Â  . I agree with you that the 'standards before status' approach has its limits and that the time is comingÂ âÂ or will comeÂ âÂ when we will, indeed, need to have clear discussions on the status issue.
That time is certainly drawing nearer.
Â Â  . Madam President, the report setting out the situation in the Member States as regards hooliganism in football between JulyÂ 2002 and JulyÂ 2003 will be discussed at the Member States' experts meeting, which is scheduled for the end of April 2005.
They will pay particular attention to the expected developments in this field: the continuing internationalisation of football; troublemakers developing counter-strategies to deal with measures taken to combat hooliganism; solutions aimed at reducing, or even eliminating, internal border controls, in connection with the growth of the EU; the emergence of forms of extremism in violence surrounding sporting events; the progressive and continuing commercialisation of football; and the gathering of hooligans in groups that act as a unit rather than as individuals.
Â Â  President-in-Office, I discovered this report and was keen that during your presidency you put further pressure on UEFA in particular and, if necessary, FIFA, to move us towards a position where football is truly a family sport.
At the moment it is being scarred not just by hooliganism but, as you said, also by racism.
In your view, does UEFA issue stiff enough penalties, particularly in international football?
What is being done about national football?
Some pressure should be put on countries like, for instance, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and my own country to ensure that football is truly a family sport.
Is there anything you can do during your presidency to make that a reality?
Â Â  . Indeed, the Presidency attaches considerable importance to these phenomena that occur in stadia, and which are due to hooliganism, but also to racism.
In cooperation with UEFA and the national football federations, we must be firmly committed to combating these phenomena, which are damaging the reputation of a sport that, in other respects, is very worthwhile and popular.
Â Â  Following on from that, would the Council care to comment on the lackadaisical attitude by the football authorities as regards what happened at the England v. Spain game, where there was lots of racist chanting?
It seems to me that racism and hooliganism in football are combining.
It is the same sort of group of people, who are not football fans, who are responsible for this.
The Council seems to have very few views on the subject.
I wonder whether it could expand slightly more?
Â Â  . We cannot tolerate expressions of racism, whether during sporting events or at any other events.
I think we need both thought and action in this matter.
Those involved in such expressions of racism need to know that they will be punished, but also that they are putting at risk the continuation of sporting events.
I think that the action we have in part taken against hooligans must also be extended to all expressions of racism, which are now tending to become more frequent on the margins of sporting events, particularly of football matches.
Â Â  . The Council remains deeply concerned about the conflict in northern Uganda.
It has on several occasions condemned the serious violations of human rights and atrocities committed against the civilian population, especially by the Lord's Resistance Army.
The conflict in northern Uganda is one of the main points in the political dialogue between the European Union and the Ugandan Government.
As part of this, representatives of the Member States and of the Commission have regularly expressed their concerns regarding the continual violations of human rights occurring in the north of Uganda.
They have stressed the need to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population by means of a peaceful, negotiated solution to the conflict.
Representatives of the European Union and of other international partners have reiterated this position to the Ugandan Government.
Moreover, the EU itself has also expressed a willingness to support the peace process and to contribute to the economic reconstruction of the north of the country.
A significant proportion of the humanitarian aid that the EU provides to Uganda is intended to help the most vulnerable population groups in that part of the country.
Despite the resumption of fighting which followed the recent expiry of the government-declared ceasefire, the Council hopes that negotiations with the Lord's Resistance Army can continue.
It is also prepared to investigate what means it could use to increase the pressure on the two parties, in order to reach a lasting solution to this conflict in Uganda.
Â Â  I thank the President for this response and should like, at the same time, to give expression to a certain level of astonishment about the fact that there is talk of a war between two factions.
As far as I can judge, this is about the terrorist activities of the Lordâs Resistance Army, backed by the Sudanese Government and at the expense of the people of Northern Uganda.
I wonder whether it would not be opportune to include in the political dialogue with Sudan, and not only in the political dialogue with Uganda, the issue of the Lord's Resistance Army and the massive scale on which human rights are being violated.
Secondly, what initiatives does the Council intend to take in order to counter the absence of any punishment in this conflict, more particularly with regard to the complaint that has been lodged with the International Criminal Court in The Hague?
Â Â  . Indeed, the formulation putting the government and this so-called resistance army on the same level may not be entirely appropriate.
Nevertheless, I think that the only way to find a solution to this conflict is to urge the Ugandan Government and that army to enter into dialogue.
I think that, without dialogue, a peaceful resolution will not be possible.
With regard to responsibilities, I think that we do indeed need to examine the extent to which these responsibilities can be set out and determined, and we must not rule out any option, including the option of the International Criminal Court.
Â Â  . President Bush's visit to Brussels, so early in his second term, sends an important political signal.
The message sent by the US President was twofold, firstly that the time for diplomacy has arrived, and secondly that Europe, and particularly the European Union, is considered to be an important partner.
The change in the administration may seem to have happened at lightning speed, but in reality the tone began to change several months back.
It was very clear during the most recent, very successful, summit in Ireland.
It was after the elections in November, though, that the offer of a new partnership with Europe and, more specifically, with the EU, was made explicit.
A new start like this is obviously in Europe's interest, especially if it is made in a spirit of true partnership and greater equality.
None of today's major geostrategic issues are the subject of real disagreement.
It is only on issues of society and the relative importance of multilateralism compared to national sovereignty that our approaches diverge.
With regard to the crucial issues currently occupying the international scene, we can see a very broad convergence of opinions between the United States and the EU.
This is true, of course, of the Middle-East peace process, and it is now true of the stabilisation of Iraq.
With regard to Iran, there is agreement on the two main objectives: Iran must not develop nuclear weapons and must contribute actively to combating terrorism.
The United States is in close contact with the European Union to find a peaceful solution to these problems.
As for Lebanon and Syria, I spoke about them a few moments ago.
In terms of the environment, it is true that the problems have not entirely been ironed out, but President Bush has recognised the existence of the serious problem of climate change.
He has expressed a desire to work with the European Union to provide solutions, in particular in the field of research and technology, and to develop clean technologies, whilst integrating the emerging powers such as India and China.
Thus, without wishing to paint an idyllic picture of our relations they are a long way from that and without ignoring the subjects on which it will be the EU's duty to return to the attack, it nevertheless seems possible to take the view that this summit made it possible to demonstrate more effectively the important points of convergence that are providing a structure for transatlantic dialogue.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply.
I should like to ask you, as a supplementary question, if some programme of contacts and cooperation between the European Union and the United States has been decided, in order to ensure that specific action is taken so as to capitalise on this auspicious climate and the basis for cooperation which, as you say, was cultivated during the recent visit to Brussels by President Bush.
Â Â  . Transatlantic relations are not limited to summit meetings.
There is continuous contact on all subjects, at all levels, not only between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, but also between the Ministers for Justice, focussing on the fight against crime and terrorism.
That is the programme.
In addition, we are going to hold another summit, which we are already working towards, with a broader agenda that will also cover matters of economic cooperation.
This summit will take place in June and, in my opinion, it will demonstrate that the relaunch of transatlantic dialogue is a strong one, with very clear aims.
Â Â  If there has indeed been a relaunch of transatlantic relations, then that is good news for the Middle East peace process, because there can be no peace in the Middle East without both EU and US involvement.
Will the Council take advantage of this new climate to up the tempo of meetings of the Quartet and the road map to peace in the Middle East, in order to lend greater impetus to that process?
Â Â  . It is quite correct that transatlantic cooperation is essential to the Middle-East peace process.
There cannot be a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without the participation of the European Union and the United States.
Therefore, cooperation within the Quartet is extremely important for the application of the road map, and the relaunch of the Quartet's efforts to implement that road map would seem to be absolutely essential.
Â Â  . The Council would inform the honourable Member that the allocation of the amount referred to is still the subject of discussion between the Commission and the Member States concerned.
The file has not been submitted to the Council itself.
The Council invites the honourable Member to put this question directly to the Commission.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your answer is very diplomatic, I have to say.
We all know that this agreement exists; we know that there are already funds in a Luxembourg account and we know that these funds have to be shared out.
We know that the budgetary authority is made up of two branches, namely the Council and Parliament.
Would it not indeed be desirable, therefore, for the Council and Parliament, as the joint budgetary authority, to come to an agreement with the Commission on how those funds were to be apportioned?
I do not believe that you can simply say that I should direct this question to the Commission.
There is a great deal of money involved.
It is reported that 10% would now be channelled to the Commission and 90% to the Member States, while the usual procedure in customs practices, when funds are claimed, is that 25% is channelled to the Member State and 75% to the Commission.
This is therefore a serious matter, and one that cannot simply be dismissed with a diplomatic response.
Â Â  I acknowledge the honourable Member's comment, including with regard to the diplomatic answer.
However, I believe that bilateral discussions are indeed still continuing between the Commission and the Member States.
You have my word that the Council will contact the Commission to find out in what context we can find a solution that, of course, will also respect Parliament's budgetary powers.
Â Â  . The Council has not been informed of any activities carried out by the secret services of the Member States in the fight against organised crime.
Indeed, no provision in TitleÂ VI of the Treaty on European Union requires the Member States to provide the Council with such data.
Â Â  I hope that the Council is very shocked by its own reply.
Organised crime crosses frontiers in Europe very easily and we need to work together as Member States and as European institutions to fight against it.
So what you are telling me, President-in-Office, is that there is no coordination at all between the activities of the secret services of the Member States.
Should there not be some coordination?
Â Â  . I do not think that I was telling you that there was no cooperation between the secret services.
You are well aware that there is coordination between the services, amongst other things for combating terrorism and organised crime, against which the networks are also joined.
What I was saying was that this issue does not fall within the formal remit of the Council, as it is not a competence of the EU.
Â Â  . The Council would remind the honourable Member that it is up to each member of the Council to set out his or her position during the press conferences that follow Council sessions and to explain those aspects of the debate that they feel need to be presented in public in order to provide the context for that position.
The Council is not in the habit of commenting on public statements made by its members.
With regard to the transparency of the Council's work, it would stress that, in accordance with ArticleÂ 11(6) of AnnexÂ II to its Rules of Procedure, after adoption of decisions by the Council during the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the EC Treaty or final adoption of the act concerned, the General Secretariat makes available to the public any legislative documents relating to this act, that is to say those that were drawn up before one of such decisions and that are not covered by any of the exceptions laid down in Article 4(1), (2) and (3), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
At the request of the Member State concerned, documents that are covered by those criteria, and that reflect the position of that Member State's delegation, are not made available to the public.
On the other hand, when negotiations are in progress on a draft text, the Council reserves the right not to release the identities of the delegations if the conditions of Article 4(3) of that Regulation are met.
Thus, the Council complies with both the letter and the spirit of the official texts, while ensuring the greatest possible transparency.
I hope that my statement has also been sufficiently transparent.
With respect to the publication of the votes themselves, the Council would remind the honourable Member that, in the field of legislation, these are automatically published and invites him to refer, in this regard, to the responses that it gave in particular to a series of written questions in 2003 and 2004 on the same subject.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find it extremely frustrating that you have not answered a single one of my questions in any way, shape or form.
I am not asking you about documents, but I am specifically asking what penalties Council members face if they disclose details of what has been said at Council meetings.
What action is taken against them?
My two other questions do not relate to the legal position, of which I am well aware, but to the steps you intend to take in response to accusations that you are a secret society.
It is not the legal position I am interested in, but the specific measures you plan to take.
In the public interest â and a great many members of the public are in fact keen to know this â I would ask you again to give a proper answer to the question as to what action is taken against a Minister or Council member who discloses details of who said what during confidential talks in closed session.
Â Â  . In legal terms, there are no sanctions.
That is very clear.
And we have no intention of introducing any.
We cannot both call for greater transparency and at the same time punish, ultimately, the freedom of speech of Council members, even if, at times, they misuse this freedom of speech.
I cannot see how we could introduce sanctions in this respect.
Â Â  . The Council would remind the honourable Member that, on the matter of the freedom of information system applicable to the Special EU Programmes Body that oversees the PeaceÂ I and PeaceÂ II programmes in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and also other Community initiatives, this falls within the competence of the said Member States.
The Council would also draw the honourable Member's attention to the fact that it is the Commission's responsibility to ensure that Council Regulation NoÂ 1260/99 of 21Â JuneÂ 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, as amended by the Council on 24Â JanuaryÂ 2005 to extend the duration of the Peace programme, is properly implemented, in view of the fact that responsibility for managing these funds is split between the European Commission and the governments of the Member States, on the basis of a close partnership.
Â Â  Surely it is a matter of concern to the Council when two Member States combine to exclude an EU monitoring body from their indigenous freedom of information legislation and so exempt it from provisions on providing the public with information that is available from all internal governmental bodies in those states.
In particular, should it not be a matter of concern for the Council that those two states have indulged in five years of default in terms of producing a voluntary code of practice for those implementation bodies under the SEUPB?
Â Â  I have no reason to believe that Community law has been infringed, and I assume that the rules regarding provision of information and supervision have been complied with.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Council would invite the honourable Member to refer to the statement made on this subject during the last plenary session in Strasbourg in February.
In the same vein, it would remind the honourable Member that it recognises and shares his desire for the establishment of cooperation in civil protection in the Mediterranean, in particular by the possible creation of an early warning system in the Mediterranean as part of the Barcelona process.
In addition, the Council welcomes the fact that this issue is to be raised during the first session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly from 12 to 15Â MarchÂ 2005 in Cairo.
The Council points out that, with regard to the proposal put forward by the author of this question with the aim of finding a solution for the dangers threatening the Mediterranean region, an ad hoc group on partnership measures, appointed by senior officials responsible for the political and social chapter of the Barcelona process, discussed these issues on 9Â FebruaryÂ 2005.
In particular, it discussed maritime safety in the region, and civil protection, particularly by preparing a mandate to draw up aid plans in the event of a tsunami as part of the existing interim Euro-Mediterranean programme.
On this matter, a seminar scheduled to be held in Marseille in JuneÂ 2005 will aim to bring together the various instruments and should discuss prevention in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, operational organisation in collaboration with other forums such as the 5+5 or the Euro-Mediterranean forum, a specific assistance plan for the Mediterranean and a warning centre.
The possibility of organising voluntary practical exercises shared between the Member States in OctoberÂ 2005 will also be looked into.
The Luxembourg Presidency attaches considerable importance to this initiative, which it launched and in which it has participated.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your answer, which is satisfactory.
I should like, nonetheless, to remind you that, of course, the early warning system is very important because, today, 70Â million people are living on the shores of the Mediterranean, not counting tourists.
In other words, we do not want a repeat of the disaster in South-East Asia.
Furthermore, we have numerous fires, numerous earthquakes and other natural disasters.
Consequently, what I should like to hear from you, in addition to what you have already said, which is highly satisfactory, is whether we really are prepared to make available the sum needed, because this sum will be much larger than the sum we already have for the bridge programme or the sum of around EUR 12 million budgeted for the early warning system.
We are talking about several million euros more and I should like to know if the European Union has decided to make these sums available.
Â Â  . I do not think that the Council on its own can provide an answer.
This question needs to be put to all the bodies with budgetary authority.
Once an operational system has been put in place, we will also need to finance it.
The two bodies with budgetary authority will thus have to reach agreement so that this financing comes, at least in part, from Community sources.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whenever disaster strikes we are faced with the same problem: although preparations are made in advance for aid programmes, no market research or opinion polls are carried out among those hit by disasters, even though these are key prerequisites.
Is any provision made in the Action Plan for future victims to be asked what their real needs are when a disaster strikes, to ensure that they are involved in any plans that are drawn up?
Â Â  . You are describing the ideal situation, and it would certainly be the best way of saving a great deal of money and of intervening using the means that are absolutely necessary.
Unfortunately, disasters always surprise us and the expected needs are not always those that really need to be met.
We certainly do need to ensure that we pay as much attention as possible to the aspect to which you refer.
Â Â  . Madam President, the European Council established in JuneÂ 2000 that all the countries in the Western Balkans were potential candidates for accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, in JuneÂ 2003, the European Council reiterated its determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the western Balkan countries, which will become an integral part of the European Union once they meet the established criteria.
It is therefore essentially up to the countries concerned to set the pace at which they come closer to the EU by aligning with the and by meeting the criteria established by the Copenhagen European Council and the conditions of the stabilisation and association process.
To date, only Croatia and the FYROM have officially applied to join the EU.
Following Croatia's application for membership, the European Council has decided to open accession negotiations in MarchÂ 2005, provided that Croatia cooperates fully with ICTY.
As regards the FYROM, the Commission is still in the process of preparing its opinion on that country's application for membership.
At its meeting in Brussels on 16 and 17Â DecemberÂ 2004, the European Council reaffirmed its commitment to the full implementation of the Thessaloniki agenda, which underlines that the future of the countries of the Balkans is within the European Union.
The recent ministerial meetings of the EU-Western Balkans Forum served to assess the progress achieved and identify the challenges ahead.
The European Council restated, in particular, that in this process regional cooperation would remain an essential element of EU policy.
With regard to the financial aspects of the accession of a candidate State, it also stated that these aspects must be allowed for in the applicable Financial Framework.
Hence, accession negotiations yet to be opened with candidates whose accession could have substantial financial consequences can only be concluded after the establishment of the Financial Framework for the period from 2014 together with possible consequential financial reforms.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
I have both good and bad news for you.
The good news is that I am the last person with questions for you today.
The bad news is that I have a supplementary question I should like to put to you.
The first point I have to make is that you mentioned two countries that did not feature in my question, namely Macedonia and Croatia.
My question related to three other countries.
Although my party and I voted in favour of Turkeyâs entry into the European Union, we believe it would be absurd for Turkey to enter into the EU before other countries that are clearly European.
The European public would find this impossible to understand, and such a situation would be best avoided.
That is why I also believe that cooperation with the countries in question should involve the drafting of a more accurate timetable for their integration into European structures, covering the next dozen or so years.
It is my impression that this will not happen, and this disappoints me somewhat.
Â Â  . I would say to the honourable Member that, of course, we do know the date when negotiations will be opened with Turkey, as does he, but we do not know their accession date.
At the moment, there are no other applications.
You referred to other countries.
The path is open to them, if they accept and meet the criteria.
The path will then be politically open, in other words they will actually become candidates.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said yourself that Croatia should seek to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal.
I would be interested to know whether any evidence is available, for example from Europol or Interpol, to suggest that the general in question is in fact still in Croatia.
Â Â  . I do not actually have any information, either from Europol and I would add that Europol is not an investigative body, as you know or from Interpol, but reports sent to us by the prosecutor of the Hague tribunal show that, in any event, the person in question, General Ante Gotovina, did pass through Croatia.
Is he still there?
That is a question I cannot answer.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, something very unusual has happened; not only have we taken all the questions, we have also completed Question Time half an hour ahead of time, something that we very, very, rarely do.
I should like to thank everyone present.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0046/2005) by Mrs Locatelli, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Science and technology â Guidelines for future European Union policy to support research (2004/2150(INI)).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon European Council of 2000 marks an important turning-point for European politics in general and for research and the knowledge-based society in particular.
The Prodi Commission project â developed particularly by Commissioner Busquin but even prior to that by the Italian commissioner, Professor Ruberti â to create the European Research Area by means of a number of measures was confirmed at Lisbon.
That is a fundamental step if Europe is to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
We are all aware of the current gap between Europe and its major competitors in this field, that is, the United States and Japan.
The percentage of GDP devoted to research spending is 3.12% in Japan, 2.76% in the United States, 1.99% in the EU of 15 and 1.93% in the EU of 25.
We have to close this gap, and the European Research Area is a step in the right direction.
This project is within reach, but it needs determination to make it happen, the same determination that was shown when we created the single market and the single currency.
The importance of the European Research Area is underlined by the new powers that the Constitutional Treaty attributes to the Union in this field, and we therefore call on the Commission to act in line with the new legal framework.
Weighing up what has been done and outlining future prospects, I must underline the importance of having continuity between the sixth and seventh Framework Programmes.
The sixth Framework Programme marked a break with previous programmes, because it set itself more ambitious targets and introduced innovative instruments that encourage a greater number of stake-holders to become involved and to coordinate their actions.
The seventh Framework Programme presents yet another novelty, which is to set up the European Research Council.
I am also speaking on this subject on behalf of our fellow Member Erika Mann, who could not be present at this debate.
The European Research Council responds to the European scientific communityâs increasingly vehement demand for a new body to be created to stimulate basic research.
Basic research is crucially important for successful innovation and will create European added value.
Up to now, European added value has been defined through collaboration between research teams in different countries. As the Mayor report shows, however, it is time to provide a new definition of added value, making it possible for individual researchers or individual teams in any EU Member State to compete with all other researchers on the basis of excellence.
That is the real mission of the European Research Council, which must be independent in its scientific evaluations, autonomous in its operation and adequately funded.
In this connection, I call on the Commission to present a clear, precise proposal regarding the structure and composition of the European Research Council governing bodies as soon as possible.
The report pays particular attention to the subject of human resources, which are the EUâs real strength.
In this respect, we have to create the right conditions so that European researchers can best express themselves.
It is essential to foster mobility among researchers and to make that a widespread practice at all career stages.
Two-way mobility between companies, universities and research centres, the harmonisation of working conditions and career structures and the creation of Europe-wide infrastructure are essential conditions for creating a fertile research environment.
To achieve these aims, I call for the Marie Curie actions to be strengthened, as they have proved to be effective and to encourage mobility in the scientific world.
Still on the subject of human resources, I should like to point to the need to promote womenâs access to the research sector, as well as their careers.
We want to see a greater presence of women at all levels, including the highest, and we also want gender research.
The future of research and of Europe also depends on our ability to make science more attractive to young people.
A closer link between educational courses and scientific careers is a precondition for us to have the numbers of researchers needed for the success of the Lisbon Strategy.
Another chapter in the report concerns technology transfer.
The seventh Framework Programme should devote special attention to technology transfer, thus coordinating Europeâs research policy with its industrial policy.
Technology platforms and joint technology initiatives are vital mechanisms for achieving this objective.
At the same time, funding needs to be increased for instruments aimed specifically at small and medium-sized enterprises, which also require the streamlining of project selection criteria and of bureaucracy in general, which has often been an obstacle preventing SMEs from taking part in research programmes.
On this last point, I believe the recommendations included in the Marimon and Ormala reports should be adopted, and not only in relation to SMEs.
To conclude, I should like to touch briefly on thematic priorities, without going into the merits of individual arguments.
I think it should be emphasised that these thematic priorities reflect the strategic priorities of the Lisbon Agenda.
In this context, I should like to make it clear that to implement the Lisbon Agenda we need to adopt a different approach to spending compared with the past.
We must move on from a model of diffuse provision of aid â what in Italy is called ââ â to a model that prioritises spending on investments that have a multiplying effect, that is, an effect of reinforcing growth.
Lastly, I would stress that Parliament must not make concessions on research funds, and I hope that the Commission will be on Parliamentâs side in this battle.
Â Â  . Mr President, there could hardly be a better day than today, when this House has expressed its position on the mid-term review of Lisbon, to take up the issue of the future of European research policy.
Let me thank Mrs Locatelli, the rapporteur, in particular, and all the committee members for the fruitful and intense cooperation demonstrated during this first month of our work together.
I would also like to thank everyone present at this late hour for their real interest in and commitment to future European research policy.
The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the adoption of the Locatelli report.
It constitutes the European Parliamentâs formal position on our June communication and, what is more, will pave the way for preparing the Commissionâs proposal on the new framework programme to be adopted on 6 April 2005.
Before highlighting what I consider to be the key elements of the Locatelli report, I would like to share with you some thoughts about the general context of European research and our plans for the Seventh Framework Programme.
Even if some of you heard this during the plenary debate on the question of the financing of FP7 two weeks ago, the context is clear.
We want and need to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy.
The intensive discussion this morning on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy has allowed us to take the measure of the challenges ahead.
Europe cannot compete on the basis of cheap labour or low social standards.
We cannot compete on the back of our environment.
We do not have the natural resources to sustain our prosperity; we only have our brains, intelligence and creativity.
Knowledge, in the broader sense, is our strongest factor of competitiveness in the global, fiercely competitive market place.
In Europe, we need to become much better at producing knowledge through research, diffusing knowledge through education, and using and applying knowledge through innovation.
That means that the knowledge triangle of research, education and innovation must function within favourable framework conditions, which reward the knowledge that is put to work.
The Commission is already working hard to develop such framework conditions for knowledge and innovation.
For example, we will come forward later this year with a revision of the state aid regime, work on fiscal incentives for research and development and innovation, guidelines on cooperation between industry and universities, re-evaluation of the profession of European researchers, and other actions.
Only knowledge-based growth can leverage the resources that we need to sustain the cost of the inclusive society, with the high levels of care and protection that Europeans aspire to.
Building the knowledge society is thus probably the best and maybe the only way to sustain the European model of society, without having to make a trade-off between economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection.
It is in this same Lisbon context that I will present our proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme.
As some of you rightly stated during our debate on the oral question on the research budget in Strasbourg two weeks ago, FP7 needs to be the framework programme for the Lisbon Strategy.
I could not agree more.
I want it to be the programme for the growth and job strategy.
The duration of the programme will be seven years, as in the case of the next financial perspectives.
But given that we envisage a mid-term review, this allows us more stability, but also more flexibility.
Both are needed.
As regards the structure, there will be more emphasis on themes and less on instruments.
Cooperation projects, formerly known as collaborative research, will be more focused on industry needs and will therefore be more supportive of growth.
I hope that you will all appreciate this new approach.
There will be a strong focus on ideas, with actions concerning frontier research in the context of the European Research Council.
The âpeopleâ part of FP7 will strengthen the existing and well-appreciated mobility actions under Marie Curie.
The âcapacitiesâ part will deal with infrastructures, SMEs, regions, the research potential of all Member States, as well as science, society and international cooperation.
As regards the management of the funds, which are to double, I am fully aware of the challenges ahead.
But with their simplification and rationalisation on the one hand, and modernised management as well as externalisation of some of the activities â such as the European Research Council, SMEs and the mobility actions â on the other, we are prepared to rise to this challenge.
Turning to the Locatelli report itself, a report that will make a significant contribution to the success of the forthcoming framework programme, allow me, firstly, to express my sincere gratitude for all the support you have given until now for the proposed doubling of funds for FP7.
This is fully in line with the Commissionâs proposal for the next financial perspective and firmly defends the proposal to set the EU budget above 1% of GDP.
Let me make a personal comment here.
I really appreciate this support.
It is crucial.
Together we have a real chance to start changing the structure of the European budget in favour of more growth- and competitiveness-orientated actions.
The financial perspective debate will thus be the moment of truth for the European Union.
It will be then, and not later, that we must demonstrate that we are ready to address the challenges ahead of us fully.
We should not miss this opportunity to prove that we are ready to invest in the future rather than look to the past.
Second, you rightly ask for simpler and clearer administrative procedures in order to improve efficiency and reduce the costs for participants, in particular SMEs and small actors.
I have underlined the importance of simplification on several occasions, starting with the hearing last autumn, and I did not forget the message I was given two weeks ago in this plenary.
We have been told since FP4 that there will be simplification.
It is time to do something.
The Commission will do all in its power to achieve this and I look to Parliament to support it.
Third, let me thank you for your support for the swift establishment of the European Research Council: I am using your exact wording.
Let me underline two fundamental principles that I intend to strive for vigorously: autonomy and scientific excellence.
I wish to assure you of my determination to guarantee this autonomy.
Furthermore, autonomy will be the best guarantor of the highest level of scientific excellence, which should be the sole criterion for the selection of the proposed projects.
What is more, the ERC needs to support at European level research in all scientific fields, from specific industry-driven research to social and human sciences.
The EU needs high-level researchers in all research fields in order to grow and compete with the USA, Japan and other strong parties.
In terms of the structure of the ERC, our current view is that an executive agency would be best placed to support such a council.
Let me assure you that we are examining all possible options, including those based on a more mid-term approach, and will inform you of our decision in due course.
Fourth, the report is fully aligned with the Commissionâs intention in recommending a substantial increase of funding for Marie Curie actions and welcoming the Commissionâs proposal for European technology platforms and joint technology initiatives.
As you know, this will be an important part of the forthcoming proposal for the framework programme.
Europe is weak in public and private partnerships, and this needs to be sorted out.
Focusing the efforts of all the stakeholders around a few well-identified key technologies is of the utmost importance, and this is what we intend to do.
Finally, the report puts great emphasis on the regional dimension, by underlining the need for the participation of regions in order to increase investment in research and innovation.
Let me add that the Structural Funds and European research policy share common objectives.
The link between the regional dimension and FP7 is important in the sense that they should be mutually reinforcing.
Parliament is fully justified in drawing attention to this requirement.
Let me conclude by saying that I consider the Locatelli report a strong encouragement to my current preparations for the FP7 proposal.
I am happy to note that on all key issues we very much follow the same line.
This is an encouraging signal for the legislative process ahead of us.
I trust you will send a strong signal tomorrow in your vote on the Locatelli report. We need this strong signal.
It would, and should, be widely heard. It would be an echo of the support you broadly expressed during the debate earlier today for renewed efforts for Lisbon, and an echo of our mutual readiness and determination to really deliver.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Locatelli, for her work and I should above all like to congratulate her on successfully achieving a collective effort in the best possible spirit of collaboration, creating a firm foundation for us to continue to work together on the European research policy while awaiting the now imminent arrival of the seventh Framework Programme.
Research, which President Barroso has indicated to be one of the priorities of the revamped Lisbon Strategy, is the tool on which the knowledge-based society is founded.
It is not just a strategic step but also an essential one for closing Europeâs competitive gap in terms of innovation and, consequently, economic growth, employment and sustainable development.
In order to catch up quickly, we have to invest greater resources, to the extent of doubling the funds available compared with the previous Framework Programme.
Even then, that is not enough.
In the context of the most ambitious objective, which is to provide the scientific community, industry and European society in general with the tools needed to strengthen and improve our research capacity, we need above all to use the funds better, with the aim of creating real centres of excellence that can attract our researchers, who are all too often forced to emigrate abroad.
Consolidating the European Research Area is important not only for our researchers and for their mobility, but also to attract investment, both public and private, European and non-European.
That is a target that can be met primarily by directing resources towards traditionally strategic sectors for the European Union.
With this report, Parliament hopes for thematic continuity with the sixth Framework Programme and an enhanced spirit of transnational collaboration.
The European Research Area must be the catalyst for private investment.
In addition, great emphasis has been placed on small and medium-sized enterprises, precisely because of the particular industrial structure of our economy, which is predominantly characterised by an industrial fabric made up of productive areas that are unable to develop independent research projects.
It therefore becomes essential to strengthen the dialogue that SMEs or associations of SMEs have with our universities and with the many European centres of excellence.
Such a dialogue should lead to a more effective and fruitful transfer of technology.
The proposal to set up a European Research Council must be seen in this context.
I support its aims, which include guiding basic research and guaranteeing not only its suitability but also its quality.
I have, however, expressed my doubts both about the potential overlap with the remit of other European coordination bodies and institutes and about the funds to be devoted to setting up and running the Council itself.
MrÂ President, I shall finish by issuing the common challenge that research must become a real beacon of European competitiveness, a real action plan.
If Europe does not make this choice, it runs the risk of being regarded as a weary, lumbering colossus, a continent that gets bogged down in talk and all too often bends its strategies to the individual interests of its Member States.
I hope that this will be the decade of research, just as the last one was the decade of the single market.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Locatelli, for her excellent work.
It is hard to believe that she has only just arrived here in Parliament.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists strongly supports the report and appreciates the work that has been done so well.
Research is the key to implementing the Lisbon objectives.
We do not have natural resources here in Europe: our natural resources are in our heads.
That is why this is a crucial area.
There is a problem with basic research and technology platforms, collaborations and especially financing.
It is sensible to finance European research when it produces genuine European added value.
Accordingly, it is hardly appropriate to finance very small individual projects in the field of basic research.
Instead, support should go to projects that are too broad, complex or risky for one single Member State to fund.
In the context of the technology platforms, the concept of cooperation with regard to new industrial research, the assumption that the private sector would put up two-thirds of the costs is not realistic in all cases.
Private agencies and institutions will hardly be prepared to provide such a large share of the funding of organisations that have their sights on the distant future and technological revolution.
Examples might be hydrotechnology and nanotechnology.
In the countries that are the Unionâs major competitors, such as the United States of America and Japan, the share of public funding in these sectors is as much as 80%.
We cannot possibly afford to give the competitive edge to outsiders in this way.
We therefore have to be ready, if necessary, to use public funds to subsidise projects which may only be of potential benefit in the long term.
Consequently, the rules governing State aid should be reformed.
Secondly, research and development must be made to benefit the SME sector.
Small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the funds for sophisticated research.
They are flexible, however, and can use the results of research and development work, and this might be the key to solving our unemployment problem.
There are 19 million SMEs and we have 16 million unemployed.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should particularly like to thank Commissioner PotoÄnik for his words, which I feel are extremely important.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, of course I also thank my colleague MrsÂ Locatelli for her hard work and collaboration.
This document highlights three key elements in the forthcoming Framework Programme for research, which are the European Research Council, the new priority thematic areas for research and the technological platforms.
Parliament thus recognises that basic research has an importance that transcends the Member States and requires a response at EU level, within the rationale of the Lisbon Strategy.
Hence we need to promote a genuine development policy through specific research instruments, such as technology platforms, financed above all by private enterprise but also by public institutions, Member States, regions and local bodies.
Research thus becomes an instrument, a core around which a general political proposal for economic and social development can be brought to maturity, alongside a monetary policy which is already in place.
Private enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized ones, will thus be able to meet their research needs in order to become more competitive.
These are strong, decisive new factors that will give European companies fresh impetus, supporting new sectors and innovation while also ensuring that conventional productive activities have a competitive edge.
By setting out these guidelines, Parliament is stating that it does not want to stand idly by and watch the deindustrialisation of Europe take place, and it is spurring the Commission and the Council to commit themselves more specifically to developing European research.
This programme is the core of a development policy.
It is pointless to think of changing the Stability Pact, which would just be a palliative measure, while the real cure is an economic and social development policy at European Union level.
Â Â  . â (Mr President, I would like to say how grateful I am to CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik for his openness and willingness to engage in dialogue, and to MrsÂ Locatelli and all the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who have been very constructive and positive in their work on this subject.
I understand that petrol prices have now reached USD 55 per barrel.
According to the financial analysts, petrol prices are not likely to fall in the foreseeable future, which constitutes a threat to the economy.
We need some pretty rapid responses. We need dynamic responses which will produce results within the next few years.
The Group considers that these responses need to be contained within the Seventh Framework Programme in terms of investment in energy efficiency and in renewable energy sources, both of which will help resolve the situation in the short term.
We are concerned about the priority being given to the hazardous energy sources of the past, such as nuclear energy, which are vulnerable to abuse by international terrorists.
We are also uneasy about the massive investment focus on energy programmes like Fusion ITER, which will not provide a single kilowatt of energy in the next 40 or 50 years according to the scientists involved.
We would like the Seventh Framework Programme to improve quality of life and the social environment, public health, preventative health, to benefit sustainable urban transport and promote the social science required to provide a balanced overview of research and of the society we are creating.
With this in mind, CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik, we are glad that you recognise the importance of social science.
I believe that in the future â and this is my last point â research will be very important, if that science is open and accessible to the general public and the scientific community.
Â Â  . âMr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has drafted a committee-initiative report on European research policy.
It is like a shopping list.
The European Parliament is prepared to buy the results of scientific research in these areas.
My main message is this: our group is in favour of guaranteeing additional resources for scientific research work.
The Commissionâs proposal for additional funds under the Seventh Framework Programme is justified.
There are fields which it would be beneficial to finance from common funds.
It should not be just business that derives the benefit.
There are many socio-political and ethical reasons for supporting basic research at university research institutes, which is unconstrained by the interests of big business and the war industry.
Joint research projects can be promoted in the best way if they lead to results for which the English would use the word âserendipityâ.
It means to find something by chance that you did not even know you were looking for.
The right conditions for serendipityhave to be created, and those conditions are established best in international collaboration.
The best example of a benefit jointly achieved through a jointly financed project is fusion energy research under the ITER project.
That is an area in which the Greens confuse fission with fusion.
No EU country would be prepared to undertake research into fusion alone.
When there is collaboration, projects start up that would not otherwise.
All participants can reap the benefits that result.
In the case of ITER, the beneficiaries include countries not in the EU.
We have to use the research framework programme to create the right conditions for âserendipityâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, whenever we take a stand on various issues in this Chamber, we must always justify whether these issues should really be decided at EU level.
The principle of subsidiarity is not something merely to be referred to in formal contexts, but rather should direct all our activities.
We all know that that is not how it works at all in Brussels and Strasbourg.
Political power is continually being shifted from the Member States to the institutions of the EU.
There are two driving forces behind this: the desire for a superstate, and a lack of political principle.
A majority of the EUâs elected representatives and of its civil servants want to create a new superstate.
For them, the principle of subsidiarity is not a guiding principle but rather an obstacle in their way.
Lack of political principle means that the Members of the House are more often than not prepared to cooperate with decisions that are to their liking, even when it is obvious that these are strictly national matters.
The end is allowed to justify the means.
Mrs Locatelliâs report, too, entirely neglects the principle of subsidiarity.
It does not put the question of what the EU should do when the Member States are unable to deal with a task themselves.
The question it asks is how the EU can drive forward the research that an establishment wishes to have.
How are we to deal with small and medium-sized enterprisesâ need for research?
How are we to awaken the interest of young people and women in science?
How are we to strengthen the links between research and industry?
How are we to increase total research funding to three per cent of GDP?
And so on.
These are all things that the Member States themselves are better equipped to deal with.
Finland and Sweden now already set aside three percent of GDP for research.
If other countries want to set aside the same amount, they only have to do so.
The research funds will not increase as a result of the Member States sending it via EU authorities.
On the contrary, this will result in increased bureaucracy and additional costs.
Competition between countries to find good solutions to this type of problem normally results in faster progress than central management at higher levels.
In the research world, this is known as institutional competition.
Competition is important not just between enterprises, but also between institutions.
Competition between countries in various areas is one of the most important explanations for the great progress made by the Western world in recent centuries.
Mrs Locatelli should therefore have asked the question: what can EU institutions do for research in Europe that the countries cannot do themselves? There are many such questions.
They fall into five categories, these being basic research, free movement of research staff within the EU, large-scale research in areas such as nuclear energy and space technology, infrastructure for research networks and common security issues for the EU.
The EUâs research policy should be limited to areas such as these, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity that is fÃªted in banquet speeches and draft constitutions.
EU research policy is on the wrong track.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, neither investment in science and research nor the Lisbon Strategy as a whole are goals in themselves.
This means that a great deal of care should be taken when drafting resolutions on science and technology.
I should like to thank MrsÂ Locatelli and express my admiration for the effort she has put into preparing this report.
It is clear that, on its own, the announcement that a European Research Area is to be established will change little.
The announcement will need to be backed up by appropriate funding for science and research, which means that no cuts should be made to the EU budget.
The funds will also need to be used in a rational manner, and this is a point I should particularly like to stress.
There are a number of issues I would like to touch upon very briefly.
Firstly, effective methods must be developed to identify talented young people and appropriate systems put in place to provide scholarships.
Secondly, accreditation standards for Higher Education institutions ought to be implemented according to the guidelines adopted in Berlin in 2003.
Thirdly, a simpler system should be introduced for awarding academic promotion, whilst ensuring that the criteria for granting grades and qualifications continue to be transparent.
Fourthly, more extensive use should be made of private sector funding, both for applied and basic scientific research and for research in the humanities, as mentioned by the Commissioner.
MrsÂ Locatelli said that life would be made easier for small and medium-sized enterprises.
That may well be the case, but how can measures aimed at introducing software patents be reconciled with such a statement?
Someone once said that knowledge is power, yet given the state of the world today, it must unfortunately be added that ignorance does not mean a lack of power.
I thank you.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party.
First of all, I must congratulate MrsÂ Locatelli on her excellent work.
The problems of the European Unionâs competitiveness in relation to the new Asian giants, the drain of our best brains to horizons richer in opportunities, the difficulty in meeting the Lisbon targets in terms of employment, development and innovation, and the issues of energy supply and health â these are the subjects that fill our time in Parliament and on which the future of our economy and our social system depends.
These topics are closely linked to each other, and their common denominator is the development of scientific and technological research.
Research actually means knowledge, employment and economic development, as well as a better quality of life.
It is therefore essential to obtain a substantial increase in funding to make it our strong point.
Research, however, is not just a matter of funds, instruments and infrastructure.
Research is done by people.
Any economic effort made by the European Union and the Member States will in fact be in vain without suitable human capital.
I am not alluding to quality, since our universities and our graduates are already the best in the world, but I am referring to jobs: opportunities to do research and to earn money.
Paradoxically, while science and technology play an ever more decisive role in todayâs global economy, young people are avoiding science subjects because of the limited job opportunities.
As a result, many graduates are forced to leave Europe or to spend years living on grants that are totally inadequate for the current cost of living, while they wait for a stroke of luck.
In recent years the number of young Europeans who choose to carry on studying science subjects has declined.
European universities do not have enough staff in their science departments to replace lecturers reaching the end of their careers, and fewer and fewer science and technology graduates find work as researchers compared with their main competitors in Europe.
We must at all costs reverse this trend, bring our young people into contact with science from an early age, stimulate their curiosity and above all enable not just the fortunate few but all those who deserve it to use their knowledge to serve Europe, by offering them work, careers and decent salaries in exchange.
If we want a future based on knowledge, we have to invest in our young people in order to train them and, above all, not to lose them.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my love of research is the only reason why I am present at this eveningâs late-night sitting, as I must admit that I would rather have watched Bayern Munich play Arsenal in the Champions League.
I too should like to start by expressing my wholehearted thanks to the rapporteur.
Not only has MrsÂ Locatelli presented a fine report, but she has also demonstrated a willingness to compromise.
A unanimous vote by this House tomorrow in favour of this report will both send out a signal and provide our Research Commissioner with the backing he needs.
This morning we spent a long time discussing the Lisbon Strategy.
The only way to make Europe competitive is to invest huge amounts in research and development in the future.
The Commissioner frequently refers to a âmoment of truthâ, and I believe that he is right to do so.
We must ensure that the research budget is large enough for us to achieve the Lisbon goal at long last.
This will not be enough on its own, of course.
Public funding is a good thing, but we must also encourage private industry and the private sector to invest heavily in research and development, and to make money available for this purpose.
I was delighted to hear you say earlier this evening that you are planning to issue guidelines particularly aimed at improving cooperation between research and industry in this respect.
I should like to make one more point, one that I have raised in this House on a number of occasions, and to which you too have referred.
It is pointless to increase funding unless this money is then spent on research in a truly efficient manner.
It is also crucial that the correct lessons be learned from the Sixth Research Framework Programme, from the Marimon report and from the criticism that has been levelled at the Framework Programme.
Programmes must be made simpler, more streamlined and less bureaucratic, and I would call on the Commission and on Parliament to do their homework on this matter.
We must ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises are also successfully involved in European research.
I look forward to the rest of the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate MrsÂ Locatelli on her excellent work.
I think that our debates over the past few months on the shape of European research policy and the objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme have been very productive, and I am sure they will have lasting benefits for science in Europe.
We have clarified key objectives with a view to achieving longer-term European Union targets; we have also analysed the instruments available for meeting those objectives, and proposed some new instruments.
If we want to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the Barcelona Summit and to reflect the recommendations made in the Kok Report, the Seventh Framework Programme must include a clear and proportionate increase in resources within the scope of the new financial perspectives.
In order to achieve these objectives and create a European Research Area we also need good coordination both at Member State and Union level to ensure that funding and activities are complementary and generate a multiplier effect.
If we are to comply with the Lisbon Strategy, we also need to support excellent basic research as the driving force for technological development, growth and competitiveness.
This entails making Europe more attractive to top researchers, from young and women researchers to highly-qualified scientists currently working abroad, and encouraging SME participation in every single thematic priority, in transnational collaborations, and in technology programmes through proportionate project funding and instruments tailored to their needs.
We are all agreed on this much â for which I again congratulate the rapporteur.
Other slightly more controversial issues will require further discussion.
For example, research priorities, which we believe should be extended to include other new priorities with major economic potential for the European Union, such as scientific research.
Â Â  Mr President, this shows us that science and research last in the long run.
I will continue in Swedish.
Mr President, the resolution that we have adopted adds European value to both research policy and economic development.
The entire resolution on the Lisbon Strategy that has been adopted by Parliament today with a very large majority â and which we in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have put a lot of work into â is based on the knowledge that sustainable development is based not just on economic growth, but also on social cohesion and environmental considerations.
The research policy and the report that we are discussing today will help build sustainable economic growth through investment in excellence and technology platforms and will help create the social cohesion that we desire â for example between men and women, from a gender perspective, as well as between different regions.
Moreover, they will help generate the funds needed for our security system and ensure that we can continue working on technological development that is driven by the environment.
I am pleased that this work is just as balanced as the Lisbon resolution adopted, and I look forward to the framework programme.
Â Â  Mr President, it is difficult to overstate the importance of this debate in the current hand-wringing over the Lisbon Agenda.
The reality is that if we do not invest in research and, more importantly, involve the business community in that research process, we will not upscale our economies.
The pan-Union coordination adds a clear value.
So it is all the sadder that the Commission proposals â which I broadly support â are under threat from my own UK Government, with its insistence on cuts to the EU budget and with little detail on where the axe should fall.
I support the broad thrust of this report and would add my words of congratulation to the rapporteur, with the rest of the House.
I have some reservations about the details and I hope that our amendments will strengthen the report tomorrow.
I would, in supporting the Commission, particularly stress the importance of simplifying the procedures in FP7, because the message I have heard loud and clear from Scotland is that the administration and the bureaucracy have been major off-putting factors in previous framework programmes.
From what the Commissioner has said this evening, I think that message has been received loud and clear, although I look forward to receiving his actual proposals.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, exactly 27Â years ago today â and incidentally also during a night shift â when I was preparing to return from an orbit around the Earth, following a research mission to the space station Salyut 6 that lasted over a week, I would never have dreamt that all these years later I would be able to speak about the future development of science and research in Europe before a House such as this one, and in the process maybe even to play an active role in this development.
I should therefore like to praise the efforts of all those involved, and especially MrsÂ Locatelli, as she has done a very good job of drafting her report, and this is why I intend to vote in favour of it during tomorrowâs vote.
A further reason why I intend to do so is that the draft report is quite clear on the significance of space exploration and the role space research will play for the future Europe, or, more accurately, for its citizens.
It is my belief that backing must also be given to projects such as the Galileo or GMS Programme, because I know from my own experience that projects of this kind give rise to opportunities in a number of other related fields, and offer the chance of hundreds, if not thousands, of new jobs.
The ITER programme should also provide such backing for the energy industry, as mentioned by my colleague.
I should like to draw a comparison to conclude my speech.
It may well be that we are on the threshold of decisions similar to those once taken by the Spanish kings when they decided whether or not to support Christopher Columbusâ project.
In modern terms, his voyage was a scientific experiment to confirm that the Earth was round, yet it not only changed the map of the world â it influenced everything that has happened in the world since then.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, although I can see that scientific research is both beneficial and necessary, it remains to be seen whether the approach adopted in the Locatelli report is the most efficient way to achieve a more innovative Europe.
Firstly, how effective can measures at European level be if it is the Member States that have powers and responsibilities in the relevant fields?
In the report, it is proposed that activities that take place in the Member States should be co-funded with EU resources.
This proposal would provide EU funding for students, research institutes and facilities, as well as communication with the public about the importance of science; areas that the Member States promote many times more effectively, and so there are more effective ways of spending European funds in this area; consider how much of the red-tape and administrative burden could be cut in international cooperation and in the mobility of researchers.
Secondly, the Commission communication on research policy guidelines lacks, to my mind, a strategic statement about research that is punishable in the Member States.
Surely it is unacceptable for Community funds to be used to support such research?
Research involving the destruction of human embryos springs to mind.
If Community funding used for such contentious research, this means that Member States will not benefit equally from the European research initiatives.
Can the Commissioner express a view on this?
Finally, the ambition of the European institutions to make their mark in the field of research does not necessarily lead to more and better research in Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this report obviously deserves our praise, as it is high time that such crucial issues were raised.
We should also welcome the fact that these issues are being discussed in relation to the Lisbon Strategy.
Yet I am afraid that this report will share the fate of the Lisbon Strategy, which failed to distinguish between economic and social goals.
Consequently neither is achieved, even though both are crucial.
We are all aware that the economy is flagging and that unemployment is on the rise.
Yet scientific goals are unfortunately conflated with ideological goals in this report.
I find it entirely incomprehensible that the report notes on three occasions that there is a particular need to promote the role of women in science.
It is self-evident that professorships should be granted to those who have the qualifications needed to hold such positions.
We can do our best to ensure that women gain these qualifications, but it is nonsensical to promote them by force if they do not.
Furthermore, I must say that I was surprised to see that research on animals was the only area of scientific research mentioned in any detail.
I am a great lover of animals, but this report is not the right place to deal with this issue to the exclusion of all others.
