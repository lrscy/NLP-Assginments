Information returned a month later, at the end of NovemberÂ 2004, showed failure to comply in the new Member States had fallen to 1.8%, and the average for the whole Union had fallen to 3.6%.
The statistics quoted clearly indicate that the situation regarding transposition is improving.
This improvement came about after just one month of effort and commitment.
Only when all the countries have transposed and implemented the directives will it be possible to lift the remaining barriers to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital without delay, thus making the internal market a reality.
This is why I am making the following proposals.
Firstly, the special procedure introduced by the Commission for dealing with cases of infringement of Community provisions applicable to the new Member States that failed to undertake transposition should become standard for all, and apply to all Member States.
Secondly, the so-called Internal Market Scoreboard should be upgraded to become an official European Council document.
It should be recognised as the main point of reference regarding the status of transposition in conjunction with data on the state of transposition of directives made available by all the Member States and updated regularly.
Thirdly, the Scoreboard should be used to name and shame all Member States lagging behind in the transposition process.
Fourthly, proper financial support for the out-of-court conflict resolution instrument from SOLVIT must be ensured, as that method of dealing with problems has already proved a success.
In addition to transposition and implementation of directives, account should also be taken of the additional factors contributing to the development of the internal market, and consequently to the growth of the European economy.
In this connection, it is essential for the new Member States to invest more in research and development, as their investment is currently below the European average.
These new Member States should also create an environment that is more conducive to links between research institutions and business.
As a citizen and former entrepreneur from one of the new Member States I am also aware of the need to create a more effective system of education and training.
In addition, more information on how the Union works and on its legislation should be made available in the new Member States. A survey of entrepreneurs confirmed this view.
In many of the new Member States, the education system is out of date.
Students are taught subjects and trades that are not appropriate to the needs of the market.
It is important to bear in mind that the better society is educated and informed, the better the quality of work provided will be.
Simplification of current Union legislation is called for too.
This will promote the development of businesses, trade and services, and stimulate the growth of the European economy.
The services directive is also essential to the proper functioning of the internal market.
In the context of the economies of both old and new Member States, a good services directive will amount to an opportunity to reduce unemployment and regional disparities.
It will lead to the creation of new jobs and to greater competitiveness, as well as to higher quality services and more opportunities for consumers to exercise their right to choose.
It is therefore best to rid ourselves of the emotions and fears generated by this directive from the outset.
What is actually needed is constructive action to ensure that the most appropriate version of this directive comes into force at the optimum moment for us all.
As I conclude, I should like to thank MrsÂ Kallenbach for her involvement and for the draft amendment she has tabled.
Nonetheless, I propose that her amendment be rejected, because discussion of the services directive is ongoing and we do not yet know what form the directive will eventually take.
Ladies and gentlemen, I trust that the solutions and suggestions I have proposed will meet with your approval.
Â Â  .
Mr President, nearly a year has passed since the ten new Member States acceded to the European Union. Since 1 May 2004, the European Union has been by far the biggest internal market in the world, with 25 countries and more than 450 million people.
Before May 2004, certain critics stated that the European Union was being enlarged at an excessively fast pace and without adequate preparation, that the candidate countries were still not ready and that everything would end in disaster and tears.
In the end, the cataclysm did not happen on 1 May 2004.
Enlargement was prepared properly and I should like to add that the new Member States demonstrated a positive stand, efficiency and dedication during preparations for their accession.
Today, almost 12 months since the enlargement of Europe, we find that the European Union, and the ten new Member States especially, have made particularly impressive progress.
There are numerous aspects and numerous instances of the development of the internal market in the new Member States that one could mention.
The Commission is sure that the delegation of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection which is visiting Poland could also cite numerous other such successes.
The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament for this important own initiative report.
We are particularly satisfied with the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the internal market in the new Member States.
Almost one year after the enlargement of the European Union, the report by MrsÂ Handzlik comments, we are satisfied to note, with a particularly penetrating eye, on the â to a large degree â positive image of the operation of the internal market in the new Member States.
The analysis and recommendations contained in the report summarise the achievements and the objectives which will ensure that the internal market operates as smoothly as possible.
Allow me to refer briefly to certain points of the report.
The proper transposition of Community legislation is prerequisite to the smooth operation of the internal market.
The Member States must perform their duties; some do so very well, others are lagging behind.
However, what is truly impressive in the new Member States is the targets which have been attained over the last two years. In particular, the new Member States have done very well in transposing Community legislation into national law.
According to the most recent information, Lithuania is top of the league of the 25 Member States, with a transposition deficit of just 1%.
Certain old Member States have not done as well.
The Member States must address more seriously the 1.5% target, which was agreed at various meetings of the European Council.
They must also make a greater effort to ensure that directives on the internal market are transposed correctly and on time.
The conclusions of the resolution are absolutely in keeping with the Commission's position including, for example, on the need for more intensive administrative cooperation between the authorities of the Member States, as is already happening in the SOLVIT problem-solving network.
These procedures for resolving differences amicably satisfy the market players and make a positive contribution to the operation of the internal market in Europe.
It is clear that the new Member States are not confining themselves to pronouncements; on the contrary, they are particularly willing to improve their performance and to create the right conditions for the development of innovation, which is most encouraging.
This is precisely the approach that guarantees the success of the internal market.
We must not forget that the smooth operation of the internal market is one of the basic preconditions to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives.
However, I should like to add that the Commission will need, in turn, to do its job.
Instead of producing more and more legislation, we will now need to take advantage of the opportunity to focus on doing less but better work.
This includes the simplification of legislation, in close cooperation with the new Member States and with the old Member States, and providing better information and guidance in connection with consumer rights and the opportunities citizens have to work and establish in an enlarged Union.
In coming years, we must make the European Union a more attractive location for business activity and investment and the creation of a modern and successful internal market certainly constitutes an important first step towards achieving this objective.
We are relying on the support of the European Parliament to face this challenge.
To close, I should like to say this: we are optimistic and believe that the new Member States bring new momentum to the European Union and are a breath of fresh air which benefits us all.
Â Â  for the . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first to congratulate rapporteur Mrs Handzlik on her very successful first report in the European Parliament and to thank the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection for its initiative to prepare this important report.
With the latest enlargement, 10 new states became members of the European Union as from 1 May 2004, but only in the legal meaning of the word.
In reality, our countries will have to carry out a lot of work in various areas in order to gradually become fully fledged Member States.
One of these areas is the transposition of directives and other Community acts to their national legal systems with a view to building a functioning, barrier-free common internal market.
The report gives a concise overview of the state of the transposition of European legislation in individual Member States.
Although my country â Slovakia â often called the âcentral European tigerâ under the competent leadership of Prime Minister MikulÃ¡Å¡ Dzurinda â belongs among the EU Member States that do not have the best track record of the transposition of European legislation, economic reforms have enabled the country to make big strides in implementing the medium-term economic strategy.
To eliminate the remaining obstacles in the internal market, it is absolutely necessary to consolidate and improve the European legislation.
The Commission should start revising the existing Community legislation with a view to its simplification.
I am firmly opposed to bureaucratic directives that regulate and prescribe everything.
We should, in conformity with the subsidiarity principle, let the Member States do what they can do with greater flexibility and effectiveness.
On the other hand, we need the directives that have liberalising effects.
Let us not be afraid to expediently adopt a new service directive, maybe similar to the one of Bolkenstein, that will breathe new life into the revised Lisbon strategy.
I firmly believe this and I think so do many of you.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the name of the European Socialists, I welcome the report; its contents are accurate and contain feasible recommendations.
I am especially glad that we are debating this report almost exactly on the first anniversary of the accession.
According to the report, the has not only been fully implemented by several new Member States to the required extent, but often even with extra rigour that most of the existing Members have not yet applied.
Interestingly enough, instead of improving the Internal Market, it partly distorted it at the same time, for the following reasons: succeeding the political changeover, the countries have only made partial progress in economic reforms.
98% of the business structure is characterised by small and medium enterprises that struggle with capital deficit and their access to information is limited.
The prolonged costs involved with adopting the will still remain a burden for new Member States for several more years.
On the other hand, enlargement with these ten plus two Members brought about some less frequently emphasised general changes as well as those which existed earlier.
The nearly 150 million new members make up one third of the EUâs population.
Around the time of accession, the economies of the existing Member States, unlike those at previous enlargements, are less prosperous and they are awaiting reforms themselves.
It is a good thing with the current enlargement, that there no longer exists two world systems.
Politicians carry a great responsibility.
Politicians, who regard the EP as an international stage for national political debate â even though originally it was not their intention â become obstacles to solving EU problems.
A European politician strives to create a framework for solution at an EU level, where all Member States may find the crutches that they need in order to take their next step at home.
I hope we all belong to this group.
What should we do?
We need a political style that is clear, factual and calms emotions, instead of stirring them up.
We need to restore quickly the balance of the Internal Market, which is most definitely guaranteed to limit the movement of the labour force.
For the new Member States, completing the Internal Market means proper functioning of the administrative system, while in the case of the majority of existing Member States, it includes meeting their own target of the 1.5% deficit limit.
Future European legislation must not lead to the distortion of the Internal Market (like the Service Directive did, for example), nor should it encumber the economy with enormous costs (see Directive on Rice, for instance), especially affecting disadvantaged parties.
It is the responsibility of politicians and of the whole institutional system to put law into daily practice governing the life of European citizens.
A good example of this is the department of DG Enterprise that supports small enterprises, including the European Information Centres, which are so successful in Hungary and other countries.
A negative example, however, is that the forms used to differentiate between enterprises are still not available in all the languages of the Member States.
A politician once said, âpeople are not prisoners of their fate, but of their opinionsâ.
We must do our best in order to bring about change, instead of political bluffing ...
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to say something about this outstanding report by Mrs Handzlik, to whom I would also like to express my gratitude.
Along with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we visited the businesses in her Chamber of Commerce.
She must be a paragon of how people in the new Member States view the Internal Market and I think that her report also reflects this and draws on it.
I would like to congratulate her on this, and to say, in this connection, that the new Member States have sacrificed a great deal in order to be able to meet Europeâs conditions.
They tightened their belts for years and, as the report states, have in many cases, been even more efficient than many old Member States in introducing the .
It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to be given more scope for imposing sanctions, thereby facilitating the enforced implementation of directives, because that will only stimulate, improve and optimise the free market even more.
The internal market has brought us economic prosperity, which, in turn, guarantees political stability, which leads to peace, and I think that was why it was decided at an early stage to add a large number of new Member States to the European Union.
I am pleased that Mrs Gebhardt has somewhat broadened the discussion on the Services Directive, because services are one of the key areas which have not been liberalised as yet.
I think it is necessary to have a good discussion so as to end up with an excellent result for this Services Directive.
I think that the debate thus far sends a very weak message to the new Member States.
Indeed, it would be detrimental if we gave the new Member States the idea that despite their many sacrifices, and despite the fact that the old Member States welcome new markets with open arms, we do not appreciate any extra competition.
We Liberals take the view that competition leads to innovation, which, in turn, leads to new jobs.
It is impossible to keep the cheap workforces in Europe.
Unfortunately, we have to establish that they go off to China.
I therefore believe that innovative jobs with added value are beneficial to the market, and I hope that we, in that respect, can wrap up the Services Directive in a positive manner.

Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Mrs Handzlik, for your report, and for your efforts in identifying the challenges faced by the new Member States, in particular, in the process â as yet unfinished â of completing the internal market.
Cooperation with you has been good, and we owe you thanks for having taken on board a number of our suggestions, but, despite that, our group has nonetheless voted against this report in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. We have done this not out of some sort of opposition to an open and truly functioning European internal market â quite the contrary, in fact, for it is one of the most important conditions for the European Union to grow together.
Nor do we have any objection to many of the passages in the report, but we do have misgivings about some of its conclusions.
Almost a year ago, we rejoiced with the new Member States, for it was more than a matter of necessity for most of them that, after more than 60Â yearsâ separation from it, they should regain the position in Europe to which their cultural history self-evidently entitled them.
Our group does, however, wish to express its opposition to the unhindered operation of what are termed market forces.
We have no desire to see unfair competition engaged in to the detriment of highly motivated and dedicated workers from the new Member States.
We do not want them to be fobbed off with the lowest wages that employers can get away with paying and to have inadequate access to support from trade unions and social partners.
We want quality standards and social factors to continue to be built in all 25 Member States, with the environment and consumers still being protected.
As we are at the moment particularly concerned with the Commissionâs proposed services directive, we have again tabled an amendment on this subject, which expresses our implacable opposition to the country of origin principle.
While I am aware that this is contrary to the rapporteurâs thinking, I would nonetheless ask for your support.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left â Nordic Green Left is truly greatly surprised by the reference in the report to the undeniable economic success of the internal market and the assessment that it has been a driving force in the promotion of economic cohesion and the progressive removal of regional disparities.
I agree absolutely with this assessment, if and insofar as the reference to economic success concerns businesses.
Without doubt, it has indeed been a huge success for them.
However, we were under the impression that the internal market was part of the efforts of the European Union to remove regional disparities and offer a better quality of life to all European citizens.
From this point of view, the internal market has failed, just as the Lisbon policy has failed and just as all the policies based on the neoliberal philosophy will continue to fail.
We need radical restructuring and to again make the citizen the centre of interest of the Union; we need a strategy that focuses on people.
What we need today is to achieve real convergence in the quality of life of all the citizens of the Union, not convergence of local economies in numerical terms, convergence which contributes to the prosperity and smooth operation of the free market system, but not to the prosperity of European citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank MrsÂ Handzlik, the rapporteur, for her all-encompassing research, and I have to say that the report shows that, one year after they have become part of the European Union internal market, all in all the situation in the new Member States with regard to the adoption of legislation does not seem any worse than in the older Member States.
We can see an almost equal proportion of positive and negative examples in both the older and the new Member States.
Business people in the new Member States are still having difficulties in acquiring the operating mechanism of the internal market, particularly in sectors which are not harmonised.
In the harmonised spheres, however, the infrastructure for conformity assessment is not always accessible to them in their own countries for the products which they produce.
I could go on enumerating separate problems, but these cannot eclipse the achievements of the European Unionâs internal market.
However, even relatively recently, we heard concerns being expressed in all the countries that were then still EU applicant countries that the free movement of goods might be disastrous for economies experiencing the shocks of a change of economic system.
Industry that was still weak would not be able to withstand the competition of powerful producers in EU Member States.
Certainly, many businesses in the new Member States that had not consolidated their position in the market went bankrupt as a result of competitive pressure from businesses in the older Member States, but business activity has of course not decreased.
Quite the contrary: the increase in competition has activated the market, and consumers have, of course, gained from this.
We can observe a surprising degree of similarity between the opinions of that time about the threats the European Union common market might pose to the new Member States and todayâs debates about the possible threats posed by the European Union services directive to the older Member States.
The most striking similarity in these debates is the way consumersâ interests are being ignored.
The consumer is not being listened to.
It is the opinion of businesses who are worried about a possible increase in competition that is being expressed.
The first amendment tabled on todayâs agenda, to reject the country of origin principle for services in the internal market, is in point of fact equivalent to a proposal to reject the internal market.
The country of origin principle is the ruling principle in European Union internal market legislation, and the decisions of the European Court of Justice have confirmed this.
In those service sectors where competition currently exists, the market gains from additional competition and, of course, the consumer also gains.
Currently, even successful small and medium-sized enterprises in Member States are prevented from crossing the borders of their own countries in order to offer services in other Member States because of the high financial and bureaucratic costs.
The application of the country of origin principle to the provision of services would open up the European Union internal market to the most important service providers in the Member States, that is small and medium-sized enterprises.
Arguments about the threat to the European social model are completely rebutted by the directive adopted almost ten years ago concerning the placement of workers in the services sector.
Consumers wish to obtain goods and services of the highest possible quality and for the lowest possible price, but the best way to ensure this is a competitive market and the European Union internal ...
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrsÂ Handzlik for drafting such an interesting report on the situation of the internal market in the new Member States.
I should also like to share with you two thoughts on the report.
The average citizen of poorer societies assesses the internal market mainly in terms of the changes in the price of goods and services following accession to the Union.
Prices of many basic products and services increased dramatically, and there is no economic justification for this.
Mechanisms designed to ensure competitiveness and systems of consumer protection failed.
In Socialist times we were supposed to be cheered by the news that the price of locomotives was down even though the price of bread was up.
What grounds for optimism are there in the present situation?
My second observation concerns the problem of market monopolies.
Many concerns have seen their profits double, not because of increased productivity, but also as a result of price policy.
There are a great many examples of this, notably fuel.
It seems to me that solutions are urgently called for.
The Union constitutes a large and attractive market. This should be exploited with a view to regulating âŠ
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by thanking MrsÂ Handzlik, and congratulating her on having drafted such an interesting and important report.
MrsÂ Handzlik is a fellow member of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and a compatriot of mine.
Her report is important for us not only because, if I am not mistaken, it is the first report drafted by a female Polish MEP, but also because it concerns a particularly important issue, one that is crucial to the economic development of the European Union.
I refer to the functioning of a truly common and free market for services within the European Union.
If we consider that services account for 70% of the Unionâs GDP, the importance of this issue can be readily appreciated.
So too can the importance of developing the market for services within the EU.
At this time, when there is much debate on the Constitutional Treaty in a number of European countries, the subject of the services directive and of a truly free, open and competitive market for services in Europe constitutes one of the key issues in the debate.
There are strong misgivings about opening up the European market for services fully to cooperation.
Many fears have been expressed too concerning the possibility of businesses and service providers from the new Member States being able to operate within this market. These views were reflected in some of what MrsÂ Kallenbach said just now.
I should simply like to refer to one important piece of news provided by none other than PresidentÂ Chirac in the course of the important debate currently under way in France.
PresidentÂ Chirac stated that as a result of enlargement, exports from France to new EU Member States in Eastern Europe had quadrupled.
This translates into something close to EURÂ 10Â billion, and 130Â 000 new jobs in France.
Such then are the consequences of operating a truly broad and free European market.
There is no reason to fear enlargement or genuine competition within a market like this.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you, Mrs Handzlik, for presenting this report, which adds up to a really good piece of work.
Many thanks, too, for the frankness you have shown in cooperating with the other groups.
That, I think, is what our cooperation here in this House should be like.
I know that I will be disappointing Mrs Kallenbach when I say that our group will not be able to support her amendment.
As she said, we are fundamentally very much in favour of a services directive being drafted, and of the services market being opened up; we do not, however, want it to happen any old how, but in a truly socially acceptable manner.
We are able to support Mrs Handzlikâs report, which contains some very important statements.
In paragraph 5, for example, it is stated that the new Member States have implemented the mutual recognition principle in their legislation.
It is also stated that they have adopted the highest standards as guidelines to achieving harmonisation, which is a crucial objective of the internal market.
These things are what matter to the public in the European Union, and I think that is what we have to achieve.
The Committee came to an agreement that there would be no place in this report for the provisions to be worked out for the services directive, and that we would, instead, discuss these issues in the report on that directive, which is where they belong.
We have kept to that agreement, as has Mrs Handzlik, and I think that is only right and proper.
We Social Democrats have our own particular reason for endorsing this report, for, in paragraph 14, we agreed that, desirable though a market in services is, we do also take the view that efforts to that end must not prejudice social cohesion in the EU, and that consumers must enjoy a high level of protection.
Such is the task we in this House have set ourselves where the services directive is concerned, and we will continue to work at it in future.
For that reason, too, I congratulate Mrs Handzlik, and I congratulate this our Parliament on having produced this report on the current state of play in the new Member States, and on the imminent report on consumer protection.
At the same time, though, I do hope that this is the last time that we shall do so.
I hope that future reports will take as their subject the whole European Union, making no distinction between âoldâ and ânewâ, but depicting it as a whole.
Â Â  Mr. President, one year has passed since the largest phase of the enlargement of the European Union.
Ten new states which had gone through the painful experience of Soviet occupation and were just recently called countries in a transitional market economy, joined the European Union internal market with the four essential freedoms of the market: free movement of persons, services, goods and capital.
After one year of work experience in the conditions of the internal market, the statistics of the new states on transposition of the directives related to the internal market proves that the newcomers quite successfully implemented their commitments.
In particular, I would like to highlight the progress of Lithuania, the country where I have been elected to the European Parliament.
Lithuania is the best amongst the new Member States and better than most of more experienced old Member States at implementing the of the internal market.
One such successful indicator was the Protocol on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products, recommended by the European Commission to the candidate countries as an instrument for preparation to work under the conditions of the internal market.
Many countries successfully implemented the directives of the new approach a year before EU membership, but here we talk about the successful implementation of the free movement of goods.
A different situation occurs while implementing the movement of services and persons.
Revisions of the directive on services, having eliminated the principle of origin, impede the development of the internal market of services.
It remains fragmentary, restricted and protected.
Talking about the free movement of persons, I would like to remind you that according to the request of the old Member States the transitional period of seven years is applied to the new Member States.
Only a few states have opened their labour markets since the enlargement.
Therefore, I invite the Parliament, the European Commission and especially the Member States, without postponing the decisions for an indefinite time, to create a fully functional internal market and thus provide real possibilities for implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me as the coordinator for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to welcome my colleague Mrs Handzlik and her first report and my colleagues from Poland and Slovakia who spoke so eloquently.
One of the reasons for drafting this report was the fact that the new Member States are already teaching all of us a lot about how to deal with the internal market.
By happy coincidence the Committee on the Internal Market went on a mission to Poland a few weeks ago.
We went to Mrs Handzlikâs home town and we met the businesses in her Chamber of Commerce.
There are businesses there, large and small, who are really frustrated about the way that some of the existing Member States are still hampering their access to the European market.
Believe me, the new Member States have a lot to teach us.
If you look at the reports on the internal market you will find that in many cases the new Member States are at the top of the list for transposing internal market directives.
Is it not extraordinary that after all this time it is the old Member States that are lagging behind?
That is why we wanted to draw up this report, because the new Member States have so much to teach us.
Inevitably there has been discussion this morning about the services directive.
As the shadow rapporteur I would like to say the biggest problem we face in Europe at the moment is unemployment.
Since 1999 the majority of new jobs in Europe have been created in the services business.
We have to create an effective and functioning new market for services.
We have to get a directive that works satisfactorily.
We can deal with the problems that are being raised, but we have to do the job properly.
On this side of the House we will lead the way in delivering an effective services directive and continuing the transformation of the European economy, with the new Member States coming with us.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Handzlik on drawing up the first report by a new Member from a new Member State in a new committee.
As the chairman of that committee, I think her report has been a commendable initiative.
It is right to emphasise today what the new Member States have achieved instead of to carp at the difficulties and challenges they might pose.
In the old Member States we see anxieties and sometimes a state of denial about what the expansion will mean to us.
That is playing out now in some of the debates about the Constitution.
It is playing out in some of the rhetoric about the fear of what immigration from the new Member States may do.
My own view is that it is a task for this Parliament to welcome the expansion of the European Union in the fullest terms.
Recently, I have had the opportunity not only to go with the delegation to Poland, but also to go to Hungary in a business delegation with representatives of my own region.
We have heard today in the voices of MrsÂ Handzlik, Mrs PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡ and all our friends precisely what their ambitions are and why they should be supported.
The internal market needs to free up services in a manner consistent with empowering consumers as well as entrepreneurs and in a manner that combines social and economic goals.
They cannot be separated out.
I must say to our friends in the new Member States that to believe that raw capitalism will give you all you need and will be your servant is an error.
All these elements need to be in balance.
I would say to those who came to my country, the United Kingdom, from the new Member States: you are welcome.
I am proud to say in the middle of the British general election campaign that we are right to have given free entry into our market to people from the new Member States.
We will prosper, our capital accumulation will prosper, our culture will prosper, our cuisine will prosper!
We welcome you, and I am delighted to be able to say that.
I hope Mr Harbour will go back and tell the Conservative Party in Britain that it should take that same welcoming view.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, only a few short years ago most of the countries that joined the EU in 2004 were trapped in a different political system.
We differed from the rest of Europe in nearly every respect and had very little in common with it, other than being located on the same continent.
Even that was not always seen in a positive light.
Today we are debating details of our life together, the removal of barriers, and overcoming difficulties.
MrsÂ Handzlikâs excellent report identifies the problems faced by all the Member States, and ways of overcoming them.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts and for all the work she has put into drafting the report.
It is to be hoped that all 24Â points will be implemented as quickly as possible.
Many successes have been recorded, but the bitter words uttered in the course of various debates, such as the debates on discrimination in the internal market or on the methods of reciprocity suggest that much still remains to be done.
Nothing is perfect, and there is always room for improvement.
It is also important to be aware that even the best of provisions are not an instant solution to problems.
Member States need to make the necessary efforts to implement provisions if they are to be effective.
The record on this varies considerably.
Attempts to circumvent directives or to burden the European Union with decisions detrimental to the interests of consumers are an everyday occurrence.
Sometimes we seem to be acting as if we had forgotten where we are heading and what the Constitutional Treaty states.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your comments and questions which I will pass on to my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy.
Regarding the amendment tabled by Mrs Kallenbach on the proposed services directive, I would just like to say that we should not use this excellent report as a vehicle to intervene in the current work on the services proposal.
This weekend we will be celebrating the first year of the European Union of 25 Member States.
The adoption of this report is therefore very timely and it shows that there is good reason for optimism about the internal market.
We note that there is still some work ahead of us.
This will always be so but overall we see a very positive picture with the ten new Member States performing well, and in a number of cases outperforming the others.
The move from an internal market of 15 to an internal market of 25 is providing a new dynamic.
We should use this dynamic to move ahead in removing barriers and create further opportunities for our companies and our citizens.
I would again like to thank Mrs Handzlik for her excellent report.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place in a moment.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, last night we held a debate in this House based on two parliamentary questions tabled by the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in relation to the EU delegation to the POPs Conference to be held in Punta del Este next week.
The questions and the resolutions supporting them were put to the Commission and the Council.
Despite the fact that the Council had adequate notice, no-one from the Council turned up last night to respond to these questions.
The Commissioner himself was here.
I would like an explanation as to why parliamentary questions tabled by the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety were ignored by the Council.
Â Â  There is nobody here from the Council to reply, Mrs Doyle, so we will forward your comments to the Council.
I am sure it will be able to reply in due course.
Â Â  Mr. President, a very good remark that it is necessary to talk about smuggling into Trans-Dniester.
However, I believe that right here, at the edge of Europe, there is another source of smuggling, that is, the Kaliningrad region, from where large amounts of smuggled goods come into European Union countries.
So far, they come in very large quantities to Lithuania and Poland.
I really do not exclude the possibility, on which the experts also agree, that this contraband can also reach the old Member States of the European Union.
First of all, this is contraband of excise goods.
Therefore, our suggestion is to also include in paragraph 12 the Kaliningrad region as a particular risk, thus urging a stop to the flow of contraband from this territory into the countries of the European Union.
Thank you.
Â Â  Perhaps it would help if I read the oral amendment.
It simply adds the words âas well as Russia to crack down on smuggling from the Kaliningrad regions to Lithuania and Polandâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, this oral amendment is merely to ensure that there is consistency and accuracy in the section on Morocco.
I propose that the end of paragraph 13 should read: ânotes that a moratorium on the death penalty exists in Morocco and calls on the Moroccan authorities to abolish the death penaltyâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with regard to the proposed reference to the Baker plan, you probably all know that it has disappeared from the new proposals by the United Nations Secretary-General.
That is why I tabled AmendmentÂ 3.
I will also request a split vote on AmendmentÂ 15 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to delete the reference to the Baker plan.
Â Â  I am advised that if we approve General Morillonâs oral amendment, it would remove the references to the Baker Plan from all amendments.
Is that correct, General Morillon?
Â Â  No, because we would then have to vote on AmendmentÂ 17, which itself relates essentially to the Baker plan.
If AmendmentÂ 17 is not adopted, this will relate to AmendmentÂ 15 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
Â Â  Colleagues, I should like to ask the rapporteur for some advice on this.
Â Â  . Mr President, as rapporteur, my advice on this particular section is not to accept an oral amendment in relation to the Baker Plan.
I think the PSE Group has a balanced amendment in this case â i.e. Amendment 15 â and my advice is to accept that one.
You lost that one, General!
Â Â  Mr President, may I ask whether you were in the habit of addressing Ian Paisley as âReverendâ in the days when he was a Member of this House, and whether the reverend gentleman would have been expected to stand when addressing the Chair?
Â Â  Mr Wieland, I am not sure I understand the point you are making.
Would you mind repeating it?
Â Â  Mr President, there were inaccuracies in paragraph 43 concerning revisions in the 2003 Criminal Code of Uzbekistan, and those revisions essentially said that torture and maltreatment of prisoners is a criminal act.
Therefore, I suggest revising the text that has been presented in the original paragraph.
âCalls on Uzbekistan to liberate political prisoners and to outlaw torture and ill-treatment in custodyâ
to replace by text
âWelcomes amendments to the Criminal Code for outlawing torture and ill-treatment in custody and persecuting their use made in 2003; calls on Uzbekistan genuinely to implement these changes and to liberate any remaining political prisoners.â
Â Â  I shall now ask the rapporteur for a comment on that.
Â Â  . Mr President, in my view this text improves the accuracy of the report and as rapporteur I am happy to strongly support it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I fear I am attempting the impossible here, but we will see how it goes.
I am proposing an oral amendment as a compromise amendment to Amendment 8.
If it were to be accepted paragraphÂ 131 would read: âRecognises the impact of mass rape in making women and girls vulnerable to contracting HIV/AIDS; urges the EU to ensure that the provision of full medical attention be made available immediately to all women and girls who have been raped;â.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to put forward an oral amendment.
I ask that the words âand countries seeking accessionâ be added in all the paragraphs in which action is demanded on the part of the Member States, the candidate countries, or the Council, as Recital H makes explicit reference to Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This would make no sense if these regions were themselves not called upon to take action.
I will want to bring in another oral amendment when we get to Recital H.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we intend to table an oral amendment to paragraphÂ 17; we have already notified you of this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have an oral amendment to paragraphÂ 17.
I will read the paragraph: âUrges Member States and candidate countries to introduce special scholarship and trainee programmes for disadvantaged Roma studentsâ.
We propose inserting: âand for all other disadvantaged studentsâ.
Mrs de Groen-Kouwenhoven wishes to move two oral amendments to insert new paragraphs after existing paragraphs 18 and 20.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to table two oral amendments to add two paragraphs to the resolution.
As all five groups supported these important paragraphs, there should not be a problem.
The text of those paragraphs should be on your desks, but, if you prefer, I could read them to the House.
Â Â  You must read them, otherwise they would not be oral amendments!
Â Â  Mr President, I thought there were no illiterate people here but I will obey the Rules.
The first paragraph is: â18a. Welcomes the formation of the European Roma and Travellers Forum, and the work of groups within Parliament focused on Roma and minority issues; recognises the importance of cooperation with such bodies when creating Roma policies in Europe;â
The second paragraph is: â20a. Welcomes the Decade of Roma Inclusion initiative to which five Member States and candidate countries are signatories and calls on the Commission to work in cohesion with those governments concerned to align relevant EU programme funding to realise this initiative;â.
Â Â  Mr President, I have another oral amendment to move, and it has to do with Recital H. I simply do not think that the original version of this, as it stands, does justice to the facts of the situation by stating that the Roma in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to be victims of ethnic cleansing.
I propose that this recital be amended, for the sake of clarity, to read as follows, and will now read it out in English.
âwhereas a large number of Roma were victims of war and ethnic cleansing and continue to be victims of persecution in parts of regions of the former Republic of Yugoslaviaâ.
The PSE Group proposes that the text of Amendment 4 be inserted at the end of existing paragraph 25, rather than forming a new paragraph.
Was that your point, Mr Purvis?
Â Â  That was my point, Mr President.
I agree with the rapporteur that the following text should be added to the end of paragraph 25: âFurther asks the Commission to prioritise amendment or removal of any legislation that is detrimental to the smooth functioning of European financial marketsâ.
That would replace paragraph 26, which should be deleted.
Â Â  Are there are any objections to Mr Purvisâ oral amendment?
Â Â  . Mr President, there are two proposed additions to paragraph 25.
We have to vote first on Amendment 4 by the Verts/ALE Group and then on the oral amendment by Mr Purvis to take the original paragraph 26 also as an addition to paragraph 25.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
It is to change the wording relating to âbankingâ as follows: âRequests that the Commission provide a comprehensive study of retail financial services with a special emphasis on banking services in the various Member Statesâ.
This puts the emphasis on banking, but does not restrict the study to banking services only.
Â Â  Mr President, I have an oral amendment to paragraph 38, which will also replace Amendment 1: âConsiders that Member States have long and diverse traditions in consumer protection; notes that the [one word deleted] call from part of the financial services industry is for minimum harmonisation, whereas certain practitioners, notably the banking industry, advocate targeted harmonisation in order to achieve a true level playing field; therefore, urges the Commission to organise a discussion about the fundamental structure of the EU financial services market, bearing in mind consumer and practitioner interests and European global competitiveness;â.
If Amendment 15 is adopted, the PSE Group proposes that the amended text be inserted after paragraph 25.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is also an oral amendment and it is to replace the words âregulated competitionâ with âfair competitionâ.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of the report concluding the agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Brazil, in view of the interest on both sides in developing cooperation in various fields.
The most pressing areas on which the agreement is based are public administration, economic cooperation, social development, research, technology and the environment.
In this context, it is proposed that cooperation be developed in areas such as biotechnology, information technology and communications, bio-information, space, micro-technologies and nano-technologies, materials research, clean technologies, the sustainable management and use of environmental resources, health and medicine, aeronautics, metrology, standardisation and conformity assessment, and human sciences.
The agreement also mentions that the parties intend to establish cooperation in the area of scientific and technological research, so that cooperation will be increased in various areas and that both sides, the EU and Brazil, will enjoy the economic and social benefits of this cooperation.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of concluding the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Federative Republic of Brazil.
I believe that appropriate instruments must be created with a view to substantially extending the current level of cooperation, within the framework of the activities that fall under the sixth framework programme for international cooperation with developing countries.
Parliament must therefore continue to foster the creation of cooperation mechanisms in scientific and technological innovation.
The European Research Area is the perfect environment in which to enhance and step up cooperation between Brazil and the EU, given the importance of science and technology in economic and social development and given the desire on both sides to broaden and strengthen cooperation in areas of shared interest.
Â Â  . The Agreement for scientific cooperation between the European Community and Mexico is a crucial instrument for improving and stepping up cooperation between Mexico and the EU in science and technology.
I believe that appropriate instruments must be created with a view to substantially extending the current level of cooperation, within the framework of the activities that fall under the sixth framework programme for international cooperation with developing countries.
Parliament must therefore continue to foster the creation of cooperation mechanisms in scientific and technological innovation.
The European Research Area is the perfect environment in which to enhance and step up cooperation between Mexico and the EU, given the importance of science and technology in economic and social development and given the desire on both sides to broaden and strengthen cooperation in areas of shared interest.
Â Â  . According freedom of movement to some of the EUâs citizens and not to others goes against the EUâs principles of equal treatment.
Its system of quotas enables Switzerland to counteract any eventual adverse consequences arising from increased free movement of persons.
Despite having voted in favour of the protocol, I wish to point out that what was termed the âvisa affairâ in Germany has now taken on a new dimension.
The âif in doubt, opt for freedom of movementâ ruling resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of visa applications by third-country nationals that were approved, to the extent that the number more than doubled, with many âtouristsâ taking up employment in the black economy or ending up in prostitution.
Such generosity, the consequences of which are as yet incalculable, might well fuel some Swiss peopleâs fears and misgivings to such a degree that the protocol will fail to be approved by the referendum that may be held in September.
The eventual upshot of that would be that the EU would have to decide whether or not to withdraw from the Agreement on the free movement of persons rather than offend the new Member States.
Â Â  . The agreement between the EU and Switzerland on the free movement of persons following EU enlargement in May 2004 was not automatically extended to include the new Member States.
Switzerland, like EU Member States, is benefiting from the recent enlargement, through greater political stability in its geographical neighbourhood and through the newly enlarged internal market.
I voted in favour of this recommendation, because I feel that this agreement will make it much easier to send Swiss staff to the new Member States, where many Swiss companies are already active.
At the same time, citizens from new Member States can now be more easily recruited by Swiss companies.
In the long run, all citizens from EU Member States and Switzerland will benefit from free movement.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of Mr Coelhoâs recommendation for a second reading on âaccess to the Schengen Information System by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehiclesâ, as it reflects the need to combat vehicle theft, in an EU in which internal border checks have been all but scrapped.
In light of the figure published by Europol that 1Â 149Â 114 cars were stolen in the EU in 2002 alone, I believe that the EU must, as a matter of urgency, take action to combat the trade in stolen vehicles.
Â Â  We believe that the stated legal basis for the current regulation is mistaken.
Extending the Schengen Convention so that the bodies responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles in the Member States are given access to data in the Schengen Information System cannot be based on common transport legislation.
This is a third pillar issue concerning legal and police cooperation.
It is for the Council, not Parliament, to take decisions about these issues.
The June List has therefore voted against the amendments.
Â Â  . The need to safeguard security and compliance with the law in a freer and bigger Europe mean that lawmakers must seek to protect the citizens whilst guaranteeing that the authorities have the necessary conditions in place to boost security.
Citizens must also be protected, however, from unnecessary and unwanted State interference in the private sphere.
In other words, as usual a balance must be maintained, even on issues that may seem trivial, between ensuring security and promoting freedom.
This applies to the legislation that is the subject of the recommendation before us, which I voted in favour of.
Â Â  Pollution from households, agriculture and industry is increasing.
It reduces the quality of groundwater.
When groundwater is polluted, the consequences are longer-lasting than when surface water is polluted.
Groundwater is an important resource for drinking water and for industrial and agricultural processes.
It should therefore be protected for current and future use.
We Social Democrats therefore welcome the Commissionâs initiative concerning new regulations governing groundwater.
Groundwater is not, however, identical throughout the EU.
It is therefore difficult to come up with a common standard suited to groundwater as it is variously to be found in the EU and, at the same time, entailing the most beneficial result for the environment.
We believe that an approach taking greater account of the big differences in groundwater between one part of the EU and another would have had a more productive effect on the environment.
Â Â  . The precautionary principle must be applied with regard to protecting groundwater against pollution, and this is currently laid down in Directive 80/68/EC, until 2013.
The protection should thereafter be continued through what is known as the Water Framework Directive, of 2000, and through the directive now receiving its first reading.
Among the various different opinions on what approach to take, the report advocates that quality standards should be based on human and eco-toxicological criteria and points out that when setting quality standards the Member States may take into account the levels of substances naturally present in water.
The rapporteur points out, however, that the new legislation must maintain at least the current level of protection, and that prevention should be a key element.
There must subsequently be the political will to take the necessary measures aimed at preventing pollution and protecting groundwater quality.
Â Â  The June Listâs members are elected with a mandate to ensure that only cross-border environmental issues are decided on at EU level.
The Council should have the central role in this decision-making process.
The groundwater issue is partly a cross-border issue.
We regret that the Directive on groundwater does not refer to a greater extent to the principle of subsidiarity.
The Directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution should therefore apply for roughly three years whereupon it should be replaced by a directive incorporating the principle of subsidiarity.
Â Â  I voted in favour of this directive.
This directive must not deviate from the principles adopted in the Water Framework Directive.
In view of the considerable diversity of bodies of groundwater in Europe, precise objectives can only be set at local level.
It is unrealistic to try to impose the same standards on the whole of Europe.
Only a limited number of parameters can be subject to quality standards laid down at European level.
Thus, the proposal that the parameters of nitrates and pesticides should be the only ones laid down at European level seems acceptable in this case.
On the other hand, we need to put certain situations in context.
The fact that the quality standard or threshold value is contravened does not necessarily mean that the body of groundwater is of poor quality; the causes of the failure must be examined so that the measures recommended in the Water Framework Directive can be applied to restore the quality of the water.
Finally, certain specific local circumstances mean that historical pollution has to be taken into particular consideration without, however, leading inevitably to a downgrading of those bodies of water.
Obviously, the measures laid down in the Water Framework Directive to avoid the spread of pollution must apply in these cases.
Â Â  . The directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution, which sets out the rules for protecting such water against pollution, does not lay down clear quality objectives, nor does it provide for exhaustive and continuing assessment.
It must be revised in such a way that more of the available data on groundwater quality in Europe can be gathered.
In order that good chemical status can be achieved by 2015, it is crucial to keep clean groundwater clean.
I voted in favour of this report because I believe it is essential to improve the tools for protecting the environment and the quality objectives for water in Europe.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending the regulation on the creation of a European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.
We think it important that the foundationâs working methods and the composition of its board be continually reviewed so that it might operate more efficiently.
It would, however, cause problems if the review were to be undertaken by the whole of the European Parliament, since few MEPs are aware of how the Foundation operates.
We also believe that recruitment should be according to the applicantâs merits and that it should be gender-neutral.
It is in the organisationâs interests to have a board uniting a variety of skills and experience, but there must be no political control of recruitment.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Harkin, because I feel that we are faced with new challenges in terms of improving living and working conditions.
I welcome the objectives behind the creation of this foundation and I believe that the amendments put forward will certainly help it to be implemented more smoothly and effectively.
The principles of good governance are essential to the smooth running of Europeâs institutions and should thus be the cornerstone of any revision and assessment of their constitutional texts.
Â Â  . The regulation that set up the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in 1975 is being revised, to follow up the results of an external audit.
The purpose of the Foundation is to develop ideas on improving living and working conditions in the medium and long term, and to identify factors leading to change.
The main amendments are intended to bring about an internal restructuring of the Foundationâs management bodies, greater participation by independent experts and an increased role for the social partners and representatives of national governments.
This strategic and operational revision will thus enable the Foundation to carry out its work with greater efficiency and transparency.
By providing information and analysis on living and working conditions, the Foundation has played a significant role in developing the Communityâs social policy.
I therefore voted in favour of these amendments.
Â Â  . We welcome any attempts, provided they are workable, to improve safety and health at work.
Although Europe has a relatively good record on safety and health at work, there is much that it can still do to improve that record.
Throughout the EU, there are still clear cases in which health and safety at work is clearly not safeguarded and in which the rules are not being followed.
Serious work-related accidents therefore continue to happen.
In order to prevent such accidents, we must build up a firm foundation of suitable legislation, ensure that this legislation is complied with and promote good practice.
This is what I hope this new agency will be able to accomplish.
Â Â  . Following an external audit to assess the functioning of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (Bilbao), the Commission has tabled a number of amendments to the regulation establishing it.
I voted in favour of the report, given that the amendments are intended to clarify the Agencyâs objectives and responsibilities, to improve its functioning, to strengthen the role of the social partners and to enhance cooperation with other bodies operating in the social field.
This Agency plays a key role in disseminating information and encouraging people to exchange experiences on health and safety at work.
This task is crucial given the terrible tragedy of work-related accidents, which come at an incalculable human and financial cost.
The Agency also takes part in the decision-making process in that it provides the European institutions with the information needed to adopt legislation in the social field and, more importantly, information on the impact of that legislation on small and medium-sized enterprises.
In addition to collecting and passing on information, the Agency will henceforth take on the task of analysing data relating to safety and health at work.
I wholeheartedly support any amendment aimed at making this Agency more transparent and more efficient.
Â Â  . With regard to international matters, the EU must not overlook the fact that the various Member States have different relationships with third countries.
Legislation must therefore guarantee that each Member State is able to act and react to its own situation in relation to the world.
As the mechanism was difficult to use, it was not put into practice.
I therefore endorse the move to make it more flexible.
Furthermore, the availability of other avenues in terms of taking action has the potential to be useful and effective.
I therefore feel that we should support the solution that has been reached.
Â Â  . As I have stated in previous explanations of vote, the pressure put on the new Member States to incorporate the Community acquis into their national legislations is unacceptable.
They are peddled the argument that failing to transpose law would block the growth of the European economy and would exacerbate regional disparities.
This is a policy based on double standards.
On the one hand, it suggests that we must boost and develop the internal market, overcoming obstacles by harmonising national legislation, in order to allow goods, services and capital to move freely; whereas, on the other hand, it seeks to limit the movement of people from those countries and to restrict their rights.
The report before us does not take into account the specific characteristics of the new Member States and the fact that they lag behind the other Member States.
It also fails to address the need to set out measures to support the running of the markets in such a way as to promote economic and social cohesion.
Cohesion policy needs increased funding to be set aside in the financial perspective, so as to foster integration on the basis of economic development criteria of promoting jobs and social inclusion and of breaking down the imbalances between the regions and countries of the enlarged EU.
In that way, support to countries lagging behind in structural terms, such as Portugal, can be maintained.
Â Â  ( We believe that an efficient Internal Market in the EU is important.
Naturally, the new Member States must also adapt to this.
We object, however, to the adoption of political positions in the reportâs explanatory statement and to the Commission providing extra resources for developing professional bodies in the new Member States.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, because in my opinion an accurate assessment of the situation in the new Member States must be carried out.
Barriers to the movement of goods and services must be removed and replaced by open market conditions, so that opportunities can be created for these economies to grow.
Whilst I feel that it is first and foremost up to the private sector to make the most of these new opportunities, the public authorities must at the same time ensure that internal market directives are transposed correctly and on time.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to make a statement concerning the vote on MrÂ Coveneyâs report on human rights.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats definitely welcomes the Coveney Report as a whole and has therefore voted in favour of its adoption.
Like all Parliamentâs reports on human rights, it does of course carry a political message, and Mr Coveney, for whom my Group has high regard, has managed to hold in balance the various political tendencies represented in this House.
For this reason, I am all the more astonished and perturbed by the attitude of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which ended up abstaining from voting â despite having secured the acceptance of its two amendments on abortion â simply because its amendments relating to Cuba and Venezuela failed.
That is politically inept.
Acknowledging its importance, the PPE-DE Group voted in favour of the report as a whole.
I would, however, like to make it clear that we regard Amendments 8 and 9 with grave concern and have left it to our members to vote for or against them as a matter of conscience.
Why is this so?
Firstly, because the amendments call for access to abortion, which is hardly likely to be any sort of bulwark against human rights abuses.
Their primary concern is with women who have been raped, even though rape is clearly condemned elsewhere in the report.
Secondly, these amendments indirectly imply that abortion is a human right.
Abortion, though, is nothing of the sort; on the contrary, it violates human rights.
Even the United Nations understands that to be the case.
Thirdly, Articles 8 and 9 go against the principle of subsidiarity.
The EU has no power to deal with this matter, which is reserved to national jurisdiction, and so most members of our group, having been free to decide in accordance with conscience, have rejected these articles.
I, myself, was one of those who did so.
This is not the first time that the left-wing groups in this House have sought to misuse the human rights report in order to make abortion more freely available.
The mere fact that a majority wants to do this does not make it right.
Nor is it binding, for the report as whole is not binding in its effects.
The PPE-DE Group has therefore deliberately left these questions to the consciences of its Members and taken a negative line on the substance of Amendments 8 and 9.
Â Â  I would not have asked for the floor if Mrs Stenzel had not attacked our group in such an unbecoming way, and one that is so extremely unworthy of a Member of this House.
There are two things I would like to say to her.
Where abortion is concerned, and in this debate, we respect the right of every Member to reach a decision in accordance with his or her conscience.
Rarely in parliamentary debate is that necessary, and rarely do political groups have to allow their members the freedom to decide in accordance with their conscience.
There are few such issues, but this is one of them.
Mrs Stenzel will not find it difficult, if she looks at the result of the vote, to see that the report would have been lost if our group had voted against it.
A ânoâ from our group would have been enough to throw the report out.
There were certain key points in the report with which we did not agree, but we were quite satisfied with others.
It was because we wanted to help this report gain a majority, while also wanting our scepticism to be visible, that we abstained.
If she thinks that is bad form, then perhaps she should consider whether she is perhaps judging by the wrong criteria.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Schulz.
I am not sure that your assumption is entirely correct.
Â Â  . While able to agree with much of this report, I felt compelled to abstain because of the amendments embracing abortion on demand and the blanket attack on capital punishment, which I regard as legitimate where there is a transparently fair legal system based on due process of law.
I particularly welcomed the reportâs forthright affirmations against terrorism â including the declaration that there is a prime duty on democratic governments to dismantle terrorist networks â its denunciation of the Commissionâs reversal of the embargo on arms sales to China and its identification of persecution in many countries throughout the world of citizens because of their Christian beliefs, though I would have liked it to have been more explicit and focused, particularly with regard to the appalling abuse of the rights of members of minority Protestant denominations in Eritrea, Vietnam, North Korea, Colombia, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Egypt, China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and elsewhere.
The persecutions and imprisonments imposed on good citizens, whose only âcrimeâ is to live according to their sincere beliefs, is intolerable.
Freedom of expression, assembly and religion must be defended throughout the world.
Â Â  . I welcome the broad thrust of Simon Coveneyâs report but I do not think it goes far enough in terms of recognising the urgent need for particular support for women who are the victims of violence and sexual abuse.
The report denounces the impact of mass rape and recognises that victims of acts of sexual violence are put at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.
But it fails to offer these victims any immediate care.
Because of this I support Amendment 8 which calls for such victims to have access to condoms, to prevent further spread of infection, and access to abortion in the event of unwanted pregnancy.
The report should also recognise, as is demanded in Amendment 9, that the only way we can ensure there is a proper response to acts of sexual violence is by giving full respect to reproductive health rights in the first place.
As far as I am concerned, sexual and reproductive health is a human right; a right that should be recognised fully and guaranteed to every man, woman and child in the Member States and throughout the world.
Â Â  The report concerns the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World and the EUâs policy on the matter.
The EU has a responsibility for human rights in its immediate neighbourhood, consisting mainly of countries in Eastern and Central Europe that are potential Member States.
It is not, however, the EUâs task to guarantee human rights globally.
That is the task of the UN.
There are positive aspects of the resolution, and we support these.
They include the call for increased environmental work and support for the International Criminal Court.
The resolution is largely, however, about strengthening the EUâs foreign policy role.
We are therefore abstaining from voting on the resolution as a whole.
Â Â  .
I could write a great deal about this annual report by Parliament, which, in common with previous years, has been used as a means of political pressurising and meddling, in which countries seen as âfriendsâ are exempt from criticism, and the âothersâ, those countries deemed targets by the USA and EU, are criticised.
Among many examples, the report:
- glosses over the military occupation of Iraq by the USA and its allies â the occupying troops are euphemistically referred to as âmilitary forces stationed in the countryâ;
- does not condemn the Israeli Government for the military occupation of Palestine or for building the fence; instead it expresses its âconcernâ regarding the âsecurity fence/separation barrierâ;
Furthermore, it:
- âcondemnsâ the lifting of sanctions against Cuba by the Council, bringing it into line with the USAâs policy towards the country, and;
- astonishingly, calls on the Venezuelan Government to ensure âfreedom of expression and free access to informationâ, when the overwhelming majority of media outlets in the country are controlled by forces that will stop at nothing to succeed in undermining democracy;
In spite of everything, this yearâs report was only adopted by the Right.
The number of votes in favour was much lower than the number of abstentions and of those who, like us, voted against.
Â Â  . Every year, the European Parliamentâs report on Human Rights tells the world how to respect these rights.
However, it does not mention the situation in Member States of the European Union.
I wish to draw attention to the case of Marek Dochnal and Krzysztof Maciej Popenda, two Polish businessmen, who have been in captivity since October 2004.
The charges against them have been changed several times, extending with no real legal basis the prosecution procedures which allow them to be detained.
This is a violation of Article 6(2) of the ECHR on presumption of innocence.
Their identities and photographs have been published, in contravention of Polish law, to try to put pressure on the judges.
Information about their private and family lives, not connected with the legal investigation, has been also published, which breaches Article 8 of the ECHR.
These two men are victims of political persecution.
Perhaps this persecution aims to refute the testimony of Mr Dochnal in front of the parliamentary committee investigating any links between certain Polish politicians and certain oil companies.
I hope and trust that this Parliament will react against this abuse.
Â Â  . Â I voted against the CoveneyÂ report on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EUâs policy on the matter.
This was because, provisions concerning the extension of so-called reproductive rights as a method of preventing the spread of AIDS were introduced into the report by the Left and the Liberals, in spite of opposition from a significant proportion of Members.
According to the World Health Organisation, the term reproductive rights covers abortion.
Provisions regarding swift access to abortion for rape victims were also introduced.
I believe abortion to be a morally unacceptable and cruel practice.
In view of the fact that opinion on abortion is so divided in Europe, I feel that such controversial provisions should not be included in any European Parliament document.
Even if the current differences of opinion on this matter are taken into account, given the current state of knowledge I do not believe that anyone can reasonably argue that abortion is definitely not an attack on human life.
These are the reasons why I was unable to vote in favour of a report containing such provisions.
Â Â  . Within my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, there has been considerable criticism of the selective nature of this proposal, and a number of my colleagues have therefore voted against it.
No one denied that it contains many pertinent comments about human rights abuses outside of the European Union, but it is striking that countries such as Israel, Turkey and the Colombian government are being spared the sort of criticism that is levelled at Cuba, Venezuela and the Colombian guerrilla movements.
In Venezuela, where most of the media are in the hands of the opposition, there is supposedly a lack of press freedom.
This attitude creates the impression that allies never make mistakes and that others never do things right.
Both left and right have a long tradition of selectiveness in their upholding of human rights, where a lack of human rights was particularly important as argument against political opponents.
We must stop this practice and take seriously, rather than trivialise, criticism in respect of mistakes perpetrated by those we hold dear.
If the Right had not just confirmed its rejection of the EUâs improved policy in respect of Cubaâs isolation by the US in a vote, despite criticism, I, along with Scandinavian and German colleagues, would still have voted in favour.
Â Â  . I am unable to vote in favour of the report, as it is vague about some major human rights problems and ignores others completely.
I will give five examples of this.
Firstly, no mention is made of the abuse and torture committed in Iraq by members of the US forces.
No explicit reference is made to the persons who committed these offences.
One looks in vain for calls for criminal proceedings to be brought before the International Criminal Court.
Secondly, no reference is made to the continuing occupation of Iraq, or to the violations of human rights that are going on there day in, day out.
The report does not condemn this breach of international law.
Thirdly, the Western statesâ wars of intervention and the violations of human rights associated with them are not discussed.
Not one line of text is devoted to the Iraqi civilians â of whom there were over 100Â 000 â killed in the course of the onslaught by the âCoalition of the Willingâ.
There is no condemnation of the military interventions â described as âhumanitarian interventionsâ â on the pretext of combating terrorism, or of the âwar of disarmamentâ, all of which happened in contravention of international law.
Fourthly, the risks to human rights arising from the militarisation of the EU, in particular as a result of it being enshrined in the EUâs Constitution, are not treated as an issue.
It is a scandal that no mention whatever is made of the human rights situation in Turkey, and the assertion that it will be considered in a separate report does nothing to remedy that omission.
It is incomprehensible that this should be passed over in silence, particularly in view of the increasing number of human rights violations in the country.
Â Â  . The overview of human rights protection around the world portrayed in Mr Coveneyâs report is, unfortunately, an accurate one.
Looking at this report from our privileged situation, living in this part of the world, one inevitably feels a duty to take concerted and effective action to protect human rights (and to protect democracy, because, let us not forget, these two concepts are intrinsically linked; without democracy, there is no human rights protection).
It is impossible to cover every aspect of such a broad issue, but there is one aspect that I wish to bring to the fore.
I am concerned at the fact that it is not clear to many European politicians â albeit not only European politicians â that terrorism is the greatest threat to our societies and that it is a threat to our citizens (I shall not point out that they are innocent citizens, because that would suggest that there could be some sort of justification even if they were not innocent), to our societies, to the model that those societies represent and to democracy itself.
Lastly, let this report send out a clear message that Europe will be resolute in promoting human rights and democracy.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mr Coveney on this annual report and on the new system that he has introduced.
The final resolution places demands on the Communist regime in Cuba and vehemently condemns terrorism.
These are areas that are especially close to my heart and that I have been pursuing as human rights coordinator for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I was pleased to see that attempts on the part of the communist and socialist left to remove the forthright condemnation of the Cuban dictatorship were defeated.
Other areas that I have been following with concern, such as the trafficking in human beings and human organs, were also addressed appropriately in this resolution, and that is something new and positive.
I deplore the Leftâs manipulative strategy to present the right to abortion as a fundamental human right.
They went as far as to block the vote on an oral amendment by the rapporteur that contained the following lines: ârecognises the impact of mass rape in making women and girls vulnerable to contracting HIV/AIDS; calls on the EU to guarantee that all women and girls who are the victims of rape will have access to full medical careâ.
After this oral amendment was rejected, all of the amendments tabled in this House by the Left were adopted, yet the Left abstained from the final overall vote, which is evidence of their intention to manipulate an important overview of human rights to their own ends.
Â Â  . Â I voted against the CoveneyÂ report on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EUâs policy on the matter.
This was because, provisions concerning the extension of so-called reproductive rights as a method of preventing the spread of AIDS were introduced into the report by the Left and the Liberals, in spite of opposition from a significant proportion of Members.
According to the World Health Organisation the term reproductive rights covers abortion.
Provisions regarding swift access to abortion for rape victims were also introduced.
I believe abortion to be a morally unacceptable and cruel practice.
In view of the fact that opinion on abortion is so divided in Europe I feel that such controversial provisions should not be included in any European Parliament document.
Even if the current differences of opinion on this matter are taken into account, given the current state of knowledge I do not believe that anyone can reasonably argue that abortion is definitely not an attack on human life.
These are the reasons why I was unable to vote in favour of a report containing such provisions.
Â Â  . I would like to explain why we as a delegation have largely abstained on the Coveney Report.
This report is very largely supported by us and we stand for the highest level of civil and political human rights throughout the world, good governance and democracy as the form of ideal government.
Nevertheless, our party has stated a policy position rejecting the International Criminal Court and therefore we cannot support Amendment 45.
We are examining the issue of resiling the UN Geneva Convention on Refugees in order to regain control of immigration and asylum policy and therefore cannot support Amendment 35.
Similarly, we regard the death penalty for the most serious crimes and abortion as conscience issues and have no stated policies either way.
In the light of these considerations we have abstained overall.
Â Â  . I am unable to vote in favour of the report.
Although it does indeed mention a very large number of important points â such as the human rights violations in the Western Sahara, which is illegally occupied by Morocco, and which are often forgotten â it is generally characterised by a one-sided view of things, selectively castigating human rights violations particularly where it seems politically opportune to do so, and even going so far as to falsify the facts.
Let me now name some of the important problem areas in terms of human rights to which no reference whatever is made.
Firstly, to talk in terms of restrictions on the free expression of opinion in Venezuela and to call upon the government to take appropriate action is positively grotesque in view of the fact that most of the media are owned by the opposition.
Secondly, the assessment of the situation in Columbia completely ignores the grave violations of human rights committed by the government and is framed as a one-sided condemnation of the guerrillas.
Thirdly, Parliamentâs criticism of the EUâs cautious resumption of relations with Cuba is, in human rights terms, utterly beyond comprehension.
Fourthly, the grave problems with human rights in Turkey are not addressed at all.
The fact that the report scarcely discusses social and economic rights, and refrains without exception from any self-critical comment on the human rights situation in the EU and on the EUâs role in the world, is certainly problematic and goes against the principle that human rights are universal and indivisible.
Â Â  All voters want the politicians they elect to stick to the platform on which they were elected.
I am a member of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I made a commitment to respect the platform of Christian-democratic values represented by this group.
These include supporting the principles of the protection and promotion of human dignity and, consequently, respect for the right to life and the uniqueness of every human being from conception to natural death.
When a political programme sets out values to promote, it is only natural to follow it, including in the voting lists.
The electorate does not like being betrayed by its elected representatives, particularly with regard to the essential values for which it elected us.
The protection of life at all times, from conception to natural death, is a non-negotiable part of any political calculation.
According to the World Health Organisationâs definition, the concept of âsexual and reproductive healthâ includes the reality of promoting the termination of unwanted pregnancies.
That is why I voted against Amendments 8 and 9.
As these amendments were adopted, they have amended the resolution in a way contrary to the PPE-DE Groupâs platform of values.
Â Â  . I support the PSE Groupâs resolution (B6-0275/2005) and the joint resolution on the Commission Statement on the situation of Roma in the EU.
In 1984, ParliamentÂ first acknowledged that âgypsies still suffer discrimination in law and practiceâ and called on governments of the Member States to eliminate all forms of discrimination against Roma.
Twenty-one years on, it is unfortunately the case that this conclusion endures: Roma and Travellers still suffer discrimination in law and practice.
The recent establishment of the European Commissionersâ Group on Fundamental Rights, Anti-Discrimination and Equal Opportunities, as well as the stated commitment of PresidentÂ Barroso to address the social exclusion of Roma and Travellers, are positive developments.
These must now be followed by concrete actions by the Commissionersâ Group and the relevant Directorates-General.
The Commission has to address the social exclusion of Roma and Travellers in Member States, candidate countries and other countries outside the current borders of the Union, and act, as a matter of urgency, to curbÂ the widespread anti-Roma and anti-Traveller sentimentÂ in Europe.
At the very least, thisÂ means full and correct application of Council Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this joint resolution, to which we also contributed, because we feel it is urgent to eliminate continuing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination against Roma, and are conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by anti-Gypysism and Romaphobia plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes and requires resolute action for its eradication.
8 April has been designated International Roma Day and is considered to be the annual day of celebration for Roma, as well as an opportunity for raising awareness about Europe's largest ethnic minority and the extent of its social exclusion.
We feel it is important to vehemently condemn, once again, all forms of discrimination, including discrimination against Roma.
We expect their rights to be upheld in all Member States and that the Member States adopt the measures needed to combat the negative images that lead to discrimination, to hatred and to racism towards Roma and to combat âRomaphobiaâ in all its forms, at local, regional, national or European level.
Â Â  The EU is a union of values and is therefore responsible for maintaining respect for human rights within its borders.
Therefore, the EU also has a role, via its Member States, in drawing attention to the vulnerable position of the Roma and in facilitating their integration into society.
Â Â  .
I and my British Conservative colleagues completely and unreservedly condemn all forms of racism and xenophobia.
However, we are unable to support this resolution because we do not think that the cause of a specific minority group such as the Roma is furthered by âpigeon-holingâ them into a separate category, which runs the risk of increasing their isolation and marginalisation.
Instead, we feel it is best to keep the fight against discrimination and prejudice, which the Roma undoubtedly face, within the mainstream of political, economic, and social policy.
Â Â  .â The PASOK parliamentary group in the European Parliament will be voting in favour of the resolution on the Roma.
Combating social exclusion and discrimination against the Roma in Europe, on the basis of today's resolution, must be a priority of the institutions of the European Union and of the Member States.
At the same time, it notes that the Member States of the Union have different definitions for national, ethnic and religious minorities and sections of the population within their borders, based on their laws and/or international conventions (as in the case of Greece) and that these must not under any circumstances be thought to be contested or affected by this resolution.
Â Â  . Only seven out of the twenty-five EU Member States have a population that exceeds that of the Roma nation as a whole in the EUâs present and future territory.
They are a nation without a state, and are considered a minority wherever they are, even if there are towns in which they represent the majority.
If it is the case that many Roma people have become outsiders, unemployed as a result of poor education, and with an attitude that can easily provoke irritation in others, this is attributable to isolation and discrimination.
We have a long tradition of driving those people away from one state to another, and of refusing to grant them civil rights because they can be considered aliens on account of their forced moves.
In some cases, individuals are given the opportunity of integrating and being accepted by the majority, but the group as a whole is not.
There are problems not only in a number of new Member States that joined in 2004 and in the two countries that will be acceding in 2007, but also in such old Member States as Greece and Italy.
Since newcomers are refused shelter, schooling and an income, criminal activity represents these peopleâs only means of survival.
That should really improve after the 90% majority for this resolution.
Â Â  The outlook for society and medicine in Europe is gloomy.
We talk about problems of inequality, waiting lists, and backward science and technology.
The solutions recommended by Parliament will be just as ineffectual as those recommended by the Commission.
This desire for modernisation actually concerns European countries that are a long way from the French model.
This system still protects us from the shortcomings that exist throughout the world.
With regard to the ageing population, nobody will dare suggest that we finally return to a true pro-family policy that encourages a higher birth rate.
We should also be worried that this report on public health uses terms such as âmarketâ and âconsumersâ.
More seriously, and for reasons that can only be guessed at, this report glorifies the European Constitution in Recital A. That Treaty is not yet in force and must be condemned as an instrument of social decline which threatens the health of the French people via a reduction to the lowest common denominator.
Finally, the issue of immigration is completely missing from the text.
ParagraphÂ 11 expresses a concern in administrative terms, whereas this is in fact a matter of the progressive annihilation of our societies, not to mention the future arrival in Europe of Turkey, for which reason we oppose a rejection of âsocial self-defenceâ.
Â Â  .
Social protection and health care systems are the responsibility of the Member States, and rightly so.
It is also true that we wish to see the citizens of Europe enjoying the best, the most appropriate and the most effective social protection, and the same is true of health care.
That said, we must not overlook current predominant trends, especially the ageing of the population.
In other words, we must urgently seek solutions to problems that are already apparent.
Lastly, I wish to point out that the broad consensus that this issue usually generates is a consensus based on the objectives and on what we want to accomplish, but not on the means and the methods.
That is where the differences are clear and well-documented.
Â Â  The Hughes report is about reforming the activities and organisation of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. The Harkin report is about reforming the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.
The Cabrnoch report is about modernising social protection and developing good quality healthcare.
We believe that issues surrounding safety and health at work, social protection or healthcare are not the responsibility of the EU.
These are issues that should be decided upon by each Member State.
The aforementioned bodies should not be run by the EU but by the parties concerned and as non-governmental organisations.
We also choose, therefore, to abstain from voting on the three reports.
Â Â  . The Financial Services Action Plan came into being one year before the âLisbon Strategyâ, yet it is one of its key pillars.
The purpose of creating an internal market for financial services and integrating the capital markets is not only to liberalise the movement of capital even further, not only to provide large multinational corporations with the means to restructure and acquire capital at the lowest cost, not only to speed up the process of acquisitions and mergers at European level, but mainly to manage the enormous flow of finance released by the gradual privatisation of national pensions systems.
It is not a little ironic that, although the rapporteur is not satisfied, 39 of the Planâs 42 legislative measures have already been adopted.
In other words, the targets of this Plan are those areas with the best implementation, in light of the unambitious social targets set by the âLisbon Strategyâ.
What is more, all of this is wrapped up in technical jargon, is almost devoid of prudential rules, and leaves self-regulation to the discretion of those operating in the sector.
More jobs and economic growth are promised, but the impact of the increasingly financial focus of the economy is shown in stark relief by the high number of financial crises at both regional and world level and by the drain of investment from production to capitalisation and speculation.
Â Â  . For those like me who advocate the completion of the internal market â without which we would not be able to meet some of the Unionâs prime objectives, such as those set out in the Lisbon Agenda â the successful integration of the financial markets is something to be welcomed.
The existence of an action plan for that purpose and the results that have come to light are cause for some satisfaction.
There is more work to be done, however, which, as the report before us points out, must be accompanied by a suitable assessment of the measures that will need to be taken over time, so that a good proposal is not spoiled by too many or too few legal instruments.
Â Â  Discharges of substances dangerous for the environment constitute an important political issue.
We do not, however, believe that the EU needs to have a common strategy in terms of the Punta del Este Conference on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
Individual Member States should each determine their national negotiating policies themselves.
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 28 April 2005.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a statement commemorating the end of World War II in Europe.
As you know, and as everybody knows, it is 60 years today since we were able to begin our assessment of the horrors Europe had experienced during that period.
The figures are horrific: 60 million dead, the systematic extermination of peoples and minorities, cities and regions reduced to ash and rubble, economies ruined and 30 million displaced people from amongst the civilian populations of all the warring countries.
And regardless of the responsibilities of those who started the war, human suffering is human suffering.
In the Pacific, as you know, the war was to continue until 14 August and ended with those horrendous pictures of nuclear extermination.
At that point, Europe was a desolated, hungry and threatened continent.
With the peace, or at least with the end of the war, on that 8Â May, certain political leaders proclaimed that the flag of freedom was flying over the whole of Europe, but today we must acknowledge that, at that point, the end of the war only brought peace and freedom to half of the continent.
The other half was the victim of the new world order that was created in Yalta.
In fact, peace and freedom did not reach everybody.
On that 8 May, a new European geography was drawn up; totalitarianism was overcome â at least certain forms of it â but another different kind, although equally iron-fisted and more lasting, took half of Europe hostage.
Bipolarity was born, a long ideological conflict began and the nuclear era terrorised the world.
Our continent was split in two and today, 60 years later, here in the European Parliament, we can at last commemorate a reunited Europe, not an enlarged Europe, but a reunified one.
On 1 May we marked the first anniversary of our reunion with the countries that were taken hostage after Yalta.
There will soon be more of us and our reunification will be more complete.
And this gives greater meaning to this 9 May, Europe Day, on which, 55 years ago, the foundations were established in order to respond to the desolation of war, in order to guarantee that it would never happen again, and this response is now complete with the arrival of the new countries that have joined the Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like today, a day on which we are commemorating three events which differ from each other, but which are related, to be a day of reflection: 55 years since the beginning of the European adventure, 60 years since the end of the war and one year since reunification.
This offers us a great opportunity to remember together our duty of memory and, above all, to pass this knowledge on to the younger generations who have never known war and to whom peace appears to be something natural.
That has not been the case, however.
The streets of our cities are full of names of people and circumstances, of events that shaped our history and which are part of our collective memory: the Westerplatte in Gdansk-Danzig, the Place Montgomery in Brussels, the Stalingrad metro station in Paris, the Boulevard Dresde, just a few metres from here, and military cemeteries of both sides dotted across Europe.
All of this is our common memory, the memory of a continent that today has overcome what then was the subordination of the individual to the State and disregard for law and for human dignity.
Our system today is based on the separation of powers, on popular sovereignty and on respect for human rights.
And that is the message we must send to the whole of Europe and the entire world on marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the war and the beginning of the European Union adventure: the commitment to carry on fighting to defend the values of peace, justice and tolerance, not just for Europe, but for the whole world.
And we must do so in the knowledge that what the citizens of Europe expect from their Union is no longer peace, because we Europeans already have peace amongst us and we all believe it to be irreversible.
Nobody could imagine that we will ever go back to resolving our differences through arms.
What the Europeans expect from their Union today is that it contribute to their prosperity and to their security in the face of the new threats in a world which is no longer the same as the one established at Yalta.
I would therefore ask that we look to the future with the firm obligation to achieve that prosperity and security that our citizens are asking us for.
Ladies and gentlemen, we wished to mark this day â the end of World War II, Europe Day and first anniversary of the reunified Europe â in a formal and unusual manner, with music in the Chamber.
I would like to present a young Latvian, born in Riga, Miss Baiba Skride.
Miss Skride has accepted our invitation to be here with us today, and to commemorate this event, she has proposed a Baroque piece: Bachâs Chaconne 1004.
Alejo Carpentier said that the baroque was undoubtedly the style that most reflects European cultural diversity.
In spite of her youth, Baiba Skride has played in the most prestigious concert halls in the world and I am sure that the improvised concert hall we have created from our Chamber will be added to her curriculum vitae today.
Miss Skrideâs talent and youth are accompanied by a violin made by Stradivarius in 1725 and which is known by the name Wilhelm, in honour of the famous German violinist August Wilhelm, to whom it belonged for almost 50 years.
I propose that you listen and at the same time watch â because sometimes music is also to be seen rather than simply heard â this evidence that our European Union is a synthesis of history, of talent, of youth and hence of the future.
Let us do so, if possible, with our mobile phones switched off.
Miss Skride, your violin has the floor.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda for the May I and May II part-sessions as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday 4 May pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
No amendments have been proposed.
No amendments have been proposed.
The Independence and Democracy Group has requested that an oral question to the Commission be included, presented by Mr Farage, on the Commissionâs procedure for preventing any risk of conflict of interest.
Does anybody wish to explain the request of the Independence and Democracy Group?
Â Â  Mr President, do not misunderstand me, I am not against people going on holiday; it is just that, normally, we have to pay for it ourselves.
My simple request to all 25 Commissioners was for them to declare what free holidays they had received since they became Commissioners.
They point blank refused to answer the question, treating this Parliament with contempt.
When it leaked out that Mandelson and Barroso had enjoyed holidays on billionairesâ yachts, we were told not to worry: there was no conflict whatsoever.
Then it emerges that one of the Latsis-owned shipyards â the Lamda Shipyard â received a EURÂ 10Â million grant, and then Mr Barroso resigns the shipping portfolio.
That resignation is too little, too late.
It is about time Parliament called the Commission to account, and I urge Members to vote to change the agenda to bring Mr Barroso here this very week.
Â Â  According to our Rules of Procedure, I must now ask whether anybody wishes to speak in favour of the proposal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to support the proposal, and I recommend in this connection that an examination be made of ArticleÂ 213 of the existing Treaties which states regarding members of the Commission: âWhen entering upon their duties they shall give a solemn undertaking that âŠ they will respectâ â and I now move on a bit âÂ âŠ in particular their duty to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments or benefitsâ.
Anyone who does not comply with this regulation in ArticleÂ 213 can be dismissed or made to forfeit his or her pension rights or other similar benefits.
The Treatyâs position is that Commissioners must behave with integrity once they no longer hold office.
That does not mean that they do not also have to behave with integrity during their terms of office.
I would therefore recommend that we vote in favour of the proposal and be given a full report by the Commission on the way in which Commissioners are showered with gifts.
Â Â  Since nobody wishes to speak against Mr Farageâs proposal, we shall put it to the vote.
We now have a point of order that had been raised earlier.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I find it astounding that people in this House who are elected to hold the executive to account should vote against the proposal.
Â Â  You have raised a point of order and, as you know, you must tell me which Rule it refers to.
Â Â  I wanted to point out, in the light of what I said, that I did not have time to vote in favour of the proposal, and I wish to have that added to the Minutes.
However, what happened was a disgrace.
Â Â  Alright, it will be recorded in the Minutes that you wished to vote yes.
No amendments have been proposed.
Â Â  Mr President, further to Rule 154 of the Rules of Procedure in conjunction with what Rule 132 has to say about Rule 150, an objection has been raised to the Dombrovskis report, on which the Committee on Budgets voted even though a full voting Member raised an objection to oral amendments.
I do not believe that this report can be debated ...
Â Â  Your comments relate to Wednesday, but carry on please.
Â Â  The Dombrovskis report has been put on the agenda for Wednesday evening, even though procedural errors were made when it went through the Committee on Budgets.
The fact of the matter is that substantial oral amendments were put, to which one member of the Committee objected, despite which the Committee moved to vote on the report.
You have already received a letter concerning this; having raised this objection at the last plenary sitting, I wish to repeat it now.
If you insist on holding this debate, I have to say that I regard it, and the previous vote, as unlawful and also contrary to the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  Thank you for reminding me that you have written to me.
I can confirm that I have received your letter and that the reply to your comments prepared by the services is awaiting my signature.
You will receive it very shortly.
No amendments have been proposed.
Â Â  We shall proceed to the one-minute speeches of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, as the president of Intergroup responsible for traditional national minorities, I would like to inform MEPâs of our letter to President Josep Borrell, which asserts Intergroupâs full support for the legitimate request of our eleven Catalan colleagues, who petitioned to be able to use the Catalan language at the EPâs plenary sessions.
This is in accord with Spainâs constitution and with the appeal lodged by Spain to the European Council.
It does not involve any extra costs for the EP, as the representatives agreed to submit their claim the day before their speech at the plenary session.
Therefore, I would like to ask President Borrell, as a Catalan himself, to present at the Presidential Meeting this petition of Intergroupâs, which requests that the Catalan language be used by Catalan speakers at future plenary sessions.
Â Â  Mr President, in the west of France, in GuÃ©rande and Saumur, as well as in Spain, in Barcelona, nearly 800 job cuts are expected as a result of internal relocation within Europe.
Celestica, a Canadian company manufacturing electronic cards, has taken the decision to close its production sites and relocate them in the Czech Republic, a country with lower labour costs and a Member of our Union.
Europeâs decision to devote a little more than EUR 11Â billion to the regions and people hit by restructuring is a good decision.
In a context that is also marked by relocation, however, it is absolutely vital to have a policy in support of the employees and the regions that have to sustain relocation within the Unionâs borders.
Hopes for a European social model in aid of the 25 countries of the Union that is based on strong social cohesion can only exist if our Institutions implement real and significant policies of territorial and human solidarity.
That is why it is today essential to capitalise on this strong political desire by supporting the men and women undergoing intra-European relocation.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to draw the Membersâ attention to the fact that the International Day against homophobia occurs on 17 May, which is next week.
I should like to urge this House and all Members to give this initiative their wholehearted support, for it is, unfortunately, still the case that not all homosexuals in Europe enjoy European basic rights.
Only last weekend in Amsterdam, the capital of tolerance and freedom, seven persons joined in beating up a man in the most cowardly fashion, his only crime being that he held hands with the person he loved.
At present, we remember all the victims who fell in the war in Europe, and these include many homosexuals who were persecuted and killed on account of their sexual preference â something that, even today, some countries do not acknowledge.
I would therefore like to urge all Members to include those people in their commemoration next week.
Â Â  Mr President, last week we celebrated the first anniversary of the largest enlargement to date of the European Union.
The accession of the ten new countries hailing from the former Soviet bloc and Yugoslavia, the Baltics and the Mediterranean is, undoubtedly, the most significant and historic event in the history of the Union.
These countries â for years many of them locked in the iron grip of Moscow â have joined the most unique and successful experiment in the history of democratic politics.
General de Gaulle dreamed of a united Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals.
Given the circumstances at the time â the Iron Curtain, the cold war and the military polarisation between East and West â few other than de Gaulle could have believed that would happen.
However, it is happening and it should be celebrated.
I wish our friends the ten new countries well.
I come from Ireland, a country whose economy has been transformed from little more than that of a poor, Third World country into one of the strongest in Europe, courtesy of European assistance through membership, and I wish all the same benefits and success to our ten new neighbours.
Integration has succeeded in overcoming age-old differences between European countries.
The political and economic reunification of our continent is a victory for the spirit of Europe, one of which we should all be proud.
Â Â  Mr President, there are only a few hundred Hungarians living in Latvia today but if we believe in humane minority rights, however, then we must also mention their deprivation of rights.
According to Latvian law, it is practically impossible for non-Latvian inhabitants of Latvia to obtain citizenship.
They cannot vote at elections, they cannot obtain a passport and it is very difficult for them to find employment; they are considered stateless in the country they live in.
Unfortunately, the majority of Hungarians living in Latvia also belong to the hundreds of thousands of stateless persons.
Latvian authorities justify this discrimination as Stalinâs sins.
I do not wish to take sides in the historical debate between Latvians and Russians.
I understand the grievances of the Latvian nation, but at the same time I refuse to accept collective punishment.
In all cases, discrimination is inexplicable, especially in the case of Hungarians, as we were also victims of the same Stalinist oppression.
I hope that, in the spirit of common democratic values, my Latvian colleagues will urge their government to eliminate this form of discrimination.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to congratulate you for the sensitive manner in which you spoke a short while ago about the sixty years since the end of fascism, since the end of the genocide of Europeans and, in particular, of Jews.
However, the month of May brings to mind another case of genocide by one of Hitler's predecessors, Îemal Ataturk, who, when he entered Samsun on 19 May 1919, slaughtered half a million Greek Russians.
The historians of the time write that the Black Sea turned red and that heads were piled high in the squares.
I think that it is a question of sensitivity on our part to condemn this incident, for which there was no Nuremburg, as there was for Hitler; for us to show the world that we, free Europe, are thinking about, know about and remember all those who committed these crimes against nations.
The memory of these Greek Russians should be celebrated.
I therefore wish to ask you, Mr President, to arrange a day in memory of these Greek Russians and a day in memory of the Armenians.
It is a question of justice; it is a question of sensitivity.
Â Â  Â Â Â Sixty years ago, the Second World War ended in Europe when Germanyâs Third Reich capitulated and hostilities ceased.
On the occasion of this anniversary, it is worth pointing out that it was not only Hitlerâs Nazi Germany that was responsible for starting this global military conflict which claimed the lives of tens of millions of people, but also Stalinâs internationalist Soviet Union.
The agreement concluded between these two countries in AugustÂ 1939, known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, made it a foregone conclusion that the two socialist dictatorships would carry out a joint military attack on the other democratic nations of Europe.
The Soviet Union only started fighting on the Alliesâ side in 1941, when it was attacked by Germany, its former partner.
Unlike the Allied forces in the West, the Red Army introduced a system of Communist coercion after driving the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe.
In reality, this amounted to a new occupation, which at times was even worse than the previous German one.
At the conferences in Teheran, Yalta and Potsdam, Stalin received political backing for his actions from representatives of Western countries, including the USA.
Shameful as it is, this is what really happened, and we should not forget it in our endeavours to construct a political vision of the unification of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to tomorrowâs vote in the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective for the 2007-2013 period.
As rapporteur for the funding and programming of rural development in this period, I ask you, Mr President, to lend your support to the justified expressions of concern in relation to, and demands for, adequate financial resources for the ongoing development of rural areas, so that their development in line with the requirements of Lisbon and Gothenburg may continue to be guaranteed in future.
Â Â  â Mr President, following on from meetings with workers and company representatives from the textile and clothing industry in Portugal, it must be stated once again that measures must be taken at European level, as a matter of urgency, to halt the further deterioration of a situation in which companies are closing down and unemployment is on the rise, with the social impact that that implies for thousands of workers and their families.
It is impossible to understand why the Commission has been putting off taking the immediate action that is required.
In light of the seriousness of the current situation in the sector, it is appalling that the Commission has postponed making a decision on formally beginning the process to activate the safeguard clause, and that it has in fact triggered a so-called investigation, which could take months.
The socio-economic situation in some of the regions most reliant on the sector is serious and could become even worse if the Commission and the Council continue to shirk their responsibilities.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I have drawn the Commissionâs attention to the problems relating to soft fruit faced by the EU Member States, in particular Poland, on many occasions, both in writing and orally.
I addressed my concerns to the Commission on 28Â OctoberÂ 2004, for example, and on 13Â December I asked the President to take action with a view to ensuring protective measures were put in place.
I would like to thank him for having intervened in this matter.
I was delighted to hear, from the Commission representative who took part in the meeting of Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture on 19Â AprilÂ 2005, that a delegation would be sent to Poland to conduct an on-the-spot investigation into the problems, and indeed this trip has already taken place.
In view of the limited amount of time left before the first soft fruit is picked, I would urge the President to ensure that the delegation presents its proposed solutions before the harvest begins.
If it fails to do so, we will have to wait another year before intervening in the market for soft fruit, and Polish producers will suffer further losses.
I would point out that Poland produces 50% of all soft fruit grown in the EU, and I would ask the President once again to take action on this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House something that can scarcely be called good news.
With effect from 1 January 2005, quotas on textiles and clothing became a thing of the past in Europe, and, since then, dramatic changes have occurred.
Within three months, textile imports from China have risen by a quite considerable extent â by 700-800%, in fact.
A firm in my electoral district, having already sustained serious losses as a result of this flood of imports, has seen its order book reduced by 8%, and as many as 9% of its workforce have already been laid off.
This change puts millions of jobs throughout Europe at risk.
I therefore call on Members of this House not only to support the Commission in its action to deal with these developments, but also to use their influence on it in such a way that these measures may be made even tougher and even more effective.
Â Â  Mr President, following the referendums on the European Constitution in the different Member States, we have to establish that in the debate on this Constitution, the arguments that are being put forward are not always correct.
For example, the April issue of , an information sheet issued in Belgium by the Commission, contained an article in which those opposed to the Constitution were accused of being populists who try to instil fear in people.
That is a widespread misconception, and one that is kept alive â whether deliberately or not â by certain pressure groups.
As it happens, current events show that things are slightly more complicated than people sometimes let on.
What are we to make of the speech by Mr Donner, the Dutch Justice Minister, in which he stated that the rejection of the Constitution would have the same consequences as the collapse of, and civil war in, former Yugoslavia?
A week later, the Dutch Prime Minster, Mr Balkenende drew a link between rejection of the Constitution and Auschwitz.
On a French public radio station, a doctor claimed that victory for the ânoâ camp would be a disaster for AIDS research.
That is reprehensible.
Within our own Parliament, a ârapid reaction forceâ was set up to respond to incorrect information by those opposed to the Constitution; we should also respond to incorrect information disseminated by those in favour of it.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to alert the House to various irregularities relating to pension payments.
In certain countries, the latest trend is to increase the retirement age and to cut pensions, or even not to pay them at all.
Those responsible justify this by citing economic reasons and the ageing population, even though the root cause of the latter is the anti-family policy that has been pursued for many years.
Policyholders commencing employment need to be sure that they will receive a pension, provided they meet certain requirements and a set amount of time has passed.
The state should take the necessary steps to ensure the funds needed to safeguard constitutional rights are available.
Countries that amend regulations as they go along, fail to pay pensions or reduce the level of these pensions are violating fundamental social rights that derive from the natural dignity of every human being.
Particularly in the EU Member States, where respect for social rights is writ large, these rights should not be violated. This also follows from the principle of public trust in the state.
Â Â  Â Â Â The ceremonies taking place in Moscow today to mark the end of the Second World War were intended to serve as a symbol of global reconciliation and unity.
One cannot help feeling, however, that the Kremlin is attempting to use this occasion to rewrite history.
It has disputed the crimes committed in Katyn, where thousands of Polish officers were murdered, as well as the genocide committed in the labour camps and the illegal annexation of the Baltic States.
It was for this reason that the leaders of Lithuania, Estonia and Georgia boycotted the ceremony.
We must not forget that the Second World War began with an almost simultaneous attack on Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and that Hitler and Nazi Germany were not the only architects of the war, as the Soviet Union also acted as an accessory.
Finally, we must bear in mind that the end of the fascist occupation of Eastern Europe marked the beginning of Soviet domination.
If we fail to remember these facts, todayâs ceremony in Russia may turn into a eulogy of Soviet imperialism instead of a celebration of the victory over fascism.
Â Â  Mr President, religious freedom is one of Europeâs important fundamental values.
Two days ago, Christians attending mass in the Turkish city of Bergamos, in the presence of the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, came under attack from a large mob of Turkish nationalists known as âGrey Wolvesâ, who tried to disrupt the mass by shouting obscenities, abuse and death threats at the attending worshippers.
The Turkish police made no attempt to stop them and nobody was arrested or prosecuted.
This is one of many episodes of state-tolerated and, on many occasions, state-sponsored persecution of Christians in Turkey.
Mr President, could you please send a letter of strong protest to the Turkish Prime Minister, telling him in no uncertain terms that, if he is to have us believe that Turkey seriously has European aspirations, then he must, amongst other things, make sure that the rights of religious minorities and, in particular, of Christians in Turkey, are properly protected and respected?
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the affection felt for Europe by many European citizens is, unfortunately, beginning to wane.
In Italy this is undoubtedly due in part to the change from the lira to the euro, which has increased the prices of all products, leading consumers to believe that they are spending less in the new currency than in lira.
I should be grateful, Mr President, if you informed the Council and the appropriate Commissioner of my proposal for resolving this issue: the compulsory marking of prices in both euros and the old currency; the price shown in lira should be double that in euros.
I am convinced that that will help restore the affection felt for Europe.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the number of Poles occupying top management posts in the Commission is a source of some concern to Polish MEPs.
Even though it was agreed that Poles would hold 17Â of these posts, there is not yet a single Polish director-general, deputy director-general, director, chief advisor or head of unit.
Not a single one of these posts is occupied by a Pole, although the intention was that Poland would receive 17Â of them.
Lithuania and Cyprus, which were meant to receive four and two posts respectively, are facing the same problem, taking the total to three countries.
Furthermore, there are still no Estonian, Latvian or Slovakian directors-general or deputy directors-general.
There has been public outrage in the new Member States over this situation, which beggars belief, and I would ask the President to intervene in the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to touch on a strange concept referred to several times recently: the assertion that the collapse of the USSR was âa tragedy for the Russian peopleâ.
Well, other peoples changed their status from captive nations to free nations.
Does the first statement mean that Russian people are so different that liberation from Soviet authoritarian tyranny made them tragically unhappy?
No authority, not even the President of Russia, has the right to present his nation in such a cartoon-like manner.
We should be concerned with how to defend the dignity of the Russian people.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sure everyone here today will be aware that last Thursday there was a general election in Britain.
It was conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system, which is inherently unfair and is no longer defensible in the 21st century.
It produced some strange results: the Labour Party that now forms the government won 55% of the seats based on only 35% of the vote.
Thirty-nine per cent of the electorate could not be bothered to vote.
Britain now has a government put in place by only 21% of the electorate.
In 1999 the European Union forced Britain to adopt a form of proportional representation for the European parliamentary elections.
Since the European Commission is now the real government of Britain, perhaps it could do us a favour and force Britain to adopt a form of proportional representation for parliamentary elections.
Under a fair voting system, the UK Independence Party could gain representation in the British Parliament and use it eventually to bring about our desired goal: Britainâs unconditional withdrawal from the European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest news from France is not encouraging.
In the run-up to the countryâs referendum on the Constitution, journalists working for the state-run media, in particular television channels, have mounted furious protests, accusing the authorities and the media bosses concerned of a serious lack of objectivity in their coverage of the European Constitution.
Events have taken a dramatic turn, and there have been accusations of blatant bias.
I believe that this House should prove itself equal to the task of addressing this issue.
After all, who will see to it that the media tell the truth in the run-up to the key political decision to be taken by the French people, if we fail to do so?
I believe that the President should take action on this matter, and that we should send a delegation of observers to France to find out whether democratic principles are being violated.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform the House of the disastrous situation in which the Polish fishing industry has found itself as a result of the protective measures put in place by the European Union.
One can only assume that these measures are intended to wipe out Polandâs Baltic fisheries, and it is already an established fact that they led to a significant rise in unemployment in coastal regions after Poland joined the European Union.
We Poles have been forced to accept absurd catch limits that will do nothing whatsoever to help protect stocks.
There is no biological or economic justification for these limits, and it is my firm belief that they were arrived at on the basis of political considerations.
To date, the Commission has failed to propose any solutions that would allow Polish fishermen to catch up with their Western counterparts.
Most importantly, no proposals have been made regarding ways in which EU funds could be used to modernise the fishing fleet.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Statement: Justice for the McCartney family.
I would like to inform you that the sisters of Robert McCartney are in the gallery, together with Mr Niall O'Neill.
We welcome them to our debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission wishes to reconfirm that it condemns Mr McCartney's murder outright.
It totally understands and expresses its admiration for the decisive action taken by the McCartney sisters in their quest for truth and justice and wholeheartedly supports their efforts.
Although the Commission, as of course the McCartney family understands, cannot intervene in judicial investigations and proceedings by the Member States, it wishes to take this opportunity today to pay homage to the courage, dignity and quest for truth and justice on the part of the McCartney family.
The Commission cannot but express its admiration for the strong and courageous stand taken by the McCartney sisters in their campaign for justice.
It would like to express its solidarity with the McCartney family and is certain that, once the Irish judicial proceedings have been completed, the truth will out.
While there is no such thing as freedom without security, there is also no such thing as security without justice.
The rule of law is the cornerstone of democracy and fundamental freedoms and the McCartney sisters are fighting not for revenge, but for justice.
The Commission supports their case unreservedly.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by welcoming the representatives of the McCartney family here this evening and conveying the best wishes of the European Parliament to all the sisters â Catherine, Paula, Gemma, Clare and Donna, and indeed to the late Robert McCartneyâs partner, Bridgeen.
There is a welcome to them here in the European Parliament.
On behalf of Mr Poettering, the leader of the PPE-DE Group, on my own behalf, and particularly on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation, I would like to pledge our fullest support to them in their courageous, dignified and determined pursuit of justice for their brother Robertâs brutal murder.
As my Party Leader in DÃ¡il Ãireann, Enda Kenny, said, Robert McCartneyâs vicious beating and stabbing to death was ordered by a commander in the Belfast brigade of the provisional IRA, following a minor dispute between the commanderâs uncle and the group with which Mr McCartney was socialising.
Robert McCartney was in the wrong place at the wrong time but this was no minor bar room brawl, as some have disgracefully attempted to portray it.
His brutal beating and stabbing was a serious and savage attack, which bore all the hallmarks of a politically motivated IRA murder.
It was perpetrated by up to 12 killers, a significant number of whom are known members of the provisional IRA.
Initially, Sinn FÃ©inâs Alex Maskey vehemently denied IRA involvement but, two weeks later, having spoken to the family, Sinn FÃ©inâs Gerry Kelly issued a statement on the matter and they accepted IRA involvement.
This killing was ruthlessly supervised and forensically covered up by men announcing that their activities were IRA business, by men who proceeded to intimidate the 70 witnesses to the crime and their families, first forbidding them from calling an ambulance on the night in question, as Robert McCartney bled to death before their eyes and his colleague lay seriously injured.
Then they warned them not to cooperate with the authorities.
Such is the level of fear and intimidation of the witnesses that the code of silence surrounding the event has still not been broken, nearly four months after Robert McCartneyâs death.
In tonightâs motion, we are calling âon the leadership of Sinn FÃ©in to insist that those responsible for the murder and the witnesses to the murder cooperate directly with the PSNI and be free from the threat of reprisals from the IRAâ, or indeed to cooperate with the Ombudsman of Northern Ireland.
The appalling offer by the IRA on 8 March 2005 to shoot dead the perpetrators of this awful crime is abhorrent and barbaric and has been met with incredulity in the civilised world.
To even suggest that amends might be made through such summary justice indicates what few lessons, if any, have been learnt by the IRA over the past 30 years.
It shows how little understanding this group has of the basic tenets of the rule of law in a democratic state.
The rule of law Sinn FÃ©in advocates, and the IRA enforces, is a brutal regime of terror, intimidation and violence.
One parallel to, and incompatible with, democratic society.
One so grounded in illegality and criminality that it constitutes an affront to the very concept of justice and leaves its victims, such as the McCartney family in this case, powerless and without redress for their terrible loss.
But these brave women, the McCartney women, through refusing to be intimidated in their four-month campaign for justice for their brother and their partner, have achieved more to highlight the residual thuggery and criminality that has existed in Northern Ireland since the official IRA ceasefire than either of the two governments or the political establishment in Northern Ireland have managed to achieve in the last decade.
Today we, the European Parliament drawn from 25 Member States, add our voice to that of the Irish Government, the British Government and the United States Congress, in support of the McCartney campaign for justice.
By bringing the killers of Robert to justice, there is a bigger statement being made in terms of a total rejection by all decent people of this continued wanton killing, maiming and violence.
It is a call for real peace.
I hope we will be in a position to help Robertâs family if the necessity arises, if none of the witnesses, nor indeed the IRA or Sinn FÃ©in themselves, are brave and honourable enough to supply to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or the Ombudsman the information necessary to institute criminal proceedings.
We are not in danger of creating a precedent: this case is unique.
For the first time the provisional movement has been shaken to the core by the depth of reaction from within its own community.
They can now put their words into action.
This case is a test of the movementâs sincerity, of its repeated disavowal of criminal activity in all its forms â or are they just more weasel words?
Time will tell.
I commend the resolution to the House.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to express the wholehearted support of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the McCartney family in their quest for justice, truth and peace.
The McCartney sisters joined us for a group meeting chaired by Martin Schulz, when we â as we shall continue to do â marvelled at their courage and uprightness.
We are very glad that Mr De Rossa and Mr Titley have taken up their cause, approaching it from two sides, which are, though, ultimately one and the same.
If I, not being Irish, address the subject, I do so not least to put it on record that we see this, not as an Irish problem, but as a problem for Europe as a whole.
When, as we are currently doing, we commemorate the end of the Second World War, we also recall that Europe is, for us, the answer to violence, whether or not politically motivated.
The fact is that the sort of acts we are talking about today are not political measures, but criminal activities, albeit wrapped up in a political cloak.
For all of us in this House, though, and for my group at any rate, Europe is about seeking to resolve conflicts, to discuss, and to negotiate; it is not about violence or about finding out who can be most violent.
John Hume, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also attended our group meeting today, and he stressed how important it had always been for him to perceive and acknowledge the differences in this Europe of ours â not just the differences between two sides, but differences on the same side.
What has happened in this instance â the cold-blooded murder of a man simply because someone did not like him or perhaps because his opinions differed from their own â is not acceptable.
Even if a political grouping has definite objectives, it must nonetheless accept differing opinions, and so let me reiterate our wholehearted support for the McCartney family, for these courageous women, these courageous sisters, as they continue their struggle.
We will be alongside them until the day when peace and justice also prevail in Northern Ireland, and, with them, the European spirit among those who do not as yet accept it.
We will fight to the very end.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this resolution on the murder of Robert McCartney.
On my own behalf and that of the ALDE Group, I warmly welcome the sisters and partner of MrÂ McCartney to the European Parliament in Strasbourg today.
I should like to commend their courage and tenacity.
They have raised their case in Belfast, Dublin, Washington DC and now in the European Parliament.
I have no doubt but that we, in Parliament, will give them the strongest possible support in their pursuit of justice.
The circumstances of Robert McCartneyâs murder shocked very many people.
But the forensic clean-up and subsequent intimidation of witnesses and others outraged all of those who genuinely believe in justice, in truth, in the rule of law and democracy itself.
While I know that the original intention was and still is to bring Mr McCartneyâs murderers to justice, that search for justice has influenced the political landscape in Northern Ireland.
It has dared to challenge those who thought of themselves as untouchable. It has forced the spotlight into some of the darker places where violence and intimidation still hold sway.
People have whispered about this for years, but those of us who did not experience it listened with incredulity and, I have to add, a certain amount of disbelief.
However, it is now out in the open.
While I cannot say that it will never happen again, I can say that finally the veil of secrecy has been lifted.
It is not possible in such a short time to give any meaningful background to the situation in Northern Ireland, but like any area where there is conflict, it is always a complex situation.
Those who would have us believe that in Northern Ireland we have the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other, do not accurately describe the situation.
I fully endorse the statement that violence and peace cannot coexist.
But in order to finally eradicate violence and promote peace, there must be genuine willingness to enter into dialogue and to share power, and there must be an acceptance that the past cannot dictate the future.
When we look to the future, we look to women like the McCartneys, who refuse to bow down to intimidation and who want, more than anything, to live in a peaceful society.
Unfortunately, when it comes to the peace process, we do not see too many women around the negotiating table; but when it comes to peace-making and peace-building in communities and neighbourhoods, it is often women who take the leading role; women who have an understanding that peace is not just about political statements, or documents signed or agreements negotiated.
Such agreements are just the framework for peace.
The real work of peace-building takes place in everyday interaction: in schools, offices, clubs and community centres, where women play a hugely important role.
With regard to peace funding, the EU has enabled many people of goodwill to contribute to peace-building in Northern Ireland.
I believe that the EU can make a further contribution today.
If the Police Service of Northern Ireland is unable to bring a prosecution, the EU could grant a financial contribution from the budget line for aid for the victims of terrorism to assist the McCartney family to mount civil proceedings in its search for the truth.
Â Â  . Mr President, I also wish to welcome the partner and relatives of Robert McCartney today.
This weekend, I attended a vigil in London to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of Brian Douglas at the hands of the police.
That is a fact, but no one has been prosecuted or held accountable for his death.
Brianâs family is not alone: there are many such cases in the UK where people have lost loved ones to such violent deaths, yet no one is punished or held to account publicly in a court of law.
The families will tell you of their burning sense of injustice at this state of affairs and their anger that the killer of their loved one will continue to lead their own life, see their own children grow, spend time with friends and all of those things that they have robbed from their victim.
Robert McCartney will never see his children grow.
We know that in many places witnesses have failed to come forward for one of two reasons: a misplaced sense of loyalty or fear of consequences.
In the McCartney case we have both, set against a political backdrop that has further constricted the truth.
Such silence hands the rule of law to thugs and to those who can feel powerful only by creating a culture of fear.
They fear the truth.
The offer from the IRA, as we have heard, to shoot the killers was an affront to justice and shows breathtaking arrogance.
The IRA is not the law!
In Northern Ireland, whatever the past, the ballot box now holds sway and the rule of law goes with that.
There can be no argument for paramilitary justice for any sector of the community and my Group believes there never has been.
So the death holds a symbolism for the future: an opportunity to break with the past.
That is why my Group has decided to support the spirit of the resolution, despite some of the wording and difficulties concerning the possible financial contribution from the Union, which is why we have asked for a separate vote on that issue.
However, the case offers an opportunity to break free from a culture of secrecy and fear and to bring the killers to account.
It is time to break that stranglehold of the past and to create a rule of law that applies to all people in all communities.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group does, of course, wish to give Robert McCartneyâs sisters a very warm welcome to the European Parliament.
We wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to them for having been able, in April, to meet them and to assure them that our group is alongside them in the search for their brotherâs murderer, in their quest for justice, in their search for peace of mind, and in seeking to bring about the social conditions that enable people with differing views to live together in peace.
To them I say: in your campaign against murder, we will always be by your side.
My group supports the justified demand that the murderer or murderers surrender to the police and that the witnesses should make â whether to the police or to the ombudsman or to some other body â statements that will stand up in court and help ensure that the murderer is punished as he deserves to be.
There must be no walls of silence where murder is committed.
It is for all of us to demand that the civil law should banish such things from every society.
Every institution, every association, every party, every individual must use their influence to cause the rule of law to prevail, not only in the European Union, but also throughout the world.
In this sense, we all share in the responsibility for ensuring a climate of openness in every land on earth, one that makes it possible for the rule of law to prevail and for laws to be obeyed.
My group condemns every use of military force as a means of policy.
We condemn state-sponsored oppression and the use of force by the armed services or the police as a means of suppressing democratic movements, every bit as much as we do individual acts of murder or terrorism carried out by individuals or political groups against individuals or the structures of civil society, for such things do nothing to help deal with societyâs problems; on the contrary, they make matters worse.
Believing it to be necessary to support the peace process in Northern Ireland, my group calls on all interested parties to press on with the peace process that was set in motion by the Good Friday Agreement and to actively promote it.
In its motion for a resolution, my groupâs sole concern is with the case of Robert McCartney, and it makes no attempt to establish a connection with certain political groups that are alleged to be responsible for his murder.
There is a difference between someone inciting someone else to do something, doing it themselves, doing it on someone elseâs behalf, or being a member of an organisation.
That is why this resolution is drafted in this way, and I believe you will be able to wholeheartedly endorse its substance.
Â Â  . Mr President, as an Irish MEP, I hesitate to speak on this matter.
Since the tragic killing of Robert McCartney, I am concerned that politicians have pushed their own electoral agenda in the context of the recent elections and have lost sight of the real point of all this.
I am, therefore, going to speak personally.
A man has been unspeakably, brutally murdered and the perpetrators have been able to walk freely and have not yet been brought to justice.
His fiancÃ©e, Bridgeen, his children, his family, are caught up in a fight at a time when they should be free to grieve and work towards closure.
Justice, it seems, is eluding these brave people and so they have come to us.
But what can we offer besides more rhetoric in this already over-opinionated debate?
We can give them what they ask for: financial assistance in their struggle.
Funds will pay the legal bills and that is necessary.
It will not, however, bring them justice: for this, I call on those present on that fateful night to have courage and testify against those who committed this crime.
I ask this, not as a Member of this Parliament, but rather as a mother who cannot imagine the pain this courageous family is going through.
It is this Parliamentâs duty to help financially.
It is our obligation to seek peace for Northern Ireland.
But, as a mother, I mostly beseech those with information on the thugs who perpetrated this act to come forward.
This family needs justice to get closure and completion of this saga and to grieve in peace.
They are in my prayers.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to join with my colleagues in welcoming the McCartney family to the Chamber to witness an unusual, unprecedented debate.
Anybody who hears the story of Robert McCartney and what happened to him cannot but be struck by the malicious intent of those who were there.
We can all, at times, excuse an occasional argument or even an accidental slap that might be given.
But this was the sequence of events that took place that night: Robert McCartney was specifically targeted and people were instructed to take him out and kill him; those same people were then instructed to ensure that no emergency services could assist him and told to clean up the bar, eliminating all signs of any involvement or any link to any individual through forensic evidence and so on. We could have excused an accident or mishap, but that kind of premeditation and malicious intent cannot be excused.
The women of the McCartney family â Paula, Catherine, Donna, Gemma, Clare and Bridgeen â who are ordinary women in every aspect of their lives, have done something extraordinary.
Through their pain, sorrow and search for justice they have united people across countries and political divides, including those who have had no involvement in any form of politics but can empathise with the pain and suffering of a family.
It is now incumbent on those who have influence in Northern Ireland and those who have influence on these members of the IRA and other political organisations to give them up to the police service and the prosecution; to allow for justice to rule and prevail.
We speak about democracy on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
We speak about justice and remembering victims.
