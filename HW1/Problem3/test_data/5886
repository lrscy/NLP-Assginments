The European Union does not have a minority protection system in place at this time, even though one in seven European citizens belongs to a traditional national minority.
And finally, as regards the debate: the Roma and those without citizenship must be given increased protection, as a minority within minorities, and it is a shame that in several Member States there are several hundreds of thousands of people without citizenship.
This situation must be remedied, and CommissionerÂ Å pidla deserves our thanks for wishing to move forward in combating discrimination.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to call attention to an essential problem, which may have caused serious concerns to the rapporteur, who has indeed been very successful in including in the report certain issues and concepts with the emphasis they deserve.
Such issues are, for instance, positive discrimination, and as regards traditional minorities, the issues of autonomy, self-governance and political presence.
However, I want to call attention to a very important phenomenon: unfortunately, under the general policy of prohibiting discrimination, we cannot find solutions for all minorities in different life situations.
If we are really looking for solutions and not just for window-dressing measures, it is very important to address the concerns specific to each minority seriously.
I would like to stress that we must differentiate between traditional and new minorities, sexual minorities and other minorities.
If we do not clarify these concepts and Community problems â each of which are considerable in themselves, and require serious measures at Community level â then we are not contributing to finding a solution, but to the creation of conceptual confusion and misleading issues.
Â Â  â The report encourages the complete eradication of discrimination on grounds of nationality or origin, restrictions on minorities or non-citizens and inequality in the areas of education, health and living standards within the European Union as soon as possible.
The Commission ought to take action against states, which are unable to implement EU anti-discrimination legislation.
Europe's movement forward will be smoother if people, who do not have EU citizenship, integrate into European society.
They are very varied â emigrants from Islamic countries in France and other old EU countries, the Russian speaking minority in Latvia and Estonia.
Lithuania does not have this problem, but we are more sensitive to our neighbours' situation than others.
The demographic situation in the two countries mentioned is unique; it came about under particular conditions, which have not been experienced by either the old or the new EU Member States.
Therefore, the progress of incorporating non-citizens into local communities must go hand in hand with their resolution to accept that they live in Latvia or Estonia, that they are becoming citizens of the European Union, and not some other union.
While retaining their own distinctive culture, which makes Europe a richer place, they must respect their state, be proficient in its language and have the knowledge of its history and traditions.
It is the duty of politicians to create the conditions appropriate for this.
The ever increasing participation of non-citizens in elections is logical only if they participate constructively as well as more and more actively in the social and political life of their country.
The report being considered makes an important encouragement for the states to establish institutions to fight discrimination.
The statistical data being compiled by the Commission and national government institutions will help greatly to assess the damage caused by discrimination.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, although my political group does not share the same positions as the rapporteur, I should like to thank MrsÂ Åœdanoka for her work and her contribution to this subject, which I hold dear.
The rapporteur has demonstrated her desire to advance further in the collective and daily fight against discrimination.
This political will is, in fact, crucial, and I should like to take advantage of this opportunity, once again, to remind the Council, which is still blocking the framework-decision against racism and xenophobia, that this interruption is altogether unacceptable.
My group is not completely satisfied with the report: several paragraphs are long, unclear and the proposed definitions may give rise to misinterpretation.
Two points trouble us in particular.
Firstly, paragraph 11: my group cannot accept the rapporteur's proposal to grant migrants of Roma origin and non-citizens the right to vote in all elections, as that is going much too far.
If migrants or non-citizens wish to participate in the life of the country in which they are settled, then they can quite simply request to become full citizens of that country, provided that the country helps them to gain access to citizenship.
Secondly, paragraph 30: it is obviously crucial to treat all forms of discrimination on an equal footing.
Combating homophobia in our societies is therefore of the utmost importance. That is why the first part of the paragraph concerned is entirely satisfactory, but we will not vote in favour of the second part calling for the principle of mutual recognition to be applied to same-sex marriages.
We must respect the rules and the laws of the various Member States.
Ladies and gentlemen, the message that our Parliament must send out is clear: yes, we must respect each individual, and yes, we must promote tolerance, equal opportunities and diversity, but we must do so while respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
Â Â  Mr President, the report we are discussing this evening has significant implications for the citizens of the European Union, as it concerns the fight against all kinds of discrimination, which is something we still commonly encounter even now in the 21st century and in countries that are highly developed economically.
The social and economic consequences of discrimination against citizens are very serious.
This is why the fight against discrimination should be based on providing education in the broadest sense of the word at a very early age, and on effective information campaigns based on best practices.
The Commissionâs decision to declare 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities is a step in the right direction in the fight against discrimination.
Let us hope that this will encourage protection of individual rights and an increased awareness of different forms of discrimination.
However, the funds earmarked for the Year of Equal Opportunities are not sufficient to achieve the expected results.
These actions should therefore also be continued in years to come.
Member States should aim to guarantee equality, in terms of social and political rights, for everyone living in the European Union.
Being different cannot be understood as being worse and therefore all citizens of the European Union should have the same right to a dignified life and equal opportunities for career development.
That is why I strongly support MrsÂ Åœdanokaâs report and congratulate her on a well-prepared document.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the discussion which has just taken place and which clearly expressed the will of the European Parliament to back a series of measures in the area of equal opportunities, the fight against discrimination and the struggle for equal rights.
You spoke from various standpoints, covering various aspects of this sustained effort from the European Union, which, as I have already stated in my introduction, is one of the foundation stones on which our Union is built.
I hope you will allow me to comment very briefly on some of the points raised.
Regarding the issue of positive measures, I feel that it is incorrect from any standpoint to talk about positive discrimination, since the measures discussed are really there to remove disadvantages and not to provide unfair advantages to anyone.
European legislation facilitates such positive measures.
We therefore decided through the medium of the work group to gather and assess examples of positive measures from individual Member States, and I think that this will prove to be of some importance.
There was also mention of the important issue of data collection.
I have already stated this in my introductory statement, but nevertheless I hope you will allow me to say it one more time.
European legislation does not prevent collection of the relevant data.
Data protection is naturally important from the viewpoint of the individual, but we can of course use duly and correctly processed anonymous data, so it is therefore a question of formulating the right methodologies.
I mentioned the reports through which we would like to formulate a method for measuring equality of opportunity or, as the case may be, for assessing levels of equality of opportunity, and in this respect we do of course need the required statistical data.
I think that it is consequently a question of the appropriate methodologies.
As I have already said, there are no structural obstacles from the standpoint of European law.
One important issue receiving a positive assessment was the year 2007.
I think that this represents a real chance for assessing equality of opportunity from all possible viewpoints and for significantly raising the profile of our efforts, giving a very strong impulse for development in the years ahead.
Concerning legislation â at present there are two basic directives in force, and these directives mark a very significant advance.
I have to say that it is now apparent that precise and reliable implementation on the part of the Member States still has not been achieved in many cases, although Member States are clearly devoting considerable energy to getting the directives applied.
The European Commission will therefore push for the use of all legal measures at its disposal because, as I have already stated, it is hugely important to apply these measures fairly so that they may bring about a real result.
There is of course the open question of new legal instruments.
As I have already mentioned, we are looking into this matter.
In my view the clear principle applies that if legislation is necessary it should be introduced.
On the other hand, however, it is always very important to assess whether the same effect might not be achieved through existing applicable instruments.
We are considering the question of possible further legislation very seriously and we will produce our conclusions in 2007.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank you once again for the discussion and for the report.
I do not know, of course, what will result from the report being debated and adopted by Parliament, but in any case the discussion that has taken place has been clear and rewarding, providing the Commission with a good guide for its future work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the report of MrsÂ Åœdanoka includes, among other things, several issues affecting the Roma, which are important for ensuring equal opportunities.
I would like to talk about an area that is very important for the Roma community: statistical data collection.
In view of historical and legal aspects, in Hungary it is very unpleasant to talk about the collection of ethnic data involving the Roma.
In my opinion, the research of discrimination using statistical methods may provide data that may be useful to the Roma community, and obviously to other ethnic and minority groups, as well.
These data are already available to us, albeit indirectly â for instance, in Hungary we can delimit the areas where the Roma live by examining the under-schooling indicators and the statistical figures of underdeveloped areas â and they may become statistical figures reflecting the efficiency of employment, housing and education programmes affecting the Roma.
In this respect, statistical data may be used as evidence in the evaluation of the efficiency of initiatives.
They may also become an excellent instrument in the fight to eliminate indirect discrimination, by presenting an authentic picture of, for instance, the extent to which a Member State has been able to apply the anti-discrimination directives transposed into its legal system.

We must recognise the possibilities provided by monitoring, especially because the numerous available programmes of the last decade, aimed at helping to improve the quality of life of the Roma, have hardly made any changes in their situation. This was also due to the fact that we did not have an empirical method to prove the positive or negative outcome of the initiative.
Â Â  This excellent report has managed to present a comprehensive and detailed picture of the problems related to discrimination, mentioning painful areas and further actions to be taken.
One of the most important instruments in the fight against discrimination is because learning may provide an opportunity for the disadvantaged to break out of their situation, and on the other hand, without an accepting, accommodating and respectful attitude, even the best-intended help offered by the majority society may have a destructive effect. have been created by equal treatment.
Positive measures that facilitate a balanced representation in all areas of society are very important to those who suffer from cumulative disadvantages.
I am glad that the report emphasises the necessity of regarding those in especially disadvantaged situations, such as the Roma, because the increasing exclusion of the Roma and their segregation in schools is typically a new Member State phenomenon.
We welcome the fact that the regulation regarding the European Social Fund has become open to a wider social acceptance, including the financing of programmes facilitating tolerance and the social acceptance of minorities.
However, positive legislation and the creation of programmes is only one side of the coin.
An increased control of the adoption of European Union laws is required, to ensure that Member States are implementing them appropriately; on the other hand, such control would create a possibility for detecting efficiency and the necessity for any changes.
The Fundamental Rights Agency could play a special role in this, but unfortunately the creation of the Agency has been postponed indefinitely, due to the disagreement of the Council.
Â Â  The report draws attention to the importance of fundamental European values and to the fact that they must be incorporated into the national laws of all Member States, and enforced.
I believe that the 2007 Year of Equality should be publicised more widely than it has been so far.
All European citizens should become aware that every person in Europe is entitled to freedom from discrimination and to equal opportunities.
This means that citizens should be made aware of the relevant legislation and possibilities for legal redress.
The dialogue between cultures is already needed in 2007, because it may be an instrument in the fight against discrimination, as well as an instrument for social integration and for strengthening European identity.
Since discrimination is caused, to a large extent, by a lack of knowledge, we must start to address the problem in its early phase: it must be addressed in education, to ensure that children become aware of the importance of tolerance and diversity at an early age, and to ensure that tolerance and diversity become a value; fear of one another and the resulting aggression should not be allowed to become the characteristic feature of relations between cultures.
I agree with the rapporteur as regards the necessity of additional legislation, and would I ask the Commission to fulfil actively its obligation as guardian of the Treaties, as described in paragraph 26 of the report, and to prepare comprehensive legislation as soon as possible in the area of combating discrimination.
At the same time, I would also like to press for practical steps to be taken, and propose that within an open coordination system, Parliament, too, should call to account Member States in respect of concrete programmes for 2007-2008 and their results.
I would also like to emphasise, separately, the importance of the media, and the possibilities it provides for combating discrimination, because our objective is to address as wide an audience as possible, and to ensure that our policy in this area becomes reliable.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council to take place in Brussels on 15 and 16 June, including the next steps in the period of reflection, and on the oral question to the Commission on the next steps in the period of reflection, by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (O-0033/2006 â B6-0208/2006).
For this purpose, Mr Winkler is here, on behalf of the Council, as is Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, accompanied by Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, Vice-President of the Commission.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, MadamÂ Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in a few daysâ â even hoursâ â time, the Austrian Council Presidency will experience a high point in the shape of the European Council, which will give us the opportunity to address and discuss a whole range of issues to which our Presidency has been attending, and to lay down results.
During the Austrian Presidency, a great many issues have been addressed, and a great many such issues and problems have been solved â very often together with you, the European Parliament.
The topics for this European Council are very diverse, and so I shall have to confine myself to a brief outline of many of them.
I am not claiming to cover everything, as I naturally wish to avoid encroaching too much on the speaking time of the Members of this House.
The forthcoming Summit will be a working Summit.
There are no epoch-making decisions on the agenda, but the Austrian Presidencyâs harvest â where it has not already been brought in â will be just outside the barn door.
The barn door is wide open, and now we want to bring the harvest in.
In recent weeks and months, the Austrian Council Presidency has started work on a dual approach to bringing Europe forward â and this also applies to the forthcoming European Council.
Firstly, this has involved addressing specific issues with the aim of making progress on the ones that are closest to the people: issues relating to prosperity, economic growth, job security, internal and external security, social security, energy security and much more.
Secondly, this approach has involved reviving the continuous debate on the future of Europe.
This dual approach combining specific issues with the future of Europe will also shape the agenda of the European Council.
Therefore, the Council agenda will contain first and foremost a number of issues that all participants agree require European solutions.
These are issues that present our societies and citizens with problems that, in a globalised world, cannot be sensibly addressed without a concerted effort from all the EU Member States and, I would add, by all the institutions of the EU.
The first large group of issues concerns the area of security, freedom and justice.
All the surveys on this, including the one by the Commission â and Commission Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m has also said this time and again â show that the public wants more Europe, expects more from Europe, in this particular field.
In the last six months, a great deal of tangible progress has been achieved in this field: I shall make only brief mention of the counter-terrorism strategy, the enlargement of the Schengen area and the conclusion of visa facilitation and readmission agreements with various third countries.
We have also invested a great deal of time and energy in a Strategy for the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs in the last six months â including making a start on developing a security belt, as it were, around the EU â and initiated a security partnership between the EU, our neighbouring countries, Russia and the United States.
This Vienna Initiative, agreed at a tripartite Summit between the EU, Russia and the USA, will also be reflected in the conclusions of the European Council.
Migration has been and remains a particularly important issue and will also be dealt with by the Council, on the basis of a number of specific cases.
Time does not permit me to go into too much detail.
This important issue warrants its own debate, where it would have to be examined from various points of view: not only from the point of view of the fight against illegal immigration and of judicial and police cooperation, but also from a development perspective.
As the person responsible for development matters in the last six months, I can say that we have been doing considerable work on the issue of migration within the framework of the EUâs development strategy, too, and that this is an important approach that we must not forget, including in our public presentation of the problem.
There is no doubt that individual measures will be of no avail in this regard: only an effective bundle of measures will help.
Everything I have mentioned up to now is of course work in progress, and so the European Council is likely to invite the parties concerned to continue the momentum of work in all these fields.
Europe should also bring greater security through its efforts to improve its emergency and crisis response capacities.
Austria has been particularly committed to this in the months of its Presidency.
The European Council will be presented with a report on this listing progress to date and making recommendations for further action.
Former Commissioner and French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier has presented a very comprehensive, stimulating, forward-looking report, which will undoubtedly be examined closely by all the institutions of the EU in the coming weeks and months.
It contains a number of good ideas for solving this problem to the benefit of public security.
Another very important issue that cannot be sensibly solved without pan-European solutions is sustainable development.
As we know, the EU has had a strategy on this since the Gothenburg European Council inÂ 2001, whose objective is for all decisions to reflect the responsible management of natural resources.
This guideline has now been completely renewed under the Austrian Presidency and further developed into an ambitious, comprehensive new strategy for a whole range of key fields such as climate change, clean energy, transport, and emphasis on sustainable consumption and production patterns.
The issue of climate change, too, is on the agenda in this context.
The issue of the Lisbon Strategy is, of course, another important topic for the European Council now to be held in Brussels.
As Austrian Chancellor SchÃŒssel also reported here, the European Council examined this strategy in detail back in March, and provided a good deal of specific guidance.
Since then, success has been achieved in the form of two important milestones: the compromise on freedom to provide services, for which the Council owes Parliament a great debt of gratitude â I should like to make that absolutely clear and express my thanks to the House â and the agreement in principle on the Seventh Framework Programme.
In the case of the Services Directive, the Council stayed as faithful as possible to Parliamentâs compromise.
This Directive is a good example of how the institutions of the EU, cooperating constructively and efficiently, can achieve tangible progress to the benefit of our citizens.
The Austrian Presidency is particularly obliged to Parliament for this.
It goes without saying that the issue of energy policy will be another important topic for the European Council.
This issue has been examined and discussed on a large number of occasions, including in relation to third countries â and yesterday I had the opportunity to report to this House on the Summit with the Russian Federation.
As regards the discussion within the Council, the main emphasis has been on the requisite internal measures, such as improving energy efficiency and moving over to renewable sources of energy.
We now need to take external measures, too, and to this end we need a common, proactive approach that is properly thought out in geostrategic terms.
On the instructions of the European Council, the Commission and Council Secretary-General Javier Solana have prepared a strategy paper that will be presented to the European Council.
Another issue on which, according to surveys, the public expects more Europe is the issue of external policy, of the EUâs external relations.
The majority of the European public wants the EU to play an important role on the international stage.
In spite of the progress achieved in recent years â and I believe this to be considerable â the EU still does not have the weight befitting its economic power and its contribution to international trade.
There remain a number of deficiencies to be remedied, and thanks are due to the Commission for preparing a concept paper on this, which makes a number of proposals.
I am sure that the Commission President will also report on this.
The issue of improving the functioning of the Union is also on the agenda of the European Council, of course.
This rather grandiose title covers the efforts of the European Council to achieve tangible progress that is also measurable by individual citizens.
This includes a number of initiatives that I should like to outline in brief.
One initiative that is very important to the Austrian Council Presidency â and, I should add, to me personally â is the issue of transparency in the Council.
These efforts are nothing new â progress has already been made in this direction â but the Austrian Council Presidency has attempted to find a global approach intended to create a new conscience about transparency, as it were.
The core of this proposal consists in making the whole codecision procedure in all its stages open to the public.
We believe that this is also a way of improving public confidence.
We have not yet resolved all the reservations, but our Presidency is resolute in its intention to work towards this up to the last possible minute.
Subsidiarity has been an important issue, as, in addition to a conscience about transparency, we undoubtedly need greater awareness of subsidiarity.
I should like to make it absolutely clear â because I know that here in Parliament, in particular, scepticism is expressed time and again â that we are not talking here about a desire for re-nationalisation.
I wish to make clear that our Presidency has been guided by a different objective.
We are talking about helping to focus European action on the specific fields in which it is capable of producing added value.
To this end, the Austrian Council Presidency organised a conference that was held in mid-April in St.Â PÃ¶lten, Austria, with the title âEurope begins at homeâ.
This saw significant participation by Members of Parliament, of course, and you are familiar with the interesting proposals unveiled there.
It is important to us that this issue now be a fixed item on the agenda and that it be borne in mind even more consciously than before.
I shall mention only briefly the considerable progress we have managed to achieve â and I hope that this will indeed be the case â on the issue of comitology.
This is about powers of scrutiny, it is about the Commission, Parliament and the Council interacting efficiently.
If the proposal drawn up yesterday between the negotiators can now be pushed through â both in the Council and Parliament â we shall have achieved progress that, although on a rather dry issue, is nevertheless important for our cooperation.
I should now like to move on to the last part of my speech: the future of Europe, the constitutional process, and the period of reflection.
The period of reflection on which the European Council decided last June has meant that many Member States have taken more or less intensive initiatives to set in motion a real debate about the European project.
The issue of European identity, too, has been examined from various starting points.
I would remind the House of the âSound of Europeâ conference at the start of the Austrian Presidency, and also of an event that, in my opinion, can definitely be called a success â the (European CafÃ©) event that was held at the same time in all the capitals on Europe Day.
The Commission, too, has been very active, having developed its Plan D. I should like to express my particular thanks to Commission Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m for her constructive cooperation.
We have had a good working relationship with the Commission, to the benefit of greater transparency and a better response to citizensâ demands and expectations.
It has emerged that Member States would like to extend this period of reflection in one form or another by at least one year.
The detailed arrangements and what should happen afterwards will be discussed intensively at the European Council and the relevant proposals made.
Moving on to the subject of the Constitutional Treaty, we have succeeded in breaking the silence that reigned at first.
It was not a foregone conclusion that this debate could be revived, but we worked hard at it and, in late May, succeeded in holding a discussion of this issue between Ministers for Foreign Affairs for the first time in more than a year.
As one of the participants in this discussion, I can say that it was very open, wide-ranging and useful and did clarify the way forward on many points, even if no specific decisions were reached.
It has become clear to all of us that the problems which the Constitutional Treaty is and has been intended to solve are still on the EUâs common agenda and that we must continue to pursue the constitutional project as a common European project.
The discussion between Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Klosterneuburg also made clear that the time is not yet ripe for a definitive solution to the legal issues connected with the Constitutional Treaty, because not all Member States are ready as yet.
Therefore, it will be a challenge for the whole of the Union and a particular challenge for the coming Presidencies to work to ensure that, byÂ 2009, there is clarity regarding the legal basis of the EU of the future.
After all, 2009 is a crucial year for various reasons: it will see not only a new European Parliament, but also one or two institutional challenges, such as a new composition of the Commission.
It is not yet possible to determine the exact mandate the European Council will grant in this regard, whether a time frame will be fixed â and if so, what it will be â and how to proceed with regard to this; the Heads of State or Government will discuss and take decisions on this.
I believe that that will certainly be one of the key topics at the forthcoming European Council.
One thing is clear as far as the Austrian Council Presidency is concerned, however: we must work together with all the Member States and all the institutions to make progress on the key issues surrounding the future of the European Union.
Finally, there is EU enlargement, another issue that will be given prominence at the European Council.
I do not wish to go into detail on individual countries.
You are familiar with the status of the respective negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, which â we all hope â will accede to the Union on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
You probably followed the progress made the day before yesterday at the accession conferences with Turkey and Croatia in the face of all the problems that had arisen in the case of Turkey, in particular.
In Klosterneuburg, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs did succeed in reaching some agreement on further common action.
The Heads of State or Government will continue this discussion and determine how to proceed in the coming months.
It has emerged that, in the second half of this year, the Commission will be working out, among other things, a contribution to the debate on the European Unionâs capacity to cope with enlargement â for which, as you know, there have been calls from Parliament, too.
The conclusions of the European Council will mention the situation regarding the Western Balkans.
As you know, this has been a particular priority for the Austrian Council Presidency.
This issue is to be seen in the context of a policy of peace and stability in the Balkans.
We shall be referring once more to the Salzburg Declaration by Ministers for Foreign Affairs and to the prospect of EU membership it holds out to the countries of the Western Balkans.
A number of external âpolicy issues will be addressed at the European Council and declarations made on them: on the Western Balkans, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and the Middle East, respectively; and the EU Strategy for Africa will also feature on the agenda.
As you can see, there is an extensive menu in store for our Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission.
I hope that you will agree that we have worked hard over the past months on making some progress on all of these important issues, and we hope that the European Council will succeed in rounding off several issues and stimulating such discussion of others as is necessary in the coming period in the interests of Europe and of our citizens.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, one year on from the start of the period of reflection, it is time to take stock of matters.
What stage are we at?
What can we do to move Europe forward?
What can one expect from the European Council?
I will begin by saying to you that a spectre haunts Europe: that of Euro-pessimism.
While we already had the traditional Euroscepticism of those who have never wanted Europe to be a political project, we now have the pessimism of those who like to think of themselves as staunch Europeans and who very often sink into a state of âcrisisphiliaâ, each one of them keen to demonstrate today that he or she has a better idea than the next person about the reasons why Europe is undergoing a profound crisis.
What has caused this Euro-pessimism?
To a large extent, it has been the shadow cast by the 'No' votes in the referendums in two of our Member States.
This shadow has raised doubts about Europe and about Europeâs ability to define a project for us to live together as Europeans.
That is one of the reasons why we need to find a solution to the constitutional issue.
I should like to make it perfectly clear: we, at the European Commission, are in favour of the principles, the values and the substance of the Constitutional Treaty.
It is a question of knowing, firstly, why we need this constitutional text.
What do we lose by not having a Constitutional Treaty?
We lose a clarification of the powers between the various levels, we lose an extension of the codecision procedure and an extension of qualified majority voting, we lose a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights, we lose an EU Foreign Affairs Minister who would also act as the Vice-President of the Commission, and we lose more effective action in areas such as public health, food safety and even energy, because the Constitution was extending the powers in that area.
We also lose an extra degree of consistency in external matters.
On this point, I should like to say to you â and my one and a half yearâs experience as President of the Commission confirms this â that we, in Europe, genuinely need what the Constitutional Treaty was providing us with externally: more effectiveness, more democracy and more consistency.
The current Treaties do not allow us fully to achieve all of these objectives.
Let us be clear, Nice is not enough.
It is a question of knowing how to overcome this situation.
Will we succeed in settling this problem by talking day in day out about the Constitution?
Will we succeed in settling this problem by restricting ourselves to a pragmatic approach?
I would say no; I would say that we need to avoid two traps.
Firstly, the trap that consists in saying, as some people would have it, that the Constitution is dead and buried and that we should only do practical things: that would be dangerous for Europe.
Moreover, it would also be dangerous for Europe, I should point out, if, at this point, we were to let ourselves get caught up in a purely institutional or constitutional debate, if we were to claim that we are being held up now while we await a solution to the constitutional issue.
That is why we must progress on two levels, as is explained in our document of 10Â May concerning the twin-track approach.
The first level relates to a Europe of results, a Europe of practical projects, but â and we are coming to the second level â a Europe of results that is not in opposition, that is not an alternative, to political Europe, and that is, in contrast, a prerequisite for gaining the citizens' support for Europe as a great political project.
Therefore, it is not about choosing between a Europe of results and an institutional Europe, it is about choosing them both.
We need a Europe of projects and results if we are to have a great project for Europe.
What is this Europe of results that is being proposed?
Despite everything, we have already achieved certain things.
That is why I cannot agree with all those who say that Europe is at a complete standstill.
I believe that, albeit unintentionally, they are compounding this crisis situation.
I understand that it is the analystsâ job to say that Europe is at a standstill, but, as political leaders, we have a responsibility.
Do you really believe that we are going to restore confidence among Europeans merely by sending out negative messages?
No.
In order to move Europe forward, we must revive people's hopes, restore their confidence and demonstrate what progress has been made.
The truth is that, even after the two âNoâ votes in the referendums, we were able to settle the budgetary issue for the next seven years, and to do so for 27 countries.
Thanks to the European Parliamentâs contribution, we were able, despite everything, to find a political solution to the very controversial problem of the Services Directive.
We were able, despite everything, to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment.
We have launched a common energy strategy in Europe, something that was unthinkable two years ago.
Let us therefore carry on making progress on the basis of practical projects.
Let us achieve results so that we can create the right moment to deal with the institutional issue.
In our document of 10Â May, we make some practical proposals.
Without wishing to go into the details of these proposals again, I shall point out a few of them.
To see what is not working in the single market in order to protect consumers in Europe.
To see what obstacles still stand in the way of fully completing the great European market.
To review our social sphere: what are the obstacles to a more united Europe?
At the same time as making progress on the issue of the market, we must make progress on the social issue.
On the basis of the existing Treaties, to make progress in relation to justice, cooperation and the fight against terrorism and crime.
It is possible, on the basis of the current Treaties, to do more in terms of immigration and of the fight against illegal immigration, at the same time as dealing with issues concerning legal migration.
This is a major issue.
If the Member States want to do more, then they can do so on the very basis of the Treaties.
Therefore, this is not simply an institutional matter, this is also a matter of political will.
Let us therefore make progress in relation to justice and security.
These are areas in which Europeans are calling on the Member States to do more, because it is obvious today that each one of us, on our own, cannot combat terrorism and cannot face up to the challenges of illegal migration: we must work together.
A great deal more can be done, too, in relation to the external dimension.
The right solution is the one included in the Constitution: a Foreign Affairs Minister, Vice-President of the Commission.
We must pool our skills and our resources in external matters, but, in view of the fact that there is still no Constitution, the Commission presented a document a few days ago that contains practical proposals designed to increase the effectiveness, consistency and visibility of the European Union in external matters.
Moreover, we have made some important proposals regarding subsidiarity, transparency and better regulation for Europe.
We have there a series of practical projects, and that is without mentioning the two major areas that, in my opinion, will project Europe into the future: energy, following on from the Green Paper that we presented, and research.
These are two key priorities.
The truth is that our research budget will increase by 60% for the next seven years compared with the previous period.
That is why we proposed to create a network-based European Institute of Technology, with a view to giving a European vocation to our research efforts and to attracting the best researchers in the world.
Why are the best European researchers now based in the United States?
Why are we unable to attract the best Chinese, Indian, Latin American or American researchers here, to Europe?
We also need a symbolic project designed to harness our abilities in the field of research.
Thus, let us rally around certain practical projects that can restore peopleâs confidence in Europe: this is the Europe of projects.
The Europe of projects is not enough, however; we must settle the institutional matter too.
What are we proposing on this issue?
We are proposing to move on now from the so-called period of reflection and enter into a commitment period.
The first important stage is next year, when we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the European Community and the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.
I do not believe that the Heads of State or Government can let the 50th anniversary of our Union come and go without committing themselves to this project for living together as Europeans.
There are two possibilities: either we make a declaration focused solely on the past, in other words a simple commemoration, or we make a declaration focused on the future, a way of renewing our commitment for the sake of our common project.
As President of the Commission, I believe that I have the duty to ask the Heads of State or Government, who are the stakeholders of our projects, to renew their commitment.
I believe that you too, as Members of the European Parliament, will have a right to ask our Heads of State or Government whether they wish to invest in this project for living together as Europeans, which is needed now more than ever in this globalised world.
That is what we are going to do.
That is why I have proposed a declaration that is not simply a new Messina Declaration.
You will remember the Messina Declaration, following the failure of the project for a European Defence Community; that declaration made it possible to revive Europe and subsequently to create the European Economic Community.
It was signed by the Foreign Affairs Ministers.
That is no longer possible today.
As I have already said: Europe will not be bureaucratic, technocratic or merely diplomatic; Europe must be democratic.
That is why all of Europeâs institutions must be involved and why I propose that this declaration be signed not only by the Heads of State or Government, but also by the Commission and by the European Parliament, which occupies a central position nowadays in the process of European integration.
If we succeed in this undertaking, by putting all of our energy into it, we will have an opportunity next year to relaunch the European constitutional process and the process of building a Europe that is an enlarged Europe, and that involves a debate on enlargement.
I do not believe in a miniature Europe, nor in a multi-speed, divided Europe. I do not believe that the response faced with the current situation and faced with the difficulties that Europe is encountering should be to say âlet us divide upâ.
Are we going to let one or two countries create a more advanced Europe while letting the others lag behind?
I do not think so.
I believe that it is our duty to do everything possible to make Europe, in its enlarged form, work.
I say this to you in the light of some previous experience.
If I compare the present situation with what was happening in 1992, for example, when negotiations were taking place with our US, Chinese, Russian and other partners, I can tell you that Europe is more respected outside its borders nowadays that it was previously.
An enlarged Europe is a prerequisite for a powerful Europe.
Let us hold a debate on enlargement.
We recognise that some members of our public have doubts about the rate and the importance of enlargement.
Let us hold a debate on the issue of absorption capacity, but let us do so by highlighting the added value that enlargement has already represented for Europe.
That is the Europe that I so earnestly desire.
An enlarged Europe, an open Europe, a more competitive Europe, a Europe that is much more than just a market, a Europe that has a political project, and a political project that is based on the idea of solidarity because, without solidarity, the very idea of a Union does not exist.
That is the great project for the Europe of the 21st century.
Not a closed Europe, nor a small, miniature Europe, but a great, enlarged Europe that is capable of shaping globalisation, instead of suffering the consequences of it.
That is the great project for Europe.
If it is to be achieved, it is vital that politicians emerge from the vicious circle of Euro-pessimism and can start to build the virtuous circle of trust, with practical results, of course, but also with this great vision of our great Europe.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the speeches by the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission have conveyed the good impression that the European Constitution is not dead but very much alive, and that there is the common will to bring this important European project to a successful conclusion.
I believe that this Parliament can support wholeheartedly what we have heard.
The Austrian Presidency has revived the constitutional debate.
That is a good thing, and it has been hard work, but we can see that all parties are now back round the table and deliberating together how to proceed.
I believe that many issues on the agenda at the Summit â from energy policy to development policy to the common foreign policyÂ â and many other issues would be easier to resolve with the new Constitutional Treaty than with the old Treaty of Nice.
For this reason, the constitutional debate we need is not an institutional, but an eminently political debate.
We must also inform people of the costs of not having the Constitution.
In our resolution, we ask the Commission President to present the people with a study showing everything we stand to lose by not having this new Treaty.
This lunchtime, plenary will vote on a resolution containing a number of demands and also ideas for the next period of reflection and the further course of the constitutional process.
The number one message to the Summit is that we once again need a declaration from all 25Â Member States that they support this common project and are also willing to continue the ratification process.
This declaration is necessary because other public statements have occasionally given the impression that the Member States concerned are distancing themselves from their commitments, and that would be a real crisis of confidence and a breakdown in loyalty among the Member States.
I hope that the Summit can send out this message.
The second point I should like to raise is that we would caution against breaking up this global compromise and cherry-picking or dismantling this Treaty.
That would weaken the project of a political Europe and endanger cohesion.
Thirdly, it is music to our ears that the Summit is to decide on a timetable.
The EU has always been successful when it has been working towards a clear objective and a fixed date.
That was the case with the internal market and with the euro, and must now also be the case with the Constitution.
The dates 2007 and 2009 have been mentioned: these tally with those in our resolution, and we need this Treaty for the European elections.
I would caution against going into the European elections with this crisis unresolved â that would strengthen Europeâs opponents and increase Euroscepticsm, perhaps even reduce voter turnout once again.
We need to have succeeded by 2009.
We believe that specific dialogue is needed with the two countries that voted ânoâ in their referendums.
It remains an open question how and under what circumstances these two countries could continue the ratification process.
We cannot get around this point.
The moment of truth will come following the elections in the Netherlands and France, if not sooner, and their partners need to know what the specific problem is with the Treaty.
The ânoâ was very vague, and it is not much use to us.
We need a specific proposal for how we can help and what we should do.
It is about time we saw a commitment to examining this issue more closely â it cannot be resolved by others; no one else can hold the debate in their place.
The effort needs to come from the two countries themselves, but they do need to be asked.
My next point is that the period of reflection is being extended, and indeed all parties should be committed to participating in this reflection.
Some countries are still silent and are not becoming involved.
That is bad for everyone, because these countries, too, still need to ratify the Constitution, and if the population does not know what it is letting itself in for and what is in store for it, that is bad for all the others.
We believe that public involvement should be increased.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs PlanÂ D is good.
We, too, must do our bit towards ensuring that even more money is made available.
We simply need resources, and we also need cross-border projects rather than just national debates.
We must continue to promote this element â from citizen to citizen, from Union citizen to Union citizen.
We have had a very successful interparliamentary forum.
This process requires the participation of not only the executive, but also the legislative bodies, the parliaments, and we, Parliament, are willing to continue this interparliamentary dialogue.
It must be clear by the end of this debate that Europe is not just Brussels; Europe is all of us, wherever we live in our countries, regions and localities â and if we succeed in this, we have achieved real progress.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity, one year after the French and Dutch âNoâ votes and only one day before the European Council, to answer Mr Leinenâs question.
It also gives me the opportunity to outline the Commissionâs position on the period of reflection and on the constitutional process.
I partly replied to that question last month, when I presented this Chamber with the Commissionâs two communications to the European Council â the assessment of the reflection period and PlanÂ D â and the Citizensâ Agenda, to deliver results for Europe.
As President Barroso has already outlined, we have set a Citizensâ Agenda with these concrete projects and the things we want to achieve.
Before I come to the next steps to be taken, let me say this about the first steps.
The Commission, as you have already heard, remains wholly committed to the principles, the values and the efficiency gains that the Constitutional Treaty would bring.
We also welcome further ratifications, as from the Estonian Parliament recently, and as we have heard being announced from the incoming Finnish Presidency.
I would also like to reply to Mr Leinenâs question and proposal to look at the effects of a âNoâ to the Constitution or no Constitutional Treaty, and we are fully willing to do so.
I think we should look at what would be the consequences and the costs of no Constitution at all.
We cannot ignore the fact that right now we have no consensus, no common position among Member States on the fate of the Constitution and the institutional reform that we need so much.
We cannot allow ourselves to be paralysed by this, and we are not doing so, as you have already heard.
To begin with, the Commission intends to implement the ambitious policy-driven agenda to address citizensâ expectations and restore public confidence in the European project.
After President Barrosoâs outline, there can be no doubt about our determination.
We shall deliver, and we will have to do that on the basis of the current treaties.
We cannot afford to wait for what will shortly be 27 Member States to reach a consensus on the constitutional issue.
At the same time, the Commission remains fully committed to debating and engaging in dialogue with citizens at European, national and regional levels.
The methods we will use are set out in Plan D â as in Debate, Dialogue and Democracy.
We should use that to explain the added value of the European project.
We should use that to argue why we need a new Constitutional Treaty.
We should use it to discuss the political priorities with citizens.
Our two institutions may not always agree on every detail, but there is one fundamental belief that we share: our commitment to becoming a more democratic, transparent and effective Union.
And that goes beyond any period of reflection.
I also believe that European affairs suffer from a participatory deficit.
Still, citizens have high expectations on delivery and policy content, and this places important demands on the Member States and on our institutions.
We must involve citizens more in the policy process at all levels, particularly young people and women.
Such initiatives should be concrete and seen as a permanent function of developing European affairs, and they should ensure that the feedback process is taken seriously â what do we do with what we hear in dialogue and engagement with citizens? â and that listening is followed up by concrete actions.
I have said it before and I will say it again: Plan D is not a rescue operation for the Constitution.
It is not limited to the reflection period â be it one year, two years or even more.
It is a starting point for a long-term democratic reform process.
We want to create a citizensâ ownership of EU policies to make them understandable and relevant, and to make EU institutions accountable to and reliable for those they serve.
I see and hear of lot of nostalgic harking back to the good old days of the European Union, but nowadays it is no good having a few men shut themselves away in a castle somewhere trying to solve the problems of the European Union.
Today we need to engage citizens; we need the support and trust of citizens and the confidence of citizens to be able to build a future for the European Union.
We need to engage and create the participatory functioning of the EU institutions.
As you pointed out in your motion for a resolution, we need a special focus in PlanÂ D for the coming year, until the June 2007 Summit.
I have already promised the Commission to come back after this Summit with a kind of mid-term review. I will pay close attention to the Summitâs conclusions in that review, and also to the resolution of this House.
Delivering concrete results and reconnecting with European citizens will create the favourable climate that is necessary for successful institutional reforms; that is the way we motivate it.
So far, Plan D has been a successful exercise in terms of setting off a wide range of activities, and I believe we have started to think and reason somewhat differently.
We focus on what is our reality of today and for the future, how we need to interact with todayâs and tomorrowâs citizens.
Over 660 activities have been taking place in Member States; hundreds of thousands of citizens have visited the Europe debate website.
For the future, I also think, as Mr Leinen does, that we need more of a citizen-to-citizen approach to allow citizens to meet across borders to discuss the European agenda.
We should focus particularly on young people, the Europeans of tomorrow, and mobilise more women in the decision-making process.
We need the whole of the European project to be more participatory, more transparent and more effective, and this ambition goes beyond any period of reflection.
That is the only way we will be able to take the European Union into the future.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I was pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council spoke of a working Summit.
After all, Europe will make progress only as a result of day-to-day efforts, of hard, specific work, and not as a result of brilliant feats of rhetoric â there is no shortage of soapbox speeches in Europe.
I should like to wish the President-in-Office every success for the Summit.
My particular thanks go out to the President of the Commission, however: not only for being here today â he could, of course, say that he is only present when the President of the European Council is here â but for what he has said today.
After all, we recently heard great criticism of the Commission President by our esteemed fellow Member MrÂ Schulz and, as MrÂ Schulz is, of course, known for his objectivity, I am assuming he will be very complimentary about the Commission Presidentâs speech in his own speech shortly.
This dual path â defence of the principles of the substance of the European Constitution on the one hand and specific projects for taking Europe forward on the other â has our strong support.
I wish to stress on behalf of our group that this has our emphatic support, and it would be good if the other group chairmen were to join me in stating that quite clearly.
When we celebrate the anniversary of 25Â MarchÂ 1957 next year â on 25Â MarchÂ 2007 â our group will insist that this event not be a celebration of those Heads of State or Government who engage in mutual appreciation under or in front of pretty flags, but rather that it express Europeâs democracy, and that there be European Parliament involvement in the declaration and the establishment of our objectives for the 21stÂ century.
I am saying this for the benefit of the General Secretariat of the Council, as it does not actually tend to be the Heads of State or Government who obstruct things.
I would call on the General Secretariat of the Council to give Parliament due involvement from the outset, as the Commission President has proposed â for which we should like to express our appreciation and thanks to him.
My second comment concerns security in Europe.
This, of course, is a delicate balancing act â on the one hand, there is the publicâs need for protection against serious crime, against terrorism, against illegal immigration, and we expect specific measures to be taken on this, but, on the other hand, when it comes to immigration, we also expect respect for human dignity and a search for humane measures to deal with illegal immigration.
We cannot accept the situation in which thousands of people are dying a wretched death in the Mediterranean and on the seas of this world, but instead must take specific measures on this, too â to prevent these human tragedies.
A further point concerns the Lisbon Strategy.
On the issue of the Services Directive, we have proved our good will, our capacity for action â and compliments to the Austrian Presidency for taking this path.
We are in favour of a European Institute of Technology â provided that it creates a network rather than new bureaucracy.
As regards energy supply, we are in favour of diversity: diversity with regard to energy sources â we cannot rely on just one form of energy, nor can any form of energy be ruled out â and also diversity with regard to supply.
We cannot rely on a single country or a small number of countries for our energy supply, but need diversity of suppliers too, and the principle of solidarity among all Member States of the EU applies here â we cannot leave anyone in the lurch.
Speaking of the concept of solidarity â and looking here at MrÂ Kasoulides â I consider it unacceptable for us to negotiate with Turkey at the present time â and that is a decision, and taking a decision means the Treaties must be complied with â when Turkey does not recognise one of the Member States of the EU, when it does not extend the customs union under the Ankara Protocol to Cyprus.
This runs contrary to the solidarity that unites us in the EU, and for this reason we must insist that the customs union be put into effect.
My last comment concerns the debate on the Fundamental Rights Agency.
I have my doubts as to whether this is the correct path to take, and I ask that we reconsider.
Of course, the Council of Europe has been presented with a report by Jean-Claude Juncker on this subject.
Parliament needs to consider the best means of cooperation with the Council of Europe and also with its Parliamentary Assembly.
The work that the Council of Europe does today, which has proved its worth, should not simply be transferred to the institutions of the EU; instead, we should concentrate on ways of complementing each other, since the Council of Europe is also a European community of states, with 46Â members.
We have 25, soon to be more, and the activities of each community must complement the otherâs sensibly.
If the Council Presidency takes that into account at the Summit, my praise for the success of this Presidency will be even greater.
I therefore wish the Presidency every success for the Brussels Summit tomorrow and the day after.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start with a comment for the benefit of the President-in-Office of the Council.
The day before yesterday, this Parliament adopted an interim report on the Temporary Committee on the CIA.
The voting in my group was fairly consistent, that in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fairly inconsistent, but nevertheless a majority recognised that the EU is founded upon the rule of law â and I would ask the President-in-Office to convey that message to the Council in preparation for the meeting with George Bush.
The existence of the EU and its Member States is based on the philosophy of the rule of law.
The EU is a place where the rule of law prevails; GuantÃ¡namo and the CIA flights are places of lawlessness.
A community based on the rule of law such as the EU, which defends its values, must say a clear ânoâ to the abuse of our institutions by the US secret services and an even more emphatic ânoâ to the existence of legal vacuums such as GuantÃ¡namo.
I would ask the President-in-Office to convey that message at the Summit.
MrÂ Poettering has made reference to my legendary objectivity, for which I am most obliged to him.
He forgot to add that he was quick to join my criticism of the President of the Commission when he and MrsÂ Martens sent a joint letter with similar content to the Commission President.
To MrÂ SchÃŒssel, too â all of them members of the PPE-DE Group.
It is not our problem if your own house is not in order, MrÂ Poettering.
The President of the Commission has merited praise today, therefore â if he says the right thing, we are on his side.
We say âyesâ to the need for this Constitution, and âyesâ to the reforms that the Constitution must bring in order to replace the inadequate Treaty of Nice.
The fact that he is now stating that in public rather than always leaving CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m in the lurch, that he is declaring his support for it in front of this Parliament, represents progress.
Bravo, you have done well, MrÂ President of the Commission.
That alone is insufficient, however â something else is needed, something that has also been mentioned today.
We need to ask those whose referendums are responsible for throwing out this Constitution what they are actually proposing, how we can surmount this obstacle.
The Governments of France and the Netherlands should also be obliged to suggest to the EU ways of resolving this dilemma.
I have a suggestion for France.
I am fairly sure that, if MrÂ Chirac were to announce that he would resign immediately if the people voted âyesâ to the Constitution, we would be assured of overwhelming majority support for the Constitution from the French.
One thing is clear, however: the EUâs crisis is also a crisis for some governments, and that is the reason time and again for the inability of the European Council to move forward on most points, as some governments do not want this Constitutional Treaty and others are hiding behind those who do not want it.
Incidentally, that is true of Denmark, Portugal and all those with a difference of opinion from the three present and future Council Presidencies.
The Prime Minister of Finland, Matti Vanhanen, is courageous in symbolically ratifying and declaring his support for the Constitution during the Finnish Council Presidency.
I think that it is good that Austrian Chancellor SchÃŒssel has declared his support for this Constitution.
Although the proposal he has made for this referendum is not a new one and has already been discussed by the Convention, it does show that Austria wants this Constitution.
The German Government, which will then hold the third successive Council Presidency, has declared its firm support for this Constitution, which is a good sign.
Anyone who says that this Constitution is dead is mistaken.
The Councilâs proposal, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, to demand a solemn declaration from leaders of whether they do indeed wish to further European integration, whether they really support the principles of deepening integration, whether they still support the spirit of the Treaties of Rome 50Â years on, is a good idea.
The content is what makes the difference â it must state that the solemn declaration being made is one not of noble objectives, but of concrete action.
It could read, for example: yes, we want the Constitution â its content, in particular â to become reality.
After all, one thing is absolutely clear â and I say this on behalf of our group and of all its members: we want EU enlargement.
We welcome the draft conclusions on Romania and Bulgaria.
We know that the prospective accession of the Balkan States has a peacemaking effect there.
For this reason, we declare our belief in the necessity of enlargement.
Without the constitutional reforms and the associated division of powers, however; without the clarity of action or the democratising potential that the Constitution holds, this enlargement is impossible â unless we want to destroy Europe, which we do not.
For this reason, we are all required to continue to fight for this Constitution, so that Europe retains its basis in the rule of law and acquires the economic strength it needs to meet the challenges of the 21stÂ century.
Â Â  Mr President, the success of this weekâs Summit rests, first and foremost, on delivering on one concept: democratisation.
Democracy, transparency and accountability must be the building blocks that shape the future of our Union.
Without a clear commitment to all three, we will be left with the piecemeal solutions that have stalled reform efforts hitherto and reinforced public distrust in the Union.
Europe will be built with the support of the citizens or not at all.
Addressing the democratic deficit means an end to the rubber-stamping of regulations behind closed doors.
That is why my group congratulates the Austrian Presidency on building on commitments to make transparency the rule rather than the exception in EU policy-making and welcomes the willingness shown by the President of the Commission to publish the names of those who sit on thousands of European Union advisory committees.
We still look forward to receiving them, MrÂ Barroso.
We call on the Council to announce that all discussions on lawmaking by codecision will be open to public view.
We know â as the journalist Meg Greenfield wrote â that everybody is for democracy in principle, but it is only in practice that it gives rise to stiff objections.
We note that, whatever they say in public, those two old secret plotters, Britain and France â the two countries that nurtured democracy at national level and yet with her offspring now suffer amnesia â are still resisting openness in the Council.
It is up to the other countries to pull them kicking and screaming into the 21st century.
In the short term, the Council must put its faith in Parliament and allow us greater legislative scrutiny.
Key initiatives, particularly in justice and home affairs, are often hampered by the absence of qualified majority voting and they end in stalemate.
The time has come to apply the clause of ArticleÂ 42 and shift policies from the third to the first pillar, as proposed by the Commission in its Communication of 10Â May, for our reputation â indeed our influence â rests on upholding values like democracy, liberty and respect for human rights.
Data protection in the third pillar is necessary to ensure protection of personal data.
Likewise, minimum procedural guarantees for the European Arrest Warrant â which I had the honour to pilot through this House â have been held up in the Council since 2001.
We want to see progress on all of those issues in order to make the European Union more democratic and more effective.
Europe demands no less than an unequivocal drive to democratise decision-making.
In the long term, only a constitutional treaty â as practical as it is ideological â can provide the institutional framework to democratise Europe.
But it is also time to recognise that the sixteenth and final Member State likely to ratify the Constitution in its current form is Finland.
We must recognise that France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will never ratify the 2004 text.
Denmark, Ireland and Sweden cannot ratify in current circumstances.
The Czech Republic and Poland choose not to ratify, and Portugal will find it almost impossible, while committed to a referendum.
So there are two options: renegotiation or oblivion.
The sooner we take steps to make structural and substantive improvements to that text and address public concern, the better.
President Barroso, I welcome the vision and determination you are showing today. But I want to hear you say that louder and more often to the Member States.
You are right â they are all shareholders in the enterprise, but they have been gripped by a fad for short-termism, and anyway the markets are falling.
We need to hammer home to the Member States just how much they need the European Union.
My group thanks the Austrian Presidency for its good work thus far.
We wish you success with other important items on your agenda: migration and other aspects of the Hague Programme; social and economic policy; the fundamental rights agency that we so badly need.
Make sure too that our Foreign Ministers have aid to Palestine and CIA renditions on their agenda.
The fine wines that you served them at Klosterneuburg were a good aperitif. They now need to sit down to the meat.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased, MrÂ Barroso, that you have changed your mind regarding what you said a year ago and regarding the Constitution.
I only hope that you do not change your mind again and that you can demonstrate the same determination to the Member States too.
Firstly, if the declaration must be ready in March and if the European Parliament intends to contribute to it in some way, I believe that we ought to say something different regarding the matter on which we are due to vote tomorrow, which is simply that we need to retain this text and that this Constitutional Treaty is the only thing that the European Parliament can accept.
MrÂ Leinen, this resolution does nothing to further the debate on Europe that we all want.
If we intend to achieve a result, then we must also make the content of our proposal clear.
The Member States have not succeeded in doing this but, unfortunately, neither have we.
Secondly, on the subject of sustainable development, we find a number of very interesting statements in the final declarations that we have received.
Nevertheless, we believe that there are practical things that need to be done and that are not even being proposed.
A more decisive measure is needed on climate change, on transport and on biodiversity, and the European Unionâs funds need to be used in a more environmentally friendly way.
Instead, all that we are doing is taking a step backwards, with a set of proposals on air, on waste and on many other subjects that well and truly baffle us.
We are pleased that the importance of transparency has been reaffirmed yet again, even though we believe that it is far more important to effectively monitor the application of Community law than to get tangled up in complicated and very costly impact assessment procedures.
This trend is very fashionable, but we feel that getting tangled up in complicated and not particularly transparent procedures is a danger to our democracy.
Furthermore, MrÂ Barroso, we are still encountering a whole host of problems in terms of transparency and accessing documents, with regard to which we do not feel that the Commission is doing enough.
We therefore endorse what the Council has done, even though we know that words are one thing and actions are quite something else, and we have already made various proposals and requests that have not been exhausted to date.
Thirdly, I wanted to address the issue of the external dimension.
MrÂ Winkler, on the subject of energy, we are slightly concerned by the fact that the only priority mentioned in the conclusions relates to the acquisition of resources and to the transportation of those resources within transit countries, while no reference is made whatsoever to eco-efficiency and renewable energy sources.
These elements have an external dimension, however, because the 15 international car manufacturers have an impact on oil prices that is perhaps equal to that of OPEC.
I believe that this silence from Europe is a negative element.
Furthermore, in the final conclusions you state that it is hoped that a negotiating mandate will be adopted for the Balkans.
Yet who should grant this mandate, if not the Presidency of the Council?
I believe that, on this point, over and above hoping, you ought to be more specific.
I shall conclude by addressing you, MrÂ Winkler, because when you spoke about Tunisia yesterday, we were very disappointed and surprised.
You said that a number of funds for NGOs had been released.
That is not true, and the Commission also confirms it.
The sum of EURÂ 900Â 000 for the Human Rights League has not been released, and I regard the fact that the Presidency is claiming the opposite here as extremely negative.
I urge you to check your sources and to let us know whether or not this corresponds to the truth, because this is a very serious example contributing to Europeâs lack of credibility.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, Mr Winkler, each of the main agenda items for the forthcoming European Council in its own way raises the issue of the meaning of European integration.
Such is the case with regard to the results of the famous period of reflection and to the common energy policy, and Europeâs action in the world does not escape attention either.
I shall begin by mentioning the period of reflection and its extension.
The first part of the Brussels Summitâs draft conclusion is dedicated to this and is charmingly entitled: âEurope listensâ.
That is all well and good, but what is it listening to?
The document elaborates on the measures to combat illegal immigration, which, I might add, are most unfortunately juxtaposed in the same sentence with trafficking in human beings, terrorism and organised crime. It deals with the Union's intervention mechanisms in the event of a crisis.
It stresses the need, in future, to take the European Unionâs absorption capacity more rigorously into account before embarking on the road to any further enlargement, and so forth. These are so many issues that are, I agree, present in the debate with our fellow citizens.
Strangely enough, however, the issue that is at the heart of the crisis of confidence plaguing the Union, that is to say the social issue, is, for its part, completely sidelined in the European Councilâs draft conclusion, which, in the course of one sentence, merely calls on the Commission to draft a report on the situation by next spring.
Saying that is not tantamount to sinking into crisisphilia, MrÂ Barroso.
I would point out that the Austrian Presidency itself put its finger on this issue as far back as January.
That is what we must discuss first in order to draw the necessary conclusions from it.
The publicâs trust is not given as a matter of course.
It is won.
Let us turn now to the European energy policy.
Helping to address the 21st century energy challenge is, in fact, a European responsibility .
Unbridled competition and the race for profitability are, however, unacceptable in this context.
Preparing for the post-oil period, making far greater progress in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, developing the research effort with a view to increasing energy efficiency and diversity, transforming the way in which transport is organised and affirming the right to energy for all are eminently political tasks that, if they are to succeed, cannot be restricted by the short-sighted calculations of the market.
Finally, the same debate concerns Europeâs ambitions in terms of external policy.
Who can oppose the desire to provide ourselves, as the Commission is proposing, with operational instruments and rules able to increase the consistency, effectiveness and visibility of our external action?
It is my conviction, however, that the fundamental reason for the weakness of Europeâs action in the world is neither technical nor institutional.
It is due to the tragic lack of political will and common vision at the European Council.
How else can we interpret, at this very moment, the staggering inertia of the 25 faced with the Israeli Government's irresponsible torpedoing of the initiative of the Palestinian President, in flagrant and continual breach of both the UN resolutions and the Quartetâs road map?
All of that reinforces our idea that the famous period of reflection and Plan D will only be useful if they represent an opportunity to hold a trouble-free debate in the open on the structural changes to be promoted so that Europeans might once again see a reason to be positive about Europe in the world today.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, as well as the Vice-President of the Commission, for their presentations and contributions.
I would like to deal briefly with a number of issues that I think we should be addressing in Europe, before returning to the issue of the period of reflection on the Constitution.
The Austrian Presidency has proven over the last few months that when you deal with a particular issue in a certain way you can achieve success.
When you try and bring the different players together you can achieve a result that nobody thought possible.
We have already seen this on a number of different legislative fronts, both in the cooperation with Parliament and in the work with the Commission.
I think that is what Europe needs today: a greater understanding that there is a return on the investment made in terms of time and effort.
That return is not just about esoteric ideals, but about creating real solutions to the problems that people face in their lives.
Unfortunately, too much of the debate is now determined by what media commentators are saying, rather than what the citizens of the European Union are saying, because when you speak to people and ask them what their needs are, and what kind of Europe that they want to see, they all reply that they want an internal market, greater job security, greater energy security, better personal security and safety, for their children to have a safer and cleaner environment in which to live and for Europe to play a responsible role on the world stage.
Taking all these things together, why do we in this Chamber seem to speak about a crisis of confidence in Europe, when the level of crisis, fear and loathing which some people would have you believe exists is simply not there among the general public?
There are a number of key things we can do in the coming Council meeting to try and drive things forward.
First of all, there must be a restatement of commitment and idealism in respect of the Lisbon Agenda, establishing the genuine goals and targets of having, by 2010, the most dynamic economy in the world and creating the investment, research and development that we will need to create new jobs and new opportunities.
We also need to follow through on existing dossiers, be it the services directive, the protection of public services or the right to universal service, and bring these into being.
With regard to energy, the President of the Commission has come forward with a good policy for a common energy policy in Europe, but we should also look at the alternatives, including the opportunity to use fuel crops to produce energy.
Finally, as regards the period of reflection on the Constitution, I consider it wrong to call it a constitution, and was delighted that the Foreign Ministers said in Austria that it was wrong to do so.
However, it contains some good points and I welcome the perspective outlined for us by the President of the Commission, and the Vice-President of the Commission in particular, in pushing the idea of a Plan D and taking up on those good points and moving forward.
My only words of caution are that we should not jump ahead of what the governments are willing to do, because ultimately the governments are the key representatives of their peoples and national interests.
Â Â  MrÂ President, what we should do, rather, is start afresh and set up a new, directly elected Convention to devise proposals that can then be put to referendums in all the Member States simultaneously.
In that way we would obtain the ground rules that voters want and we could call the EU a democracy and a union of democracies.
The Summitâs document on openness is a fig leaf.
Last year, the EU adopted more than 3Â 000 acts.
Fifty-seven of these were adopted through a joint decision-making process.
Complete transparency and joint decision-making were also decided on at the Seville Summit in 2002 and again at the end of Tony Blairâs Presidency.
Now it is MrÂ Blairâs own foreign minister, Margaret Beckett, who is trying to block progress at the last minute.
If the measures are adopted in any case, journalists will all be able to write the joyful story of how the Summit met peopleâs expectations by making progress towards transparency.
The majority of EU laws will, however, continue to be adopted by officials in 300 secret Council working parties after having been prepared in 3Â 000 other secret working parties under the auspices of the Commission.
Instances of openness and democracy will continue to be exceptions to the rule.
The real progress made at the Summit is in terms of its support for the Commissionâs proposal that, in future, all proposals should be dealt with in proximity to the people, that is to say in the national parliaments.
It is a constructive proposal, and the initiative now lies with the national parliaments.
I hope that they are ready to seize the opportunity.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, allow me to offer some constructive advice.
Use your many means and your sensory mechanisms to find out what the European public really wants.
The answer will presumably be security, justice, accountability and democracy.
The field of security is not doing too badly.
The field of justice â which can only be the product of the two last-mentioned fields, namely democracy and control â is sadly lacking.
I am convinced that the breakthrough can only come if you make a break with the things that have previously failed, move away from the things that have not worked: away from the Constitution and towards the Basic Treaty, with subsidiarity, transparency and control.
There is a very great lack of this.
I would ask you to understand that, to very many Europeans, the elite gathered in Brussels and Strasbourg is currently as welcome as chewing gum on the cashmere sweater of society.
This has to change.
When it does, you are in with a chance.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when he awarded the Charlemagne Prize, Jean-Claude Juncker said, among other things: âThank goodness other people are watching us who are not Europeans.
Africans, Asians, even Americans never cease to marvel at European successes.
The only ones to grumble about them are the Europeans themselves.
I cannot understand it.â
Neither can I. We should stop talking ourselves into a crisis and instead work together on the requisite projects and solutions.
The President of the Commission is right in saying that Nice is insufficient.
That is why we had Laeken, however, and Laeken produced the Convention â and so we have already drawn up a new Treaty that needs to be transposed.
He is right in saying that the two referendums with a negative outcome have plunged us into a crisis that is partly reinforced by our calling it one.
That is the reason for the period of reflection we have had for one year now.
That is why we want to salvage the political project of the Constitution.
Indeed, it has already been ratified by 16 Member States.
To the President-in-Office of the Council I would say that I most definitely expect this Summit to put an end to any talk of the death of the political project of a new Treaty, and to result instead in all parties declaring their support for the decision on this political project, concluding it in this parliamentary term and continuing the ratification process.
I expect there to be no talk of the crisis of the European Union, only talk of the political projects; I expect to see not only analysis, but also the setting of dates, the establishment of projects, the issuing of work orders, the establishment of timetables and the involvement of the public.
Let us take over the parliamentary forums and establish them in the national and regional parliaments, too.
Let us increase transparency and make Plan D more specific.
This will enable the successful implementation of the political projects and mean that the period of analysis is a thing of the past.
Â Â  Mr President, the Councilâs agenda features an important topic in the shape of the EUâs enlargement.
I should like to say a few things about Romania and Bulgaria, which will be in the limelight today because of a resolution that Parliament will be adopting later on today.
Last month, we debated here with Commissioner Rehn Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession further to the Commissionâs progress report on the preparations of those two countries.
This week, the Heads of State or Government will be addressing the same subject during their meeting.
Our group takes the view that the Commission has reached an even-handed verdict.
The Commission shares our ambition to hold firm to 1 January 2007 as the accession date for both countries, provided they apply themselves to addressing the outstanding reforms.
Like the Commission, we are convinced that this should be possible without any problems.
Our group has always been consistent in its support of Romania and Bulgaria joining on the planned date of 1 January 2007.
Those two countries must now concentrate on tying up loose ends in order to meet the accession date.
I think that both countries have the political impetus to achieve this.
They both appear to have learnt their lesson, as was also the reaction in those countries to Commissioner Rehn's report.
The reactions from Sofia and Bucharest to his report were very much to the point, to the effect that they had both made a note of what was required of them and they were going to go off and do just that.
This attitude further strengthens my optimism that Romania and Bulgaria will take their homework seriously.
Moreover, both countries have made considerable progress over the past year, which is encouraging.
As such, it is not relevant to speculate about deferring their accession.
Both candidate countries have demonstrated recently that they both have resolve in what they do, which gives my group the confidence that preparations will be completed in time.
As such, we have, at the moment, no fundamental objections to the Commission proposal not to arrive at a final verdict until next October when our final report is due.
We would welcome it if the Council were to adopt the Commissionâs attitude.
In adopting this attitude, we all have our own role to play.
The roles of Romania and Bulgaria are clear.
In the past, we have asked the Commission to make an extra effort in order to help Romania and Bulgaria in their preparations, and to be clear about what they expect of the candidate countries.
We would reiterate that request now.
The Council, too, has the responsibility to reach an even-handed verdict, but it also has the responsibility to ensure that the EU countries finish the ratification of the accession treaty on time.
As was agreed last year with the European Commission, Parliament too will remain involved in monitoring the accession process right to the end, and I am convinced that this will result in a positive outcome.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would say to the President-in-Office of the Council that, at the end of the Austrian Council Presidency, his countryâs government has another chance to rescue the Council from its helplessness, as his countryâs Presidency has produced very mixed results so far.
I very much welcome the initiative for greater transparency in the decision-making process.
As MrÂ Watson said, the Presidency really has passionate supporters of this in the shape of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
On the other hand, the irony of the story, in a way, is that 2006, in particular â the European Year of Workersâ Mobility â has seen the adoption of a Services Directive that hinders that very mobility.
As regards the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, however, the Council must understand that this Treaty has failed in its present form.
If we are really serious about the ubiquitous profession that the focus of European policy must be on the citizen, we cannot simply ignore the ânoâ in France and the Netherlands, nor can we ignore the fact that other Member States have already announced that they will not be ratifying this Constitutional Treaty.
Europe needs a constitution â that much is perfectly clear â and the substance of this Constitutional Treaty is good, but specific proposals must be made for what can be changed.
In this context, I was very pleased to read an interview with the boss of the President-in-Office, Wolfgang SchÃŒssel, in the German newspaper â for two reasons.
Firstly, he said that he supports Germany in the World Cup.
I think that is excellent â now we are sure to win.
Secondly, however, he took up the proposal to hold a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty on the same day in all the Member States of the EU.
I think that is excellent, as such a step would really bring citizens and European institutions closer together.
In addition, it would really be a historic event: a constitution that citizens had awarded themselves â that would really be an important Treaty.
The President-in-Office said, in all modesty, that there were no epoch-making decisions on the Councilâs agenda.
Yet if he succeeds in putting the idea of a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty on the same day throughout Europe in front of the other Heads of State or Government and in winning support for it among them, he will be able to say, in all modesty, that he has produced epoch-making decisions.
I wish him every success in this.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow is the day when the Heads of State or Government come together to ceremonially extend their period of inaction and helplessness.
Guy Verhofstadt called it a âdeafening silenceâ: the din of cherry picking, subsidiarity and proportionality, of âemergency brakesâ and âcore groupsâ from the sandpits of technocracy â most of these terms not even translatable from the English.
We have another year of this din in store for us.
I wish to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that an interim report on the European debate is due to be presented at the end of his countryâs Presidency in June of this year â but there is no debate.
The Presidency has promised us a roadmap for overcoming the crisis in Europe â but does not have one.
It has promised that Europe would listen â but its discussions have been held in closed circles among hand-picked elites, have been held with experts behind closed doors, and the Presidency has only heard what it wanted to hear.
The citizens are not speaking about all of this.
Having had one year to think things over, the President of the Commission comes here and gives the following answer to the question as to the causes of the Europessimism of the people: the cause is the failed referendums.
The President is mixing up cause and effect.
The failed referendums are the result rather than the cause of Europessimism.
The cause is the failure of intergovernmental Europe, of its massive democratic deficit, of its weak legitimacy, of its becoming bogged down in unanimity and nationalistic rivalry.
The Governments have been standing in the way of Europe.
They want to rule Europe as a sideline.
They are not able to come up with a social response to globalisation.
These are the causes of the pessimism among Europeans.
They are disappointed in Europe; and that is why a European democracy is needed.
I hope that this understanding plays a role in the Council, too.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the last year has been marked by numerous popular protests against the Services Directive, but also by campaigns against the dismantling of social services and the weakening of democracy.
I need only point to the campaigns in France, Greece and Germany â in Germany, the protests by university-clinic doctors that have been going on for months already are still continuing â and all of this is connected with the politics we are pursuing at national and European level.
It is time for not only governments, but also the Commission and Parliament, to realise at long last that, outside the European institutions, the EU public started long ago to develop its own conception of a different Europe, a different EU.
Nevertheless, it has become apparent from the plans for and deliberations on the forthcoming Summit that have been seen to date that the European Council wishes to give the public the impression of having understood the ânoâ to the European Constitution as a criticism of merely the style of politics, rather than of official policy and priorities.
At all events, neither PlanÂ D, a white paper on grass-roots communication, a great deal of paper, nor a number of new websites have changed the priorities of this policy.
That is, unless the listening of which Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m has just spoken results in the requisite corrections at long last.
Admittedly, if she were to understand the requisite measures of which she has just spoken in the sense of these corrections, she would have our wholehearted support.
However, the reaction that we have seen thus far this year strikes me as showing lack of understanding.
In my view, a further demonstration of this is the recent proposal by the Austrian Council Presidency to put the old text of the Constitution, without amendments, to a direct vote in the EU Member States.
That is unacceptable â corrections must be made.
Once this has been done, it is perfectly legitimate to consider holding a referendum.
We must finally put an end to the situation seen up to now, in which the various countries have merely been engaging in ratification and glorification.
In this respect, the opportunity of the 50th anniversary that has just been mentioned should actually be taken to hold a democratic debate on the EUâs plans and projects to date, and thus also to enable a new start for the European Union.
Â Â  I am sorry.
If your group gives you two minutesâ speaking time, then you stick to those two minutes.
This is not the beginning of the end of your speech, it is the end of your speech.
Could people please stick to their speaking time.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Council will once again discuss the future of the Constitutional Treaty at its forthcoming meeting in Brussels.
However, there is a saying that you should not flog a dead horse.
The Constitutional Treaty, which was rejected in referendums by the French and the Dutch, is just such a dead horse, regardless of how many Member State parliaments ratify it.
It is difficult to imagine that any French or Dutch leader would be willing to put the same document to their people again.
Moreover, in the Treaty there is a clear attempt to move towards a single European state, although in recent years Europe has witnessed trends in quite the opposite direction.
Before our very eyes, eight independent states emerged from Yugoslavia.
One of those countries is now in the European Union and the others are knocking at the European Unionâs door.
In Spain, the separatist tendencies in Catalonia are hard to overlook, while in Belgium it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain unity between Wallonia and Flanders.
It is therefore impossible to accept a text which appears to steer against these patently obvious processes.
Let us therefore stop flogging this dead horse and deal with issues that are really important to Europe and its citizens.
We need to support entrepreneurship and create new jobs, we need reforms to accelerate economic growth and increase tax revenues in order to allow greater spending on social programmes, education, public healthcare and pensions.
If the European Union is effective in resolving these problems, then Europe will also function well without the Constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Council is once again returning to the issue of the draft Constitution for Europe, in spite of the fact that the text which it is stubbornly attempting to resuscitate is dead.
Some commentators have referred to these actions as political necrophilia.
European Union citizens do not want the Constitution and their wishes should be respected.
This seems to go unnoticed by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, amongst others, who recently stated, during a meeting in Krakow, that it is vital for the European Constitution to be ratified.
However, she did not say how the Constitution would resolve the specific problems of the citizens of the Member States or what would happen to the citizens of those countries which have already rejected this Constitution in democratic referendums.
The Constitutional Treaty is a threat to democracy as it has nothing to do with the participation of citizens in deciding the fate of their countries or with the accountability of politicians to their electorate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the people of France and the Netherlands are sticking to their guns.
According to a British poll, 74% of French people and 75% of Dutch people do not believe that a single part of the European Constitution should be implemented, unless a decision is made to hold another referendum.
This is a bitter show of dissent for MrÂ Sarkozy who, disregarding the vote cast by the French population, wants to make the congress vote again just on parts I and II of the Constitution.
It is also a show of dissent for those who wanted to make the people of France and the Netherlands vote again on the Constitution, a Constitution accompanied by a social protocol designed to reassure the French and by a protocol on subsidiarity designed to reassure the Dutch.
It never rains but it pours for the Euro-federalists: according to the same poll, 63% of French people and 68% of Dutch people want to take back a number of powers from the European Union or to leave it altogether.
This is an act of revenge by the European nations on the ideological and irresponsible Eurocrats in Brussels.
It is also the return of the right of the peoples and nations to follow their own destiny and to defend their sovereignty and their identity.
Let us return to the Europe of realities and the Europe of nations, which the British and the Danes were able to retain so successfully.
They rejected the Schengen Agreement and a Europe overrun by massive influxes of immigrants granted residence and work permits on the initiative of MrÂ Zapatero and MrÂ Berlusconi.
They rejected the euro and its budgetary austerity pact, which curbs growth.
They rejected the European Super-State, which is aimed at destroying the nations of Europe.
The fact that a decision will be made during the forthcoming European Council in Brussels to extend the period of reflection by one year reveals â â if there were any need to reveal it â â the divide that exists between the nations of Europe and the self-proclaimed elites, who have not learnt a single thing and who act as though nothing had happened.
They did not grasp the fact that Europeans were feeling deceived by this passive, ultraliberal Europe, which is all about fine words and slogans and which has the weakest growth rate in the world and the highest unemployment rate.
They did not grasp the fact that the nations of Europe did not want Turkey in Europe and that the Turkish advance imposed by Brussels was creating an irreparable split.
Â Â  Mr President, this Summit is scheduled to be, in part at least, a stocktaking exercise on the European Constitution.
Yet the Constitution, however you look at it, is to a large extent discredited.
France and the Netherlands should not be asked to vote on it again, and the Dutch Prime Ministerâs remarks should be taken very seriously.
The longer this issue drags on, the more out of touch the European Union appears to be with its citizens.
We must move on from the endless debate on constitutional mechanics and get on with delivering results, because if we do not do that, citizens will conclude that their leaders have learned nothing.
Cherry-picking from the constitutional text, at this stage at least, would be unproductive.
However, we certainly need a Europe of results, as President Barroso has rightly suggested.
I personally also want to see a Europe of real reform, because without reform there can be no results.
Progress has been made in economic reform and I congratulate President Barroso and his colleagues for the work they have done there.
However, we need to do much more and be more focused, as Mrs WallstrÃ¶m said, on achieving the concrete results.
There is one other thing I briefly want to mention.
The British Foreign Secretary said that she will try to overturn decisions on opening up Council meetings to public scrutiny.
This is absolutely astonishing and worrying and is a U-turn in British Government policy.
Mr Blair constantly preached the virtues of more openness during his Presidency and we got a specific agreement that we would get openness in relation to Council meetings and Council processes.
It is absolutely essential that the other governments give the British Foreign Secretary a short, sharp shock at her first Summit and ignore her attempts to preserve secrecy in this unfair and unacceptable way.
What has she got to hide?
It is a shameful move on the part of the British Government and I hope it will be soundly defeated.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it has already been said that the forthcoming European Council will not have any dramatic decisions to take.
Nevertheless, it could give out a very important twofold signal, namely âyesâ to enlargement, but also âyesâ to strengthening the institutions of the European Union, particularly in the context of the Unionâs capacity to cope with enlargement.
It never ceases to amaze me when some of our British fellow Members say that we do not need a constitution but we do need a lot of new Members.
Equally, some Polish fellow Members â particularly on the right â are opposed to the Constitution, but believe that Ukraine must join as soon as possible.
That will not be possible.
There will not be majority support among the people, or in this House, for further enlargement unless the relevant changes are also made, including the EUâs capacity to cope with this enlargement.
We need to face this fact.
Anyone in favour, as I am, of setting further enlargement in motion will certainly be reflecting on how to make a place in the EU for Ukraine.
He or she will also have to state quite clearly, however, that the EU first needs to be given the necessary strength.
The fundamental content of this Constitution needs to be implemented, however, be it in the present or an amended Constitution.
If there is a consensus on this and the Council also says so clearly, this will send out a clear signal, the right signal.
As rapporteur for Croatia, I am also delighted that a clear signal has been sent out to Croatia. The country has long deserved its own negotiations.
I will also be very pleased when we state clearly â including in relation to Thessaloniki, and maybe in even stronger terms than we did in Salzburg â that we have an obligation to the Balkans, not only in the interests of the countries themselves, but also in our own interests.
If, however, we also state clearly and unambiguously that we first need to strengthen and reform our institutions accordingly â people will understand â then that will be an important signal; one could even say that it was an epoch-making signal that this European Council was sending out.
As regards the partnership with the USA, the Summit with this country follows the European Council, and preparations will also have to be made for this.
We have said time and again that this partnership is desirable and necessary.
Yet it must be based on common values, one of which is respect for human rights, and that is why GuantÃ¡namo and the issue of the activities of the CIA are so important to us, why it is so important to us that these issues be on the agenda.
This is not because we want to detract from the USA or from the fight against terrorism, but because we want to conduct the fight against terrorism alongside the USA â on the basis of these common values.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have an appeal to make to the EU Heads of State or Government when they meet in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday.
First and foremost, they should involve the EU in their national debates.
When reforms are debated in the Member States, not a single word is said about the EU.
The fact is that the EU really is a completely foreign concept when the welfare state is subject to review.
In, for example, Germany, France and my own country, Denmark, we are currently debating what economic reforms are needed to secure welfare in the future.
All national politicians â ministers as well as ordinary members of parliaments â should, however, be clear that a strong and effective EU is absolutely necessary and is a precondition for any welfare state.
Why, then, this deafening silence?
What is the use of the Commission and Parliament setting all these resources aside for a dialogue with the people when national politicians let the side down in such a damaging way?
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have constantly worked to bring about openness in the Council of Ministers.
Why is the United Kingdom now suddenly faltering after Tony Blair promised here in Parliament to open up the meetings of the Council of Ministers?
It is simply not good enough.
Openness about the work of the EU is an absolute necessity if we are to be closer to the people.
I would therefore call on all the Heads of State or Government to open up the meetings of the Council of Ministers so that everyone can see how they proceed, can hopefully see that there is nothing to hide and can see whether ministers have actually been present.
We should thus also avoid holding 25 different press conferences in which everyone is a hero.
I am also looking forward to the Presidency giving a favourable reception to President Borrellâs call for action to bring about a one-seat EU.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, MrÂ Barroso, I should like to go back over one part of your speech.
You said, with good reason:, that we must progress on two levels: The strengthening of the single market, on the one hand, and social solidarity, on the other.
I would add: social justice and equity.
I believe, MrÂ Barroso, that the rejection and the Europessimism are fuelled by a rather keen awareness of the fact that we are not actually progressing on two levels and that the action of your Commission, like, I might add, that of the Council, has been to prioritise the first level.
I should like to tell you or to remind you that, under your Presidency, as, moreover, under the Prodi Commission, no new social legislation has been decided on by the European institutions.
Furthermore, no new collective agreement between social partners has been decided on either.
It is this serious imbalance â I believe â that is increasingly affecting one section of the population, the one which, as a result of globalisation, has the most uncertain status.
It seems to me that the Council, Parliament and the Commission should respond to this situation.
That brings me to my second point, which concerns the instruments designed to promote social solidarity or social justice.
Mr Barroso, we will be unable to build an equitable model in the future if we do not have a fiscal policy at European level.
That is the contradiction between those who are reluctant to pursue enlargement and those who want more social justice: maintaining unanimity on all fiscal matters amounts to standing in the way of a possible European fiscal policy.
It has taken 15 years to have a directive on savings income, which is, for that matter, full of derogations, and we are not making any progress on common standards in relation to corporate tax.
To conclude, MrÂ President, the European Unionâs political project does not amount to a single market, which we need, but to a form of competition among national models.
We need a more proactive approach and more common policies at European level in order to guarantee fairness and a European social model.
Â Â  Mr President, if we did not have a European Union, there would certainly be a need for a Europe-wide cooperative that contributes to a better life for those living in the border regions, to cross-border aspects of the environment, energy supply, consumer protection and to the protection of health against internationally tradeable dangerous substances.
People want a Europe that helps remove the barriers for peace, social security, public services and international solidarity.
This is quite different from adorning a world power or increasing the freedom of international corporations.
People want a Europe that helps them solve their problems, rather than a Europe that causes inconvenience.
People no longer recognise that Europe in the Unionâs current phase.
Voters in two countries have given us a signal that things must change.
If we want to stick with the European Union that we have, it will have to be fed from the bottom up, by our citizens and their organisations.
Continuing with constructions from the top down, dreamt up by the powers that be, will not solve anything.
We will need to use enlargement and the increased involvement of our citizens creatively in order to make a new and better start possible.
Â Â  Mr President, the majority of the reforms required can be carried out without the new treaty.
One example is the agenda of the forthcoming European Council meeting, which will address the extension of the Schengen area, the issue of rendering the debates of the Council more transparent, the negotiations on European Union enlargement and the reform of external policies.
Let us not make the Treaty of Nice unpalatable to Europeans, as it is all we have today.
We not only need to reflect on the new treaty, but also on the political will of Member States and their citizens in relation to carrying out common tasks.
The problem is not the lack of a new treaty but the lack of shared beliefs concerning the future.
We announce better legislation and yet we are adopting a Services Directive that is so vague that the European Court of Justice is rubbing its hands with glee at the prospect of the ensuing cases which will give it even more power.
We announce common interests in energy matters, yet on a daily basis we are conducting an utterly selfish energy policy.
We announce investment in research, yet the European Technology Institute is withering away before our eyes, ripped apart as a result of national self-interest.
We claim to espouse the principle of subsidiarity, yet we are funding a framework research programme which will be cofinanced by all European taxpayers, even though some of the research concerned is illegal in many Member States.
These are real splits which, if we wish Europe well, are regrettable.
These are splits which place larger question marks over the state of the European project than the demise of one or other treaty.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Council must end the confusion about the status of the European Constitution once and for all.
While one Member State declares the document dead, another Member State ratifies the Constitution as if nothing was wrong.
I appeal to the Heads of State or Government to put an end to this confusion; if not, public confidence in the Union will wane even further.
I support extending the period of reflection by one year, on the condition that we go back to the drawing board for a completely new treaty document.
I would prefer a treaty document to a constitution, a manageable document that combines the previous treaties, a treaty in which the Union, within a defined space, demonstrates its added value in the area of cross-border policy challenges.
I would particularly call on the Austrian Presidency to show leadership by finally removing the confusion that has come about and to give the emergence of a new treaty framework a shot in the arm.
Austria is finally leaving its mark on this programme, something which I have waited for for six months.
Â Â  Mr President, we like to claim that the EU is a Union of values based on democracy and the rule of law.
Yet when the Danes voted against the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992, when the Irish voted against the Treaty of Nice in 2000, they were told to go away and try again.
So much for democracy!
When the French and Dutch voted against the Constitution last year, we ignored their verdict.
We are trying to revive a constitution which is dead in its own terms.
We are implementing large parts of it with no legal basis.
So much for the rule of law!
In our pigheaded determination to press on with the European project in defiance of public opinion, we show our brazen contempt for the voters and for democratic values.
The voters are starting to notice.
Amongst my East Midlands constituents I sense a growing concern and, indeed, anger against the European project.
So, press ahead with the EU Constitution if you must, but be warned: you are fuelling public resentment, which will blow the European construction apart.
Â Â  Mr President, illegal immigration has become one of the European Unionâs major challenges.
In Spain, for example, according to all the opinion polls, it is seen as the countryâs second biggest problem.
I would therefore have liked to have heard the Austrian Presidency say something more decisive, more ambitious and more concrete about the progress you expect from the next European Council in this field.
Besides the provision in the draft Constitution, we could â and in my view we should â continue to make progress on the communitisation of measures to combat illegal immigration.
I am well aware that some people will say that certain governments take decisions against the wishes of their European partners, ignoring the Commission, and then, when problems arise, they want them to be resolved amongst all of us.
I would like to say to those people, however, that, with a Community policy on immigration, there would never be mass regularisation without control, and the 'pull factor' which we are currently so afraid of would not therefore exist.
Legal immigrants must be guaranteed integration and equal rights and obligations.
By the way, we could consider transitional measures for Romanian and Bulgarian citizens who â I too am sure â will soon be Community citizens.
Moving on to other issues, the Presidency referred in passing to the document requested of Michel Barnier.
Since last summer, Parliament has done a lot of work on natural disasters; we have visited the areas affected and, as noted in a resolution approved practically unanimously, we have seen great dissatisfaction in society and too little coordination amongst the competent administrations.
Finally, I would like to say that you have not said anything about the Regulation on the Funds.
One detail remains to be resolved, Mr President, so that Parliament can vote for it during the first week of July.
Your colleagues can tell you about it, but I would ask you to make a final effort and I wish you the best of luck.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Union and the world need reliable, affordable and sustainable energy flows.
I have just quoted MrÂ Solana.
The interesting document he addressed to the European Council is distinguished by a number of deafening silences: while he does indeed speak of the need for an energy policy for Europe and for an action plan incorporating a number of priorities, MrÂ Solana carefully avoids mentioning concepts such as the âcommon energy marketâ and the âsingle marketâ.
In short, the Europe of necessary solidarity on energy is still very much in limbo.
The fact is that the energy issue is going to become a key element of all European policies.
Energy will dictate our international relations policy.
The economic, environmental and social policies of our countries will be governed by it.
Energy will have more and more of an influence on all of the Unionâs policies: from agriculture to structural policies, via housing, transport and research.
In spite of that, Europeâs response to the various energy challenges remains weak and lacklustre.
What should be done?
In order to influence its external supplies, Europe must first display its internal solidarity, its will to build a genuine common market.
MrÂ Solana tells us that the best way of guaranteeing a reliable and affordable energy supply is to have the world markets function properly.
The fact is that the world markets are dominated by cartels and oligopolies.
Where is the free and transparent market dear to the liberals?
Gazprom has just begun talks with the Algerian company Sonatrach, whose aim is certainly not to do the Union any favours.
Is it not time for the countries with high energy consumption to organise themselves, in turn?
In its resolution on the Lisbon Strategy, Parliament called on the Union to consult with the US, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Indians, with a view to preventing a form of competition that would end up ruining everyone.
Europe must invest in energy efficiency, in new technologies and in renewable energy sources.
Everyone knows that Europeâs future energy supply will be neither 100% nuclear nor 100% renewable.
We need as intelligent an energy mix as we can possibly have, bearing in mind the differences in geography and climate within the Member States, as well as their resources in terms of primary energy, biomass and so on.
The Union cannot overlook any course of action.
All forms of research must be encouraged.
Then, above all, Europe must become more united and more vigorous in defending our common interests.
Â Â  Mr President, the purpose of this debate is to provide President Borrell with something interesting to say when he speaks at the European Council tomorrow.
I fear that if Parliament simply agrees the line proposed by the PPE-DE and PSE Groups, we will be signing up to the same paralysis that exists within the Council.
President Barroso is quite correct in saying that we must make progress on policies, and a âMessina 50â is probably a positive proposal, but what is the point of extending the period of reflection without providing a target and a purpose for the reflection?
Procrastination is not a credible policy.
Waiting for the successors of Chirac, Balkenende and Blair to be thrusting federalists is a crazy fantasy.
What we require is for the European Council to establish a rendez-vous with a decision in the autumn of 2007, setting up a fresh conference to renegotiate PartÂ 3 of the Constitution.
These are not just legal problems, President-in-Office, but a profound political crisis which we must address.
I expect it is going to be possible to ring-fence the classical constitutional provisions that we find in the first and second parts of the Constitution, around which consensus still exists.
However, it is PartÂ 3 which contains the common policies that have so greatly disappointed public opinion in France and the Netherlands and in several other places, notably as regards social and economic policy and the issue of borders.
In fact, we have little choice.
We either try to improve the product and market it effectively within the court of public opinion, or we consign the whole project to oblivion.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the main mechanisms for the integration of Europe is the enlargement of the European Union.
Bulgaria and Romania are at the doors of the EU, Turkey is already negotiating its accession conditions, the new state of Montenegro has expressed its hope of becoming a member of the European Union, and other states in the Balkans may follow suit.
In this context, I should like to focus on the issue of the Copenhagen criteria and the policies related to minorities.
Many states are still following the old-fashioned French model and trying to assimilate those who have a language and culture different to that of the state.
In Romania, for instance, there is a large Hungarian-speaking minority, whose rights must be fully recognised before Romania enters the European Union as a way of recognising internal diversity.
That is to say as a way of respecting human rights, because fulfilling minority rights is absolutely essential to respecting human rights.
The European Union gives hope to minorities.
Please do not disappoint them.
Â Â  Mr President, the Councilâs draft conclusions begin with the title âEurope listensâ.
The question is whether that is true.
The EU might listen, but is it concerned about what people are actually saying?
A year ago, the referendums in the Netherlands and France sent clear messages to the EU.
The draft Constitution was rejected by large majorities.
If the EU had listened, that decision would have been respected.
Instead, what was referred to as a period of reflection was introduced, with the unexpressed but clear aim of having the same Constitution smuggled in later, notwithstanding the will of the people.
Now, debate and reflection have been announced, but a debate aimed only at having the same Constitution dusted off later is meaningless.
All the answers to emerge from such a debate are provided in advance.
Such a period of reflection is in danger of turning into manipulation rather than genuine democratic debate.
If the desire is for an open debate on the EUâs future, the democratic ground rules must be respected, and it must be made clear that the Constitution has been rejected once and for all.
Â Â  Mr President, we are to have an extended period of reflection, are we?
Some people who are having periods of reflection are otherwise known to be âin retreatâ and some retreats are made in better order than others.
Some people, MrÂ Barroso, might have learned from reflection to date, saying that perhaps it was not the case, or that they might have done things differently, or even, perish the thought, that they were wrong.
But all we have heard this morning is, âWe were right.
The people of France and Holland are wrong.
The Constitution should be brought backâ.
You have employed new architects to build on exactly the same foundations of integration, over-regulation and empirical ambition.
Fortunately, only three people in ten in Britain any longer believe any of this rubbish, so roll on our referendum, whatever the question!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to mention two topics, namely enlargement and the fight against terrorism.
As regards enlargement, I shall highlight the importance of the compatibility criterion and of absorption capacity, which I am afraid has not been strongly supported by my country in the debates within the Council.
As regards terrorism, a truly obvious question must be asked.
How is this commitment on the part of the European Union compatible with the recent appointment in Italy of the former terrorist, Mr DâElia, who is guilty of being an accessory to the murder of an Italian police officer?
The ties of solidarity linking the European left to the new Italian Government have until now prevented this obvious question from being brought to peopleâs attention and debated within the European Union.
This is disgraceful when we consider that, in Italy, the terrorism of the and groups has affected not only police officers, judges, politicians and industrialists, but also trade unionists and exponents of the best Labour culture, such as Professor Biagi.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, your Presidency can already boast of a positive track record.
We congratulate you on it.
As for the European Council that is due to take place, it is not in a position to take major decisions, but it may have a decisive influence on the future fate of the European Union.
Paving the way for a revival or endorsing a failure: that is the challenge awaiting you.
You will have to determine the strategy for future enlargements.
I call on you to stop forging ahead regardless, an approach further illustrated by the opening of detailed negotiations with Turkey, even though the latter does not fulfil the political conditions and is making no further progress with regard to integrating the .
From now on, we must regard the European Unionâs absorption capacity as a key parameter.
There can be no further enlargement without an improvement in the decision-making mechanisms, without a sufficient budget, without new resources and without a genuine agreement on the nature of the European project.
This is what it is basically about: constructing a political Europe by setting out the timetable for implementing the main reforms contained in the Constitutional Treaty, which we refuse to forget about.
The Convention obtained a result that cannot be overturned.
We must go beyond Nice.
What should the content of the European policies be?
We do not want Europe to devote the bulk of its decisions to improving the internal market, that is to say, to creating a vacuum.
We want a Europe that builds.
We want the governments and our Parliament to draft the policies that we need: on immigration, energy, economic coordination, research, security and foreign relations.
Contrary to what is claimed, Europeans want more Europe, but they want a Europe that creates forms of solidarity, that guarantees security, that makes an impact on the world and that does not just police the market.
They want a Europe, too, that respects its most sacred commitments: Strasbourg as the seat of the European Parliament.
A great deal of lucidity and courage will be required.
We trust that you will provide evidence of this at the end of June.
Â Â  Mr President, we have been saying that Europe is a citizensâ Europe, because the European Union exists through them and for them.
At the same time, we are feeling the uncertainty, and we are actually voicing our questions, because we know that decisions have become disassociated from citizens, who tend to view the results of the Community as natural; however, solidarity does not come naturally to everyone, as you would like it to be, Mr President, and I have deep sympathy for everything you have said concerning this issue.
The political effect of the enlargement is making itself felt behind the will of those who voted against, and solidarity has not become second nature to our operation, but, like you, I do have hopes for the future.
We want more solidarity and a continuously consolidating democracy, and this is why we need the Constitution.
On the other hand, we are, at times, at a loss as to why the old Member States, during the Council session, abandoned their former initiative concerning the creation of the Fundamental Rights Agency, when we, new Member States, are continuously proving ourselves in matters of democracy and respect for human rights.
Even today, the importance of democracy, openness and transparency has not been questioned by anybody.
But when it comes to human rights, why do we prefer to examine others rather than ourselves, the Member States of the European Union?
We will not be able to avoid Community control in respect of the enforcement of human rights.
A few thoughts about the social dimension of the European Union: the European Union has taken into account the challenges faced by new Member States.
We believe that defining preferences for the European Social Fund is particularly important in the course of the determination of social policy objectives.
But in order to ensure that the social Europe is truly social, it is not sufficient to emphasise the objectives of competitiveness versus those of employment; we must also emphasise social cohesion, because in the absence of social cohesion, not only nations, but the European Union itself may become divided.
At this point I would like to add that we are grateful that the Roma problem has recently been emphasised to the extent that we have seen.
Finally, when it comes to catching up, some are travelling in a high-speed elevator to the designated floor, while others have to struggle on the stairs.
Let us think of those who have started the painstaking process of climbing the stairs.
Â Â  Mr President, Poland supports the Constitutional Treaty.
Do not listen to Polish politicians.
Listen instead to public opinion in Poland.
Over 60% of Poles support the Constitutional Treaty.
If that is the case, what can we do to make sure it comes into force?
The period of reflection is for the citizens and not for the European institutions.
For them, it is time to get down to work.
The Austrian Presidency can be proud of its many achievements, three of which I would like to point out today.
First of all, there is Strasbourg.
The optimism of Mozartâs music encouraged European politicians to be optimistic about the Constitution, something that is significant.
Secondly, I think that the heeding of Parliamentâs call for Council debates to be more transparent was a very important step and I congratulate the Austrian Presidency on this achievement.
Thirdly, Mr Barnierâs report, which is one of the most interesting European documents to have been drawn up recently, will also stimulate debate.
However, what should we do at this point?
Right now, together with the Commission, we have to address two serious social problems. This is something the subsequent presidencies should also address.
First of all we need to deal with the problem of immigrants in Europe and, secondly, the problem of Europeâs social dimension.
They should become the focus of Community policy, of a common European policy. Finally, we need to ask what can be done to make the constitutional text possible?
This lies in the hands of the European Commission.
The third part of the Constitutional Treaty largely repeats treaties that have already been ratified.
The European Commission should carry out a legal analysis and only the 25 or so amendments that have already been tabled should be included in the first part of the treaty and be subject to an immediate decision.
This is a great task for the European institutions and I would like to express my faith in the Commission and the Presidency of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, there are two issues here: do we have and to what extent do we respect democracy in Europe and who is ultimately in charge.
If we truly believe in democracy and that the Constitution will bring change to the lives of the people of Europe, we should allow the people of Europe to have their say in a referendum.
We should not be afraid of the people of Europe.
Who is in charge?
Are you in charge, Mr President of the Commission?
If you really are in charge, tell me where the southeast borders of Europe are.
You do not know, because Turkey does not allow you to know.
Well done.
Let me ask you about the law of the sea.
It applies everywhere in Europe except to the Aegean. Well done.
Which country is threatening Europe?
Only Turkey in the Aegean with its .
Well done.
Which country is violating Europe?
Is it Russia?
No, it is not.
It is Turkey every day in the Aegean.
Well done.
Which country does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus?
It is Turkey.
Well done.
Which country is occupying 40% of a country of Europe?
It is Turkey. Well done.
Where is the effigy of the Ecumenical Patriarch mocked and hanged?
In Turkey and you tolerate it.
Well done.
These are the facts, Mr President of the Commission, and I propose that your next meeting with Mr Bush should be held not in the Azores, but at GuantÃ¡namo.
That is where you should hold it, so that you finally understand what is happening in this world and how you are colluding in the crimes of the Americans.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the Austrian Presidency, Chancellor SchÃŒssel promised movement on the Constitution talks.
I therefore expect a clear message from the Council meeting that the text foisted on the citizens is incomprehensible, unfair and, most importantly, dead, and that the time has come to draw up a new document.
Given that Chancellor SchÃŒssel is a politician who stands by his words, he should not accept the manipulative delaying tactics employed by Chancellor Merkel and President Chirac.
They want to leave the Constitution to mature ânaturallyâ for one more year, and then to come to a decision on it during the German and French Presidencies.
Austria is, from a historical perspective, in the best position to alter this process.
It has already travelled down the path of attempts at European integration.
Less than a hundred years ago, the Austro-Hungarian Empire united 21 European countries.
It only lasted for 51 years, however.
Why was that?
Problems were not addressed and were left to mature ânaturallyâ.
I feel that extending the period of reflection on the current Constitution shows disdain for the citizens and the campaign to resurrect it is simply throwing their money down the drain.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I address you, MrÂ Barroso, because I welcomed your speech this morning in which you revived Europeâs great project.
We have at last heard the Commission raise its voice loudly in this House in order to revive politics and to secure the Union's due role on the international stage.
This is the Commission that we want and that Europeans want too.
It is a Commission that is shaking off the burden of bureaucracy, which is mainly to blame for the people of Europeâs estrangement from the institutions.
MrÂ Barroso, I agree with you.
If we give up in the face of difficulty and if we allow ourselves to become overwhelmed by pessimism, then we will not achieve any objective whatsoever.
Politics must not fail the great challenge of building a Europe that is aware of the role it must carry out on the international stage, that is to say, a Europe that exports peace, a Europe that is capable of taking a leading role in the Mediterranean, in the Middle East, in the Balkans and in the fight against terrorism and against counterfeiting, a Europe of strong transatlantic relations.
That is why the constitutional process needs to be concluded.
The first six months of next year are crucially important.
We support the German Presidency in preparing â as the Austrian Presidency has already done and I am sure Finland will do too â a series of political initiatives for 2007 involving the 450Â million Europeans that are all too often forgotten about.
Parliament must, and I am sure that it will, play its part as leader.
The Romans used to say , nothing is difficult for those who want it.
We want a political Europe, a Europe of values, a Europe of the people, a Europe of subsidiarity, a Europe of solidarity and a Europe of freedom.
MrÂ President, we cannot allow ourselves to fail this challenge.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as well as Euro-pessimism, another spectre haunts Europe: that of autism and its associated hypocrisy and myths.
That spectre fuels the one you mentioned.
I too understand the attachment to the Constitutional Treaty on the part of those Member States that ratified it and of the majority of MEPs.
Like all those who campaigned for it to be ratified â and I was one of them in France â I remain convinced that it contains some crucial advances with regard to the functioning and the democratic life of the Union.
However, we must dispel the myth that, in time, it will be possible to present the same text, accompanied by a simple annex, in the countries in which it was rejected.
We must also do away with the hypocrisy of the Member States that have so far been unable to ratify it and that, in actual fact, are quite simply unable to secure a majority, particularly when the people have been promised a referendum.
I believe that we need instead to acknowledge this and to try to forge ahead, as you proposed just now, Mr Barroso, because European life cannot be founded on regrets.
We need a revival, advances and progress.
This revival â â and on this point too, I agree with you â â cannot be limited to the debate on the institutions.
It hinges on policies.
It hinges on the Europe of projects, on the Europe of growth and knowledge, and on the Europe of research, of energy and of cooperation in the Mediterranean.
As regards the institutions, desperately wanting to keep the Treaty as it stands may not be the best way of saving its substance.
I think that the period of reflection â â which the Council appears to be spending its time extending â is, rather, in danger of preserving the Treaty in aspic.
I believe, in fact, that this exercise will soon reach its limits and that we must instead prepare to go beyond it by proposing a new road map.
In order to go beyond it, we will need to do what your predecessor, the current Italian Prime Minister, said yesterday and draft a new and simpler text, which permits limited, but crucial, reforms.
As for these reforms, they should be clear and easily understood by Europeans and should mainly focus on improving the democratic functioning of the Union and on clarifying the responsibilities among the institutions.
Which reforms?
I will mention six of them, and I believe that we should more or less stop there.
Firstly, to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, whose legitimacy is being recognised more and more by Europeans.
Secondly, to make the Council's work more transparent when it debates legislative matters, as it is unacceptable that France and the United Kingdom should now place obstacles in the way of this transparency.
Thirdly, to ensure that the appointment of the President of the Commission is made by taking into account the votes cast by Europeans during the European elections.
Fourthly, to implement a power whereby the national parliaments can monitor compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.
Fifthly, to review the rules on qualified majority voting on the basis of what was agreed in the Treaty of 2004, in such a way that they are based on the population.
Finally, in fact, to bring in a foreign affairs minister.
The Member States have already given their backing to all of these ideas.
I am convinced that, in all of our countries, the majority of people would be willing to support these reforms.
We need initiatives.
Let us attach importance to the substance rather than to the form.
