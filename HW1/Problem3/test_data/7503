Mr President, this evening we will identify what are probably the two make-or-break issues for the next WTO round in Cancun - TRIPS and public health and agriculture.
Developing countries' perception of our good faith, good will and sincerity towards them will be tested by our attitude to these two issues.
As we know, binding agreement was reached in the form of the Doha Declaration, paragraph 6 of which highlighted the difficult issue of WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector, who could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS agreement.
The Council for TRIPS was asked to find an expeditious solution to this problem.
Commissioner, we welcome the efforts you have made and the backing you have had to get this implemented.
In an innovative and welcome suggestion you enlist the aid of the World Health Organisation.
If the intention is not honoured, the new constraints would violate the spirit of the Doha Declaration and would show bad faith.
I am sure you are right - and we have had discussions about this - to reject a moratorium on disputes or, indeed, a derogation.
Neither is an adequate solution.
The behaviour of the United States, not just on this issue but also - and far more seriously in some ways - on the issue of Iraq, is becoming increasingly difficult to understand.
Indeed, the only possible explanation is its politicians paying undue attention to the financial interests of pharmaceutical companies who paid for their election.
They have come up with only a unilateral solution and a narrow list.
This is inadequate!
Two deadlines have been missed already, and there is a real risk of deadlock if the efforts which we have channelled through you come to nothing.
Concerns which have been raised, for example on the diversion trade in generic medicines, are being tackled.
Hence the regulation by the Council of Ministers.
Let us welcome your proposal of 7 January.
It is a multilateral solution which enlists a reputable and widely trusted agency, the World Health Organisation.
As you said, the solution must be lasting, fair and legally viable.
The conflict should be examined on the basis of the guideline that public health has primacy over patents.
We cannot overestimate the importance of finding a solution to this issue.
I wish you very good luck, Commissioner.
Mr President, in this debate it is perhaps worth citing once again what the Doha Declaration actually says. I quote: 'The TRIPS agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health', and it: 'can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' rights, to protect human health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all'.
It is worth bearing in mind those words and repeating them for the record, particularly for the consumption of US observers.
I doubt they are listening right now, but perhaps we can send them a copy of the Minutes of this stimulating discussion later on.
The US position is not just contrary to the spirit of the Doha Declaration: it directly contravenes the letter of the Doha Declaration.
As such, it is a slap in the face for all developing countries which invested so much hope in the Doha Declaration and in the objectives of the Doha development round.
It represents a spectacular assertion of narrow and misguided commercial interests over the greater prize of a development round itself.
It is worth making that clear because if you then consider the commercial interests at stake, it becomes even more incomprehensible why the US is single-handedly blocking agreement in this area.
I would now like to quote a press release from the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.
It states that: 'over 95% of all medicines on the WHO drugs essential list are off-patent, and studies show that there are relatively few patents on AIDS drugs in Africa'.
In other words, that statistic alone suggests there is very little commercial risk for either the European pharmaceuticals industry, or the US industry itself.
It is all the more frustrating to watch these deadlines being missed - even applying the logic of their own commercial self-interest - as a particular sector in the US blocks progress in this field.
My group strongly supports the initiatives taken by Commissioner Lamy and the European Commission.
We sympathise with his position and ask why it is that the US pharmaceuticals industry seems to have been able to marshal US government support in backing its irrational reaction to the EU proposal.
Unilateralism with a reason is just about comprehensible.
Unilateralism without any logic whatsoever is unforgivable.
Mr President, I would also like to express my group's support for the good work of the Commissioner aimed at providing a satisfactory solution to this conflict which has arisen in Doha in relation to the United States' position.
I would like to point out several inconsistencies: as a doctor and a teacher, I am aware of the range of reports presented each year by the World Health Organisation, which always cite the famous Horowitz vicious circle, according to which illness creates poverty and poverty creates illness.
We therefore have to break this vicious circle by helping to eradicate diseases - amongst other things - because the eradication of disease increases economic capacity and that helps to put countries in a position to produce, to have their own industry, and helps to provide access to these medicines for the people who need them.
We are therefore talking about a duty in which we have a high degree of responsibility.
It is also regrettable - as other speakers have said - that the unilateral position of the United States in this regard is having a bearing on one of the most negative aspects of the process of neoliberal globalisation we are suffering, which consists of increasing inequalities and hindering and weakening the situation of the countries with fewest resources.
We therefore have to understand that it is the European Union, which is based on a desire for peace, development and solidarity, which can introduce elements to ensure a rebalance within the context of this neoliberal process of globalisation which is under way in order to provide it with the elements which - as has been said during the previous debate - arose from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre.
We therefore believe that the European Union's efforts to make the World Health Organisation an organisation with the authority to be able to indicate the necessary health situations at any particular time to be appropriate, and we therefore support Mr Lamy's position.
Mr President, I am amazed and saddened that this matter should be back up for discussion.
In November 2001, the developing countries were rejoicing in the Doha Declaration, which authorised them to have recourse to compulsory licences for public health reasons.
There is just one cloud on the horizon: countries with no production capacity must have the medicines they need manufactured in another country and a company may only manufacture a medicine if 51% of its production is intended for the national market.
This problem in paragraph 6 should have been solved before the end of 2002.
It has still not been solved.
In the meantime, the American pharmaceutical laboratories, who are the main financial backers for the Bush campaign, have returned to the attack.
The proposals made by the United States or the European Union, which are each more restrictive than the last, have resulted in failure.
Today, the Trips Council is proposing to return to the previous wording allowing recourse to compulsory licences in urgent cases, a solution that proved inapplicable and led to the Doha Declaration.
The objective of paragraph 6 must be to ensure that countries with no production capacity can genuinely use compulsory licences.
On the contrary, however, some proposals create discrimination between first-class countries with a production capacity and second-class countries with no production capacity, which are, in fact, the poorest countries.
The former will be able to use compulsory licences to manufacture any medicine that responds to a public health problem that they themselves have identified, whereas the latter will have to prove that they are experiencing a national situation of urgency.
Although, in theory, all countries may have recourse to compulsory licences, in practice, the poorest countries will have to fight to have urgent situations recognised, obtain their licence and have their medicines manufactured.
This proposal is unacceptable and I would ask you, Mr Lamy, to propose a solution that is genuinely beneficial to developing countries so that health takes precedence over profit, as you yourself said so well.
Mr President, the crux of this issue is very simple.
It is that there are 42 million people in the world today suffering from the AIDS virus, yet we have the technology and the treatments available to combat diseases such this.
However, people in the developing countries cannot afford to pay the exorbitant prices for the medicines needed to treat sufferers of AIDS and other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.
If we are to provide these medicines to those who need them, we have to override the intellectual property rights of companies who have patented the technology to combat these diseases.
We can achieve this by reaching an agreement between all contracting parties at the level of the World Trade Organisation.
The crux of the discussions is the relationship between intellectual property rights and public health issues.
If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms, then the cost of these medicines will be substantially reduced.
We all recall the much publicised court case brought by 40 pharmaceutical companies against the South African Government on this issue.
We have a moral obligation to support the effort of finding the way to provide urgently needed medicines to people in developing countries.
This is a matter for the World Trade Organisation, but progress, I regret, is far too slow.
Last November, the European Union presented a compromise proposal to the WTO ministerial meeting in Australia to find a solution to this important matter.
However, it now appears that the US Government is just not satisfied with the terms of this compromise.
The US Government believes that too many diseases are included in the European Union's proposal.
Too many diseases are included they say, when in the meantime people are dying from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
Over three million people will die from AIDS this year alone.
The technology is there to provide suitable treatment to sufferers of this disease.
Intellectual property rights will have to be put to one side so that we can alleviate the suffering of millions of people who will die needlessly, if we do not find an urgent solution to this issue.
On a separate but related matter, I have called on the members of the international community many times to increase their budgets to combat the AIDS epidemic.
In fact, debt relief programmes must be put in place for developing countries with high levels of AIDS sufferers.
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate calls to mind concepts of peace and solidarity upon which the European Union was founded. The principle of solidarity applies not just within the Union but also to the people of less developed countries.
The European Union upheld this concept when, in the face of United States obstruction, it took the initiative and authorised the importation and use of generic and low-cost medicines for underprivileged communities. As a rapporteur to Parliament on directives relating to medicines, I have worked on directives concerning the authorisation of the marketing of medicines within the European Union.
I am therefore well aware of the issues involved. I understand that it is important to strike a satisfactory balance between research and generic medicines, between data protection and the price of the medicine and between innovation and authorised copying.
I do not however wish to revisit these issues today, nor do I wish to delve into the issue raised by a number of countries, namely whether the right to health should take precedence over the right to patent.
In certain circumstances, this issue can be resolved quite easily. Do we have the right to let people waste away?
Do we have the right to allow people to die when they could be treated?
This would amount to failing to help a person in danger.
In accordance with the principle of equal access to medicines and therefore to health, I would urge the European Union to use all its influence to support these authorisations. At the same time, the Union should however ensure that a specific framework is created and that the process is completely transparent.
I believe it would be helpful for the World Health Organisation to act as arbiter in this, and would like to adduce three reasons for this.
Firstly, effective measures should be implemented to prevent the parallel importation into the European Union of generic medicines destined for developing countries.
If such controls are not introduced, the people we wish to help will not receive the medicines destined for them.
Furthermore, such parallel imports would undermine the quality health system we wish to develop within the European Union.
The relevant authority should draw up a permanent register of generic medicines destined for developing countries to ensure the effectiveness of such controls.
I hope this list will evolve over time as new diseases appear, in order to increase the efficiency of product distribution and quality control frameworks.
As for the quality of these medicines, we know that they are not third-rate products.
On the contrary, we know that they are just as effective as other medicines. Making such products available, however, could only be one aspect of curing disease and fighting the epidemics we are trying to curb.
Lastly, Commissioner, the provision of local infrastructures, control laboratories and training for professionals is in fact just as important as making these products available.
For all these reasons, I think the WHO should take on the essential role of guarantor for the process of making medicines available to all.
Mr President, in the multilateral spirit of world solidarity and the global coalition against international terrorism immediately post 11 September, we in Europe, under the inspiring leadership of Commissioner Pascal Lamy, have gone all out to build bridges, to win the USA over and to make Doha a successful development round.
Ultimately the deciding factor turned out to be developing countries' access to cheap medicines without paying for patents, either by their own production or by importing them.
Ultimately the political breakthrough came.
All developing countries can now establish when they are having a serious health crisis or problem and nothing is preventing them, not even the TRIPs agreement, from buying or producing cheap medicines.
That applies to all developing countries and all medicines.
There are no restrictions, and no external prior approval is needed.
The assignment was to round this off in a legally conclusive text.
This should have been done in December 2002, but it failed because the USA, in my opinion, was no longer adopting a multilateral position.
I believe President Bush trampled all over the Doha agreement in favour of his own pharmaceutical industry.
Commissioner Lamy, you have always told us that you are negotiating on behalf of the whole of Europe and that you accept the European Parliament as possessing powers of democratic control and codecision.
Well, this is an important point for the Group of the Party of European Socialists - and, when I listen to my fellow-Members, for many other groups too.
We should like to say that you enjoy our full support, but we do not wish to bow under pressure from the USA any further.
So: this far and no further.
We want no restrictions on countries, no restrictions on the types of medicines, nor any prior approval by an external authority.
That is naturally a little different from the advice from the WHO.
We do support stringent measures to protect our own European market against dumping, however.
With more than 90% of AIDS patients in developing countries, we want Europe to unambiguously decide which side it is on and to strictly limit itself to a solution in line with the political Doha agreement.
We urge other groups in this Parliament to vote accordingly.
The interests of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria patients worldwide must be at centre stage. Not commerce.
Necessity knows no law.
The TRIPS agreements must not be a limiting factor.
As the PSE Group we are convinced that if this point fails, Doha will be keelhauled and Cancun will have failed before it even starts.
Then there will be no development round!
And that is the last thing that the world will permit in the current, very serious crisis.
That is why we are taking this clear stance.
Having heard my fellow-Members Mr Wijkman, Mr Clegg and Mrs McNally and many others, I think that Parliament is on the point of making a clear judgment and giving Commissioner Lamy, who, as he has understood, enjoys our full support, a powerful mandate.
The arrangements made in Doha are crucial for allowing people in developing countries better access to medicines, particularly those for diseases associated with poverty.
My group is of the opinion that Commissioner Lamy has taken some excellent initiatives with a view to making healthcare more easily accessible, including in the poorest countries and specifically in those countries that do not have their own production capacity.
I would, however, like to put forward one criticism, although I agree with all the things that have been said here.
Access to medicines is not only a question of money.
There are two other issues that I would like to raise.
Firstly the infrastructure in the countries concerned, and in this case I am talking about distribution and about which people in those countries get access to these medicines.
Distribution means that there must be an infrastructure, something that is completely absent in many poor countries.
What is even worse: this is not a priority for the regimes in the countries concerned.
For example, a person taking AIDS medicines has to take them up to three times a day every day.
This means that they have to stick rigidly to their treatment regime and that distribution channels are therefore needed to ensure that the patients concerned can always obtain their medicines.
If this does not happen, the remedy will be worse than the disease, because people will become resistant to these diseases and that will ultimately work its way through to Western countries as well.
Then new medicines will have to be developed.
That is my first point.
My second point is that regimes are often, in fact, corrupt.
In such cases it turns out that the only medicines that are made available are the ones we have exported to these countries at low tariffs or the ones that can be produced there without patents, and even then they are only available to the better-off and not to the poorest population groups for whom we had intended them.
What is more, they are sometimes re-exported or simply exported to Western countries.
Commissioner, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is painting a very negative picture of developing countries.
Fortunately, things are progressing at this moment, although diseases are progressing even faster.
It is precisely this race, against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, that we must try to win.
Attempts are actually being made to set up basic healthcare systems in many countries, in which, in fact no such things once existed, and the European Union must not be found wanting in this.
It is the case that there was a time when treating people who became sick despite prevention - which, let us be honest, is not perfect even today - was an unachievable ideal.
For the first time, however, there is hope that people - even those who are HIV positive - can in fact improve their lives and the quality of their lives if they have access to medicines.
It is therefore of the utmost importance that you succeed in your assignment, Commissioner.
All of us here in the European Parliament support you in your endeavour to ensure that disease can be overcome, even in countries which do not have the resources to do so themselves.
The failure of Doha does, however, make us pessimistic.
I hope that you will be able to tell us that we can revert to our own proposals, but I am also prepared to give your compromise a chance because I think that it is reasonable, although I find it too paternalistic. I think, though, that it is a minimum and I hope you are at least successful in that.
Mr President, I will not bash America because the whole set of international trading regulations on medicines is in a mess.
Unfortunately, once drug companies - even with the best intention to alleviate suffering - allowed their products and intellectual property rights to be semi-confiscated under the guise of becoming available on affordable terms in developing countries, it was inevitable that all sorts of complications would arise.
These include definitions of what constitutes a measure to protect public health and is, therefore, subject to the compulsory licensing requirements allowed under TRIPS.
Initially, the communicable diseases of HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB were included, but now there are plans to extend this list if the WHO thinks it appropriate.
As these countries become more developed, more western diseases will become endemic, and a case will be made to extend the categories even further.
Also, as more migrants come to Europe, diseases such as the three above will become more common.
This will create markets for these drugs and lead to enormous market-driven pressures for parallel re-importation by unscrupulous middlemen from LDCs, which produce them cheaply as generics.
This will undercut the profits of legitimate pharmaceutical industries.
It also appears that the exemptions discriminate against smaller countries which lack the manufacturing base to produce the required life-saving drugs under compulsory licences.
How much simpler it would have been if we had been more robust in defending the rights of drug companies to maintain their patent rights all over the world and then negotiated some differences in pricing, according to what the markets could actually bear and, at the same time, insisted that the burden of the drugs bill be picked up by and large by aid packages rather than by raiding the shareholder capital of the major pharmaceuticals.
If there are to be reduced profits for the pharmaceuticals, my country, the UK, will suffer disproportionately, as it is a major employer and export-earner, and many of our pension funds are heavily invested in this sector.
After all, many developing countries - even if the drugs were free - do not have the infrastructures to administer the treatments.
Besides, profits are essential to fund further innovative research and development in the future, even into orphan drugs for rare tropical illnesses, which are of little interest in the West at present.
At the very least, I call for a three-yearly review in future to see how this TRIPS agreement works out in practice.
Mr President, the tragedy, as the Commissioner indicated, is that we still have a deadlock over changes that might deliver the real objectives we identified in Doha, which would allow countries - as others have said - to have the manufacturing capacity to export cheaper generic medicines to countries in need.
The reality is that developing countries will not accept the United States' insistence on restricting exports to those who treat only a handful of infectious diseases.
I fear also that, even if the United States concedes, the reforms will be wrapped up in red tape and have some TRIPS-plus features.
We should now consider a fresh start that is likely to produce a workable solution, although I accept, regrettably, that this is unlikely.
The danger is that this whole issue could drag on until Cancun.
If this were to happen, then the TRIPS issues could then again be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations on agriculture, services and the new issues.
Is that something you see as likely, Commissioner?
Surely it would be disastrous if developing countries were expected to do trade-offs in the only real area where they secured such a major victory at Doha.
The spirit and reality of the development round is surely called into question if developing countries have the clear perception - and they do now, as Mrs McNally said - that commercial interest is being put before public health.
That was not the intention at Doha.
You understand, Commissioner, as others have said, that these are issues of justice and equity and that the concept of the development round would become a sham if the industrialised world is seen as, or perceived to be, reneging on the position that was so satisfactorily agreed at Doha.
Mr President, when the United States recently faced the threat of an anthrax attack, the authorities needed adequate and cheap supplies of medicine to treat the illness. They therefore took it upon themselves to oblige the pharmaceutical laboratory concerned to provide the medicines more cheaply.
Had the laboratory refused to do this, the United States authorities would have resorted to a compulsory licence. I would remind you that, at that time, no one required the United States to consult the World Health Organisation first to check if anthrax was on the list of diseases deemed to be admissible in this case.
The United States was not required to negotiate the conditions for the potential production of such a generic medicine. Why then are certain developing countries now being required to do so?
I will now move on to my second point.
I believe Mr Clegg was right to cite the Doha declaration.
I think my fellow Members were right to remind us that an undertaking was implemented and that this undertaking should be respected. According to the undertaking nothing in the interpretation of the agreements on intellectual property should prevent developing countries and WTO member countries from tackling their public health needs, whether or not they have the capacity to produce medicines.
These countries should therefore be allowed to make their own decisions on this.
Those with the capacity to produce medicines should be able to decide the circumstances in which they might need to resort to compulsory licences.
Those without the capacity to produce medicines should be able to decide the circumstances in which they might need to resort to parallel imports.
These imports would be legal, as they would be sanctioned by the state. Mr Rod and Mr Wijkman are therefore right, as are others like Mr Van den Berg, when they say that we would be imposing on the poorest countries conditions which do not apply to industrialised countries or to developing countries with the capacity to produce medicines.
I think we are now faced with the difficult task of finding a simple and effective solution to the problem.
Any solution must not entail long and costly negotiations and procedures. The latter would eventually cost the lives of millions of sick people who would die without access to treatment.
We heard that our fellow Member, Mr Tannock, is more concerned about the possible fall in the profits of certain industries than the fate of the sick. Mr Lamy, you are clearly under pressure from certain quarters, including the European industries.
I urge you not to give way to these pressures!
Please speak for the people of Europe. The people want us to help the sick in developing countries.
Mr President, I welcome the European Union initiative in January to break the current WTO deadlock on developing countries' access to affordable medicines, particularly those countries which do not have the manufacturing capacity to make generic medicines locally.
Just last month, Commissioner Lamy proposed a pragmatic solution which, in his view, is workable, sustainable and legally secure, because it complies with both the Doha mandate and the compromise text of 16 December 2002 that was discussed within the WTO.
The EU initiative covers the most comprehensive possible list of major infectious diseases but is not restrictive, which was the main problem with the negotiations in 2002.
Commissioner Lamy's list includes: yellow fever, plague, cholera, meningitis, dengue, influenza, hepatitis, polio, typhoid fever, typhus and measles.
These are all horrendous diseases that have been virtually eradicated in the West, yet millions die unnecessarily in the Third World every year.
The Lamy strategy would save lives, and pharmaceutical companies will not be losing revenue because the people in these countries are too poor to buy the medication as it stands.
The debilitating effect of these diseases affects families, communities and economies throughout the developing world.
This EU initiative should help to improve the standard of living and public health in some, if not all, of the developing world.
However, it is essential that a mechanism is constructed to deal with the other public health issues and potential outbreaks, and not just the diseases listed in the compromise deal.
The list proposed by Commissioner Lamy is not restrictive - WTO members could ask for World Health Organisation guidance for any other serious public health problems which may arise in the future or are not covered by the list as it stands.
This gives the EU proposal some flexibility to respond to unforeseen outbreaks.
The response will be based on World Health Organisation expertise in the field.
The compromise proposal, which is more humane that the US approach, should allay US concerns that patent laws could be breached and weakened.
At the same time, it provides sufficient flexibility to deal with specific disease-related crises, should they occur.
This debate will hopefully send a strong message of support for the Lamy proposal, as the WTO General Council simultaneously discusses the subject.
It is important to help the developing world to eradicate these diseases without depriving the pharmaceutical industry of the funding it needs for further research in this area.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say how pleased I am that we are holding this debate on the World Trade Organisation and on certain ongoing negotiations. This comes on the eve of another ministerial meeting at which specific political positions on the matter might be sealed.
I am however concerned about the declaration of the Council for TRIPS. It means going back on the undertakings we gave at Doha.
Access to generic medicines for developing countries is not just a commercial issue. It is at the heart of development the world over.
If we do not make progress on this question, all our other efforts to promote development will be in vain. We would be wasting our time.
Achieved in difficult circumstances, the Doha declaration on public health of November 2001 was an important first step towards helping the populations of developing countries and promoting their interests.
We looked forward to at last sending a message of hope to those people.
In December 2002 however, opposition to the agreement, for which the United States was entirely responsible, clearly demonstrated that the interests of the pharmaceutical industry took precedence over the health of millions of people.
This stance is not merely unfortunate. It is unacceptable and inadmissible, given that as my fellow Member Mr DÃ©sir outlined, the United States was prepared to suspend the Bayer patent in October 2001, because they were experiencing an anthrax attack, which was obviously a matter of greater urgency for them.
We should welcome the efforts of the Commission to reach an agreement on access to medicines.
Nonetheless, the Commission is still failing to take enough account of the legitimate demands of poor countries. This comes as we are about to retain the division of countries into a first and a second class, as if the deaths in some regions were less important than deaths in others.
Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement must recommence at the earliest opportunity. The lives of millions of people in developing countries are at stake.
I am convinced agreement could be obtained on the basis of the Doha declaration and Article 30 of the ADPIC agreement, and on that basis alone.
An agreement achieved on any other basis, that did not take account of Article 30, would extinguish the hopes of the people of developing countries. They want to lift themselves out of poverty and improve their worsening living conditions, conditions that are increasingly unacceptable.
Such an agreement would also send a clear message to the people of Europe. It could be a fine example of the basis on which the European Union works and of the extent of our concern for others.
Commissioner, we call on you to speak for our collective conscience.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have to start by clarifying whether patent laws are actually in place.
The copyright must be valid in the country in which it is sold; that is to say, it must have been registered and granted there.
Of course, things can always be manufactured in a country where there is no copyright on them, and there must be doubt as to whether, although they clearly bring benefits, the medicinal products have actually been patented in every country around the world; I really cannot imagine that they have been, but should that indeed be the case, it follows that compulsory licensing is the ideal approach when it comes to giving help quickly and in a consistent way.
We must ask ourselves, though, what happens if a compulsory licence is actually granted.
Will it solve all our problems?
What about prevention and complete recovery?
I think it self-evident that medicinal products need to be developed further, and that we have to focus primarily on creating incentives for research, rather than simply allowing ourselves to reduce the issue to patent rights and licences.
When, moreover, the copyright has expired and compulsory licences have been granted, we politicians, too, will bear responsibility for universities and industry having incentives to carry out research.
Another important step in the right direction would be to put out public invitations to tender several times in a given year, to safeguard the fundamental principle that sufferers from disease really should get the most modern and the most effective medication available.
For if, in future, research in this area of medicinal products, and the marketing of them, ceases to be a viable business proposition, we will be faced with the problem of being able to offer medicinal products that may well be cheap, but are not as effective as they might be.
What do we do then?
Mr President, this is a difficult issue on which feelings can run high. I would first like to thank the representatives of all the groups who have expressed their support for the position I have adopted on behalf of the Commission.
I have noted the statements made by Mr Wijkman, Mrs McNally, Mr Clegg, Mr Marset Campos and Mrs Maes in particular.
The European Parliament is firmly united on this issue. This is very important for us at the Commission, it is important to me and it is important in the field of external relations.
I would point out that the issue of the use of compulsory licences by countries with a pharmaceutical industry to obtain benefit from differentiated prices and lower prices was settled at Doha.
On that occasion we did not however settle the issue of countries which have to resort to imports. This implies that the system of compulsory licensing could be applied across international boundaries, giving rise to complicated legal problems.
This problem is currently dealt with on a provisional basis.
All developing countries can at present use a compulsory licensing system to obtain benefit from differentiated prices. This applies to medicines to treat diseases like AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and certain other diseases.
This is possible because of the provisional arrangement that the United States and the European Union implemented in December.
This provisional arrangement is simply not enough however.
We think it is unlikely to galvanise all the parties involved. These parties are the governments concerned, their health systems and the pharmaceutical industry.
A long-term solution must therefore be found.
None has so far emerged from the discussions taking place in Geneva, because of the American position.
Further evidence of this was provided at the Council on TRIPS this morning.
I would like to reassure Mrs Kinnock on one point. The issue of access to medicines is not on the Doha negotiating programme due to be concluded at the end of 2004.
It does not feature amongst the fifteen subjects we decided to discuss. The issue falls beyond the scope of these negotiations and will therefore not be the subject of any kind of trade-off.
It stands alone as a subject in its own right and on the table of the World Trade Organisation.
This issue is not linked to the rest of the negotiations by virtue of the agenda but because it testifies to the capacity of the World Trade Organisation to instil confidence in its members. Consequently, when it comes to discussing the question of whether the compulsory licensing system should be used for Viagra or for medicines to treat toothache for example, members have the confidence to prevent the discussions degenerating into a legal battle.
I am simply referring to this particular example because I have read about it in the press. This all amounts to a major problem for the World Trade Organisation.
I wonder why the pharmaceutical industry has adopted the position it has. The latter resulted in the United States rejecting the compromise on the table in December.
I have to say that I am completely baffled.
I did not understand the position that the American pharmaceutical industry took in South Africa either, and I also failed to understand the position it adopted when it very nearly caused a stand-off between the United States and Brazil, until the United States Government saw the light. I just cannot understand its attitude.
Its stance will only strengthen opposition to the principle of intellectual property across a large number of sectors. In truth, it is easy to present this conflict between health and profits in such a way that, little by little, if the American pharmaceutical industry continues as it has been doing, there will be sound political reasons for starting work on agreements on intellectual property.
This time the determination will be there.
I would urge those of you who have some influence in this field to use this argument to try to convince these people that their attitude will not get them where they want to be, but will lead them in the opposite direction. The United States would do well to consider an example of how to reach a consensus when circumstances make this imperative.
They could study the attitude adopted by the European Union recently towards the Kimberly process on the subject of blood diamonds. This may be a less high profile case, but it is nonetheless important, especially for certain developing countries.
We Europeans were isolated in the World Trade Organisation. We were the only party reluctant to ask the WTO for a dispensation to implement the Kimberly agreements.
We stood alone and eventually decided to go along with the consensus because we did not want to stand in the way of this solution.
We shall do so by coming up with our own interpretation of the articles of the WTO.
The United States could perfectly well adopt the same approach on this issue.
On the question of parallel imports raised by several Members, I am sure you will be aware that the Commission has put forward a proposal for the European Union.
The Council is currently studying the proposal. Those of you with an interest in the matter could join me in urging the Council to take less time than usual to rule on the proposal.
I would now like to move on to my last point.
I agree with those Members who explained that while the problem of price and the problem of taking account of patent law in connection with prices are important, these are not the only problems to be solved. There are many other issues to address if we are to ensure better access to medicines for people in developing countries.
The quality of the health systems must be improved.
There needs to be a system of public research into diseases that no longer exist in developed countries and are therefore no longer of interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Problems of distribution and medical culture must be resolved.
There will still be much to be done, even after the difficulties relating to patent law have been overcome, which I trust will be soon. This is not however a reason for giving up on our determined efforts to ensure that this first, important and highly symbolic step is taken with the help of the European Union.
The Commission will certainly persevere, spurred on by the statements made during this debate.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2) I have received six motions for resolution to wind up the debate
The next item is the Commission statement on the WTO agricultural trade negotiations.
Mr President, as Mrs McNally said during the previous debate, agriculture was one of the make or break issues at the Doha negotiations mentioned recently in another context.
Mr Fischler and I will both attend the informal WTO mini-ministerial meeting in Tokyo at the weekend, and agriculture is one of the issues on the agenda.
We are pleased the Council of Ministers recently approved the Union's negotiating position. It was unfortunate, however, that approval was only possible after heated debate and several delays.
Nonetheless, the fact that Council has approved this position will strengthen our own hand considerably at the forthcoming discussions.
Let me now say a few words on the main features of the modalities of agriculture negotiations, as they are known in negotiating jargon. These modalities will figure prominently between now and the end of March.
Firstly, I should like to shed some light on the meaning of the term modalities.
It might seem a fairly uncontroversial term, but it is in fact a key element of negotiations, because what is referred to as an agreement on modalities is actually an agreement on rules and figures.
To give you an example, these rules may relate to subsidies. They can lay down which subsidies are permitted and which are not.
Such rules may also relate to import procedures. As for the figures, they are intended mainly to achieve a reduction in tariffs and a reduction in subsidies.
This is what is at issue in the current phase to be concluded by 31 March.
Of course, there is more to agriculture negotiations than this. Nonetheless, it is a very important element of such negotiations.
Consequently, Mr Franz Fischler and I have always made it our business to ensure the Union pulls its weight in negotiations on agriculture. The proposals we have put on the table bear witness to this.
They demonstrate that the European Union is in a position to negotiate on agriculture further to the reform of its common agricultural policy. At the same time, however, the Union is determined to negotiate so as to ensure that development becomes the driving force behind bilateral negotiations.
The proposals we placed on the table testify to our commitment, our mandate and our ambition.
At Doha, we committed ourselves to negotiating on the whole agriculture chapter. This includes opening up of markets, the reduction of export subsidies and domestic support, mainstreaming non-trade concerns and making a strong commitment to development.
Our mandate does not permit us to pre-empt aspects of the reform of the common agricultural policy on which no decision has yet been reached. We are bound to operate strictly within the framework of previous reforms and particularly the most recent of these, under Agenda 2000.
It is worth emphasising lastly that we wish to be fully involved in these negotiations, particularly where the interests of the most vulnerable countries are at stake. We hope to play a leading role in the negotiations.
Contrary to statements made from both ends of the spectrum, ours is actually a middle-of-the-road position.
It is in stark contrast to the positions of extremists of both sorts. We trust our position will enable us to facilitate agreement on all aspects of the agricultural negotiations.
I would now like to share with you some of the details of the content of the proposals.
Firstly, with regard to access to the markets, we are proposing a 36% overall reduction in customs duties, with a 15% minimum reduction per line. This reduction is based on the method applied during the previous round.
It has been tried and tested. In our view, it is the only viable method given the time constraints we are up against.
Our formula differs radically from the so-called 'Swiss' formula put forward by several other countries in that it allows wider margins for developing countries.
Clearly, this is vital to the negotiations in question.
It is worth mentioning that the adjective 'Swiss' is somewhat misleading, as Switzerland itself denies any responsibility for the formula attributed to it. We have proposed detailed and ambitious provisions for developing countries.
These include zero rating for a minimum 50% of exports of agricultural products from developing to developed countries. Another proposal is for duty and quota-free access for all products originating from less developed countries and destined to industrialised and emerging countries.
This amounts to extending the scope of our 'everything but arms' initiative. The issue of phased tariffs for products of particular interest to developing countries will be raised for the first time.
Our approach to export subsidies is in the same vein.
As a first step, we propose a 45% average reduction of the budget envelopes for export refunds. Further, we are prepared to progressively do away with all export refunds for certain products.
Allow me to emphasise that point again. We propose gradually to eliminate export refunds for products of particular interest to developing countries.
It must be made quite clear that obviously, this twin proposal can only be implemented if the other parties involved also restrict comparable export subsidies.
I am referring to certain types of export credits and to what could in some cases be termed the abuse of food aid. I also have in mind the activities of state enterprises based in countries that actually enjoy a more liberal reputation, activities amounting at times to unfair practice.
The Commission's stance on this issue is unequivocal. We are not prepared to be the only member of the WTO to make concessions on agriculture issues.
The effort we are prepared to make must be matched by all other parties supporting exports. We trust also that all industrialised countries will play their part in opening up markets.
In addition, we are proposing to retain the current arrangements for internal support, as far as the yellow, blue and green box system is concerned.
It does not make sense to tamper with a system that has proved sensible and is capable of responding to needs as they arise.
On the other hand, we are proposing a 55% reduction of the internal support causing the most distortion in international trade, namely what is in the orange or yellow boxes.
Further, we wish to introduce some new provisions. There are a number of loopholes in the current system of ceilings for the boxes, and these are being exploited to the point of abuse by several countries.
I have in mind in particular variable aid of the deficiency payments type and our request to delete the de minimis clause for developed countries. In our view, its scope has been too broad.
Another of our proposals involves integrating the expectations of developing countries, especially the most vulnerable, hence our proposals on market access.
Another significant proposal, for which we are indebted to various non-governmental organisations is the notion of a so-called food security box. This would involve putting in place a special safety net mechanism for the most sensitive products in specific developing countries.
Lastly, I should like to comment on other issues to be negotiated, over and above those strictly related to trade.
We aim to request clarification or updating of rules in areas such as environmental protection, rural development, animal welfare, consumer information, the precautionary principle and the protection of designations of origin.
As you will appreciate therefore, these broader issues are high on the European agenda.
In conclusion I would like to say, Mr President, that these proposals aim to allay the concerns of three main interested parties.
As regards our trading partners, notably the developing countries, on this occasion we are proposing a quite different and special treatment of the latter.
We hope the European agricultural sector will be reassured that we shall continue to fight for support to allow them to continue to provide the services it renders to society. We shall also strive to protect our quality products by defending our designations of origin.
We have the interests of consumers in Europe and elsewhere very much at heart, and trust that the WTO will not raise too many objections to the implementation of rules on health and information.
To summarise, our proposals on agriculture do reflect most of the concerns informing our approach throughout this round of negotiations. These are development and opening up the markets to benefit mainly the developing countries, all to be governed by rules designed for the benefit of our society and the international community as a whole.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Communication that the European Commission has just presented to Parliament on the modalities of the agricultural agreement to be negotiated at the forthcoming WTO Round was unanimously approved on 27 January by the General Affairs Council.
I believe this proposal to be balanced and to be in line with the spirit of Article 20 of the Marrakech Agreement and of the Doha Declaration and makes a genuine and generous contribution to those who until now have gained little from almost 50 years of multilateralism in trade - in other words, the world's poorest countries.
Evidence of this is the proposal for free access to the markets of the richest countries for the agricultural products of the poorer countries.
Also, the compromise proposal intended to ensure that at least 50% of rich countries' agricultural and food imports come from the poorest countries.
This proposal is coherent with current practice in the European Union which, as the Commission states in one of its recent documents, imports more food products than the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand put together.
This is what gives us the moral authority to say that this WTO Round must be the development round.
This is also why we have proposed a food security fund that will enable the poorest countries to implement measures to protect their markets from the subsidised exports of the rich countries, thereby enabling them to develop local production and to fight hunger and poverty.
We must also be aware, however, of one important aspect, which is that an excessive reduction of customs tariffs could undermine preferential access to the EU market, which is already benefiting some countries with which we have trade agreements. Amongst these are the ACP countries, under the Cotonou agreements, and the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean.
We will have to be careful about this because if we establish excessive tariff reductions and do not ensure that our market preferences in favour of these countries are consolidated, these same poor countries could lose market share to other, richer and more competitive countries.
It is also because of this attitude of openness and support towards the poorest countries that gives us, the European Union, the moral authority, to say that we also have the right to protect our farmers and to preserve our social model.
The European negotiators can therefore only accept a final agreement at the WTO that firstly preserves the European farming model based on farming's contribution to rural land-use planning, to the territory's balance and to the vitality of rural areas, which represent almost 80% of our territory.
What this means, specifically, is that the EU will be able to continue to support its farmers and to guarantee a reasonable - and only a reasonable - level of Community preference for farm produce.
Secondly, we must ensure the right balance between greater trade liberalisation and greater requirements in areas that are not strictly trade related, but are definitely related to the trade in food, such as, in particular, the quality and safety of food, compliance with basic environmental standards and adherence to the trademarks and denominations of origin and geographical indications of our products which, as we all know, are widely counterfeited by a huge variety of countries across the world, with the WTO rules unable to prevent this happening.
Unless this is done, we shall be doing something that our society does not understand and we shall be attacking our own interests and, even worse, we shall not be supporting the interests of the poorest countries.
I think that the European Union has provided a good example of good, reasonable proposals for these countries that have until now been the most marginal players, the most marginal beneficiaries of the WTO - the poor countries.
We have come up with good and positive initiatives under 'everything but arms', and our proposal for negotiation consolidates these proposals. I therefore believe that we must call on other rich countries in the world, even more highly developed than we are, to follow the EU's example.
Mr President, I am pleased indeed that Commissioners Lamy and Fischler will be going to Tokyo for the mini-ministerial with an approved position.
I agree with you, Commissioner Lamy, that the agriculture negotiations will be very important in determining whether or not the meetings in Cancun are a success.
I am pleased too that you have defined for us 'modalities', it is a word strange to the English language, but of course, once you come to rules and numbers you are then beginning to be so clear that certain vested interests begin to take fright, so these negotiations will be difficult.
The European Union certainly has a world responsibility in terms of negotiations on agriculture.
As Mr Cunha has just said, the volume of trade alone would make us significant.
However, we do not have sole responsibility, and countries such as the United States should be reminded that they have a responsibility too.
I am sure in your discussions with Bob Zurlik you will remind him of that.
However, you said quite clearly that the European Union can and will negotiate, so let us look at what that means.
Naturally we have the interest of European producers and consumers in higher food quality, rural development, environment protection and animal welfare.
Some of those issues need clarification, and at the same time, the raison d'Ãªtre of the development round are the needs of agriculture in developing countries where, proportionately, it is of far more importance than it is in the European Union.
It is the principal source of income and employment in developing countries and a major tool in the fight against poverty and indeed in the improvement of food security.
So our aim is multi-faceted, we need a better deal for agriculture in developing countries, but we also need to strengthen targeted support for certain aspects of European agriculture.
We have a certain margin of manoeuvre within which to do it.
There is some feeling within the Socialist Group that the proposal is somewhat lacking in ambition.
We expect to be offering to the developing world a bigger and an earlier reduction in all agricultural tariffs and in getting rid of restrictions of imports from the developing world.
We want more insistence on the importance of the greenbox and more attention to special and differential treatment.
You will need to consider whether the current CAP reform goes far enough.
The Socialist Group would probably think not.
We will leave it to you to push the agenda forward as quickly as you can.
My group is also of the opinion that the mandate that the Commission has been given is a good one, and that it is quite happy to be publicly associated with it.
Negotiations have only just begun, and we are sure that if the Commission - Europe - takes a certain step, other trade blocs will have to follow.
For us the most important thing is that we have found that the European people do not fully support European agricultural policy at this moment.
Clearly this must change, so we must change European agricultural policy.
We are in favour of the maximum possible reduction trade subsidies that distort trade, and this applies in particular to export subsidies and other similar subsidies imposed by other trade blocs.
We are therefore generally in favour of greater liberalisation of trade in agricultural products.
Something else enters into this, however.
In Europe we have all sorts of rules which have little to do with the health of the product but much more to do with ethical principles, such as animal welfare, the bird and habitat directive, and so on.
Elsewhere in the world, farmers have far fewer of these kinds of rules to contend with.
I always find it very difficult to explain to European farmers why they have to adhere to these rules and at the same time compete with farmers elsewhere in the world who do not have to.
This seems to me to be a recipe for unfair competition, and I think that the Commission should emphasise this, particularly in its negotiations with the World Trade Organisation.
What is more, farmers in various parts of Europe do not always enjoy a very good income.
We cannot change everything from one day to the next, and I therefore think that we need to pay great attention to the European agricultural model; this is something that we can certainly defend in an international context.
We must be able to reward farmers for their performance on a basis other than their production of agricultural products.
I can therefore only emphasise the need for the Commission to defend the worldwide recognition of regional products grown in Europe and the ban on their being grown elsewhere under the same name.
The Commission must also emphatically underline our endorsement of a system of integrated agricultural production, with control from stable to table, so to speak.
I would also like to emphasise that in addition to the policy of improving product prices, we need another policy to cover the use of agricultural products for industrial purposes.
Finally, everything but arms: the overwhelming majority of my group supports this, and we must do something for the poorest developing countries.
The great question for our group is that of how the Commission is dealing with the principle of origin, and how, as we intend, we can be sure that products imported by us really do come from the poorest countries.
Mr President, I believe it would have been better to have held this debate before, and not after, the General Affairs Council had agreed to the Community's offer for negotiation of the agricultural aspects of the WTO.
It is clear that this is necessary for institutional balance and the whole decision-making process.
This is not a new practice, however, since there are precedents in the reform of the CAP of 1992 and in Agenda 2000.
I say this because certain aspects, such as the reduction in internal support, involve the need to adopt very controversial aspects in the proposed regulations on intermediate reform.
We are talking about aspects such as total decoupling which, as well as being rejected by many MEPs - including myself - is also opposed by professions and many Member States.
With regard to the content, I would continue to say the same thing: we are accepting a policy which will lack substantial and sufficient funds and which could therefore have negative effects on Community agriculture and in particular on the least-favoured regions.
With regard to the more specific proposals, I believe that there are some quite positive aspects in relation to the least-developed countries.
However, the assumption is made that greater liberalisation of trade will lead to greater economic development.
And this is not always the case.
In this regard, I would like to point out that the two most liberalised markets - coffee and cocoa - are the agricultural markets with the highest level of poverty surrounding them and in which the producing countries call for less liberalisation and more regulation.
Neither can the negotiations be based on world market prices which, although it is true they are linked to the volumes marketed, bear very little relation to production and consumer prices.
In any event, I believe it is important to make progress in order to remove export refunds for agricultural products with damaging effects on local agricultural production in the least-developed countries.
We must recognise the right of the less developed countries to protect themselves from these subsidised exports in order to safeguard their fundamental right to food security, to food sovereignty and to the survival of their small-scale and family-run farms.
I believe the proposal to create a food security box is interesting, since it would be very useful also for the European Union for strategic and food security reasons.
But in this regard the Commission is forgetting our dependency on vegetable proteins from outside and, specifically, from countries, in this case, which are not underdeveloped or developing, but which are very developed.
And our dependency stands at 75%.
This seems to me to be an extraordinary oversight.
Finally, given its distorting use by the United States and other countries, I am very pleased with the proposals to eliminate the de minimis clause, to subject export credits and food aid to strict discipline and to protect geographical indications.
Mr President, Commissioner, many developing world countries, along with many NGOs that are active around the globe, have demanded that responsibility for negotiations on agriculture should not be handed over to the WTO, a demand made also at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre.
There are good reasons for this. We have to see that, in the past, although agricultural trade affected the world's agricultural production only to a minimal degree, its mechanisms, and the resultant price destruction had a profound effect not only on European countries, but also on those in the developing world.
Not only there, but also in Europe, its practice of dumping - in the form of export subsidies - destroyed or marginalised rural farming, bringing even greater hunger, forcing countries into a state of dependency, and causing debts to accumulate.
It is abundantly clear that trade does not fill stomachs, and if anyone does get rich from it, it is seldom if ever both the parties concerned.
It is therefore understandable that it is from these sources that highly sceptical questions are being asked about precisely what is to be negotiated at the WTO.
If the WTO negotiations are to be successful, then these mechanisms have to be done away with.
Care must be taken to give absolute priority to the right to produce basic foodstuffs, the right of countries to alleviate their own people's hunger, the right to cultivate the land and to treat the environment properly, along with the right to pass farms on to the next generation, thus maintaining rural farming, as well as the dismantling of destructive trade mechanisms, and of what we call world trade, which amounted to nothing more than export dumping. This will enable us to develop in solidarity with people in the developing world, as well as with rural farming in Europe.
Mr President, the WTO negotiations on agriculture, combined with the Commission's proposals for CAP reform, represent fundamental change for European agriculture and the welfare of farm families.
I have said on many occasions in this House that uncertainty about the future is having devastating consequences for farm families.
I query the degree of compatibility between the Commission's commitment to the EU agricultural model, which is based on family farming, and the proposals in the world trade negotiations.
Trade liberalisation, combined with a progressive reduction in EU farm support - particularly when this reduction is to apply to those already on the margins - raises serious doubts as to our real intentions.
As for the detail of the WTO proposal, what we see once again is a desire by the Commission to exceed the mandate given to it by Member States.
The cuts proposed in export subsidies, import tariffs and domestic farm support are both excessive and unnecessary.
They certainly go beyond any area of commitment entered into in the Uruguay or Doha Rounds.
When we see how our competitors behave - especially in the United States' Farm Bill - one has to ask why we in Europe have to lie down on every occasion and roll over.
Now that the EU petition has been tabled with the WTO, I plead with the Commission to defend vigorously the vital interests of European and, indeed, Irish agriculture.
Improved market access will intensify competition in the EU market.
I call on the Commission to be particularly vigilant during the negotiations on the products more sensitive to this aggressive competition, in particular beef and butter.
I want the Commission to ensure that only minimal tariff reductions will be applied to those sensitive sectors.
It is impossible to debate the forthcoming agricultural negotiations at the WTO without putting the matter in the context of the Commission's mid-term review last month.
All six impact studies, which the Commission carried out, assumed there would be no change in the multilateral trading framework. However, this is clearly not the case.
While it is difficult to forecast the outcome of the current round, the one thing we can be certain about is that a reduction in tariff protection will be part of any agreement.
Given the volume of beef and sheepmeat that is entering the EU at present levels of protection, it is equally certain that most, if not all, of the gap in the EU market created by the reduction in EU supplies will be filled by products from third countries.
I ask where then are the price increases which have been forecast by all these studies to come from?
Decoupling, taken together with the WTO proposals, will cause a reduction in EU production of beef and sheepmeat.
The Commission already knows my view that this will have a disproportionate impact on Ireland.
Despite Commissioner Fischler being very dismissive of this when he presented his proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development last month, I still hold firmly to my view.
I am not afraid to be dismissed as a merchant of doom when I hold a view borne out by hard scientific data, compiled in an independent study on behalf of the Irish Government.
For example, the Commission study indicates a 3% fall in EU beef production, but a 12% fall in Irish beef production.
We will have to take the worst of both worlds: a serious reduction in production with the associated consequences for the economy, including unemployment in our vital agrifood sector, and the anticipated market vacuum filled by third-country imports.
To conclude, I repeat what I said to the Commission last July when the mid-term review proposals were made and again when the legislative proposals were made last month: the combined effects of the prospect of greatly liberalised agricultural trade under the WTO and the Commission proposals for major reform of the common agricultural policy are potentially devastating for European agriculture.
Less than 10% of the world's agricultural production ends up in international trade.
The overwhelming bulk is traded locally or nationally.
This means that proposals intended to regulate trade in 10% of production, as is the case with the World Trade Organisation, must not lose sight of the effects of these measures on trade in the other 90%.
I do not have time to go into all the aspects of the European proposal to the WTO, so I will restrict myself to the position of developing countries and the European model for multifunctional agriculture.
For some of the world's population, food is not something that can be taken for granted.
We must keep a close eye on the interests of these population groups at the WTO discussions.
These interests go further than simply breaking down tariff barriers and preferential access to the European market; preferential access does not necessarily result in an increase in the income of the developing countries and their people.
A recent study has shown that complete liberalisation of trade only provides poor countries with a minimal increase in their income.
Countries such as India and Nigeria are asking for the WTO agreements to be applied flexibly, and rightly so.
They want to support and protect their agricultural sectors and the development of the countryside in order to offer their rural population some security of existence.
These countries need subsidies in order to guarantee food security and to support small-scale agriculture.
I am therefore pleasantly surprised by the Commission's proposal for a Food Security Box and by the scope that Europe wants to offer these countries to support their own agriculture by means of subsidies.
Export subsidies are destroying the world market.
The Commission is, quite rightly, proposing to reduce these further.
If other countries agree to this, the result may be an increase in prices on the world market.
I would, however, like to point out to the Commission that this does not help everybody.
As many as 43 countries in Africa are net importers of food.
They will therefore be worse off if food prices on the world market increase.
This is why, in addition to the anti-dumping measures, technical assistance for these countries is of great importance.
The incomes of farmers in the European Union are under pressure.
Trade liberalisation is primarily of importance to trade and the processing industry.
If Europe wants to retain its family-run farms, it will have to take measures that conflict with the principles of free trade.
It will also have to act more effectively than it is doing at the moment.
A study by the OECD shows that only a quarter of every euro of support that goes to agriculture ends up with the farmer.
Further liberalisation without sufficient protection for the European agricultural model will result in a reduction in the number of farmers.
Fortunately, the Commission's proposal to the WTO is putting the case for the multifunctional agricultural model.
There should still be the possibility of subsidies for aspects that do not disrupt trade, such as the environment, animal welfare and countryside development, but I hope that the Commission also realises that a viable agricultural sector in Europe needs sufficient scope to regulate its market.
Because agriculture still does not operate like a bicycle factory, we need appropriate protection at our borders.
This protection must be transparent.
Food aid as a capped form of dumping is reprehensible.
The Commission rightly highlights this in its proposal, along with other forms of agricultural support such as export credits, export guarantees and state trading enterprises.
Finally, the Commission's proposal is lacking a significant policy instrument that has a positive effect on the market and prices - I am referring to production control.
This instrument is working properly for sugar and dairy products.
The only discordant note sounded by this system is the dumping on the world market of surpluses caused by excessively high quotas.
We should therefore not do away with the quota system, but quotas should be realistic.
The quota for dairy products is 105% of consumption.
If we brought this down to 100%, we would free the world market from dumped sugar and milk powder and we would at the same time offer our farmers a better price.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to make three points concerning these agriculture negotiations under the auspices on the WTO. I must make it clear at the outset that I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of the discussions.
Firstly, these negotiations are taking place against a background of widely differing approaches to agriculture in the United States and the European Union.
Aware of the negative consequences of the fair act for their agriculture, the United States have replaced it with an ambitious farm bill bringing in a 70% increase in financial support to the sector. In contrast, the European Union has set ceilings for expenditure on agriculture.
Further, the Union is implementing a policy on decoupling, just as the United States have abandoned theirs. The Union is also reluctant to apply Community preferences, as was the case in the incident concerning cereals from the Black Sea.
Clearly, these contrasts reflect differing degrees of political will.
The United States wishes its agriculture to remain strong. For the United States, retaining control of what they term the food weapon is a strategic priority, so they are deploying all the means at their disposal to that end.
As for Europe, it is divided on this issue, as it is on so many others.
Europe is even divided on the very appropriateness of a public agricultural policy.
It is divided too on the resources such a policy should have available.
In the proposal on agriculture made by the United States in the context of Doha, significant public support for its agriculture is retained.
It would therefore be both paradoxical and unacceptable for European agriculture to be stranded high and dry at the end of the process.
Secondly, with regard to the Cairns group, it is vital to prevent those countries that are not developing countries and have maintained unrelenting pressure since the start of the Uruguay Round from bringing about the demise of any kind of European agricultural policy by whatever means they have available.
We must stand firm. Developing countries cannot become shields concealing this aim.
After all, the European Union is the largest importer of agricultural products from developing countries in the world.
The Union accounts for two-thirds of Africa's agricultural exports. In addition, the Union is the only party to have created a system of non-reciprocal preferences in the framework of the LomÃ© Convention and subsequently of the Cotonou Convention.
My third and last point is that it is vital for any agreement to be subject to proper provision for concerns we deem to be crucial to society, though they are not strictly trading issues.
I mean proper provision, not mere lip service. I have in mind the requirement for traceability, the rejection of social dumping, concern for the environment and authorised protection of designations of origin.
Mr President, these issues have to be central to negotiations. They cannot be sidelined.
I trust you will take all this on board, Commissioner.
Mr President, the Commission's proposals for the WTO negotiation modality, or rules on agriculture, were unanimously supported by Member States at the recent General Affairs Council, following earlier discussions with various trade policy groups and the agriculture fora.
They have now been submitted to Geneva to be considered, along with the proposals of the other members of the World Trade talks, including the United States, the Cairns Group and the developing countries.
Agreement on the rules under which the new agreement will be concluded is due by the end of March this year, and agreement on the new round itself by the beginning of 2005.
But let us call it as it is.
There are marked differences in the positions of the main negotiating parties, and there will be pressure on all, including the European Union, to compromise.
The European Union negotiates at the World Trade talks on the basis of a mandate which was approved by the Council of Ministers back in September 1999.
That was subsequently endorsed by the General Affairs Council.
That mandate is based on the Agenda 2000 agreement, one of the main objectives of which was to prepare the EU for the WTO negotiations.
Last December the Commission presented a draft paper which it said is consistent with the EU's negotiating mandate at WTO level, as approved by the Council in 1999.
It is consistent therefore with Agenda 2000, and will not require changes to the common agricultural policy; the EU level of export subsidies and domestic support in the so-called 'yellowbox' are already below the levels of reduction commitments proposed; the market access proposals can also be accommodated without disrupting EU markets; and the EU is already committed to reducing tariffs and quota barriers on imports from the least-developed countries and from all developing countries, as proposed in the paper.
Most Member States question the Commission's approach in making substantial reduction commitment offers at this stage, given that there will be pressure to make further concessions as negotiations proceed.
Ireland and France had difficulty with a number of specific issues, and a small number of amendments were introduced at the Council to meet these concerns.
The most important of these issues for Ireland related to improved market access, or the reduction of import tariffs.
Following pressure from Ireland and France, the Commission provided a declaration in the Minutes of the General Affairs Council to the effect that it would submit the proposals on market access to the Council, would remain vigilant in the negotiations in relation to products which are exposed to international competition, and would take particular account of sensitive products.
We also recorded in the Minutes a declaration that our acceptance of the Commission's proposal is on the basis that, at most, minimal tariff reductions will be applied to sensitive sectors, especially beef and butter.
The Irish also had further concerns in relation to domestic support, the redemption of the 'bluebox' and the exemption from reduction commitments of direct payments which are of vital importance to our farmers.
In 2002, 60% of Irish farm incomes were in the form of direct payments to producers which qualify for 'bluebox' exemption.
The retention of export subsidies is also a major issue to us, as a major exporter of agricultural and food products to third countries.
We are particularly dependent on the continuation of an EU system of export subsidies in order to remain competitive on export markets.
Commissioner Fischler contends that his decoupling proposals will reduce production and therefore increase prices, but this ignores the reality of the Commission's World Trade proposals of a decrease of up to 36% in import tariffs amongst other multilateral issues.
We still need answers from Commissioner Fischler as to how he is going to square that circle.
The 36%, 45%, 55% proposals at World Trade talks, together with the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy - which includes proposals for decoupling and modulation - and the uncertain implications of enlargement, have created a climate of serious mistrust in a Commissioner who wants to tear up an existing decision of EU heads of government after only two and a half years of a seven-year agreement.
Yes, we have a duty of care to the developing world, but that must go hand in hand with the duty of care to our own farmers.
Notwithstanding the generosity of the common agricultural policy, and as a result of a combination of falling prices, lower production levels and higher costs, aggravated by exceptionally bad weather, they face ongoing and serious declines in income and uncertain futures.
Mr President, it is clear that there are still major differences of opinion in this Parliament.
Certainly, when I hear the opinions of the traditional farmers' front, it is clear that this Parliament still has much work to do.
From a Socialist point of view, world trade is about fair play for all.
It is essential that we achieve breakthrough in the negotiations on the agricultural portfolio.
We would like to secure two things in this regard.
Firstly we would like to see an end to the dumping of products from Europe and the USA on the markets of developing countries.
We would also like to see our markets opened up more towards developing countries, in which populations are sometimes more than 80% dependent for their incomes on agricultural activity and the abolition of quotas and tariff restrictions on developing countries exporting to us.
Secondly we would like to see production subsidies in the European agricultural policy converted into public grants for nature conservation and new economic activities in the countryside (recreation, ICT, animal welfare).
In other words, less, but spread out more extensively; less support for large-scale farmers; more support for quality and a reasonable existence for farmers.
The latter is essential, as liberalisation is one thing, but we do not want the market to do everything.
What we need is public supervision and regulation.
We are talking about a social model for Europe.
We are well aware that in doing so we will have to prevent this support from public grants from being indirectly used as capped subsidies, thus once more resulting in protectionism and products being sold on the world market too cheaply.
In our opinion it is clear that the proposals now being put forward are a good starting point.
At the same time we would like to ask Commissioners Lamy and Fischler to make more than 50% of agricultural products from developing countries tax-free.
We would like to see change phased in before 2011.
What we would like to see is over 30% off the tariffs, and in 30% less time.
We wholeheartedly endorse the concept of the Food Box.
We also realise, however, that the ACS countries must do their homework better and come up with proposals more quickly.
Then there is the USA, of course.
It is clear that the USA, with its Farm Bill, is currently going completely against the spirit and the facts of Doha.
This places us in an enormous dilemma.
We are of the opinion that Europe and the developing countries must together exert pressure on the USA to abandon this position, because we are convinced that the current policy is bad for us, for our environment, and for the welfare of our animals, as well as for the developing countries.
As the Group of the Party of European Socialists has already done in the last legislative term, let us also demonstrate the courage to change course despite all the ifs and buts.
Mr President, on 27 January, the Commission stated that the EU's proposal on the WTO negotiations was compatible with our current advocacy of substantial and progressive liberalisation on a fair and even-handed basis.
It is furthermore stated in clear terms that 'the actual measures involve the fair sharing of agricultural burdens and the developing countries, too, should be given greater opportunities.'
That is a logical development in view of the fact that, in the EU too since the 1992 CAP reform, liberalisation keeps making advances in the implementation of the GATT resolutions.
The good ship WTO is steaming ahead, with undertakings in the agricultural and food industries swimming in its wake as best they can, as, every time the consumer spends a euro on groceries, the farmers get only an average of 25 cents.
The liberalisation of agricultural trade has its advocates and its opponents.
There is unanimous agreement that developing countries should be given easier access to the European Internal Market, yet, despite liberalisation - or, indeed, as a consequence of it - there has been no definite improvement in the situation as regards world hunger; indeed, as the motions for a resolution point out, this has got worse.


It is not clear what sort of permanent and comprehensive body of Europe-wide legislation on non-commercial matters might be able to maintain the balancing act between, on the one hand, the maintenance and improvement of European agriculture's competitive position on world markets and, on the other hand, the protection of insufficiently competitive agriculture at a time when it is being made more multifunctional for the benefit of society.
My mind is quite open as to whether the European agricultural model, combining multifunctionality with a policy of subsidies, can be implemented with any international legitimacy.
The great danger is already present that this will prove no long-lasting protection and that the abandonment of European subsidy policy will then begin in earnest, because there will as yet be no political majorities, and where they do exist, they will be compromises.
On the other hand, the WTO's fundamental categories do not include issues of rural development, environmental protection and animal welfare.
What is true of enlargement must also be true of the WTO negotiations, the principle being that nobody should be any worse off.
The situation before the negotiations and after them will be considered in that light, so we can look forward to the result with some excitement.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two new worrying developments have emerged in connection with the latest round of WTO negotiations. These developments concern the atmosphere of negotiations on the one hand and the subject of negotiations on the other.
The atmosphere has changed due to the strong pressure exerted by the United States representatives on their European counterparts.
Mr Robert Zoellick has referred to European partners such as France and Ireland as colonialists who are two hundred years behind the times.
You are an exception Commissioner, as you have all but been awarded an honorary doctorate by the Bush administration. All this has taken place against the background of references to 'Old Europe', or even cheese-eating monkeys.
We know that your opposite number Mr Robert Zoellick, signed an open letter from Mr Wolfowitz in January 1998 calling for a war on Iraq. You seem to be negotiating with a hawk Commissioner!
You know him better than I do, however, so you must be best placed to judge if he really is one.
The subject of negotiations has also changed.
To date, we had been discussing subjects which lacked soul.
Now, as we discuss agriculture, we are negotiating on quality, the environment, welfare, animals and consequently essentially cultural matters. The present round does not concern goods.
It concerns knowledge. It concerns the very essence of people, and their very being.
Hence the fear of nothingness, as the Louvain students made clear to you.
Agriculture constitutes an exception to the rule. There is its unique structure, the AOCs and the countryside.
Hence the deep-rooted fear that you might not stand up for this agricultural exception which goes right back to Mesopotamia. It is nothing new.
Serious misgivings abound, and they are mainly of a political nature. We fear that Cancun will be a 'Munich in the sun'.
There are moreover precedents for this. There is the mysterious agreement of 2001 on bananas.
Chiquita collapsed just like Enron. There is the failure to challenge the issue of dependency on oil-producing crops, even after the opening-up of former Eastern bloc countries and the consequences of mad cow disease.
Above all there is Mr Fischler's project, begun in July 2002 and confirmed in January 2003, which involved deep cuts in subsidies. At the same time, the United States established proposals to spend 190 billion over ten years from May 2002.
Nonetheless, the de minimis rule would keep all this within the green box.
Our fears are also based on an unfathomable contradiction. Surely it cannot be right to destroy our agricultural infrastructure and know-how when by 2020 there will be two billion more mouths to feed.
This is the basis of my fundamental fear.
Commissioner, we seem to be already condemned as we speed along on board the shuttle Earth which is as riddled with cracks as the shuttle Columbia.
Yet here we are discussing commerce and global free-trade when we know drinking water supplies are dwindling and when two billion people lack electricity or medicine.
I am beginning to wonder therefore whether the WTO, like the European Union, is a museum piece.
Commissioner, the subject of this evening's debate is certainly the basis for a tapestry of some of the major themes of world and European politics.
For example, the first theme is without a doubt that world agricultural trade and the talks which are outlining and will define the aspects and modalities thereof represent the point of confrontation between market liberalisation and governments' desires to pursue protectionist agricultural policies which go beyond production itself and affect what are known as non-commercial aspects too, such as environmental protection, food safety, the safeguarding and promotion of quality and the preservation of rural areas.
We have listened to you carefully this evening, Commissioner, and it is clear from what you have said that the European Union has expressed a strong desire to negotiate an agreement for the further liberalisation of the trade in agricultural products.
In our opinion, however, the agreement must be well balanced and must be an agreement which benefits everybody.
It would appear that this is also the position which Commissioner Fischler has upheld on a number of occasions with regard to Community agricultural policies. Not more than a week ago, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, he pointed out that the rules which emerge from the new rounds of talks next autumn must be fair and apply equally to all.
Thus, the idea which emerges of cutting export subsidies is an idea which is certainly attractive and which I certainly support, but only on condition that other subsidies causing the distortion of the international trade market are also regulated.
Then there is another major political theme which is connected with the subject of this evening's debate. We need an overall perspective on the matter.
The current economic situation, whose development will interact with and be affected by the future development of the agricultural sector, cannot be viewed purely in terms of international trade, for international trade is directly dependent upon the proposal to reform the common agricultural policy.
What was to be a mid-term assessment review has become a veritable transformation of European agriculture.
The Community policy guidelines in this sector, in addition to seeing the market as a means of economic development, are intended in Europe to ensure consumer protection - consider the recent creation of the European Food Safety Authority.
This principle of food safety has been expressed and accepted at WTO level too, but it has only been accepted as an ideal. Much progress will be needed before quality equal to that of our own produce is guaranteed.
The production costs sustained by the European agricultural economy differ substantially from those sustained by the developing countries, for the standards of quality, safety and health and hygiene are different.
It is as desirable that clear international rules for the protection of agrifoods should be established at the forthcoming negotiating rounds as it is for the Codex alimentarius to be duly valued and respected in the protection of recognised typical European products.
European farms operating in a globalised context must invest in the quality of their produce to acquire specific market shares which are sensitive to new consumer demands.
Production standards are now oriented towards ensuring the traceability of production from stable to table.
In this sense, the possibility of marketing European agrifoods produce at world level must go hand in hand with the economic development of the less wealthy countries, with mutual respect for local agrifoods production in a global context of balanced growth regulated by both the economy and well-defined rules, but, above all, by the clear need for growth which benefits all to the detriment of none.
Therefore, the basic issue before us now is that the proposal you have outlined to us this evening, Commissioner, contains a principle. We need a common agricultural policy which preserves the conventions we are used to.
Your speech and the documents available to us uphold a principle which we find it very hard to accept, to the effect that the proposal for mid-term review, which provides, inter alia, for decoupling and the non-fulfilment of blue box commitments, should take precedence over the WTO negotiating modalities, which provide for an endeavour to preserve the blue box aid instigated with the McSharry reform.
There is therefore a need to redefine the negotiating modalities, removing the Blue Box chapter altogether and thus irretrievably eliminating the possibility of safeguarding direct payments in a multilateral context.
If this should happen, we believe that it would be the beginning of the liberalisation of the European agricultural sector, which is essential not just for the sector as such but for the whole of the European economy as well.
Mr President, Commissioner, we support and we consider very positive the Commission's efforts to integrate the developing countries and the least developed countries into these negotiations, access without customs duties or quotas for those countries and the creation of a food security box, but we also believe that in some proposals we could have gone further, such as in the proposal relating to the reduction in export refunds, on which I trust we can make progress during the negotiations.
I would also like to say that the commitment to greater openness must be accompanied by a fair distribution of responsibilities amongst the developed countries.
In this regard, we must condemn the unilateral nature of the United States' agricultural policy.
Commissioner, I am concerned, however, that the model of agricultural multifunctionality may be jeopardised.
I must tell you that in the proposal for negotiation multifunctional considerations are mentioned just once when the Commission refers to access to the market for the poorest countries.
With regard to Community agriculture, it is true that we are now referring to social objectives such as the protection of the environment, public health, obligatory labelling or the need to compensate for the additional costs of animal welfare.
But European agricultural multifunctionality no longer plays an important role in this offer for negotiation and the main focus has passed to the decoupling of aid, the principle which the Commission is going to concentrate the negotiation on, in the internal support chapter.
Commissioner, I believe that, if we allow our entire negotiating strategy to rest on the principle of decoupling, we may find ourselves without any room for manoeuvre in terms of guaranteeing elements which are essential to European agriculture, such as the stability of markets, with the maintenance of stable and economically viable prices which allow producers to earn an income.
Mr President, it is abundantly clear that the European Union intends to sacrifice small and medium-sized farmers and support for agriculture at European Union level at the alter of the World Trade Organisation.
The inviolable principle behind all European Union decisions is how best to serve the interests of big business and the multinationals.
The forthcoming reform of the CAP - which is a catastrophic overhaul, not the mid-term review it claims to be - is being carried out in the run up to and under pressure from WTO negotiations.
The proposed WTO agreement speeds up the liberalisation of the international trade in agricultural produce on the pretext that international trade will increase and benefit the developing countries.
The same was said of GATT, and look what happened there.
GATT was going to increase the international trade in agricultural produce and generate wealth. Not only did the developing countries and their people not benefit; they were worse off than before, with no margin for development even in countries with a high output like Argentina.
All that happened was that the multinationals producing and selling agricultural produce sent their profit figures soaring.
The same will happen with the WTO agreement, for three basic reasons.
The first has to do with the approach, which favours monopolies, as did GATT.
The second has to do with the international system of prices and subsidies for agricultural produce and the international system of prices for industrial goods.
The rich countries buy cheap agricultural produce and sell expensive industrial goods, including medicines.
The third reason has to do with who produces and owns the agricultural produce in numerous developing countries, where farming and agricultural produce are owned by huge multinationals paying starvation wages.
That is why the Communist Party of Greece is against the proposed agreement and is doing everything it can to coordinate the grass-roots fight in every country for international trade based on mutual benefit of equal value to all.
Mr President, the European Union has made clear its commitment to reforming the agricultural trading system - firstly to secure a future for Europe's farmers and, on the other hand, to recognise the need for special treatment for the developing countries.
This is no mean feat.
In fact it is very difficult, as we have people on one side who believe the Commission is going too far, and others who believe that it is acting far too cautiously.
If the European Union is to have a credible voice in the Doha process, this procrastination must stop.
With enlargement on our doorstep we must act immediately.
The Commission's proposals will benefit European farmers in the long term and improve prospects for meaningful global trade liberalisation talks.
I hope that we send the clear message that it is the farmers themselves who should receive a greater share of the market price, and not the increasing numbers of powerful monopolies that are controlling, in a devastating manner, our agricultural industry at the present moment in time.
The balance we seek is to support small farmers - 90% of the farmers in my country, Wales, are small farmers who farm in less favoured areas - and rural development and Pillar II, on the one hand, while also taking account of farmers in the Third World.
It is a very difficult balancing act.
We can no longer continue with a situation where the average European dairy cow now has a bigger annual income, thanks to European subsidies, than half of the world's population.
Mr President, Commissioner, what I actually would like to do is to address just a few points, as my colleagues have already had a lot to say.
I believe that the difficulty we have, and that you in the Commission have in particular, is, in essence, the fact that you have to reconcile two different strategies.
On the one hand, you have to implement reform in the European Union's agricultural production, and on the other, you have to improve developing countries' access to the market.
That is of course extremely difficult, and is made more so by the very ambitious timetable, as you are required to be able to point to successes as soon as this year - successes in the Cancun negotiations.
You must at least say in what direction you are taking us, and in doing so you also have to keep sight of your obligation to successfully conclude the negotiations in 2005.
Add to that the complications with your trading partners, and the whole thing, taken together, amounts to a thoroughly tricky act.
I have looked at many documents and position papers from Germany, but also from other countries, so that what is here on the desk in front of me is a pot-pourri.
On the one hand, much that is said is complimentary; people approve of the fact that something is happening at last, and that we are going in the right direction.
On the other hand, there are also many reservations and concerns, with fears that the European Union will end up with the model of what I might summarise in general terms as a sort of 'leisure agriculture', and that we are to some extent losing sight of the need to be flexible enough to be truly competitive and to be able to compete internationally.
We may well be able to do a great deal for the environment and agriculture, but there is the risk of other instruments falling by the wayside.
Commissioner, both you and Commissioner Fischler have, I believe, always said that we have enough room to manoeuvre.
We have flexibility.
We have to look at the details, perhaps at the milk prices for example, or in other areas, to see what else we might do.
Let me conclude with a very brief question.
At a seminar of the Group of the Party of European Socialists last week, representatives of the developing countries kept referring to the development box, and expressed the desire that more be done about it.
Perhaps you could say something about this.
Mr President, Commissioner, the motto we need to adopt for negotiating our agricultural policy at the WTO is: 'More empty words? No, thank you.
Specific proposals?
Yes, please'. And the proposals and the timetable for applying them are nothing if not specific.
The overall package being contributed to the forthcoming WTO negotiations by the European Union puts the ball very firmly in the European Union's court.
Rather than just tabling proposals, it needs to make a studied demand for something in return.
We need to know, for example, what the other developed countries are going to do and which parts of the system of protection for European Union farmers need to be safeguarded.
While we are on the subject of protecting our farmers, and I mean the farmers of the 25 Member States of the European Union, not just the 15, we need first for the multifunctionality model of European agriculture to be recognised and protected.
Secondly, the review of the common agricultural policy - and the Socialists' agree with the general philosophy here - must not pay the price for any misplaced commitments undertaken at the negotiations.
Thirdly, as far as the environmental dimension of rural development, striking an ecological balance, food standards and so on are concerned, the European Union must lobby for a common clause for all countries based on its standards.
It is both pointless and unacceptable to make it easier to import agricultural produce from developing countries which do not meet European standards.
Finally, we are not doing poor countries and their farmers any favours if we manage to increase farmers' incomes in poor countries, merely so that the developed countries can sell them extortionately expensive AIDS drugs, for example.
In other words, what we need at the negotiations are not just impressive proposals of good intent; we need to juxtapose them with social benefits, we need a certain type of negotiation which serves broader social interests.
Mr President, I think one of the conclusions we can draw from the debate this evening is that this House always has much more to say about agriculture than about access to medicine, Davos or Porto Alegre.
I am not sure this is news but it is nevertheless the case.
We should ask ourselves what is really at stake in this whole affair of multinational commercial agricultural negotiations.
The issue is whether the European Union can and should subscribe to controls, ceilings and rules. In the future these would limit the support and protection we currently afford to our farmers and would like to continue to afford them.
Further, I would like to remind you of some of the principles on which my position and Mr Franz Fischler's position are based. I would then like to dwell on two or three points in a little more detail.
Firstly, at Doha we made a number of commitments on negotiations.
Our undertakings went considerably further than those we gave on the previous occasion. I am referring to Marrakech in 1995.
We agreed to increase market access by reducing our support within the Union and reducing export subsidies.
These matters form part of our negotiation mandate. We shall pursue this, as previously agreed.
Our second principle concerns our work on these issues. In allocating concessions, we should give priority to developing countries and ensure that concessions and consequently control measures are applied in an equitable manner.
There is no question of the European Union as part of the developed world accepting control measures other developed countries would reject.
I would now like to outline my third and last general principle. This debate is not the same as our internal debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy.
The debate over our position in relation to the World Trade Organisation is quite separate from the internal debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy.
We are not debating the reform of the common agricultural policy in Geneva, Tokyo, Washington, Sydney or Cancun.
It will be debated internally, along our own lines.
It is true that we are debating our position in relation to the World Trade Organisation in Brussels and Strasbourg, but in the spirit I described.
The Commission has indeed put forward a proposal. If adopted, it will usher in further reforms in the management of the common agricultural policy.
It remains to be seen if and when these decisions are taken. It has yet to be established also which of these decisions will be used as negotiating tools and when.
This is not the case at the moment however.
I must make it clear to Mrs Doyle that the 36%, 45%, 55%, that Mr Franz Fischler and I have now put forward with the agreement of the Council, follow from reforms already adopted. They do not compromise the eventual outcome of other reforms in any way.
Turning to whether what we have put forward is too ambitious or is not sufficient.
You have already responded to this question I think. Some of you think our proposals lack ambition and others think they go too far.
Mrs McNally made it clear that, in her opinion, we could have gone further.
I would like to say that I do not believe we could have gone any further, at least not at this stage.
If here and now all the contracting parties within the WTO made the type of commitment we have put on the table, we would all have taken a great step forward towards establishing better control measures to support agriculture throughout the world.
Now for the question of whether we are going too far.
I believe this is what Mr Hyland is concerned about. I do not believe that we are.
I do think however that we have already gone too far in reforming the common agricultural policy in recent years. This was perhaps the essence of what Mr Hyland was saying.
As you can well imagine, this is not the view of the Commission.
I would now like to address the points made by Mr van Dam, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mrs Erika Mann.
They rightly pointed to the issue of food security. They based their arguments on the fact that in agriculture, only 10% of production is traded on the international market.
This contrasts with the situation in other sectors. They are right in what they say and this is why we have introduced a new measure that has been widely commented upon.
We are building in the concept of food security, a safeguard clause, a separate section devoted to food security. As I said in my introductory intervention, we have taken inspiration from various quarters, in particular non-governmental organisations.
Before I finish, I would like to respond to Mr Mulder.
It is true Mr Mulder, that the rules of the so-called 'Everything but arms' initiative include very strict controls on the origin of products that mean that only products from the least advanced countries benefit from the 'zero duty, zero quota' measure agreed for their benefit.
These rules are very restrictive and some of the countries believe they are excessively so.
It is therefore right the rules should be so rigorous.
I would say two lessons have been learnt from this debate. The first is that Mr Martinez appears to have certain existential concerns.
This in itself is excellent news. The second is that, for once, there are excellent reasons for such concerns.
On this occasion, I do actually share the view that agriculture concerns not just goods but our very being. I am sure my colleague Mr Fischler would agree on this too.
Mr Martinez is right on this point. Agriculture is about goods that are produced, distributed and end up on our own or other people's plates.
Agriculture is also about a service, however, and there is far less talk about that. The goods component of agriculture can be found on the market and in trade links.
Goods are bought and sold. The service component of agriculture encompasses food security, the environment and welfare.
This is not discussed. In general it is poorly served by market forces.
Agriculture is therefore made up of two interdependent elements.
One can be seen to circulate, and could be deemed to fit the same rules as applied to the production of socks, tyres and shoes The other element cannot be equated to the trade in socks, tyres and shoes in any way whatsoever. This is the service component, and because of it we have a special relationship with what we eat and what we produce.
The coexistence of the goods and the service components of agriculture is at the root of the difficulties we are up against. This is how we in Europe perceive agriculture and this is why Europe has adopted a balanced position on a number of outcomes.
We are not, however, prepared to sacrifice what we believe to be the collective cost of agriculture.
We will pursue this concept of the two aspects of agriculture in our discussions. I have already made it clear to those of you who are interested in or indeed passionate about this issue that there is everything to gain from discussing this whole matter again, before the Cancun meeting.
We should, if possible, debate the negotiation program as a whole, and not bit by bit disjointedly as we have this evening. Mr Franz Fischler and I are certainly willing to do so.
As an exception to the rule, I will give the floor to Mr De Rossa.
Mr President, I apologise for being late.
I wanted to speak because my position in relation to agriculture is not the same as the position presented to this House by a number of other Irish Members.
I say this because it is important for the variety of opinion that exists in relation to farming to be on the record.
I welcome the proposals put forward by the Commission in relation to farming.
One of the issues that is constantly ignored in Ireland and elsewhere is the contradiction between our spending a considerable amount of money on development aid in assisting developing countries, and yet maintaining a common agricultural system which, at the same time, undermines the very people we claim to be trying to help with our development aid.
That is an issue we have not yet come to grips with in Ireland or, to some extent, in the rest of Europe.
It is not a position that you will hear too often from an Irish Member in this House and, for that reason, I wanted to put it on the record.
This intervention does not set a precedent since, as you know, if for any reason a Member cannot speak, they can present a written statement not exceeding 200 words once per part-session.
To end this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure
Most of the countries worst affected by AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are unable to produce the necessary treatments themselves.
Forty-two million people are infected with AIDS in the world.
Only 36 000 people are receiving treatment in Africa.
Every day, 40 000 people die from infectious disease.
The situation is therefore serious and urgent.
In response to this situation, on 20 December last, the Northern countries gave in to the diktat by the United States which, in order to protect its pharmaceutical industry, vetoed the agreement on generic medicines.
The European Union, however, wishing to protect its image, agreed to go back on the Doha acquis, by presenting highly restrictive definitions of the diseases in question and the countries concerned and allowing the establishment of a right for the WHO to assess the conduct of countries in this matter.
Hundreds of thousands of human lives are at risk.
The European Commission has chosen to give the profits of the pharmaceutical industries precedence over life.
Together with my group, I support the many NGOs that are asking for matters relating to public health to fall outside the scope of the WHO.
Freedom of movement and residence for EU citizens
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2003) by Mr Santini, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States [COM(2001) 257 - C5-0336/2001 - 2001/0111(COD)].
Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Santini, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for this very positive report.
The report concerns a long-awaited proposal for a directive which is crucial for facilitating the free movement of persons and which takes into account the work carried out at the end of the 1990s, in particular by the high level panel chaired by Mrs Simone Veil, on citizenship of the European Union.
This proposal lays down the conditions governing the exercise of the fundamental right of free movement and residence, which is conferred directly to every EU citizen by the Treaty and enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
In this respect the proposal represents a first step towards defining a strong concept of citizenship of the European Union, as confirmed by the basic aim of the proposal.
EU citizens should mutatis mutandis be able to move between Member States on similar terms as nationals of a Member State moving around or changing their place of residence in their own country.
In particular the directive should facilitate the exercise of the right to free movement by reducing administrative formalities to what is absolutely necessary, by better defining the situation of family members, by introducing a permanent right of residence after four years of uninterrupted residence in the host Member State, and by further restricting the scope for refusing or terminating residence on grounds of public order.
The proposal also introduces important innovations by comparison to the existing acquis.
In particular it extends from three to six months the period during which citizens are not subject to any formalities other than the possession of a valid identity card or passport.
It suppresses the obligation to obtain a residence permit for European Union citizens, replacing it with straightforward registration with the competent authorities, which is already the case in some Member States.
It establishes a system in which the European Union citizen has simply to declare that he fulfils the conditions linked to the exercise of the right of residence.
Finally, it introduces after four years of uninterrupted residence a permanent right of residence which is no longer subject to any conditions.
As is rightly underlined in Mr Santini's report, the right to free movement is still subject today to many obstacles.
This has been confirmed in the repeated judgments of the Court of Justice on the matter.
This proposal incorporates the clarifications made by the Court's recent decisions and, once adopted, it should considerably simplify the exercise of the fundamental rights of every European citizen.
. (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for this introduction, which paves the way for the presentation of my report.
Indeed, the directive we are discussing represents a genuine leap forward in the debate on citizenship of the Union and the free movement of persons.
For the first time, the citizen is recognised as having rights not just as an economic entity but as a person, as the holder of individual rights which, together with general rights, make up European citizenship.
The rights of free movement and residence derive directly from the European Treaty, they have long been established, as the Commissioner said, and they confer on the citizens new, major fundamental rights.
Indeed, one might say that this directive lays the foundations of dual citizenship - national and European citizenship - as formulated in the draft Treaty discussed in the Convention too.
The introduction of the right to permanent residence is a concrete example of this.
Before looking at the directive in more detail, we should specify its scope.
It is directed at Community citizens and members of their families, of whatever nationality.
The principle of equal treatment of third citizens who are members of a Community family has been established since the sixties and the directive makes it even more efficient and effective.
This is a right derived from the right of the Community citizen of whose family they are members. It must be made clear from the outset that this directive does not apply to the citizens of third countries or, in any case, not to those who are not related to Community citizens, even if they are living in a Member State or enjoy free movement within the Union.
The great merit of this directive is that it combines all the previous provisions on the subject in a single text.
Another merit is its clarity and, in this regard, I feel that some of the rapporteur's amendments, not least, have helped to simplify the excessively bureaucratic sections as far as is possible.
The most innovative elements include the proposal to replace the residence card, as the Commissioner mentioned, with a simple certificate of registration with the competent authorities.
The registration procedures must be straightforward and direct and, in any case, the principle of self-certification must be applied, as it already is in some Member States.
The principle of self-certification must also apply to the provision of proof of income and health insurance cover too.
In the case of family members who are third-country nationals, an identity document must be supplied in order to prove the existence of a family relationship, purely in order to prevent abuses, which are always possible.
A further innovative principle introduced by the directive concerns the expulsion of third country citizens who are entitled to residence on Community territory.
The directive stipulates that they cannot be expelled under any circumstances whatsoever.
This approach applies the 'Amsterdam objective', namely the creation of a border-free area of freedom, security and justice, but some of the Member States will probably want to establish their own rules on this matter.
I have saved the most controversial issue until last, as always happens when debates are introduced in this Chamber: the family, its composition and the definitions of couple and spouse.
To avoid such a vast wealth of innovative legislation being hijacked by the usual tug of war, as rapporteur, I have striven to be as open as possible, stretching my principles and the principles of the political group I represent to the limits in the interests of completing the process with the directive intact.
Moreover, there is no ambiguity over the definition of spouse in terms of Community law, as the Court of Justice has confirmed on a number of occasions.
In this connection and in relation to unmarried couples too, the rapporteur has appropriated a number of amendments tabled and then withdrawn by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which appeal to the laws of the different Member States with a view to putting an end to the discrepancies which still exist at Community level.
In my opinion, this democratic appeal to subsidiarity, to national sovereignty, respects all interests and should avoid the usual crusades which could well diminish the content of the report and render its scope ineffective.
In short, each Member State can regulate family issues on the basis of its own legislation and concerns.
It would be a real shame if we were unable to succeed in delivering a worthy text enjoying broad support to the Council, considering the marvellous opportunity of codecision we have on this matter.
Moreover, it is inconceivable that we should impose on 13 States a model supported by only two of them, or that priority should be given to symbols and dogmas rather than responsible rules awaited by millions of citizens who want to be able to organise their lives.
To sum up, it has to be said that the rapporteur's approach is, for the most part, in line with that of the Commission, which has produced a coherent, objective text which, as we already know, also expresses the Council's position.
We have the opportunity to give the citizens new, modern rules which provide greater guarantees of civil liberties.
I am confident that they will be adopted at the vote in this Chamber and I would like to thank the committee draftsmen and all the Members who have contributed to the report with their amendments, which have, without a doubt, improved the content of the directive.
Madam President, European citizenship was one of the great achievements of the Union Treaty adopted in Nice in 1992.
In accordance with the judgments of the Court of Justice, the rights of European citizenship, including the right to free movement and residence within the Union, were fundamental rights of European citizens, whose recognition did not require any legislative implementation.
In accordance with this legal basis, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market considered that there was no reason for the establishment of restrictions of an administrative nature, either for entry into a country or for free movement and residence.
Much progress has been made in the field of legislative organisation by means of the Schengen Agreements, but it is the case that certain countries are still resisting this progress and are not participating in it.
Therefore, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market hoped that this proposal for a directive would represent an effective step forward by removing all the restrictions in terms of administration and content to a citizen's ability to establish themselves in another Community country.
This was the purpose of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market were not accepted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the rapporteur would naturally like them to be maintained, but has not insisted, in order not to jeopardise the agreements reached in this field.
I would like to draw attention to an amendment, however, which could to a certain extent respond to the concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I am referring to Amendment No 23 - which introduces a new Article 4(b) - which says that 'This Directive shall not lead to the withdrawal of existing rights established by the legislation of the European Union or Court of Justice decision'.
I believe this amendment is essential if we do not want to move backwards in terms of the rights of European citizens within the Union.
Madam President, the Commission proposal for a directive on the right of citizens to move freely is, without doubt, an important step in removing the unjustified technical obstacles that persist even in united Europe.
The proposed amendments submitted by the European Parliament have of course improved the Commission's proposal significantly.
The amendments submitted by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities aim to bring about a number of improvements to reinforce the free movement of women, taking account of the specific problems faced by women and the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender.
Unfortunately, Commissioner, your ambition to allow European citizens to exercise their right of residence freely and without impediment has not resulted in a text that is gender neutral and takes account of the specific problems faced by women.
The main problem concerns women who are economically dependent on their husbands and who, in the event of death or separation, have no prospects of extending their right or continuing to reside in another European country.
In other words, they are automatically deprived of any legal rights derived from their residing in another Member State of the Union.
We feel this needs correcting.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities also emphasises the importance of protecting all interpersonal relations by giving live-in partners of either sex the same rights as a spouse.
More and more Member States are finding ways of recognising couples who live together without officially getting married.
Most countries now allow partners to be officially registered and this category therefore needs to be included in the definition of family members.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the draft directive put before us today marks a great leap forwards in the realisation of our European Community, for it will be through EU citizens enjoying freedom of movement that we will achieve our objective.
What the directive has in mind is that journeys by EU citizens between the Member States should be subject to the same conditions as those undertaken within individual Member States, in other words, the intention is to demolish the remaining barriers and surmount the bureaucratic and political hurdles and obstacles that block the way to freedom of movement.
This leads me, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to emphatically endorse the Commission proposal and the refinements and modifications that our esteemed rapporteur has made to it.
Such is our objective towards which we are journeying, and I am convinced that we can reach that objective providing that certain conditions are complied with.
I was disappointed by the way in which certain Members, in this debate on the great issue of freedom of movement, focussed their attention, to the exclusion of all else, on the definition of what we are meant to mean by 'family'.
Although this is just a small part of the whole, and needs to be discussed, we should bid farewell to the view that a select few know what is meant by 'family', and that their definition should be imposed on all other Members of this House or on the Member States.
That is not acceptable.
We should arrive at a compromise, and do so by accepting the fact that the various states have different conceptions of this and make different arrangements for it.
What we should not be doing is allowing the few to take it upon themselves to impose their concept and definition of the family on all the other states.
If we can manage to stand back and arrive at consensus by accepting individual Member States' diverse arrangements, this proposal will win acceptance by a broad majority.
In the interests of EU citizens' freedom of movement, I appeal to all those who have introduced these proposals to follow where reason leads.
Madam President, on behalf of my colleague, Carmen Cerdeira, who has been shadow rapporteur for this report, and who unfortunately cannot be here, I will try as far as possible to speak on behalf of my political group.
Citizenship of the Union - institutionalised and created as such by the Treaty of Maastricht and later modified by the Treaty of Amsterdam - confers a series of rights and duties on the nationals of all the Member States.
The intention is to associate the citizens with the process of European integration, giving them more involvement, strengthening the protection of their rights and promoting the idea of a European identity by means of the creation of a sense of belonging amongst the citizens of the Union.
The citizenship rights and the Union as a whole will only have credibility amongst the citizens if they can be applied in practice in their everyday lives.
Within the context of citizenship of the Union, one of the fundamental rights that citizenship confers is laid down in Article 18(1) of the Treaty, which gives every citizen of the Union the right to enter, move and reside freely in the territory of the Member States.
The same right, with a similar wording, is conferred on the European citizen by Article 45(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and this seems to us very significant.
Consequently, these rights are of a constituent and not a declarative nature. In other words they are acquired regardless of any permission granted by the Member States.
We welcome the Commission's proposal, which we consider to be a genuine step forward.
The movement of the Union's citizens amongst the Member States should be carried out mutatis mutandis in conditions similar to those of the citizens of a particular State.
In reality, Madam President, the Union's citizens have taken this principle on board much more quickly and thoroughly than their governments.
They have taken it on board and they exercise it.
I can assure you that in my part of the Union, on the coast where I spend several days, there are many European citizens residing illegally who simply come and go between their two houses, one in their country of origin and one in my country, whenever they want and without filling out any papers.
It cannot be demonstrated whether these people have spent the last six months in their house, because sometimes it is 60 km from the neighbouring country.
The euro will make this even easier and more possible and I hope that progress can be made within the Commission.
Therefore, my group has presented amendments that intend, once and for all, to end the consideration of the economic situation of people, giving priority to the condition of citizen, and to recognise that at this moment the citizens and their families are already exercising the right to free movement within the European Union.
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to state that we support Mr Santini's proposal, as adopted by the committee.
The purpose of the directive is to give more content to EU citizenship and to increase people's freedom of movement within the Community.
The proposal would mean a consolidation of the present multiplicity of regulations, directives and judgments in this area.
In this way, the state of the law would become clearer and less ambiguous.
Clear legislation would, at the same time, mean that it would be easier to overcome many of the practical obstacles to people's freedom of movement that still exist.
The ELDR Group fully supports the principle of non-discrimination whereby EU citizens from other Member States are, as far as possible, treated according to the same rules as citizens of one's own country.
This directive is a step in the right direction.
We also, however, support the progressive definition of the family incorporated into the proposal.
On a general note, I should like to state straight away that the intention behind the proposal is not to lay down a definition of the family. The intention is, quite basically, to preserve family unity.
The discussion surrounding the definition of the family ought not therefore to distract attention from the purpose of the proposal and the positive consequences of the directive's being adopted, namely a strengthening of the basis of the rule governing freedom of movement, an increase in the mobility of the labour force and, of course, the preservation of family unity.
Madam President, the proposal for a directive on the right of European citizens and their families to free movement and residence within the territory of the Member States marks a key point in the creation of a freer, more open Europe, and it endeavours, moreover, to simplify and streamline a veritable spider's web of provisions on employees and the self-employed, pensioners, students and citizens who simply wish to live in a country other than their own.
Then the amendments adopted in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have improved the original text considerably, providing greater legal certainty for workers and protecting them from the dangers of illegal immigration.
Of course, European citizens should be protected from these dangers too.
Certainly, a great deal remains to be done, as Mrs Karamanou and Mr Medina Ortega have made clear.
In addressing the expectations of family members who wish to live outside their own country, we have been working, not least, towards a genuine increase in civil liberties, eliminating discrimination on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation or form of cohabitation.
We are convinced that, just as rights such as the right to divorce or to have an abortion are ingrained in the psyche of the majority of Europeans, so there is also a clear need to make effective the right of those who wish to live in a country other than their own, who wish to live alone or with a same-sex partner or to build a family without being forced to marry.
I do not know whether the Council will decide or be able to preserve the political and cultural balance of Parliament's decisions, whether it will endorse the report in the form adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, but we are sure that, should it fail to do so, it would be acting against the wishes of the majority of the Union's citizens, as Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ has said, with the danger of widening the gap between institutions and people.
Madam President, my group is also very happy with the proposed directive as well as with the report.
While we often hear that the European Union wants to proceed with integration too quickly in other areas, this is typically a matter that people think should have been settled long ago.
In fact people often think that it has already been settled, and they are then disappointed to find out that free movement is not as free as they thought.
This is about a Swede who wants to go and live and work in Italy, for example.
This is now being simplified.
Now I know that some Members of this Parliament, and particularly some Member States, think that this is about migration.
I find that rather far-fetched.
It is mainly about the free movement of EU citizens and only concerns people from third countries if they are married to or are in long-term relationships with EU citizens.
So let us keep it in perspective.
An important part of this is naturally the fact that many people wanting to travel within the EU or who want to go and live in another country will not want to do this on their own but with their families or their partners.
A great deal has been said about this in the report, the definition has been broadened and my group is satisfied with that.
I conclude from Mr Pirker's amendments and comments, however, that the definition remains extremely controversial.
Marriage - we think that this is logical; the person's spouse must be allowed to accompany them.
We also think registered partnerships are surmountable; the person's registered partner must also be allowed to accompany them.
We have difficulty with long-term relationships, however.
I would therefore like to quote Mr Pirker, to show that I have been listening to him closely.
He said: 'We must distance ourselves from the idea that only a few people know what the definition of 'family' is.'
I agree with this wholeheartedly.
I think that the most important thing is that people are committed to each other, that people want to take responsibility for each other, that people want to care for each other, and I think that it is therefore absurd that we want to disrupt family life because there is a certain official signature missing.
You can also look at alternatives; how long people have been living together, for example.
There are alternatives; the most important thing is that people are committed to each other, that they have a family life.
Perhaps there is an official signature missing, but let us, as the European Union, see what we can do about it, not disrupt family life because there is a signature missing.
Madam President, both the rapporteur, Mr Santini, and the Commission applaud European citizenship.
This is now to be given concrete shape in the proposal to give EU citizens the right of free movement and residence.
This right is, and I quote: 'becoming an integral part of the legal heritage of every citizen of the European Union', according to the Commission.
Precisely what heritage does the Commission mean here?
I find this pronouncement just as surprising as the term 'European citizenship'.
Because a Dutch person can go and work in France more easily, he suddenly feels like a European citizen.
But no, he is still a Dutch person working in France.
From a practical point of view it is a good and even modernising proposal.
It will eliminate a lot of red tape and uncontrollable rules.
I think that there are two points on which I believe the Commission is encroaching too far on the Member States' decision-making authority.
Firstly in article 25, in which a host country is prohibited from issuing an expulsion order when the person concerned has obtained a permanent right of residence.
Then in article 30, paragraph 2, which states that a person may resubmit a request for admission no more than two years after expulsion.
That is really badly thought through.
I cannot support the amendments in the Santini report that extend the definition of partner and that tone down the Commission's amendments.
Madam President, we have been waiting for this directive on the free movement of persons for many, maybe too many years, and now it is here at last, we support it, it has our backing.
In actual fact, I have taken the floor not least in order to present to the rapporteur, both in words and on paper, the Transnational Radical Party's petition, signed by 1122 people of 30 different nationalities, who are calling for full respect for the free movement of persons within the European Union in order to eliminate discrimination against same-sex couples.
In this regard, I would like to say, in particular, to the rapporteur, Mr Santini, and Mr Pirker - who appears to see in some of the amendments and sections which have been included by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs the desire to use the directive on free movement to impose a single family model throughout Europe - that this accusation is unfounded, and the texts they adopted prove it.
What we are trying to do is not impose a single family model unduly but ensure that, with regard to the free movement of persons, with regard to European legislation, therefore, there is no difference in treatment, no discrimination on the basis of the fact that some couples are recognised to take a particular form, to be same-sex or heterosexual couples.
This is our request.
We do not think that in providing for the free movement of persons within the European Union we would automatically be introducing same-sex marriages throughout Europe, but if same-sex marriages are recognised in one country, when the same-sex couple moves to another country, its rights in terms of free movement - not in terms of all family rights - should be recognised.
This is the point, and that is why I am asking the Members of the other groups not to remove the phrase 'irrespective of sex'.
The objection has been raised that it is unnecessary, that it is superfluous.
We are not lawyers or barristers. We simply believe that this phrase, this expression should be preserved in the text.
If it then proves to be superfluous, so much the better.
Therefore: free movement irrespective of sex of persons who have entered into marriage or unmarried partnerships.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I highlighted in my report on European citizenship, which we adopted in plenary last September, recognising European citizenship has been a slow process that even today faces too many obstacles, with initiatives having to be carried out to ensure that the concept of European citizenship is fully implemented in its political, administrative, judicial, social and economic aspects.
I also recommended at that time that, in order to deal with the obstacles still hampering EU citizens' exercise of freedom of movement and residence, the proposal for a directive that we are discussing today should be adopted as rapidly as possible.
By reworking existing texts, this proposal attempted to introduce the much -needed streamlining by combining in a single legal instrument the right to free movement and residence in the European area, and enshrine, specifically, the right of permanent residence at the end of four years of continuous residence.
This is a welcome proposal.
The work of our rapporteur, Mr Santini - and very good work it is - has helped to introduce into this proposal a set of contributions that I believe are extremely positive.
There are, nevertheless, two areas that have already been mentioned in this debate, which still pose problems.
They concern the definition of the family, an excessively broad definition, which appears to seek to force national legislation to recognise the definition of an unmarried partner as a family member.
I believe that common sense would here dictate respect for national law and for the provisions laid down in each Member State.
This also applies to the excessively broad concept of family member, on which I think it would be more reasonable to uphold the current acquis for direct descendants and direct relatives in the ascending line, contrary, therefore, to the widening put forward in the proposal. This could lead to an enormous increase in the number of people requesting family reunification.
The widening of the definition proposed by Mr Santini is therefore acceptable on humanitarian grounds or on serious health grounds.
Madam President, I thank the rapporteur and the Commission for bringing forward this important report, dealing as it does in a sound way with significant matters.
We in this Parliament must endeavour to do all we can to make it easier for European citizens to move freely around the Union.
It is somewhat anomalous that, at the moment, it is easier to move goods or capital around the European Union than it is for European citizens to move around.
Mr Vitorino said at the beginning that free movement is subject to too many obstacles, and Mrs Buitenweg has just given some examples that make this obvious.
If the European Union is to move closer to the citizen, we have to make it much more of a common market for people than it is at the moment.
However, just as with business, in order for this to function efficiently there must be regulations.
For example, British pensioners retiring to Spain and others travelling from one country to another for work must be freed from unnecessary bureaucracy and excessive red tape.
If we are to meet our target of making the European Union the most competitive economy in the world by 2010, and make it as easy for EU citizens to move from one Member State to another, as it is for US citizens to move from one state to another in the United States, then we need a free flow of European nationals moving between countries to live and work.
This is about European citizens and their families being able to move around freely for work and to live; it is about teenagers getting residence permits in the country in which they have grown up.
However, there are aspects of this report which could be misinterpreted or abused.
That is why we need to build in a few extra clauses.
My own government is concerned to ensure that our efforts to facilitate freedom of movement for legitimate EU nationals do not open new channels that could be exploited by criminal gangs and others.
As we are all too aware, we live in a dangerous world.
There is a minority - albeit it a very small minority - of people who may want to exploit for illegal and violent purposes the freedom of movement that this report facilitates.
Therefore, we should not deny Member States the right to exclude people where there is a proven threat to national security.
We need a few other safeguards to protect people from the hazards of modern living.
I endorse what Mr Di Lello Finuoli said: the real issue is not whether people are married or with whom they are in a lasting relationship.
The Treaty guarantees the right of all citizens to family life and we, as a Parliament, are empowered to uphold this.
Others have spoken about this.
Legitimate and lasting partnerships should never be put under threat.
On the other hand, as a balance, perhaps we need to ensure that there are safeguards to discourage the small minority who might want to use marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry.
It is about free movement for people and freedom to live their lives as they wish: a free market for people, a common market for EU citizens and their families.
Madam President, this proposal finally delivers on the 50-year-old promise to allow EU citizens and their families to reside in another Member State.
It is great news for the cause of freedom.
But to listen to some, including 'conservatives' in the British Labour Government, you would think it was all about facilitating illegal immigration and terrorism.
It is time for this misinformed hysteria in the UK to stop.
There are sufficient safeguards in this measure and in EU law.
On the definition of family that EU citizens can take with them when they move, this must at least respect the law in the country of original residence.
Why should a Swedish gay registered partnership lose all recognition of status when they move, for instance, to Italy?
Governments, including the British one, are very happy to champion the mutual recognition principle in criminal penalties, including the European arrest warrant.
Let us also champion it for freedom and rights for people, including British people.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move freely and reside within the territory of the Member States results from the new legal and political state of affairs created by the introduction of citizenship of the European Union.
The various items of legislation currently in existence are to be replaced by a single act, conditions and formalities are to be changed, and what now needs to be clarified is which restrictions are to be permissible for reasons of public order, security and health.
What is under discussion is the rights of EU citizens and their family members.
In the deliberations in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we came up against the problem of defining what is meant by 'family members', and I gather from what I have heard this morning that we were not alone in doing so.
How, today, do we define the family?
Does 'family' mean father, mother, children, along with parents and grandparents?
Does 'family' include unmarried couples of whatever gender?
Here we find that the legal position varies from one Member State to another, and this, in my view, is where the Member States' subsidiarity must prevail.
At the same time, it strikes me that a European definition of the family is urgently needed; after all, it is what we have to work with.
Who will give security to the mother or father who brings up children and is therefore unable to take up employment that could provide them with evidence of their own secure income, if the working partner dies or leaves them?
In the case of residence for a period in excess of six months, they are still required to submit a declaration demonstrating their economic independence, but it is often the women whose economic-dependent status puts them in an unstable position.
This means that we need an independent legal status for spouses.
As I see it, a family exists when someone takes on the responsibility for educating someone else, providing for them, and caring for them.
Society has to give security to those who do this, who commit and bind themselves to doing this - and I do indeed include among them those who have signed a marriage certificate.
Madam President, I agree with the Commissioner that this is about citizenship of the European Union and it is crucial for the facilitation of the free movement of our citizens.
As you rightly say, Commissioner, everything else being equal, EU citizens should be able to move between Member States and the administrative burden should be reduced to that which is absolutely necessary.
I welcome in this report the wider definition of 'family' and the importance given to the consideration of humanitarian grounds in the application of this directive.
However, the wider definition of family will not be welcomed by all, and I do not share the UK Government's - my own Labour Government's - analysis of this directive.
On the wider definition, we must examine our prejudice and our firmly held beliefs.
This is about national citizenship and EU citizenship.
We must move forward at a pace which must not be dictated by the Member State least likely to reform.
The definition of 'spouse' may be clear according to the European Court of Justice, but it is up to us as legislators to redefine and to revisit definitions, especially in the light of modern family life and the diversity of durable and lasting relationships.
On that point, I stand here in a same-sex relationship of 20 years, yet my partner of 20 years would not be given the definition of family if he were to move with me to Brussels so I can do my work in the Parliament.
I am asked to pay the same taxes, to live by the same laws, but both I and my relationship - which cannot be recognised in the United Kingdom - are denied equality.
So, we encourage people either to enter into honest, durable relationships, or we encourage them to enter into marriages of convenience which would drive a coach and horses through this directive and all of its intentions.
This is either about the free movement of all of our citizens or it is not.
Baroness Ludford is absolutely right.
There should be a principle of mutual recognition here.
I ask the PPE-DE Group to join with us, to explore the possibilities and reach a sensible compromise with the Council, recognising the modern world and affording equal rights to all of our citizens, not equal rights for some.
The free movement of persons that we are discussing here is one of the core principles of the European Union, and it is odd that we are still having all manner of differences of opinion about it.
The present labour market and the opportunities for study and enjoying your retirement in a country other than the one you come from call for Europe to have flexible rules.
They should not hinder anyone unnecessarily.
It nevertheless looks as if the Commission wants to exclude a significant group of citizens from this right, namely those citizens who want to take their families with them to another country but who are unmarried or in a registered partnership that is not recognised in the other country.
For example, a French woman who is in a registered partnership cannot take the man or woman of her dreams with her to Italy because there is no such thing as a registered partnership there.
Mr Pirker says that is a minor detail; to me it looks like a disaster.
Even two men or two women who were married in the Netherlands or in Belgium cannot go to Greece together if one of them is going to work there.
Imagine what it must feel like.
In the Commission's proposal, family members can only accompany people going to another country if they are spouses in a heterosexual marriage or if they are unmarried partners and the host country equates these couples with married partners.
This approach, however, results in discrimination on the basis of nationality, something that was prohibited in the European Union a long time ago.
It is an odd matter that we have to fix.
A number of fellow MEPs and myself have therefore submitted amendments to introduce the system of mutual recognition in this area, and these have also been accepted in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
This system ensures that all possible forms of relationship are mutually recognised by the Member States.
Marriage, the registered partnership and also the de facto partnership - irrespective of their composition, in other words, irrespective of sex.
Incidentally, we are not only talking about same-sex couples; a growing number of men and women choose not to marry and prefer to cohabit but without losing all their rights.
Fortunately there are already eight Member States who enable their citizens to do so.
This freedom of choice must not, however, be lost when these citizens cross the border.
I am therefore pleased that the vast majority of this Parliament appears to support the application of the principle of mutual recognition in this area.
This is a big step forward and augurs well for the coming discussions with the Council.
So if that is the case, why does my group want to retain the phrase 'irrespective of sex'?
The reason for this is that our friends in the Group of the European People's Party have not been able to agree whether they are indeed willing to apply this principle of mutual recognition across the board, in other words including relationships, marriage relationships and non-marriage relationships between persons of the same sex from those countries where they are legally permitted.
To us, partial equality is no equality at all.
Given this doubt, there can be no harm in promoting the rights of homosexual men and women a little more in the meantime.
In that respect I can only underline what Mr Cashman said, and I therefore hope that our friends in the Group of the European People's Party will be able to take the chill out of the air in the next phase of this stage in the legislation.
Madam President, freedom of movement is the core of EC law.
We must turn freedom of movement into a reality within the EU.
I therefore welcome uniform regulations that may make it easier for people to move without difficulty between the various Member States of the EU.
Following enlargement, it will be still more important for the rules governing freedom of movement to be clear and simple so that all EU citizens, both new and old, are aware of their rights and of the rules that apply.
In order to encourage increased movement within the EU, we must begin by simplifying the rules.
The rules must also be generous.
I am therefore pleased that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has proposed rules that facilitate the freedom of movement of different family members.
I am especially pleased that this committee has proposed extending the concept of the family.
People who do not live in what, from a legal point of view, are traditional family structures must have the same right as married couples to live together in the countries of the EU.
They must be entitled to feel sure that the same rights apply to us all.
That is of course a challenge for many in the EU since it brings traditional thinking into question.
We must nonetheless accept that challenge and the opportunity it provides, precisely because we live in a common union and wish to create a common EU citizenship.
Ultimately, we are concerned here with respect and the equal value of every person.
The regulations governing family issues in the EU must be generous and non-discriminatory.
Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for his excellent report and confirm that the Commission will be able to incorporate the vast majority of the proposed amendments into our amended proposal, which we will present shortly.
Let me turn to the two controversial issues during this debate.
First of all, concerning Article 2 and the concept of family, one has to recognise that harmonising the conditions of residence for European Union citizens must not result in our imposing modifications on Member State legislation defining family status.
I understand this debate and the difficulty of, on the one hand, ensuring compatibility with Article 13 of the Treaty, which is the legal basis for combating discrimination, including discrimination against unmarried couples or same sex couples when, on the other hand, the Treaty excludes Family law from the scope of competences of the European Union.
In this very sensitive field, the Community must respect the developments introduced in Member State legislation and must be flexible in this.
There is no universal legal solution for this kind of de facto partnership or for registered partnerships or same sex marriages.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we should not exaggerate the extent of the practical difficulties that unmarried couples or same-sex couples encounter in exercising the right of residence.
In fact, when the two people are citizens of the European Union, they both enjoy the right of residence by virtue of Article 18 of the Treaty, independently of the nature of their relationship.
However, I recognise that the problem arises when one of them is a third-country national.
For the time being, the Commission's proposal is to define marriage with reference to the term 'spouse', and we do not seek to define this term.
In fact, at present, the legislation of only two Member States recognises union between persons of the same sex as marriage.
Under the case law of the Court of Justice, the term 'marriage' designates a union between persons of the opposite sex.
The Commission prefers, at the present stage, to follow the case law of the Court of Justice, and to use a formula that allows progressive interpretation of this concept on the basis of future developments in the legislation of Member States.
As regards unmarried partners, including registered partners, the Commission also considers that the recognition of these situations will have to be made by reference to the host Member State legislation.
I understand the argument of mutual recognition, but one has to be very careful when using it.
The recognition for the purpose of residence of unmarried partners on the basis of the legislation of Member States of origin could pose problems to those Member States whose family legislation does not recognise these possibilities.
In addition, the principle of non-discrimination requires that the host Member State treat unmarried couples of other Member States in the same way as its own nationals.
I believe therefore that everyone will agree, particularly in this field, that we should not create reverse discrimination.
That would be the actual outcome of such a proposal.
I will follow your deliberations tomorrow and the negotiations with Council very closely.
I am sure that all of you are aware of the difficulty of this debate and the different approaches of the Member States.
The rapporteur has suggested an amendment to Article 21 concerning equal treatment which aims to exclude inactive people from social assistance during the first six months rather, than the first four years of residence, until they acquire permanent rights of residence, as provided for in the Commission's proposals.
I am aware that the Commission's text needs to be adapted in the light of the recent judgment of the Court of Justice in this field, which stated that any citizen residing legally in another Member State must enjoy equal treatment with its nationals in matters of social welfare.
However, despite the fact that Mr Santini's amendment goes in the right direction, it is not possible to accept it in its current formulation as it is not completely in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Justice to which I have just referred.
The Commission considers it preferable to reconsider the proposal and to better scrutinise the content of the Court of Justice judgment.
We will bring forward an amended proposal as soon as possible.
