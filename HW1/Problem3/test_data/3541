Consequently, the Commission's old proposal, which in essence forms the basis for the Council's political agreement, does not serve the purpose of Article 93 because it tends to destabilise rather than consolidate the internal market.
However, as the Commission and the Council are determined to stand by their initial position, although they have no reason to do so, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has asked me to table a compromise proposal.
This proposal is as follows: the Council can adopt the Commission's initial ideas and Parliament will withdraw its opposition to them.
However, it will call for an alternative method of harmonising taxes.
This alternative will be based on a combination of minimum excise duty of 57% plus a minimum value added tax of 15% which, once the relevant mathematical formula has been applied, gives a harmonised tax of around 71%.
So what we propose is to introduce two methods of taxation and to allow the Member State in question to choose between them.
The pros of this solution are as follows: first, it will not push up prices and put the industry in certain Member States in the south at a disadvantage.
This is, of course, vital to the candidate countries, as I have already said.
Secondly, it will help to harmonise prices, in that we already had price convergence with the minimum 57% tax and it was the value-added tax which was causing the fluctuations.
Consequently, our new proposal does more for harmonisation than the Commission proposal.
Thirdly, it allows Member States to protect their small and medium-sized enterprises from distortions of competition caused by imposing a fixed tax.
And by shifting the focus away from price increases on cigarettes, these measures will discourage smuggling.
I think the Council should show courage and imagination, accept the two different versions and leave the final decision to the Member States.
I am positive that the new proposal, which I am confident my fellow Members will support, has so many advantages that the Member States will opt for it and we shall soon have just one system of harmonised taxation.
Allow me to finish, Commissioner and members of the Council, by saying that I, too, want to see smoking reduced.
But I do not think that we can do so by constantly hiking up prices.
Cigarettes are already extremely expensive in Europe and smoking shows no signs of abating.
Which is why I am against the amendments tabled by Members trying to support the anti-smoking campaign by raising prices.
I do not think the price mechanism can be used to achieve everything.
There is much that it can be used to achieve, but not everything, which is why I am against these proposals.
This is my compromise proposal to Parliament and I call on the Commission and the Council to take it seriously and not to look on it as a mere formality, because that would be insulting to Parliament.
Mr President, it is with some regret that I must disagree slightly with my colleague, Mr Katiforis.
I am speaking particularly on behalf of the UK PSE delegation in order to say that we will not be supporting this report for many of the reasons that Mr Katiforis has already outlined.
We do not accept the argument that price makes no difference to the amount of cigarettes consumed.
In fact, I have figures here from the UK, which show that a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes leads to a 4% decrease in consumption.
So there is a link between the cost of smoking and the amount that is actually smoked.
That is the case that the UK PSE delegation is making, particularly with regard to Amendments Nos 2 and 3 on reducing the excise duty below that set out in the original report.
It is important for Parliament to vote against this report, because very recently we adopted the tobacco directive, which, as we all know, took various public health measures to reduce smoking.
It therefore seems very inconsistent to adopt this report, which seeks to pass measures and form opinions which will, to some extent, go against the measures we have already taken on public health grounds.
That is not to say that we do not understand the issues raised about the applicant countries and about small and medium-sized tobacco producers.
If voting against this report has an effect on them, that is unfortunate and is not something that we would wish to see.
But when we are discussing tobacco we are talking about a product which is harmful to health wherever you happen to live, and that is the main argument.
This is a health measure rather than anything to do with production or with harmonising duty, though that we accept the latter as a principle.
I felt that I needed to explain our position and say why the UK PSE will be voting against this report later today.
Mr President, it is obvious to us, too, that increased prices lead to a drop in the consumption of tobacco products, particularly cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco.
The situation in the United States and Sweden, where excise is very high and consumption relatively low, illustrate this trend, as well as a study conducted by the World Bank.
In two previous resolutions from 1996 and 1997, the European Parliament left no doubt as to the fact that it is seeking an upward harmonisation of tobacco prices by means of increased excise duty.
As the Commission proposes in the explanatory note, the new minimum excise amount in euros for cigarettes is based on the average excise yield in the Member States, namely EUR 90 per 1 000 cigarettes and subsequently reduced to EUR 70 per 1 000 cigarettes in order to prevent the majority of the Member States from having to increase their excise duties.
It is, in this connection, once again worth mentioning that the excise yield in nine Member States is even more than EUR 70 per 1 000 cigarettes.
This is why my group is opposed to a further reduction.
In our view, Commissioner Bolkestein' s proposal is a big improvement on the current situation.
He already mentioned health aspects during previous discussions a few months ago.
We would like to further reinforce this aspect.
We have tabled a number of amendments, in conjunction also with Mr Blokland.
Firstly, there is the VAT issue in respect of which the rapporteur has submitted proposals which we support.
Secondly, we believe that this matter should be firmly placed in the context of existing negotiations in the World Health Organisation.
We are of the opinion that more should be done to combat differences in smuggling prices, since they form one of the reasons for fraud and smuggling, although they are not the only reason.
In our view, a system should be considered during the four-yearly review by means of which the use of more harmful products can be discouraged.
In the final analysis, and I am taking this opportunity to repeat what I have said before, it remains an unacceptable anomaly, on the one hand, to increase the excise duty on tobacco products, although partly for health reasons and, on the other hand, to continue to heavily subsidise tobacco growing in the European Union.
Mr President, there is no doubt that cigarettes seriously damage your health.
However, it is hypocrisy on the part of the Commission to maintain that it is helping to protect public health by introducing more taxes on tobacco products, which are a widely consumed product, when it leaves consumers at the mercy of very dangerous products in the food chain, imported tobacco products of dubious quality, and is pushing for health to be completely privatised.
One thing is for sure: increasing taxes - and hence the price to the consumer - will not reduce smoking.
Otherwise it would surely have happened by now.
What will happen if taxes are increased is that consumers on lower incomes will be forced to buy cheaper contraband cigarettes from third countries which are possibly even more damaging to their health.
In other words, smuggling will increase, not decrease, as the Commission maintains.
The proposed measures will increase the cost of living at a time when consumers' wages are constantly being eroded by the policy of the European Union.
The campaign against smoking and the campaign against tobacco cultivation in the European Union have become one and the same and we are against that.
The campaign against smoking benefits consumers' health, while the campaign against tobacco cultivation benefits large-scale producers and industry, mainly in the USA, to the detriment of tobacco farmers and processors in southern Europe.
That is precisely why we are against abolishing or even reducing tobacco-farming subsidies, as many would have us do.
That would wipe out tobacco farming in the European Union, which would then be wholly dependent on imported cigarettes.
These are just some of the reasons why we are against any form of additional excise because, as I have already said, it does nothing to protect public health; in fact, it may well have the opposite effect.
Finally, we suggest that revenue from tobacco taxes should be used to fund education, preventive measures and centres where smokers can kick the habit and obtain treatment.

Thank you, Mr President, we all seek clarity, including clarity in the policy on tobacco products and the excise duty that applies to them, excise yields which are largely used to combat the negative effects tobacco consumption has on health.
Unfortunately, Mr Katiforis' s report lacks this required clarity.
However, the report has made it clear that the rapporteur wants to protect the interests of the tobacco industry, and particularly in those countries where products are also available at low prices.
The rapporteur' s approach serves the interests of the cigarette industry and not the interests of the citizen.
It is therefore very disappointing to note that the rapporteur confines himself to amending the Commission proposal where the level of excise duty is concerned without giving a reasoned consideration.
This consideration is something which the European Commission itself does give with regard to increasing excise duty, namely in terms of promoting a well functioning internal market and discouraging smoking by pursuing a consistent and convincing policy.
This is underlined in the amendments I have tabled together with Mr Maaten.
In the past, Parliament has in two resolutions clearly called for an upward fiscal harmonisation of excise on tobacco.
The claim that the increase in excise would encourage smuggling is not proven.
Quite the reverse, in fact, smuggling practices occur precisely in those areas where tobacco products are cheap.
However, research has shown that the increase in tobacco prices encourages people to quit smoking and deters non-smoking young people from taking up the habit.
It will be to the credit of Parliament if the amendments that I have tabled together with Mr Maaten are adopted.
Finally, I should like to note once again that, sadly, one billion euros' worth of tobacco subsidies still go up in carcinogenic smoke.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the United States - a country which has achieved the most striking results in curbing cigarette consumption - the incidence of taxation in relation to price is much lower than in all the European countries, even those with the lowest excise duty levels.
I feel that this is a benchmark we must not disregard.
There is another factor that we must not lose sight of.
The British Member said that increasing prices leads to a reduction in cigarette consumption, and this is evidence to prove it.
However, what happened in Italy is that an increase in cigarette prices brought about by an increase in taxation did indeed reduce the consumption of cigarettes sold on official markets but only because it greatly increased the consumption of contraband cigarettes.
This is especially true in that cigarette smuggling takes place not between European countries with differing excise duty levels - and we would point out that excise duties in the United States vary from State to State - but from outside Europe to inside Europe: cigarettes are smuggled from Montenegro across the Adriatic and by this route to the whole of Europe.
Moreover, we will be in danger of exacerbating this phenomenon of criminal, mafia smuggling if we continue to pursue this policy of increasing excise duties.
The positive results obtained in terms of public health in the United States - I want the Members to understand this - were pursued and achieved by applying lower rates of excise duty than in Europe.
Mr President, I will make a few brief and concise observations.
I fully agree with what the rapporteur said about the legislative procedure, the role of Parliament and the need for loyal cooperation between the institutions.
I also agree with the rapporteur on his modifications to the Commission' s basic proposals.
The Commission proposes a special tax, an abscissa of 50% with a threshold of 70%.
Mr Katiforis proposes, firstly, to reduce this threshold to EUR 60 - a proposal which my group agrees with - and secondly, to offer the States which this directive is aimed at an alternative option: to apply the rate of 71%, including within this rate both special taxes and valued-added tax.
I believe this is an innovative and important approach which respects the principle of price proportionality, which to a certain extent puts an end to the minimum threshold, and introduces a degree of clarity into indirect taxation.
The accumulation of indirect taxes and value-added tax have been repeatedly condemned by this Parliament and this option - to establish a combined minimum level for the two taxes - seems to me to be a good solution.
I also agree with the rapporteur that price plays a part in dissuading people from smoking, but it is not the only method, and we therefore expect the Commission to send us supplementary proposals soon, aimed at putting an end to this habit.
I also agree that the price increase in coastal and border countries may lead to an increase in fraud.
I would ask the Commission to strengthen the cooperation procedures in order to eradicate fraud, which is one of the elements that erodes indirect taxation, especially here, but we will talk about that later with Mr Bolkestein, in relation to the Kauppi report.
Congratulations, Mr Katiforis.
On this occasion you can count on the support of my group.
Mr President, we feel that the Katiforis report on the proposal for a directive on the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco products is a good compromise on the Commission and Council' s proposal.
Indeed, adopting the Commission' s proposal, we would ultimately have made the legislation too inflexible and created great difficulties, particularly for the manufacturing sector, with the result that the cost of national production - especially in southern Europe - would have increased and its quality decreased.
There would also be an increase in smuggling, as has already been pointed out. In particular, we feel that the idea of a fixed amount minimum excise tax on cigarettes, as proposed, would not have protected - or rather, would have compromised - equality in the field of competition between very large and small and medium-sized tobacco companies, thus leading to distortion of the principle of competition.
In our opinion, Mr Katiforis' report focuses on three goals.
Firstly, the goal of tax harmonisation - it proposes a rate of 71% - in that VAT rates are made subject to a common rule for we are imposing a total tax for the first time: excise duties plus VAT; by taking this line, we will achieve greater convergence and avoid indiscriminate price increases and penalising the manufacturing industries of the Member States of southern Europe.
Secondly, the goal of combating fraud and smuggling.
Thirdly, it also achieves the aim of greater prevention of health risks, which is not obtained through continually increasing taxation but, we feel, especially through specific investment in research too.
Lastly, we feel that the position on cigars and cigarettes as presented in the Katiforis report is more convincing in that it also avoids potential employment slumps, thus safeguarding the principles laid down in Article 127 of the Treaty.
Therefore, Mr Katiforis, the Italian members of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, European republicans, democrats, Italy of Values members and liberal socialists will support your report.
Mr President, 22% of all cigarettes purchased in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are smuggled into the country.
In the year 2000 smuggling of tobacco caused losses of GBP 3.8 million to the British Exchequer.
Her Majesty's Customs and Excise have been able to cut the cross-Channel bootlegging of tobacco by an impressive 76% since March 2000.
The bootleggers are up in arms at this, but now, with the Commissioner announcing his intention to take action against the United Kingdom for creating barriers to the free movement of goods, the door could be opened even wider to give smuggling an even greater field day.
The cheap smuggled tobacco has produced new smokers among the young people in the United Kingdom.
That is a tragedy.
It has also threatened the few remaining jobs in the British tobacco industry.
The British tobacco industry should have an even playing field with the tobacco manufacturers in the rest of the European Union and should not be penalised.
Mr President, I and my delegation of British Conservatives welcome the rejection of the Commission's proposal in the previous vote in Parliament, and we regret the current proposal to accept the Commission's proposal, which is flawed.
We will be supporting a number of Mr Katiforis' amendments because they make a bad proposal rather better.
However, overall, we cannot give our support to this proposal because we do not believe in the upwards harmonisation of tobacco taxes.
Tax is a matter for nation-states, for domestic governments, and should remain the preserve of domestic governments, which are democratically elected and democratically accountable, tax being one of the most fundamental aspects of nationhood and statehood.
In addition, we are by no means convinced by the health arguments on smoking and tax.
We are increasingly concerned that ever-spiralling levels of tax on cigarettes may lead to increased smuggling.
Such illegal smuggling of cigarettes from outside the European Union is now causing a great deal of concern and may lead to an increase in smoking, certainly in my constituency and much of the United Kingdom.
So the health issues in favour of high tobacco taxes are not clear cut but, even more importantly, we do not believe in the upward harmonisation of excise duties or, in particular, the upward harmonisation of tobacco taxes.
Hence, we will be opposing the Commission's proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, smoking is dangerous both for people who smoke and for those in their vicinity.
Even those who are not even born are harmed by the fact that their mothers or fathers smoke.
Smoking is therefore very much a public health issue.
We must therefore do everything to prevent people from starting smoking.
I know what I am talking about, Mr Katiforis, for I, myself, have been a smoker.
The words 'public health' do not even appear in the report.
Mr Katiforis is a very intelligent and agreeable fellow MEP, but even intelligent MEPs are occasionally wrong.
This time, Mr Katiforis is wrong.
There is a lot of evidence to show that higher cigarette prices reduce the level of smoking.
Less tobacco is consumed, and fewer young people begin smoking.
In my country, the Public Health Institute has calculated that the one-off effect of the increase in cigarette prices in 1997 was to save 12 500 people from premature death, thanks to the fact that 100 000 people gave up smoking when cigarettes became more expensive.
We are talking here simply about my own country, Sweden, which has only 9 million inhabitants.
As is well known, taxes in Sweden are, moreover, significantly higher than in the EU generally.
The arguments are therefore in favour of our being obliged to accept the Commission' s proposals.
However, I do not believe it is sensible for the EU to support tobacco cultivation at the same time as great efforts are being made to prevent smoking and reduce the spread of cancer.
We must be a little more consistent and not engage too much in double standards.
I therefore hope that Parliament will support Mr Maaten' s amendment and, through it, the Commission' s proposal too, albeit in a somewhat stricter form.
Mr President, I belong to the majority in this House that rejected the Commission's proposal in November, and I would actually have been quite happy to have left it at that, but now we are confronted by a second report that we have to vote on.
Unfortunately, the Commission is sticking to its plan to raise the minimum rates of excise duties.
Today's are on tobacco; according to my information, the Commission wants to introduce a proposal to increase excise duties and to abolish the zero rate on wine, even though it is a proven fact that wine drinkers are more intelligent and less prone to weakness of mind in old age.
What else the Commission plans to cook up the day after tomorrow, I do not know.
This proposal will not achieve the objective set for it, that is, the progressive convergence of excise duties in the internal market, and puts an unnecessary question mark against the balanced compromise achieved in 1992 under Luxembourg's Presidency between supporters of proportional and specific taxation.
If this hapless proposal from the Commission were to be implemented, there would also be a massively greater risk of smuggling, especially in the countries of the South and in post-enlargement Central Europe, because the price of cigarettes there would increase by between 200% and 500%.
As far as the campaign against tobacco consumption is concerned, which has to be pressed into service in justification of the Commission's exorbitant proposal, I can only reiterate that there is no proof whatever that cigarette prices slow down tobacco consumption. Far from it, smoking then even becomes a status symbol.
In view of these considerations, I reject the Commission's proposal.
The amendments introduced by our rapporteur, leaving it to Member States to choose between excise duty at EUR 60 per thousand cigarettes and excise duty plus VAT of 71% of the price, represent the lesser evil, and, politics being the art of the possible, I will, of course, follow the rest of my group in voting for Mr Katiforis' report with full conviction.
Mr President, the new report brings the positions of the Commission and Parliament closer to each other and I welcome the efforts made by Mr Katiforis in that respect.
His report now proposes to approve the Commission proposal subject to two amendments.
The first amendment concerns the taxation of cigarettes and offers Member States a choice between two taxation systems.
The Commission is, however, of the opinion that this will lead to less rather than more harmonisation of tobacco taxation.
The option proposed would not oblige any Member State to change its level of taxation and would even make it possible for a number of Member States, including Member States applying relatively low tax levels, to lower their rates.
This would be in clear contradiction to health policy objectives, as has been pointed out by Mrs Honeyball this morning.
For this reason, the Commission cannot accept this first amendment.
Moreover, it feels that one of the reasons why it is proposed - in particular the need to conserve the balance between specific and percentage taxation - is already taken into account in its proposal.
As I explained previously, Member States affected by the introduction of the fixed amount in euro retain the flexibility they enjoy at present to determine the proportion of the specific and ad valorem components of cigarette taxation.
To justify the amendment, the report also points to the situation of candidate countries, for which the minimum duty level should be an achievable objective.
But offering them a choice between two taxation systems after accession would leave us with a wide gap between their tax and price levels and the tax and price levels of the present Member States, resulting in substantial revenue loss for present Member States.
The Commission is aware that achieving the amounts in euro will require a significant effort from most candidate countries and has therefore proposed to the Council that limited transitional periods should be granted to candidate countries to reach the minimum rate of taxation.
The second amendment rejects the change in the definition of cigars and cigarillos.
However, the Commission remains of the view that products having the characteristics of cigarettes should also be taxed as cigarettes.
That change was requested by a number of Member States and has the unanimous support of all the others.
It has also received substantial support from the cigars and cigarillo industry.
I would also like to comment upon the two other amendments adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The first one suggests adding a new recital, calling upon the Commission to submit proposals to eliminate fraud and smuggling.
The Commission shares the view that rate harmonisation in itself will not eliminate fraud and also that other measures are required to combat fraud and smuggling.
However, this does not need to be re-emphasised.
A number of initiatives to combat fraud in the sector of excise products, have already been launched following the 1996 report of a High Level Group on fraud in the alcohol and tobacco sector.
The most recent example is the Commission proposal of 19 October 2001 for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on computerising the movement and surveillance of excise products.
It will be more appropriate to discuss the issue of fraud, which is a general issue relevant to all excise products, within the context of this proposal.
The second amendment concerns the upper limit of the euro amount proposed by the Commission and suggests lowering the amount from EUR 100 to EUR 85.
The motivation of the amendment is that EUR 85 is easier to achieve than EUR 100 for the applicant countries, which today apply excise duty levels between EUR 6 and EUR 24.
I would point out that this upper limit is not relevant to applicant countries.
It is only relevant for Member States already applying a very high amount of duty but which, in spite of this, do not meet the 57% minimum.
In conclusion, I can say that the Commission sees this report as a step forward in comparison with the first report, as it endorses the need for enhanced approximation of rates of excise duty.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Mr President, once again it was quite impossible to hear the Commissioner's winding-up speech.
It is totally unfair to our Commissioners who come here to address us after they have listened to our speeches.
I wonder whether, at the start of this two-and-a-half years of your presidency, you might consider a five-minute break between the end of business and Members coming into this Chamber, because we cannot continue in this way, showing this discourtesy to our Commissioners.
Mr Corrie, your point is well made.
Your suggestion is one possibility.
We also need to ask the huissiers to ensure that when Members enter the Chamber they are not engaged in conversation.
Conversations are for outdoors.

( After the vote on the Commission proposal)
Mr President, I wish to express the Commission's disappointment that the vote has gone against its wishes.
The only thing that remains for me to do is to bring the result of this vote to the attention of the Commission, which will take due account of it and inform Parliament accordingly.
Mr President, I have asked for the floor, when you have given it to the Commission, to say that what we have just rejected in this House is Mr Oostlander' s report, not the Commission' s proposal.
We do not have the power to vote on the Commission' s proposal.
We have rejected the report by Mr Oostlander, together with his opinion of the Commission' s proposal.
You are quite correct.
That is what I declared - that the report, as amended, was not adopted.
The procedure that now takes place, if the Commission does not withdraw the proposal, is that we refer it back to the committee responsible without voting on the draft legislative resolution.

Report (A5-0011/2002) by von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the implementation of financial services legislation (2001/2247(INI))
Before the vote on Paragraph 13:
Firstly, I would like to congratulate the new President of Parliament personally. I hope that he will have the patience to listen to me as the previous President used to.
I have to tell you that I took part in the work of the Conciliation Committee establishing the working hours of mobile workers performing road transport activities.
I discussed the matter with my friend, Mr Ugo Gustinetti from Alzano Lombardo in the province of Bergamo, who has worked as a driver all his life, and he said to me: 'What is much more important than rules is that there should be genuine monitoring of driving time' .
Therefore, I propose that the Galileo satellite system should be used to monitor all the vehicles moving in the European Union from the sky.
Mr President, I wish to make an oral statement on the vote on the directive on working time in the road transport sector.
My delegation welcomes the adoption of the directive.
The improvement of road safety in general and greater protection for crew are both matters for concern across the whole of Europe and must therefore be regulated on an EU-wide basis.
The latest events in connection with the hauliers' scandal in Luxembourg and in my homeland, Austria, have shown that there is much wrong in the transport sector.
The plenary's adoption in January of the proposed regulation introducing an attestation for drivers was a proper indication of the desire to get the better of the illegal employment of third-country nationals.
The directive that the plenary has adopted today represents another important step.
The requirement to adhere to rest breaks and the laying down of maximum and night work times are making their contribution to safety on Europe's roads.
It is for that reason that we voted for the adoption of the directive.
It is, however, regrettable and disturbing that self-employed lorry drivers have not, for the time being, been included in the scope of the directive.
That is a problem.
It will probably give rise to new forms of pseudo self-employment.
- (PT) The result achieved by the Conciliation Delegation is very positive and represents a very significant achievement for the European Parliament.
By adopting this directive on the organisation of the working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities, we will eliminate distortions to competition within the sector and at the same time promote road safety.
I welcome, in particular, the agreement achieved on the central issue of this directive: the inclusion of self-employed workers.
Including these workers within the scope of the directive seven years after its entry into force and the possibility of the Commission undertaking a study of the consequences of the exclusion of self-employed drivers, to be carried out two years before the end of that seven-year period, have proven to be a useful and balanced formula for overcoming the resistance of some Member States and thereby obtaining the agreement that is crucial to the adoption of this new directive, which is of vital importance to the common transport policy.
The definition of a self-employed driver put forward in the directive also makes a valuable contribution to preventing the creation of new forms of false self-employment during the period of temporary exclusion of self-employed drivers.
With regard to the hours of night work, guarantees are provided for the competitiveness of the outermost countries, whose drivers have to travel long distances in order to reach the main centres of production and distribution, travelling at night when traffic is less heavy.
The outcome of the agreement between Parliament and the Council, therefore, represents an appropriate balance between the economic aspects and road safety and the health of workers.
. I am a supporter of the general principles involved in regulating working time, for the benefit of workers in terms of health and safety considerations and, in the case of road transport, for the road safety/accident prevention benefits that will be achieved.
I do believe that regulations of this nature must balance the acknowledged benefits against the practical realities faced by transport operators, especially in rural and island areas where no viable alternative to road transportation exists.
The concession on limitation to night working is important to Scotland, where long road distances are unavoidable and where transport operators already suffer such disincentives as high fuel taxation and relatively poor road networks in many areas.
Rapport Ghilardotti (A5-0026/2002)
Mr President, Mrs Ghilardotti has documented the debate on the directive on consulting and informing workers in an excellent report, which I support.
Moreover, I was sure she would do a good job, for Mrs Ghilardotti was Chairman of the regional council of Lombardy, the largest region in Italy, when I was a regional councillor, and this document will certainly help workers to take part in the life of the undertaking they depend on for a living.
However, I would like to ask Mrs Ghilardotti, who, I regret, does not appear to be in the Chamber at the moment but who, I am sure, will read my explanation of vote, whether we cannot manage to achieve a directive which would require workers always to be informed of their pension rights as well.
. This directive will give valuable protection to many employees whose livelihoods are at risk, in particular due to the increasing ease with which companies relocate.
It will not, of course, stop job losses but it will prevent situations from arising where employees read that they are being made redundant in the newspaper.
It will also enable preparations for large-scale job losses to be made if they are inevitable.
It does not adversely affect the 97% of companies with fewer than 50 workers that fall outside the terms of the directive.
This final agreement is certainly not as strong as the Green/EFA Group wanted.
Nevertheless, we will support the agreement because it is a major step forward in some states like the UK, which currently has no such protection for workers.
We saw this in my constituency, Wales, when Corus made 3,000 steelworkers redundant, with disastrous effects on many communities and no prior consultation with the workforce.
The six-year exemption unfortunately shows that the UK Government has learned nothing from that experience and workers in Wales will continue to be amongst the most vulnerable in Europe to job losses.
I hope it will not take six years before all workers in Europe enjoy the same rights.
. A stark example of the need for improvement and the establishment of a common European framework for informing and consulting employees is occurring in my home area at this moment.
A long established multi-national company - Levi-Strauss - recently gave advance notice of redundancy in relation to workers at two factories in Scotland, at Bellshill and Dundee.
The news media were informed first, and the announcement was accompanied by a statement explaining that the company had unilaterally considered and rejected any possible alternative to closure.
This type of action is deplorable, not helped by the fact that the UK is seen as having the weakest legislation in this area.
I therefore welcome and support moves towards a reasonable EU-wide standard for proper consultation with workers.
Rapport Oostlander (A5-0460/2001)
Mr President, I too voted against Mr Oostlander' s report, but this does not mean that I am against combating drug traffickers.
We all agree that it is right to fight to eradicate the scourge of drugs from the face of the earth - not just from European territory - but if we do not restore our young people' s faith in values, including the values of politics, we will never succeed.
Therefore, when will we decide, for example, to remove from bookshops a book by a certain Italian journalist named Mario Giordano, entitled 'L' unione fa la truffa' [The Union is a fraudster]?
It is unacceptable to sell books entitled 'L' unione fa la truffa' in European bookshops.
I call upon the Presidency to take the necessary measures.
. I have been on record many times before and I would reiterate this call today that soft and synthetic drugs should not be legalised in Europe.
I do not support the legalisation of ecstasy, cannabis or other synthetic drugs such as LSD or amphetamines.
The UN Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs prohibits the use, manufacture and distribution of ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines and this policy position must be fully upheld.
I would like to say for the record that I did not register my vote today because there was a wholescale misuse of language put forward in various amendments which sought to fully confuse the key elements of the debate today.
It is undeniably the fact that the use of these drugs causes damage to the user' s health.
They can hardly be perceived as providing a positive function.
I believe that the World Health Organisation has taken the correct approach on this issue.
We cannot and must not support the creation of a drugs culture in our society by legally permitting the use of soft and synthetic drugs.
For example, some people have put forward the proposition that ecstasy use should be deemed quite normal in society.
I abhor this particular line of argument particularly in light of the fact that there has been a number of tragic deaths in Ireland and across Europe from the use of ecstasy.
The long-term effects of the use of ecstasy are still very much unknown, other than we know that ecstasy is still a drug that can cause depression and memory impairment.
While the European economy is performing strongly, we must also ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are combated in a society.
European initiatives to reduce the level of drug abuse in Europe must be supported at every opportunity.
I do believe that the European Social Fund has played a key role in this regard in the past and must continue to do so.
- (NL) Those who organise international trafficking in hard drugs are only concerned with making money on the back of the suffering of others.
Proposals not only to lock these criminals up but also to strip them of their profits receive my support.
Without these profits, they have no motive for continuing their harmful trade.
Unfortunately, Mr Oostlander argues that, within his group, he is not one for splitting hairs in order to fight the thirteen amendments from the Left.
Those amendments focus on organised cross-border crime, national competences and the consideration of therapeutic and personal use.
In addition, he makes no secret of the fact that, in his view, the proposals are minimal, and he hopes that they will be further tightened up in future.
Some see his proposals as a way of opening the door to ruthlessly combating the production, transport and use of soft drugs.
This would lead to the criminalisation of the users, who would then need to make their purchases from criminals who trade in hard drugs.
With regard to those amendments, I consider whether they contribute to the discouragement of soft drugs in a way similar to that employed in connection with other harmful, but legal, stimulants, such as alcohol and tobacco.
The rejection of the improvements by the Left necessitates my rejecting the entire package, unfortunately including a few sound proposals made by the rapporteur.
. I wholeheartedly applaud the efforts to standardise the meaning of and define the penalties for drug trafficking.
Essentially, this report represents a balanced, far-reaching, sensible and tough approach to a perennial problem which besets all Member States of the EU.
For too long, the terms and conditions of what constitutes a drug trafficking offence have been too woolly, thereby creating serious pockets of crime in some parts of the world and within the EU.
An additional welcome measure is the standardisation of penalties, with prison sentences with a maximum term of no less than five years.
Once this law becomes enforceable, it should act as a real deterrent.
Fines should only be used as an additional measure to prison sentences since otherwise they could lead to the belief that you can somehow pay your way out of a criminal offence.
Lastly, I welcome the nuanced approach that the report takes vis-Ã -vis mitigating circumstances.
For example, minors and those who have committed offences under physical duress, should clearly not be subject to the same penalties as all offenders.
Report Ludford (A5-0436/2001)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we naturally welcome the proposal for a Council directive which is totally in line with the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions, which stressed the need to finally put in place a policy for integrating third-country nationals.
Having said that, we could not support the report. We regret that the proposal does nothing more than set out the conditions governing the residence of third-country nationals and that it does not, in any shape or form, establish a genuine European status for third-country nationals comparable to that of EU citizens.
By the same token, family members must enjoy the same rights as the person they are joining.
Yet, the way in which it is presented in the report, the right to live a normal family life, which is internationally recognised, does not take into account certain fundamental laws.
Although the right to vote was, in principle, adopted in part, the conditions of application are not mentioned.
Political rights are, however, an integral part of any integration policy.
Fundamental rights are universal and if the universality of rights must be applied without exception, it should also apply to everyone, whether or not they are EU citizens.
As for the criteria regarding resources and evaluating the stability of resources, would it not be better to offer all residents access to the labour market, rather than to confine some of them to exclusion?
Furthermore, there is no reason why students or persons that have been granted residence with subsidiary protection should be excluded from the scope of the proposal.
Firstly, however, the concepts of public order and security, which are reasons for excluding persons from permanent status, require a common definition.
Yet these concepts are now left to the discretion of the States or the competent authorities, which gives rise to serious discrimination, particularly towards third-country nationals.
Lastly, with regard to procedures, the examination process takes six months, which is far too long.
If the application is refused, a redress period, which does not exist, should be provided and this must have a suspensory effect, enabling any attempt at the expulsion of the person to be blocked, in the name of the right to self-defence.
My final point is that the directive does not cover the millions of third-country nationals who are residing illegally, but who urgently need a political solution from Europe.
The Union must therefore shoulder its responsibilities.
To sum up, this report does not promote equality between citizens of the Union and citizens of third countries.
The European status of a long-term resident does not exist.
We must not therefore sanction this type of political approach.
Mr President, Baroness Ludford' s report calls upon us to facilitate the movement within Europe of citizens who wish to stay here for at least three months of a six month period.
The Pensioners' Party is for this and is pleased to see citizens of any other State travelling within Europe.
In this regard, however, I feel we should distinguish between citizens who come to visit Europe with honest, noble intentions - Baroness Ludford belongs to the nobility so she, better than anyone, can understand that nobility must be valued - and the honest citizen is noble, and citizens with ignoble intentions.
In other words, an open doorway for the new nobility of honest citizens but doors closed to the delinquents who, I am sad to say, are to be found everywhere, just like black sheep.
The nobility, however, the new nobility of people with noble intentions, must be allowed to enter Europe.
- (DA) The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in the European Parliament has abstained from voting in favour of the overall report because we are unable to support Article 5(1) of the Commission' s proposal.
- (PT) This proposal for a directive has my vote because it represents a major step forwards and makes a valuable contribution to the creation of a more coherent Community policy in the field of immigration.
It is an attempt to define the status of long-term resident, because we all recognise the need for the European Union to reach a compromise on harmonising the situation of citizens of third countries residing legally and permanently in a Member State, in which they must be guaranteed legal, economic and social rights on a par with those enjoyed by the Union' s own citizens.
This status will be obtainable after five continuous years of legal residence, at the request of the interested party, who must have financial resources and sickness insurance, so that he or she does not become a burden on the Member State, and as long as the applicant' s behaviour poses no threat to public order or to domestic security.
On the other hand, once this status has been granted, the individual will be guaranteed a set of rights, such as the right to work, to education, social security, healthcare and access to goods and services, etc., thereby making this a real instrument for integration into the society in which the individual lives.
It is worth emphasising once again the importance of creating a more energetic policy for integration, which is crucial to promoting greater economic and social cohesion and to preventing discrimination and racism.
Nevertheless, we must also stress the fact that genuine integration requires efforts on both sides.
Furthermore, I welcome the series of procedural guarantees established in this proposal for immigrants who are anxious to be granted this status and which will enable us to prevent potential abusive behaviour by the competent authorities of the Member States.
We voted against the Ludford report, which supports the Commission' s proposal to establish a single status for third-country nationals, who have been legally residing in one of the EU countries for more than five years.
In our view, this idea is fundamentally flawed, as it will make the existing status uniform and more rigid, and deprive each Member State of any margin for manoeuvre in an area - namely, the presence of long-term foreign residents on its territory - which must, first and foremost, remain a matter for the national sovereignties.
Secondly, we cannot give this proposal a legal basis without distorting the meaning of Article 63(3) and (4) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which only provides for 'measures' regarding residence and not a 'status' in the full meaning of the word.
It is true, however, that if the Treaty of Amsterdam had not been ratified, the weaknesses that the Commission is now exploiting would not exist.
Lastly, we are seeing once again that, in practice, the Commission is using the concept of status as a lever to grant long-term resident third-country nationals (including refugees as well, for good measure) rights that are virtually equal to those of national citizens.
Article 12 of the proposal for a directive lists the areas where equal treatment would be de rigueur, in other words, almost all of them, except the right to vote.
This systematic equality is unjustified; although foreigners clearly have a right to receive benefits in return for having paid social security contributions, each nation must have the freedom of choice to decide whether to grant benefits that are funded from tax contributions.
We wonder whether this desperate attempt to achieve equal treatment for all is one of the profound causes of the disaffection towards citizenship that is currently evident in our countries.
We are in favour of full equal rights, including political rights, for everyone living and working in the European Union, whether citizens of a Member State or third-country nationals.
The proposal for a Council directive sets itself a different objective altogether; amongst others, that of increasing the mobility and flexibility of the immigrant workforce within the European Union.
Nonetheless, the proposal makes several improvements - which we have voted for - to the status of persons who originate from third countries and who are residing in the European Union.
That said, the proposal aims to limit even these few improvements to long-term residents only, which we cannot adopt.
It is even more difficult for us to adopt most of Parliament' s amendments, which further restrict the original text and have no other aim than to pander to nationalist, sovereign or xenophobic prejudices.
We shall not vote against this text, because, in many ways, it improves the situation of certain third-country nationals who live and work in the European Union.
But we refuse to give our backing to the numerous restrictions that it contains.
We therefore abstained on the whole text, rejecting the particular amendments - that is, most of them - that would make the original text worse.
It is a pleasure and a joy to see our fellow Member Baroness Ludford back at work.
Since she was appointed a senior human rights specialist at the European Parliament, we can only remember the emblematic report that we voted on last March, which was dedicated to the fight against racism and xenophobia.
She threw all her belief and all her effort into the task so that she would succeed in impressing upon us her passionate belief in 'anti-racism' .
Today, thanks to her impressive resilience, she has not disappointed; the active integration of third-country nationals will be achieved more quickly and to a greater extent and will be a useful weapon in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
Baroness Ludford has reassured us and put our minds at rest.
Her report is therefore presented as a list of duties.
Duties that are, of course, reserved exclusively for the people of Europe.
Therefore, third-country nationals who have been residing in an EU country for more than five years shall automatically acquire the status of long-term resident.
The administration has mandatory powers to issue the resident permit which is valid for ten years and is automatically renewable (Articles 8 and 9 of the directive).
Once the status has been granted, Member States can only withdraw it under very restricted and specific circumstances.
The legal certainty of the holder must be as high as possible.
The holder can therefore be absent for a period of more than two years without having his long-term resident status withdrawn.
The host Member State is obliged to grant to third-country nationals and their families, under the right to family reunion, the same rights as those granted to nationals, whether this is in terms of education, professional training, social protection, social assistance or tax.
They can also enjoy additional welfare benefits, such as economic or cultural benefits, in order to enable them to integrate completely.
To complete the picture, obtaining this status must constitute the first step towards being granted the nationality of the Member State in which they reside.
This objective will fulfil the desire that Parliament has voiced on numerous occasions to see a multiracial, multicultural society flourish within the Community, where there could be no discrimination on grounds of race, gender, ethnic origin, religion etc.
We are greatly looking forward to seeing Baroness Ludford welcome with open arms the several thousand refugees from Sangatte who are hoping to settle in England.
Home, sweet home!
- (NL) If the measures for residents and visitors from outside had not been prepared before 11 September 2001, they would probably have been subject to a long delay due to the new fear of terrorism and lack of security.
It is high time we tore down the last vestiges of statutory discrimination against a large proportion of our population.
This discrimination affects people who, mainly in the 1960s, were attracted as 'guest workers' from Turkey or Morocco to come and fill the most unpleasant and worst paid jobs.
Initially, their permanent residence was not taken into consideration by the six Member States of the then European Communities.
After 40 years, many of these people from the first generation of migrants still do not have the nationality of their country of residence.
For these people, there was no European unity for years.
Unlike people with the nationality of a Member State, they were required to continue to comply with visa obligations in each separate Member State which they crossed in order to spend a holiday in their country of origin.
The fact that they are now afforded more equal rights is unfortunately not so much the effect of indignation about the discrimination against them as it is a way of building one large European super state and of demonstrating that the old national borders have largely become defunct.
- (DA) I have abstained from voting in the final vote on this report.
I have done so because Denmark has a reservation in this area and not because I disagree with the intention behind the report or the directive.
I would emphasise that I am in favour of giving rights to third-country nationals when they accept work in another EU country.
Rapport Kessler (A5-0455/2001)
Mr President, this directive is not unlike the previous, noble directive of Baroness Ludford. As I see it, it discusses the possibility of movement, particularly for unemployed people who come to Europe to seek work - which is good - but also for pensioners and elderly people who wish to see the beautiful sights of our Europe.
As representative of the Pensioners' Party, I would like to take this opportunity to call upon Parliament, in addition to allowing the movement of people who wish to visit our beautiful European countries, to do everything possible to make it easier for those elderly people who have worked for a lifetime and now, at last, have the time to dedicate to healthy, intelligent, educational, cultural travel round the beautiful sights there are to see in Europe.
The Commission' s proposal on the movement of third-country nationals within EU countries for stays of less than three months is not restricted to harmonising conditions; it also aims to reduce certain controls in the name of 'freedom' .
This is the case, for example, with the 'reporting of presence' by foreigners under the Schengen Convention which I mentioned in yesterday' s debate.
Even if this obligation to declare oneself was poorly applied, I was of the opinion that it was a matter of urgency to strengthen this obligation, rather than to weaken it.
In another area, the Commission is also pursuing its former approach by proposing to introduce a 'specific travel authorisation' issued by a Member State which will apply in all the others, in order to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals for a period of less than six months.
This reform is a good illustration of the subversive technique whereby a series of small steps can finally bring about the grand plan.
As things stand, stays of more than three months are subject to national visas which fall within the sovereignty of each State.
The 'travel authorisation' proposed by the Commission would erode this mechanism.
In order to justify this derogation, on page 9 of the Explanatory Memorandum, the Commission mentions the case of certain foreigners who would need to move around the EU over a six-month period in their capacity as 'recipients of services' , such as 'tourists' or 'persons taking health cures' or even 'musicians' , as Commissioner Vitorino mentioned during the debate.
This pretext is rather weak; hardly any tourists stay for six consecutive months in the EU and there is no justification for developing a directive specifically for them.
The advantage for the Commission is elsewhere, namely the destruction of the coherence of a system based on national sovereignties in order to introduce a different kind of system, one that has supranational objectives.
This dogmatic exercise will not bring any other benefits for our current area of priority, which is controlling migration flows and security.
On the contrary, there is a danger that it will harm it, by encouraging weaknesses and inconsistencies to appear.
Rapport Katiforis (A5-0016/2002)
Mr President, before I left for Strasbourg, I met my great friend and colleague, Mr Giuseppe Italia - that really is his name, the same as my country, Italy - and Giuseppe Italia, who lives in Cremona, said to me: 'I know that you are going to vote on this report. That is good, I am in favour of that.
I am a chain-smoker and I am prepared to go out of my house to have a cigarette if there is someone indoors who does not like smoke.
However, I am sixty-two years old: I don' t drink, I don' t have sex any more because ...' - he did not expand on this point - 'but, at least, leave me the pleasure of smoking cigarettes for I do not disturb anyone and I have no other pleasure left in life.'
Therefore, I voted for the motion: I am in favour of smoking in appropriate places and I am against increasing taxation on cigarettes.
Mr President, after Mr Fatuzzo' s diverting speech, I would like to add my comments on the Katiforis report.
I come from the south of Italy and I am sad to say that we continue, as always, to be badly served by airlines.
I should have been in the Chamber for one of my reports - I am a shadow rapporteur - but I did not get here in time.
In any case, I would like to point out here that this connection between smoking and health which we are continuing to make in resolutions on excise duties and State tobacco subsidies is inappropriate.
There is clearly a connection between health and smoking but this is not the way to solve the problem.
In southern Italy, particularly in Naples, contraband cigarettes are sold door-to-door and on the street: therefore, if we really want to boost the smuggling activity, the way to do it is to continue to wage war on this product.
I would also point out that in some very poor areas with a high level of delinquency, such as the province of Caserta, tobacco succeeds in literally keeping3 000 workers off the breadline, and these jobs would be placed in extreme jeopardy.
Congratulations, Mr Katiforis, on your two-fold resolution which the House has endorsed almost unanimously.
Mr President, I should like to make a comment on the Katiforis report.
I share the concern about the less privileged regions.
I have the feeling that some States - and I am thinking of France, but do not rule out that there may be others - use the whole tobacco excise issue to put themselves in a good light abroad by adopting a progressive policy, that is to say a policy that promotes health and is against tobacco, while they actually devote too little attention to compensatory measures for their regions that rely on tobacco for a living.
I also heard in Corsica a complaint similar to the one expressed by our fellow MEP.
I therefore believe that those in Paris care little about the suffering in the regions in their concern to make us more healthy.
Not by cutting down on sex, but by cutting down on smoking, Mr Fatuzzo.
Rapport Van den Berg (A5-0464/2001)
Mr President, yesterday, I followed with great interest the debate on the reform of development cooperation policy and the debate with the Commission on the grey zone between relief and development cooperation.
I fully concur with the report by Mr Van den Berg.
I should like to stress that, wherever I go, I hear complaints from women in situ about the lack of involvement and the lack of participation in the practical implementation of reconstruction.
In Somalia, for example, the women are on the spot but the men take the decisions in Kenya, far removed from reality.
I therefore believe that the verbal concern about gender aspects is not sufficient.
We must insist on women being actively involved in the field; they are sufficiently responsible to consider, and help assess, the way in which reconstruction should take place in practice.
Relief, rehabilitation and development: pensioners and the Pensioners' Party are in favour.
Indeed, they are so much in favour of this that I too, Mr Andria, was delayed in my plane journey to Strasbourg.
Why is that?
Because I had to stall hundreds of pensioners - doctors, lawyers, architects and engineers - who, having learned of this report, wanted to leave immediately for developing countries to offer their services to help them, free of charge, with no remuneration, in the hope that this document would support, encourage and assist those elderly people and pensioners who so wish to continue to be useful after their retirement in the many developing countries.
It was very difficult to dissuade them and I hope that, next time, they will have reason to applaud the European Parliament because it accepts their help.
We voted in favour of this report for the sole reason that, if the European Parliament rejects the text, this should not serve as a pretext for making further cuts to emergency interventions that are granted to cope with natural disasters in poor countries, interventions which are already disgracefully low.
By condemning the coordination problems alone, the report is, however, concealing the dreadful lack of resources.
What is more, the report makes no mention of the fact that, despite the fact that natural disasters have equally disastrous consequences in poor countries, and that these countries are completely incapable of coming to terms with even the slightest of their consequences, this is because they do not have the material and human resources, such as hospitals, doctors and transport, and that they are so poverty-stricken from being plundered, both in the past and present, by the capitalist companies of the world' s most powerful countries.
To speak of 'gaps' in 'international assistance' is utterly scandalous when referring to the most powerful countries, which restrict themselves to making purely symbolic gestures when they have to assist a poor country in coping with a natural disaster, but which, in fact, spend astronomical amounts on dropping bombs on a poor country such as Afghanistan (and many others before it).
Rapport Olle Schmidt (A5-0392/2001)
We have voted in favour of the report in view of the importance it attaches to transparency and environmental considerations.
We would nonetheless make it clear that we are opposed to Paragraph 22, designed to make the ECB the EIB' s supervisory authority.
Report Von Wogau (A5-0011/2002)
Mr President, Mr von Wogau could not fail to win the vote of Mr Fatuzzo and the Pensioners' Party on this major document on European finances, public finance and the financial market.
Pensioners and the elderly like to keep abreast of money matters, of course, because they know the value of money after a whole lifetime of dealing with it.
I would like to take this opportunity to express the great joy with which elderly people throughout Europe welcomed the introduction of euro notes and coins, the new currency; they feel as if they are in a fairy tale country, in a land of dreams where there is more money than before.
I am sure that this European finance policy will bring pensioners and the elderly greater pensions, more money and greater well being. Europe is drawing closer to them.

Before I explain why I voted for the report in question, I would like to draw your attention to Mr von Wogau' s major contribution to Parliament' s work as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I know he will be just as valuable as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
My heartiest congratulations!
The process of integrating the financial markets involves reshaping all the structures which supplement financial services.
In this context, it becomes even more important to take note of experience gained in markets outside as well as within Europe in terms of organisation, operating procedures and the functioning of control measures.
In particular, to this end, we need to introduce new telematic technologies to increase the efficiency of the securities markets.
In fact, the use of these new instruments, which both allows the level of competitiveness between securities operators to grow and makes it possible to manage large volumes of transactions according to time frames and procedures which, until a few years ago, were unhoped for, has helped to raise the 'quality' of prices on these markets and to reduce brokerage costs.
The implementation and integration of the securities markets must, however, be based on a more effective decision-making process - I refer here to the Lamfalussy report - which safeguards the interinstitutional balance while fully respecting all the levels of democratic control established and in operation.
That said, the first thing we need to do is speed up and streamline the legislative process, adopting legislative acts at first reading where possible.
Secondly, there must be an increase in transparency and provision of information, for these are an essential basis for the development of an integrated European securities market.
The third improvement needed is consistency and clarity of procedures for both consumers and investors.
We therefore need an information system to facilitate transactions, from the placing of orders through to payment.
Lastly, it is vital to regulate the role of securities brokers. This should take the form of regulation of brokers and regulation of activities, in addition to establishing a new balance of supervisory powers in which Parliament' s powers are equal to those of the Commission.
The report by Mr von Wogau on 'comitology' within financial services - namely, on the Commission' s introduction of implementing measures for legislation in this area - raises a number of very interesting questions, but, in our view, does not always provide the right answer.
The starting point of the discussion is the current wording of Article 202 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which grants to the Council, and to the Council alone, the responsibility of delegating implementing powers to the Commission, which is contested by the European Parliament. It believes that, given the recent extension in its co-decision power, Parliament should now jointly decide the rules, as well as the implementing measures.
The European Parliament is putting forward some excellent ideas in the von Wogau report, such as the automatic inclusion of a sunset clause in legislative acts, under which any delegation of powers to the Commission with a view to taking implementing measures would be suspended at the end of four years so that its appropriateness can be re-examined.
On the other hand, Parliament is departing from its true role in wanting to verify all the implementing measures, and even 'to attend meetings of the Securities Committee as an observer' .
The Council traditionally enjoys two types of powers, executive and legislative.
Due to its executive powers, Article 202 grants it a specific role in drawing up implementing measures.
The same does not apply to the European Parliament, which has only a legislative role in applying the Treaties, and must not therefore be involved in everything.
Nevertheless, the Commission clearly has a problem when it comes to supervising the drafting of the implementing measures.
The European Parliament' s reaction may not be fully appropriate, but it has been triggered by a genuine reason.
The next Intergovernmental Conference should respond to this by strengthening the role of the Council in the execution committees, and by strengthening the democratic scrutiny exerted over these committees: the scrutiny of the European Parliament over the Commission' s representatives, possibly, but also the scrutiny of sectoral assemblies made up of national parliaments, which would be exerted over the Council' s representatives.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.08 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Situation in the Middle East
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only my obligation, but also my desire, to begin by warmly congratulating you on your election last month to this extremely important post, which is a fundamental pillar of the European Union' s institutions.
Mr President, I have said this in private, but please allow me to repeat it publicly.
It is going to be a great pleasure for me to work with you, with the Presidency, and with Parliament, and rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that whenever our complicated agendas allow it, I will be very happy to attend Parliament to explain the important actions the European Union is taking in the field of security and foreign policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have been asked to attend today to speak essentially about the Middle East and that is what I will focus on, but I would also like to take this opportunity to exchange a few words with you on the situation in Afghanistan and the Balkans, where - we must not forget - we have very serious commitments.
Ladies and gentlemen, the first term I am going to use when talking about the situation in the Middle East is frustration.
For those of us, like myself, who have spent years trying to find a formula for resolving the problems of the Middle East, the situation we are in can only be described, both from a personal point of view and from that of the parties involved, as highly frustrating.
I first became involved in the problems in the Middle East at the Madrid Conference, which was the driving force that demonstrated that we needed a formula essentially based on the idea of 'peace for territory, territory for peace' and which subsequently gave rise to the Oslo process, which brought results, but not all the results we wanted, and which suffered from the enormously tragic assassination of Prime Minister Rabin.
Today, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot talk of a peace process, since there is neither a process nor any peace.
My first comment, ladies and gentlemen, is therefore to say how much I, as a person involved, regret the consequences of this lack of a peace process, as do the people who are suffering on both sides.
Should we be pessimistic then?
I would say not, and despite all the frustration, despite everything that is happening, we must retain a certain degree of optimism and a sense of future possibilities.
I believe that the European Union is performing its task correctly by not throwing in the towel.
We must stick vehemently to our principles and our commitment to this process.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must not just defend and help the Middle East peace process because of the principles and values which inspire the European Union, but also because, in this globalised world, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, is our home territory.
We cannot conceive of a stable Europe, a progressive Europe, without a Mediterranean and a Middle East which are also progressing.
It will be very difficult to achieve a stable and peaceful Europe, which is worthy of the status of a great world actor, if we are not also capable of having a Mediterranean which is peaceful, tranquil and prosperous.
Please allow me to say that, since I had the opportunity and the privilege to work on the drawing up of the Mitchell report, almost a year ago now, there have been many, too many, missed opportunities.
Too many moments when something could have been done and it was not.
Too many occasions when progress could have been made and it was not.
The European citizens and we in Parliament, their legitimate representatives, must collectively commit ourselves to never again allowing an opportunity to be missed.
At this point there are certain opportunities which I would like to mention to you.
But please allow me to go a little, not into the broader story, since we have had the opportunity to discuss that on several occasions in this House, but into more recent history. Please allow me to return to December of last year.
On 10 December, I was in the Middle East.
I was able to be there and talk to all the political leaders.
I also met with General Zinni, the representative of the United States there.
There was a tough stage, as you will remember, but later there was also a moment of hope.
And we must recognise that, thanks to the effort of Miguel Ãngel Moratinos, the representative of the European Union in situ, we achieved, from around 10 December, the most significant moment of peace for many, many months, which lasted until the middle of January.
There was opportunity during that period, the most significant demonstration of which was the speech by President Arafat on 16 December.
You will remember perfectly that on 16 December President Arafat made a speech in his own language, broadcast by television stations, as requested by the Members of the European Union, in which he called for a cease-fire, for peace and for the terrorist groups to stop their violent acts on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.
As I have said, there were a few days of peace, of hope, which were related to the Christmas celebrations.
Even when President Arafat himself was not authorised to go to Bethlehem to celebrate Christmas.
Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, since 10 January we have a situation similar to the previous one.
First of all violence broke out amongst Palestinians in one of the settlements, later Israeli forces murdered an important member of one of the Al Fatah groups and later there was the incident involving the vessel, the Karim A. I would like to talk about both things very briefly.
It was a terrible tragedy that violence should have broken out again in January.
Because we had passed that crucial period of seven days of total calm and the opportunity was not taken to make a qualitative jump forward.
I remember, and I will never forget, how, in Tel Aviv airport, on 6 December, late at night, together with the United States' representative, General Zinni, we were thinking about the plan to implement the Tenet plan and the implementation of the Mitchell plan.
We had agreed on a trilateral meeting between the Palestinian, Israeli and United States security services and subsequently a bilateral meeting between the Palestinians and the Israeli forces.
Terrorism and violence from both sides destroyed the opportunity we had over those days.
And it was complicated - as I said previously - by the famous episode of the Karim A. Please allow me to stop a moment and explain to you what the famous Karim A has meant.
As you know, the ship, which contained arms of a higher calibre than those normally used by the Palestinians, also had a strategic value for the Israeli leaders and for the United States, since it was the beginning of the relationship, not yet finally proved, but very possible, between 'somebody' in the Palestinian Authority and Iran.
Ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between the Palestinian Authority and Iran has been practically non-existent for many years.
If that relationship comes to be proven, it would significantly change what we might call the Middle Eastern landscape.
There is no firm proof which I have been able to see physically, but there is no doubt that something of that nature has taken place.
As you can imagine, ladies and gentlemen, all of this has led to an increase in the already significant distrust between the two parties.
If Camp David represented a break in the trust between the two parties, the situation of the early days of January this year have lead to huge further increase in that distrust.
What can we do from now on?
How can we try to resolve the situation?
Remember the famous European Union declaration in Laeken, in the final days of December.
It assigned clear responsibilities to the two parties and I believe it is one of the best declarations made by the European Union.
We must continue in this direction, which was the one taken by the last General Affairs Council.
That Council, as well as making that declaration, sent me to the United States to try to find a common position between the European Union and the United States, above all in relation to the situation of the Palestinian Authority.
As you will remember, President Arafat is practically a prisoner in Ramallah and the Israeli authorities are still claiming that the Palestinian Authority has become unnecessary and irrelevant.

You know that that is not the European Union' s position and that we believe we should maintain the Palestinian Authority and its President, for various reasons: firstly, because it has been elected by the Palestinian people and, secondly, because we firmly believe that there will be no military solution to this conflict and that therefore the only possible solution is dialogue, and that dialogue requires negotiators, and the negotiator elected by the Palestinians are the members of the Palestinian Authority, headed by President Arafat.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we are maintaining that position.
And I have had the opportunity over recent days - I have spent the whole week in New York talking to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and in Washington with Vice-President Cheney, Secretary of State Powell and the President' s adviser, Condoleezza Rice - to try to discover whether we are able to give further joint impetus in the face of this terrible situation in the Middle East.
I believe that these visits have some consequences.
I do not want to talk about the influence of any one party, or the influence the European Union, but I will restrict myself to describing the facts.
Last Wednesday night when I was in the United States, Prime Minister Sharon, for the first time since saying that he would never again hold contacts with the Palestinian Authority, received three very important Palestinian leaders in his private residence: the President of the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority, Abu Ala; the person who is considered to be the number two in the Palestinian Authority, Mr Abu Mazen; and Mohamed Rachid, who is considered to be one of the most important people in the financial world within the Palestinian Authority.
For the first time, Prime Minister Sharon received these people in his house.
I can also tell you that yesterday and today Secretary of State Powell has received Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Parliament, in Washington.
In other words, we are at a point where we can once again say that there is a tiny glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.
The aim of all this effort is to try to recover a political perspective.
We can and must continue to fight against violence.
We must continue to condemn terrorist attacks, but we must also be capable of giving the conflict a political perspective. That was the spirit of the Mitchell report.
That was the spirit in which I participated as a representative of the European Union, and that is the spirit which must inspire all of us.
That is where we stand, ladies and gentlemen.
I cannot tell you at this point that I have great hope.
I have a little bit of hope.
I began by saying that I was very frustrated, but I can also see that there is some possibility that we may inch forward a little.
Any movement in the right direction is worth trying, however small it may be.
Because, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know how many of you have been there recently, but the situation, from the citizens' point of view, is truly horrendous.
It usually took me twenty minutes to get from Jericho to Ramallah. At the moment it may take me three hours to make the same trip, owing to military and police controls.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union is doing all it can to try to bring a little hope to this process.
I believe that the European Union must continue to work in conjunction with our friends in the United States, as well as the King of Jordan and President Mubarak.
A few hours ago I was with the King of Jordan, I also spoke a few hours ago with President Mubarak on the telephone and I have spoken to President Arafat this morning, and there is, as I have said, a little hope.
I cannot say that there is a lot.
We still have the rest of the week to carry on working.
At the weekend, as you know, the Foreign Affairs Ministers will meet at Gymnich to deal almost exclusively with the issue of the Middle East.
What political initiatives can we bring to the table?
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to participate in what I believe should now be our course of action: to help, to contribute to the successful outcome of the process of dialogue which has begun between the President of the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority and the Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Peres.
As you know, the negotiation mechanism which has now begun is as follows: to try, as soon as possible, to have the Palestinian State recognised, before the definitive borders are recognised.
The idea is that the bases of the negotiation should be the 1967 borders, with exchange of territories if necessary, in order to compensate for some of the possible difficulties.
To try not to enter at this point into a discussion of the more difficult issues: Jerusalem and the return of the refugees; and to begin to work with the mutual trust of two States which already recognise each other, although the second is not complete.
This is the idea we are working on.
I cannot guarantee success.
I must also tell you, very frankly, that Prime Minister Sharon told me that for him that was not the perfect solution but that he was going to let the Foreign Affairs Minister continue with the negotiation.
That is to say that we cannot be sure that in the end the government of Prime Minister Sharon is going to accept it.
But I believe we must continue working in that direction.
If there is no change, even the slightest change, in the current situation, the violence will continue to dominate the centre of the debate.
And we must be able to prevent violence being at the centre of the debate, since politics must be there.
I insist once again: this problem can only be resolved politically, by means of dialogue, and, therefore, sooner or later - let us hope that it is as soon as possible - arms and violence must disappear so that politics can prevail.
There is no other solution.
Ladies and gentlemen, just a few days ago, Simon Peres spoke in a restricted sitting of the General Affairs Council to the fifteen ministers and told them something which meant a lot to me, due to the way he expressed himself and the emotion with which he said it.
He said more or less as follows: "I will never be in a government which does not have the objective of two States: Palestine and Israel.
For a dreamer such as I, Simon Peres, who is very old and has always worked to achieve peace, it is impossible to imagine a situation in which there are not two States.
If there are not two States, two negative things will happen, which I could not accept: one, Israel would not be a democratic State because we would be imposing ourselves on the Palestinians, or, on the other hand, Palestinian demography would win out and the State would not be a Jewish State ".
For all of these fundamental and profound reasons, which he expressed with great emotion, we must carry on fighting for two States, quickly, on the basis of the agreements of the United Nations Security Council, the two resolutions, and on the basis of those approaches which I referred to earlier.
Will we have success immediately?
There is no guarantee of that.
Is there the will to make every effort to do so? Yes.
I can assure you that there is.
However, ladies and gentlemen, neither the European Union nor anybody has a miraculous solution.
To carry on working with the United Nations, with the United States, with Egypt, with Jordan, is - I believe - the best way to try to make progress in that direction.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this is what we are doing.
You can rest assured that both Miguel Ãngel Moratinos and I will be working 24 hours a day, whenever necessary, to try to resolve this conflict, which is of profound concern to the Europeans.
We are not talking about a distant problem, but a problem which is physically, geographically, close and which we feel in our hearts and in our heads.
It is therefore our obligation to continue doing it.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, please allow me very briefly to mention two issues which I had been asked to mention.
The first is Afghanistan.
Commissioner Patten will have more information to offer you, because it is he who has represented the European Union at the Tokyo meeting in a most dignified manner.
I just wanted to say that we have a personal representative of mine in Kabul, and I am also rather proud to say something that we are not always able to acknowledge: the military forces defending Kabul at the moment, supporting the government which was approved at the Bonn Conference - also a European city - are mostly European forces.
Thirteen European Union countries have forces deployed there.
I believe we have to say this very clearly: we must be proud that the people who are carrying out the peace and stabilisation process in Kabul are basically citizens of our countries.
Secondly, I will tell you that we have to work, and that we will do so in very difficult political circumstances during the remaining time between now and June, when, as you know, the Assembly will once again have to name the Grand Assembly which will have to meet to elect another government, which will not be easy.
The present government has a certain degree of balance.
To change those balances will not be easy, but it will certainly have to be done.
Therefore, between now and June we will have to work very intensively with the representatives of Afghanistan and also the other three fundamental countries.
Firstly, Pakistan.
Yesterday, both Chris Patten and I were with the Pakistani Foreign Affairs Minister.
I believe that they are doing a fantastic job and we should congratulate them on it.
Secondly, Iran, the other key country for the stability of the region.
We must recognise that, regardless of what is said or what can be said about Iran, its representatives behaved constructively in both the meeting in Bonn and the meeting in Tokyo.
I believe that we must work with them.
And thirdly, Russia.
These three countries are crucial to the external stability of Afghanistan.
We are doing so and we are going to continue to do so, in order to try to ensure that this process, which will begin in June, and which was launched at the Bonn meeting, yields results.
The other issue I wanted to mention, very briefly, Mr President, is that of the Balkans.
I would like to focus on three points, which in my judgment are the hottest, or potentially the hottest issues.
The first relates to the FYROM, Macedonia and Skopje.
I believe that, after the agreements signed in Ohrid, we are in an ideal situation, from a political point of view.
The whole Constitution was changed and a few days ago the Law on Local Governments was approved, which was a fundamental element in terms of being able to implement the return and entry of police into areas they had been expelled from some months ago.
We are therefore moving in the right direction.
The situation is still not perfect, but I believe we will be able to spend the Spring in peace and calm.
At this moment, NATO military forces, led by Germany, are still there.
The government has accepted an extension for another three months, which may become six.
The European Union is considering the possibility of treating them as an actual European Union responsibility in the future.
No decision has been taken, but it is being considered and therefore, in relation to Skopje, although this is not a time for great celebrations, I believe that things are moving in the right direction.
The Conference of Donors, which Chris Patten will refer to, may work and may be a considerable help from an economic point of view.
Secondly, in Kosovo, as you know, there were elections which we should all be satisfied with.
The elections took place very calmly, with no violence, and the Serbian minority also participated in them.
They are now the second largest force in the Assembly.
What is happening now, at the beginning of February, is that they have not yet been able to reach agreement, and remember that the elections took place in November.
They have not yet agreed either on electing the President, which really should be President Rugova, or on forming the government.
It also happens that the representative of a European MIC, which will continue to be European, had to leave for personal reasons and we have had a few weeks of vacuum.
I was there trying to give a little impetus to the negotiations, which are absolutely essential, so that Rugova, who does not have the majority to govern, can do so with the others.
Let us hope that over the next few days we will have an Assembly with a government in place, with the Presidency elected which has the ability to confront the real problems that that government will have to deal with.
The last point I would like to make relates to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
As you know, the talks between Podgorica (Montenegro) and Belgrade broke down on 24 October.
I was called by Kostunica and by Yukanovic, to see whether we were able to keep those talks alive.
We have managed it and we are continuing to work, to negotiate and to facilitate those talks as the European Union.
I am going there as often as I can to talk to each of them.
We will meet again on Sunday, when we will have another meeting to see whether it is possible, by means of constitutional reform, to prevent the referendum and the separation of Montenegro from Belgrade.
We are working very intensely on that: there is total consensus between the Member States of the European Union that we should make every effort to achieve that objective.
There were certain doubts over whether the United States would take the same approach or not.
After spending this week dealing with their leaders, I can tell you that they are taking the same approach and they are prepared to help us to achieve this reform of the Federation' s Constitution.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end - and I believe, Mr President, that I have almost exceeded my speaking time, since I was told 30 minutes and this is my twenty-seventh minute - by referring once again to my first point: the Middle East.
There is no doubt that it is, and must continue to be, our main concern.
The European Union has great responsibilities and we must continue to work in that direction.
It will not be easy, but we must not throw in the towel and we must continue to be resolute and determined.
We will win this battle.
(Applause)
Mr President, this is the first time I have spoken in a debate with you presiding.
It is not just the half of me that is Irish which welcomes your presence in the Chair - all of me welcomes your presence in the Chair.
I wish you well for a very successful presidency.
I am sure we can count on it being not only successful but also remarkably eloquent.
I have one potential confession: If I have to slip away for a couple of minutes during the course of the debate, it will be just to do my democratic duty in another place, where one of the Union's great institutions is meeting and discussing important matters relating to competition policy and other things.
I will only do that if I have to and will return straight away to the debate.
The whole Parliament knows how tirelessly my friend and colleague, Mr Solana, has worked to restore some semblance of hope in the bloody shambles of the Middle East peace process, and to sustain the progress that the Union has undoubtedly made in bringing stability and hope to south-east Europe, and to the western Balkans in particular.
I have an admirable speech, which goes over all the issues which the High Representative covered so extraordinarily well.
In order not to offend the intelligence of Parliament and to ensure that as many Members can take part in the debate as possible, I will not simply cover the issues which Mr Solana has covered with such knowledge and passion.
I will just underline the strength of my agreement with everything the High Representative has said.
He has pointed out the missed opportunities - one after another - which have brought so much savagery and violence to the region, beginning with the failure to implement the Mitchell report, and going on to the failure to respond with adequate generosity of spirit to the speech made by Mr Arafat on 16 September.
He has touched on some of the appalling errors which have disfigured the history of the region, including the Karine shipment. What we have seen is a descent into violence: killings provoking more killings, violence, repression, senseless destruction.
As the High Representative said, we do not have a Middle East peace process any more but - to use a phrase from a New York magazine a few weeks ago - a bloody feud.
We have to remain engaged in order to try to restore some hope, and the High Representative set out some of the things the European Union is doing to press the case for peace and for a political settlement.
There is one thing on which I should like to focus - which the European Union has been doing and which is sometimes decried.
We have been supporting the Palestinian Authority, and our support for the Palestinian Authority has first of all made certain that there is still a viable negotiating partner for the Israeli government.
Secondly, it has made sure that there has not been a descent into anarchy in the Palestinian territories - because let us be clear that the alternative to a Palestinian authority is Palestinian anarchy.
What is the alternative to the substantial commitment we have made?
In the last two years, we have spent about EUR 400m from the Community budget in the Palestinian territories, and that money has been carefully vetted month by month, in particular the contributions we make to the Palestinian Authority, to ensure that it is not spent on purposes of which this Parliament would not approve.
It must be said that if the accountants of Enron had been one-hundredth as diligent as the IMF is, month by month, in looking at how our money is spent in the Palestinian territories, a lot more people would still have jobs and pensions to look forward to.
When one looks at that commitment and sees the extent to which projects we have started and others in which we have invested money have been destroyed, wilfully and purposefully, it is enough to make one literally weep.
We have seen the destruction of projects worth about EUR 17m in which the European Union has invested - that is, just over a tenth of the total destruction of infrastructure which has been identified by the World Bank.
And the World Bank argues, though this must be a very rule-of-thumb figure, that the Palestinian national income has been reduced by about USD 2.4bn as a result of what has happened over the last months.
I ask myself, and I ask Parliament: where is the evidence that any of that increases security?
(Applause)
Where is the evidence that going back twice to destroy the forensic laboratory that we had been asked to provide for the Palestinian security services increases security in the Territories?
Where is the evidence that destruction of a sewage pump increases the security of Israel and Israeli citizens - something which I wholly understand they are passionately concerned about?
Where is the evidence that taking bulldozers to the runway in Gaza airport is a contribution to the security of Israel?
We all know that sort of destruction of infrastructure, health and education services, people's livelihood and jobs destroys hope and any prospect of political stability and security.
The High Representative referred to what we are doing in Afghanistan and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Why is Europe spending EUR 600m this year in Afghanistan - EUR 200m from the Community budget?
We are doing that not just out of humanitarian motives, but also to try to ensure a more stable and secure future for the people of Afghanistan.
We know that economic development and social progress help contribute to political stability and to greater security.
That is why we are making that investment in Afghanistan and why, so far, the European Union, the Member States and the Commission have pledged about 45% of what the World Bank and the UNDP say is going to be needed in Afghanistan over the next five years.
I hope some others - the United States, Japan, Saudi Arabia - will be as generous as we have been in the next few years.
Why are we spending what we spent in the Balkans, in FYROM, for example?
In the last few months, with the reconstruction agency starting to do as good a job in FYROM as elsewhere in the region, we have already repaired 400 houses, there will be 300 more repaired by April; electricity has been restored in Aracinovo; water and electricity are restored in Kumanovo.
We have made a considerable contribution to restoring normality to Macedonia and will keep on doing that.
Again, why?
Not only because of a humanitarian impulse but also because we know from our experience in Europe that there is a relationship between economic stability and political stability and security.
I do not labour this point as a sort of demented chartered accountant.
I make these arguments because they are so obviously true.
We know they are true from our experience.
If you make people unemployed, if you destroy any infrastructure for people's social well being, then what you are doing is not only making their lives miserable but also, almost certainly, making sure that everyone's lives become more violent.
I hope that even now in the Palestinian Territories and in Israel more people will be prepared to listen to the moderates, to those who made their views about the future so bravely known at Kalandria checkpoint before Christmas.
I hope that the Voice of Peace movement will be listened to because the people who argue in that brave way for peace are the only ones who really chart a way forward for the Middle East, for the Palestinian State in the future, and for Israel.
Anybody who does not believe that should ask Members of this Parliament; should ask somebody like Mr Hume what helped to produce peace in Northern Ireland.
It was moderates being prepared to stand up for their beliefs, it was moderates having the courage and decency to go out there and argue for what we all know is the only way in which you turn off the violence and turn on the peace and security.
Look at what has happened in South Africa, which the Voice of Peace Movement from the Middle East has recently been visiting - exactly the same process occurred there.
So in endorsing everything which the High Representative has said, I just wanted to ask this question: how many more people have to die before the voices of the moderates who are left in the Palestinian Territories and Israel are actually listened to by the citizens of those communities?
(Applause)
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the events of 11 September and subsequent action taken in Afghanistan and the current situation in the Middle East, have pushed into the background a matter that both Mr Solana and Mr Patten have mentioned, namely a peaceful settlement in Macedonia.
I wish to say a word of thanks to Mr Solana, the High Representative and also to Commissioner Patten, but also to all the others who have played their part there in making Macedonia peaceful today.
This is a gigantic success for the European Union, for which our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats thanks you.
In these days and weeks, we are looking eastwards.
We expect there to be new countries in the European Union in the next few years.
I will, though, say quite emphatically and underline what the High Representative said, that it is important to our security in Europe that we achieve peace in the Middle East and that we, as Europeans, cooperate peacefully and well with all the countries of the Mediterranean region.
We will also state that, when these problems are under discussion, we must first just put people on centre stage.
We state quite clearly that the life and human dignity of a Christian and a non-Christian in Europe, the life of a Jew, an Israeli in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and the life of a Palestinian, of a Muslim in Ramallah or the Gaza Strip are of the same value, and no distinction must be made between human rights in Europe, in the Islamic world or anywhere else on this earth.
(Applause)
We wholeheartedly agree with both Mr Solana and also Mr Patten in declaring our need of dialogue and of partnership.
These involve us telling the truth and not going along with irresponsible language.
When, for example, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says, in Thursday's issue of 'Maariv' - and I am quoting him verbatim: 'In Lebanon' - that is, in 1982 - 'it was agreed that Arafat was not to be eliminated.
To tell the truth, I regret that we did not eliminate him.' - that is irresponsible language.
That is the sort of language that leads to war; it is not the sort of language that brings about reconciliation.
(Applause) I find it difficult, even in view of my nationality - and I was born after the war - to say this here.
I find it cynical of the Israeli Prime Minister to respond to our criticism of his attitude by speaking of a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe.
No, we are not anti-Semitic.
We want Israel to live in peace within secure borders.
In that, we stand alongside all Israelis.
This has absolutely nothing to do with anti-Semitism.
We reject that appellation with all the decisiveness we have.
(Applause)
We have, of course, demands to make of Yasser Arafat.
He wrote a remarkable article in the 'New York Times' a few days ago.
In it he says that he intends to redouble his efforts against terrorism from the Palestinian side, thus expressing the possibility that he might not have previously done all that was necessary.
So we also call on Yasser Arafat to do more in this respect in the places where he has influence, knowing as we do that he does not have all the Palestinian groupings under his control.
Mr Solana also mentioned the weapons shipments on the Karine-A. We too want to have information on who they were intended for.
We urge Arafat to provide information on this.
I believe that we Europeans have, along with the Americans, a great task ahead of us.
The Americans, though, must also understand that they have to give Israel and Palestine equal treatment, and that both sides have the same dignity.
Secretary of State Powell, in an interview a few days ago, spoke of Palestine's right to exist, its right to be a state.
All this we welcome.
I think that we, Europeans and Americans together, now have a common task, to contribute to peace in that region.
Yasser Arafat is, of course, the elected President of Palestine.
If we do not accept him as a partner in dialogue, then there can be no peace and no dialogue.
We therefore call on Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat to make a start on peace by talking to each other so that people in the region, in the Middle East, can have a future worthy of human beings.
All those who promote that, such as Javier Solana, Chris Patten and others, have the full support of our group.
(Applause)
Mr President, High Representative, I too want to welcome the Commissioner, who will shortly be returning to the Chamber.
I wish to start by joining with Mr Poettering in what he said on behalf of his group, and also, on behalf of our group, express our thanks for the success of the policy on the Macedonian issue which the High Representative and the Commissioner conducted last summer.
The press is, unfortunately, always full of the things that are not going well in Europe, but when a policy is successful, it is virtually ignored.
I want to focus my remarks on the Middle East.
I am dismayed by the figures the Commission has published on the destruction recently meted out to projects funded by the European Union.
The point here is not the fact that something is being destroyed, but rather the reason why it is being destroyed.
The Israeli government is attempting to wreck whatever might become the infrastructure of a future Palestinian state, and that is something we cannot accept.
You were saying today, Mr Solana, that what is going on there is not a peace process.
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
I have been saying in this House for a year and a half that we should no longer use the word 'peace process' .
It is a low-intensity war, but a war all the same, and our task is to put a stop to it and attempt to restart what will become a peace process.
We are, though, still a long way from doing that.
Mr Solana, I fully support your statement that the EU must carry on, for we have no alternative.
As has repeatedly been said, though, Israel does not want us as mediators.
Perhaps you will again be accepted and welcomed there, with an opportunity we are rarely given to present our policies and our proposals.
Are we then to finance projects only to see the Israeli government's tanks destroy them?
I also consider the recognition of a Palestinian state to be very important, indeed, as Mr Poettering has said, the only possibility.
A President has been elected for this Palestinian state, and that is something Mr Sharon cannot ignore any more than we can.
He is the only person we can negotiate with.
I do not believe there are many other potential partners in dialogue on the Palestinian side.
I regret, Mr Solana, my inability to share even in your modest optimism.
For one and a half years, we have been looking on while two utterly unequal opponents wage war on each other.
We look on while Israeli tanks destroy Palestinian homes and kill Palestinian civilians and we also watch as Palestinians kill themselves and take equally innocent Israeli citizens with them.
It goes without saying that we condemn all violence and every terrorist act without 'ifs' and 'buts' .
Where, though, does it get us?
We achieve no progress by it, and so, Mr Solana, we and the Commission as well, have to think in terms of using the powers we have by reason of the association agreement with Israel, even to the extent of suspending it.
High Representative, Commissioner, you have the dubious fortune to live in interesting times, as the Chinese might say.
You may be the architects of the Union's awakening in foreign policy.
I welcome the meetings that Mr Sharon had last week with Palestinian leaders.
I regret that it is the first time since he came to power that he has directly engaged with the Palestinians and I hope it is not mere coincidence that the talks come just before his trip to Washington DC.
But it will not be enough to talk about a cease-fire.
We need to be talking about an Israeli pullback and an end to the destruction of EUR 17 million worth of EU-funded Palestinian infrastructure.
I recommend, High Representative, that if we want peace we do not define any starting date.
Nonetheless, the news that some Israeli reservists are reportedly refusing to serve outside the 1967 frontiers is a welcome development.
After all it was similar pressure from reservists that led to Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and, taken together with Arafat's expression of willingness of the Palestinians to end the conflict and the need to find creative solutions, these green shoots of optimism need to be nurtured and encouraged to grow.
High Representative, you spoke of the Mitchell report and light at the end of the tunnel.
I hope this is not the headlamp of an oncoming train.
Sometimes America's friends - or so-called friends - in the Middle East have been about as helpful to the peace process as the so-called loyalists in Northern Ireland have proven loyal to the UK Government.
The Union has a serious dilemma if it believes that US policy on the Middle East is damaging the entirety of Western interests.
I wish you wisdom and courage in your discussions with our friends on the other side of the Atlantic.
High Representative, you spoke also about Afghanistan.
My group is concerned about reports of interfactional fighting in Northern and Eastern Afghanistan, leading to thousands of Pashtuns fleeing villages, reports of 50 or more people being killed in Gardez.
Such reports are an ominous sign and strengthen the case for an international stabilisation force to prevent any possibility of a slide to civil war.
Our priority would be to complete the elimination of terrorist networks but in this regard we believe that whatever questions there are over the status of combatants held by the US in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo Bay, they should be treated consistently with the 1949 Geneva Convention.
(Applause)
That Convention was the fourth such to establish principles for the treatment of enemy soldiers and civilians in wartime.
I hope that you will support my call for a United Nations committee to review it, to determine whether further changes are needed concerning armed insurgents and terrorists who do not fall within the traditional definitions and, if not, at least call on the Americans to sign the 1977 amendments to extend protection to guerrillas and combatants, amendments which the US has refused thus far to sign.
In his state of the union address, President Bush displayed a shocking belligerence.
Just as his environmental policies lead to global warming, so his diplomatic and military policies are pushing the world towards a new cold war.
In this century every shot the US fires will indeed, in the words of the poet Emerson, "ring round the world" and unless you can appeal to, and nurture, a wider concept of American self-interest, then we risk the menace of a new military millennium.
(Applause)
Mr President, High Representative, we are being haunted by the chronicle of long-expected and mindless acts of violence in the Middle East.
You said that politicians feel a sense of frustration, not to mention cynicism.
This translates as melancholy, sadness, distress, fear, anxiety and despair for the people.
We could continue by saying that the Israelis certainly have not done what was necessary.
Mr Sharon' s strategy consists of destroying Palestinian infrastructures, because he does not believe in the Palestinian State, he does not want a Palestinian State. He has spent his whole life fighting a Palestinian State.
We must therefore make him understand that he will only achieve peace and security in his country if there is a Palestinian State.
And, to do this, we must enter into a dialogue of political interference in Israel.
It is the Israeli people that must be made to understand that they can only have security if there is the Palestinian State. The only possibility of security for Israel is if there is a Palestinian State.
As far back as 1972, I defended this thesis and I was almost beaten up during an important meeting at the University of Jerusalem.
I know what fighting for this issue means in Israel, but there is no other solution.
Similarly, there is no other solution than saying that, in the Palestinian territories, there will be no return of all Palestinians to the State of Israel.
The numbers of those returning will be limited, we must have the courage to say this, but a State of Israel is a State of Israel, a Palestinian State is a Palestinian State and the two must remain separate.
The price of this is that there will be a European intervention force between the Palestinians, maintaining security in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Jaffa, but which also maintains security in Ramallah, Gaza and in other Palestinian towns.
You will say to me 'But who are we to do this?'
Mr Sakellariou will say 'Europe means nothing.
No one listens to us.'
First of all, we must want to be heard, we must want to speak out, we must want to say 'No, it is not up to the Americans to run global politics!'
We, the European Union, know that the Middle East conflict is a result of a fundamental European crisis.
It is our responsibility, the responsibility of Germany, the responsibility of others who created the situation that we now have in the Middle East.
This is why we must not give up.
This means that today, we must break down the barriers that are isolating President Arafat.
This does not mean that I believe President Arafat is absolved of all responsibility.
He is as hypocritical as Mr Sharon.
They are two old gentlemen who have been fighting for decades in this region and we know that hypocrisy is one of their common weapons.
They know one another very well, they do the same thing.
That is not the problem.
It is not a question of moral standards.
As one speaker said today, there is an elected president - Mr Arafat.
There is a second - Mr Sharon.
I can do nothing, even though, in any case, I would not have voted for Mr Arafat or for Mr Sharon.
Democracy is not what I decide, it is what the majority decides.
Nothing can be done.
We have to put up with the situation.
I shall therefore come back to the point that we must break down the barriers that are isolating Mr Arafat.
This is why our group is asking the European Parliament to invite Mr Arafat and Mr Perez to have a discussion with us.
They both hold the Nobel Peace Prize, therefore they know what is meant by peace.
Well, let us invite two holders of the Nobel Peace Prize to discuss the subject of peace with us here in Strasbourg.
And let us put pressure on Mr Perez to allow Mr Arafat to leave.
It is scandalous that it is Mr Sharon who decides whether Mr Arafat has the right to take part in a meeting in Brussels or in Strasbourg or wherever.
It is up to us to intervene politically to break down the barriers isolating Mr Arafat.
We must fund, organise and support all the NGOs that are fighting at civil society level for new relations to be forged and so that everything between the Israelis and Palestinians will not collapse, as there are some wonderful things being done in this region.
Those who have often visited Palestine and Israel know this.
This is why we have a fundamental responsibility to contradict the key phrase that you hear in Israel, which is 'there is no other solution' .
This is not true; there is always another solution.
I know that today, as Mr Patten said, those who speak of peace are not listened to, but if we manage to show that the other side can hear the initiatives we are proposing, then there will be many more initiatives, like those by the soldiers who are saying that they want to defend the security of Israel, but do not want to occupy Palestinian territories and the Palestinians.
This is why I hope that Parliament will have the courage to make a determined effort in its attempt to influence the Israeli and Palestinian civil societies and make a strong gesture by inviting Mr Arafat and Mr Peres to Strasbourg, in order to break down the barriers isolating Yasser Arafat.
Mr President, High Representative, I welcome many of the positions that you have clearly outlined, Mr Solana, particularly regarding the Palestinian Authority and its president.
I also know that you are working in a creative and worthwhile manner with your many counterparts in order to encourage the prospect of a breakthrough in the situation.
I also thank Mr Patten for his fair and forceful words on the subject of the destruction of infrastructures which symbolise the heart of the Palestinian State.
I think, however, that the general attitude of the Fifteen is still greatly out of touch with the extreme seriousness of the situation in the Middle East.
In my view, there is a great danger of seeing the majority of Palestinians lose their last hope for peace out of dignity.
A nation that is submitted to this sort of daily humiliation by the occupying forces must never feel that the whole world does not care.
We must therefore make ourselves heard.
As Mr Poettering rightly pointed out, it is not normal for the head of a government to express regret that a man, recognised by the whole international community as the leader of a people and a nation, was not killed 20 years ago.
What do we think of this?
And how has Europe reacted to the dangerous green light given by President Bush to Mr Sharon' s policy under which he makes things worse in order to further his own ends?
The rapport between them is as threatening as a violent storm cloud.
Conversely, how are we interpreting the signs, a growing number of which is evident amongst the Israeli population, of a deep-rooted opposition to Mr Sharon' s policy on the basis of the fundamental requirement that the military occupation of the Palestinian territories must be brought to an end?
I am thinking of the courageous statements made by Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, who believes that a nation of occupants will end up being disfigured by the crimes of occupation.
I am thinking of the 300 men and women who travelled from Israel to Ramallah this weekend to deliver a message of peace to Mr Arafat.
I am thinking of the appeal launched by 52 Israeli officers and soldiers to no longer agree to fight in order to occupy, deport, destroy, blockade, kill, starve and humiliate a whole nation of people.
The latest opinion polls reveal a profound distrust of Mr Sharon' s security policy and almost an absolute majority in favour of peace with the Palestinians.
Do such facts not give us more room to manoeuvre than those that we use to significantly heighten the tone when faced with the irresponsible attitude of the current head of the Israeli government?
What are you intending to do, Mr Solana, in this area, to support the forces of peace in Israel?
Lastly, practical measures are as important as fair words in diplomacy and these measures are now expected from Europe.
One of the very significant initiatives, such as the one I proposed to you in an open letter that I sent last week, and the essence of which Mr Cohn-Bendit has just partly taken up, could be to invite President Arafat, and possibly Shimon Peres, to the European Council and to the European Parliament and, if Mr Sharon dared to defy the European Union by using force to prevent our guest from travelling, to organise a joint visit by the 15 Foreign Affairs Ministers to Ramallah and to clearly express an opinion on the conditions that, in Europe' s view, would secure a return to peace.
I believe that it is of utmost urgency to give, in one way or another, those who support dialogue and peace on both sides the prospect of a breakthrough, which they vitally need.
Simply by doing this, you will present - and I know that this is your desire - Europe with a task that rivals its greatest ambitions.
Welcome
I have the pleasure of informing Parliament that Mr Rodrigo Samayo Rivas, President of the Central American Parliament, and Mr Manuel Gamero DurÃ³n, Vice-President, have taken their seats in the gallery of official visitors.
I extend a very warm welcome to them on our debate on the Middle East.
Situation in the Middle East (continued)
Mr President, like previous speakers I, too, am gravely concerned that since last December the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated to a new low.
There has been an appalling loss of life, the conflict in the region between the Israeli and the Palestinian people has deepened and the hopes of restarting the peace process regrettably have receded.
Between 15 January and 25 January last, over 45 people were injured from bomb attacks alone, while ten people were killed during the same period.
This is a staggering level of violence and hatred by any standards.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been left homeless as a result of the demolition of nearly 100 houses by the Israeli forces at the refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.
I very much welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency has written to the Israeli Foreign Minister expressing our deepest concern at the damage that has been done to projects funded by the European Union as a direct result of Israeli attacks against the Palestinian institutions.
Mr President, violence has brought neither greater freedom to the Palestinian people, nor greater security for the Israeli people.
In both cases the result of violence over the last few months has achieved the opposite to what was originally intended.
Violence has only resulted in an intensification of hatred and recriminations between the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples.
The Israelis and Palestinians must resume the search for peace and the two sides must act together and they must act in tandem.
The Mitchell principles have clearly laid down the broad parameters for an overall peace agreement.
Any future agreement must both recognise Israel's right to live in peace and security and ensure that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are protected and promoted.
This means the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories.
Israeli and Palestinian authorities are going to have to move to renew some level of security cooperation with the aim of ending this awful present cycle of violence.
Persons involved in perpetrating any of these awful terrorist attacks which have taken place must be arrested and must be brought to justice, including terrorists operating in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad organisations.
Recent discussions between representatives of the Palestinian authority and Prime Minister Sharon must be seen as a somewhat positive move, but negotiations must surely be meaningful and cannot be seen as a cosmetic exercise under any circumstances.
We must all remember that Yasser Arafat is the democratically elected leader of the Palestinian people and he has the political authority and the political mandate to represent the concerns and the needs of the Palestinian people at this time.
Yasser Arafat is a viable peace partner for Israel and he commands the support not only of his people, but of the broader international community.
I welcome the recent article written by him in the New York Times in which he stated that the Palestinians were ready to end the conflict with Israel.
This call for reconciliation and coexistence must be welcomed by all interested parties.
I strongly believe that the EU must continue to play as active a role as possible in brokering a peace between both sides.
President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon are meeting this week and I hope that this will signal a more willing involvement on the part of the United States to re-intensify its efforts to reach a political agreement in the region.
I strongly believe that the European Union and the American government have mutually important roles to play in ending the violence in the region and restarting meaningful peace talks.
Finally, the Israelis and the Palestinians must also calm the situation and de-escalate the conflict.
Sustained attacks by Israel on the Palestinian Authority and its security forces and facilities are wholly misguided.
Incursions by the Israeli military forces into Palestinian territories must be halted immediately and there must also be a lifting of restrictions that are imposed on the Palestinian people.
Let us all remember, as was said by previous speakers, that the alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy.
Thank you, Mr President, there is, once again, a glimmer of hope in the Middle East.
There are two indications of this.
First of all, there was the discussion between Prime Minister Sharon and prominent representatives of the Palestinian Authority that was held in the middle of last week.
Furthermore, a regular follow-up every couple of weeks has been announced.
In addition, there is the public assurance by Mr Arafat in the American press that he wants to call an end to the terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens.
I sincerely hope that the meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon next Thursday will help these developments move towards a de-escalation of the extremely bloody Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Just consider the extent of the killings and destruction on both sides.
And suffering, certainly personal suffering, cannot be captured in cold statistics or weighed up on a merely rational level.
Meanwhile, a consistent rejection of, and fight against, terrorism do remain the conditions par excellence for creating any political compromise between the State of Israel and its neighbours.
This is of direct interest to various countries in the region, for they fan the Palestinian and Lebanese flames of terrorism willingly and knowingly.
This is why the clear warning by President Bush addressed to them in last Wednesday' s State of the Union speech deserves full support from the EU Member States.
However, this political realism is lacking on our Continent, precisely at a time when European shortcomings have come to light in NATO in such a poignant way.
The EU Member States support efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, especially by making a credible and effective contribution to the current fight against terrorist networks in that region.
This will benefit the Israelis and Palestinians alike.
I would therefore call on the Member States in the person of their High Representative, Mr Solana, to make this contribution.
Last week, a young person from my town, Apeldoorn, sent a touching e-mail about peace in the Middle East.
His appeal was not for a spiral of violence but a spiral of prayer.
Along with the psalmist, I would say indeed: pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Patten' s comments - and I am sorry that he is not here at the moment - are absolutely unacceptable.
In my view, to speak of the senseless destruction - and this is a point on which we obviously agree with him - of the Palestinian infrastructure and to speak of the selective killings of Palestinians without mentioning the Israeli victims is absolutely intolerable.
But this is also symptomatic of the policy that Commissioner Patten has, for many months, been conducting towards Israel.
I am pleased that the High Representative, Mr Solana, is here with us, because at least he can raise the quality of our debate slightly above the level we are used to in this House.
Having said that, I do not think, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that we can resolve the conflict between Israel and Palestine by simply asking both sides to make a little effort, or even asking both to make a great effort.
Mr Barak made some proposals with which we are all familiar and these proposals were not accepted.
The Palestinian Authority existed and the Palestinian Authority has sanctioned the suicide attacks that were and still are carried out every day against Israel.
That is the reality today.
I think that the European Union has an opportunity to show true generosity, but not by means of the tourist trips that Mr Wurtz is suggesting.
The European Union could show its true generosity by saying to the public, to the people of Europe, that they must have the courage to fully integrate Israel into the European Union, that this is the only way to guarantee security in Israel, to finally give five million Israelis the feeling that they can live in peace alongside the Palestinians, but within the European Union.
This proposal has been put forward.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must urgently begin to reflect on this in slightly more depth.
Mr President, I have the feeling that, recently, in each debate in this Parliament on the Middle East, we basically go over the same ground.
The only thing that changes is the state of the crisis, which, unfortunately, is increasingly worse in that region.
Since the last resolution we approved in the European Parliament, with the majority support of the parliamentary groups, there have evidently been more terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians.
I think there have been five in the last ten days.
We have also, however, seen the siege by the Israeli army increasingly close in on the Palestinian population and its institutions.
There has been very considerable material and personal damage which I consider to be completely unjustifiable.
Within the landscape of violence, which is very controversial both inside and outside the region and also here in the European Parliament, we should be able to agree on certain things.
The first is that nothing can justify acts of terrorism, which reduce the chances of peace and produce nothing but pain and indignation.
The second is that it seems clear that the Palestinian National Authority does not have the capacity to restrain this wave of violence.
The third is that not everything is permissible in the fight against terrorism: when we have the Rule of Law, we must always act within the parameters of the law and with scrupulous respect for human rights.
The fourth is that the parties in conflict must understand that no act of violence is going to improve their position.
And the fifth is that we cannot stand on the sidelines; on the contrary, the European Union must maintain its political pressure and its permanent presence in the region.
I am happy to see the efforts the Council and the Commission are making, but I am even happier to hear that there is a glimmer of light on the horizon.
I agree with the Council declaration, which says that our first priority must be to put an end to the suffering of both peoples.
And it seems to me completely pointless for us to try to find somebody to blame.
On the contrary, I believe that we must seek solutions and, for example, the European Parliament should promote and sponsor an international conference for peace in the Middle East, a second instalment of the one held in Madrid ten years ago, from which Mr Solana could no doubt recount many experiences.
Let us hope that amongst all of us we can contribute to peace, because I believe that that is the only truly important thing at the moment.
Mr President, High Representative, today' s debate seems to me to be a proper debate.
I appreciate the Presidency' s flexibility as regards time: if the President wants to make this a genuine political debating chamber once again, it may be no bad thing that he is showing some flexibility towards us.
I would like to say that we are caught up in an appalling, absurd situation: when the Israelis elected Ariel Sharon to power they thought he would bring them more security, but they are now in a terrible situation.
When President Bush was giving his assessment of the tragic situation after the attacks on the Twin Towers, he gave the impression of intending to eradicate the sources of hatred and to genuinely do something about this tragic affair.
However, if the United States now backs Ariel Sharon, there is a danger that it will no longer be able to play the mediating role it had even under Bill Clinton.
At present, it would appear that Yasser Arafat is not in control of the situation, for the terrorism of Hamas is still gathering momentum, but if Mr Arafat were to lose all support, the consequences for Palestine would not bear thinking about.
Therefore, it is up to us, to Europe to do something.
I do not want to shock anybody, but I believe that the only way to give Israel security - as many Members have said - is to establish a Palestinian State.
Therefore, we must start to declare right now that we are prepared to recognise such a State and also that we need to have a special relationship with both the Israeli State and the Palestinian State.
I will not go so far as to mention accession to the Union, as Mr Dupuis did, for fear of causing offence, but if Europe wants to genuinely lay the history of the twentieth century to rest, it cannot confine itself to enlargement and refuse to assume full responsibility for the consequences of European history.
Mr President, the recent Palestinian suicide attacks, Israel' s tough reaction to them and, to some extent, the statements by Prime Minister Sharon about Mr Arafat, have once again brought the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a head.
This spiral of violence must now be broken as a matter of urgency.
The international community must urge both parties to reach a permanent settlement and cease the terror.
One glimmer of hope is at any rate the consultation between Prime Minister Sharon and some Palestinian official representatives that was held last weekend.
As far as the European Union is concerned, a tougher stance would be welcome.
We must strengthen our position in the peace talks, given the exceptional interests - and first and foremost the humanitarian interests - that are at stake.
European leaders can no longer afford to look on from the sidelines, at the risk of a much greater and more extensive conflict emerging in the Middle East.
The peace process will be a lengthy and tiresome process, but I remain convinced that with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance, we can attain our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East.
I too nurture some small hope.
In actual fact, there seems to be greater awareness within Parliament of the tragedy taking place and also of where responsibility lies for this situation, not least our own responsibility.
As Mr Solana has said on a number of occasions: we have wasted many opportunities.
I fear we will waste others too, but I do feel it is important that we have gained this awareness.
I find Mr Bush' s support of Ariel Sharon' s policy truly irresponsible, opportunist and inhumane, for it is not that the two sides lack confidence in each other: this is a specific policy, a specific decision - Ariel Sharon has made this explicitly clear in his speeches in the Knesset - not to allow a Palestinian State to exist, apart from 'Bantustan' territories, and not to give back the Occupied Territories.
I do not understand why we do not realise that this is his policy and take appropriate action.
At the same time, some responsibility certainly lies with Yasser Arafat, and it is an appalling tragedy for both Palestinians and Israelis that terrorist acts are taking place.
However, my hope lies in Commissioner Patten' s words, in Mr Solana' s words, in actions and signs, and I would like to tell you of the great hope that I have in Israeli society.
On Saturday, together with 300 Israelis - young people, coloured people, young lads who have refused to serve in the Occupied Territories, women, university professors - we crossed the Kalandia checkpoint, running serious risks for the Israelis who crossed it were told they were not allowed to enter the Occupied Territories.
Three hundred of us crossed the Kalandia checkpoint to go to meet Yasser Arafat.
The young Israelis said: 'We want peace. We are the other Israel' .
And Mr Arafat embraced them.
However, the most important part was in the afternoon when we met the Palestinians and Palestinian organisations, and they too displayed their desire for peace.
I therefore feel that it is imperative that we believe in these organisations and act to support them.
I too, like Mr Cohn-Bendit, want to issue a challenge.
If Mr Arafat leaves the territories, there is a danger that we will not be able to get him back in again.
It is important that we work to support this operation, to bring Abu Ala and Avraham Burg here.
International protection is vital for the Palestinian people; moreover - and here I agree with Mr Sakellariou - it is vital that we take practical action, even suspending the association agreement, for Israel must respect human rights.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic situation of Palestine illustrates two political truths, which are only bitter for utopians.
First of all, each nation necessarily aspires to sovereignty, in other words, to have the full reign of a territory that is its own and which it can organise as it wishes.
Secondly, it is not, therefore, borders which create conflicts, but the lack of safe and recognised borders.
It is not the division of nations which engenders war, it is when the nations are thrown together.
Throughout the world, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies have failed, causing bloodshed, and yet there are many utopians even in this House who would like to conduct such experiments on our European societies.
I greatly admire Mr Cohn-Bendit' s realistic attitude towards the Middle East, an attitude that totally contradicts the hare-brained ideas of his friends and his own colleagues, regarding the situation in France for example.
That said, the tragic but fragmented events - bloody attacks, arms trafficking, the mutual accusations of murder, terrorism, the repeated failures at maintaining a truce, the unacceptable destruction - are sad consequences, which must not, however, be confused with the profound causes of the situation.
The fundamental problem is that there will only be peace if the Israelis and the Palestinians each have a territory that is marked by recognised borders and, within this territory, they have the opportunity to govern their country freely, without threats or interference.
The State of Israel now possesses three quarters of Palestine' s former territory under the British mandate.
The Palestinians must be permitted to live freely, in peace, in the other quarter.
As sensitive as some places are for the Jewish people and for other believers, places which have great religious significance, we must bring an end to the colonisation of the occupied territories which stems from 1967.
We must observe the United Nations Security Council resolutions and we must also bring an end to a military occupation that has lasted for almost 35 years now and which is an outright record in history.
Of course, Israel has a right to secure serious guarantees in exchange for its withdrawal.
These guarantees can be granted within the framework of the United Nations Organisation, and, in particular, by the United States of America.
They must be more serious than those that failed to prevent the 1967 conflict.
However, this is no longer 1967.
Israel must thus have the courage to appreciate its victories, to withdraw from the occupied territories.
Only then can peace return to the Middle East.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, one victim of the recent bombings in the Middle East, in which Israeli civilians were targeted, has been the willingness of moderates to form coalitions.
I think one has to distinguish between murdering civilians willy-nilly, pursuing possible terrorists or, on the other hand, setting a 7-day deadline and positively inviting the radicals to promptly wreck the possibilities for dialogue.
Israeli settlement policy, which is to be continued, provides us with examples of this sort of thing, as does the hopeless existence which drives Arab Palestinian refugees to turn themselves into weapons, and the consideration of the idea that they should return to their original homes and thereby put a question mark against the State of Israel's long-term viability.
We also see it in the destruction of infrastructure on Palestinian territory, and that in areas that have nothing to do with counter-terrorism, but - as Commissioner Patten rightly said - destroy prospects for development.
It is for these reasons that we have to make it clear that we, the European Union, have to make a fresh start, and it is perhaps not right that you, Mr Solana, are going there to play for high stakes in a week's time, followed by the American representative the week after.
So we shuttle hither and thither and get nowhere.
Why do you not, for once, go there together in the same week in order to make clear that this is a joint European and American initiative to hammer the point home that we will no longer allow things to go on the way they are.
Both of you must go there together and take funds with you in order simultaneously to give hope and guarantees of security.
We must find a new point of departure, and we will not do it in the ways we have used so far, nor - and this remark I address to Mr Sakellariou and others - by adopting resolutions apportioning guilt in a one-sided way, because then we are destroying the opportunity to be intermediaries.
Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, the reports you have presented today may not have been positive or optimistic, but they sketched a realistic picture.
I am very glad that, after a short, perhaps terrifying moment, the European Union has clearly demonstrated that it is not willing to sit back and let the Palestinian structures, supported moreover by funds raised by the European Union, be destroyed.
This is not about denying Israel the right to defend itself against terrorism, but about our strongest condemnation and rejection of excessive courses of action that really have nothing to do with counter-terrorism.
I am very pleased that this is what both representatives have done, clearly and unmistakably, and that they have made their position clear without falling prey to emotionalism.
That is important because the pro-peace groupings that are present both in Israel and in Palestine are waiting for Europe's voice to be heard.
I support all the efforts at joint action with the USA, but where this is not possible, we must be an identifiable, and indeed, readily recognisable, European voice.
My second observation, on the Balkans, may well be taken as underlining all of what has been said here.
I would only ask that particular additional attention be given to the situation in Albania, where things are not at present developing very well.
I wish to make it very clear that I cannot see us going down the road towards an association agreement with Albania if Albania does not concern itself with the country's stabilisation.
What has happened in the past weeks is, alas, no contribution to stability.
We want stability in the Balkans, we have done much, and with great effort, to achieve it, and let no power in the Balkans cause this stability to collapse again.
I would therefore ask you both to follow events in Albania, in particular, very closely, and represent our positions there with a great deal of clarity.
Thank you, Mr President. After months of heartrending and meaningless violence in the Middle East, we must now nurse and foster each and every glimmer of hope.
President Arafat has indicated that he is prepared to negotiate with any Israeli party and to help search for a creative solution for the return of the refugees.
These are two courageous steps forward which deserve our support and should be immediately responded to by an equally generous offer by Prime Minister Sharon.
In addition, we have noticed that, in Israel, a shift has emerged in public opinion with regard to one of the key issues of the conflict, namely the illegal occupation of the Palestinian regions.
There are now 110 reservists of the Israeli army who have signed a petition in which they refuse to take part in the occupation any longer.
