We had the Essen Council.
You know that 14 top priority trans-European networks were approved and, a few years later, we see that half of them have not progressed.
Consequently, on numerous occasions you see that we make plans on paper.
And this becomes even more remarkable if you think that certain of these works concern what we are talking about now, namely respect for the environment and the need to address traffic congestion in certain sensitive areas of our continent.
Consequently, what is urgently needed is for proclamations and all these plans on paper to find some response in reality.
And here we have to look at the question of funding.
In a few days' time, no doubt, the European Commission will come along and tell us that it is proposing a new plan reforming the trans-European network guidelines.
So we shall jointly adopt a number of priority works.
But if we do not fund these works efficiently, it is certain that, as the volume of transport increases, in a short time things will be much worse and the entire European network will be even more overloaded.
In this way development too is undermined.
Consequently, we need to see how the Member States can assume their responsibilities and how the Union budget will fund the European networks more substantially and what role the European Investment Bank can play in this direction.
I hope the Italian Presidency, which appears to be particularly sensitive to this specific issue, will manage to take efficient steps in this direction because, believe me Minister, debates such as this have been held on other occasions in this Parliament, but the results were not particularly impressive.
I trust that you will take the European Union down a different road.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not, of course, have to re-invent the trans-European networks, because we have them already.
Mind you, they have already lost something of their impetus, considering who has been working on them and for how long.
From 1996 until today, the TENs have undoubtedly had their ups and downs.
At the beginning, or as early as at the Essen Council, they were hailed as the magic remedy for the European Union and its development, until the moment came when we realised that what was expected of them was rather unrealistic.
No, I think that the TENs are a very important tool for the European Union, economic cohesion, the internal market and a modern transport policy.
The Commission's White Paper again made that clear not long ago.
As Europeans, we need a transport policy that is technically up-to-date - GALILEO was mentioned as a potential model - and one that is sustainable, that is to say with priority given to rail and water.
We should now have been a small step further down the road if the Council had also accepted the Commission's proposals, as Parliament has done.
In 2002, Parliament attempted a small revision of the trans-European networks, to which the Council has not so far provided us with a response; instead, the Van Miert Group has gone on to do its work.
So then, we do not have to re-invent the wheel.
The Van Miert Group has done its work, involving high-ranking representatives from every single Member State, and its reports affirm that the Member States agree with what it has, as it were, thought out and presented.
It is now, therefore, really up to the Commission to incorporate what the Van Miert Group suggested into a proposal.
This would then go before Parliament and the Council and, given good will on the part of the Council, we should then have implemented relatively quickly what the Van Miert Group has thought out in terms of projects and, also, financing instruments.
It is not quite clear to me why, in fact, we are now debating the issue once again.
The proposals and plans are on the table. It is now just a question of their being implemented and worked on.
That is why no further pressure should be placed upon available speaking time.
So then, we have a proposal from the Commission, Parliament is doing its work, and then let the Council - instead of dragging its heels, if it please - very rapidly implements the proposal so that the revision of the TENs can be got rapidly under way.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the review of the trans-European network guidelines, which dated back to 1996, was, without a doubt, necessary, both in order to resolve the increasingly complex infrastructure problems and to prepare for enlargement.
The work of the Van Miert Group is certainly thorough, but I do not fully endorse its strategic approach, which is biased towards northern Europe to the detriment of the south and the Mediterranean, an area which represents a major opportunity - and also a major European challenge - in terms of the economic, cultural and social cohesion of peoples and countries with which we are called to enter into a new, major dialogue.
Therefore, if Italy is a major bridge in the Mediterranean between north and south and between east and west, I fail to understand why both the Adriatic corridor and the Mediterranean corridor, designed to satisfy the requirements of intermodality and interoperability, have been removed from the list of priorities.
Only the bridge over the Straits of Messina, which is a case apart, remains.
We therefore call upon the Commission to ensure that they are reinstated once again among the priority projects for 2020, and for endeavours to improve relations between the public and private sectors and to implement controls.
Madam President, we would like to thank Mr Antonione for being with us today, but what we wanted when we requested this debate was to talk to Mr Lunardi and Commissioner De Palacio: however, we have to note that neither of them is in the Chamber today, and we do not believe that this is a coincidence - rather, a clear political gesture.
The Presidency's speech focused more on the functioning of the internal market than on the achievement of sustainability goals, and the same applies to the Members' speeches: they all talked about transport; no one mentioned sustainability.
People say that the review of the TENs will contribute to the development of a network which is efficient in terms of quality and sustainability, but that does not necessarily follow and it requires specific political choices to be made.
There is no mention of incorporating environmental concerns into the current debate on the review of the TENs and there is no sign of any intention to carry out a pre-emptive environmental assessment.
Here is a practical example.
Today, we are faced with the danger that the Commission will bring forward to 1 October the approval of what is known as the 'Van Miert list', which sets out the TEN priority plan for the next 20 years.
As it admitted itself, the Van Miert Group should have carried out an assessment of the projects' impact on the environment, biodiversity, volumes, transport and climate, but it has not done so.
Who should shoulder this responsibility, if not the Commission?
If the Commission really is going to take its decisions by 1 October, it will not have time to do so; it will merely have time to ratify the Van Miert list, which boils down to nothing more than the product of bartering between different governments.

We feel that, before the Van Miert list is approved, a proper cost-benefit assessment needs to be carried out on the trans-European networks proposed at Essen; we need to promote a European transport plan which prioritises the restoration of existing lines, reinforcement of regional networks and the fight to achieve decongestion of urban traffic; we need to consult the local bodies and authorities in the spirit of the Aarhus Convention and expose the interests of the economic promoters who are behind major infrastructure.
There is a lot more that needs to be said, but I hope that we will have other opportunities to say it.
Madam President, as rapporteur for TENs, I would like to start by thanking Mr Antonione for being here today, and I would like to thank Commissioner De Palacio for her work in general on this renowned project.
In the few minutes available to me, I would like to say that the experience I have accumulated in the field of TENs has led me to draw two conclusions.
Firstly, we could say that we are dealing with a pipe dream, something that was decided many years ago but was not then implemented when it came down to it, perhaps because of a lack of resources but perhaps because of a lack of will too.
Secondly, a series of debates has been launched in the individual States on the different resources, on the reference legislation, on the question of whether to focus the TEN project on rail transport or on priority objectives; ultimately, however, of all the original projects - the famous 14 - 11 have yet to be completed.
On the other hand, what we are attempting to do - and I would express my appreciation to the Commission here for its endeavours - is, thanks to the work of the Van Miert High Level Group, review the TEN objectives and, in particular, the resources.
I believe that all the individual States would like this project to be important in terms of the expansion of their economies, of job creation, of attempting to create a genuine network across the 15 nations, soon to be 25.
It is therefore important to appropriate more funds.
We must therefore endeavour to achieve about 30 or 40% in non-returnable funds; we must aim not just at EUR 600 million per year but at achieving between EUR 6 billion and EUR 8 billion per year for the next ten years.
We all hope that this will be possible and I believe that, with the help of the Italian Presidency in these six months, we will be able to succeed.
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Antonione for remaining with us thus far.
I have to say that this debate is not adding anything new to what we already know because, although it is true that there is a general problem where sustainable development is concerned, the fact is that, in this period, we are on the eve of enlargement - partial but major enlargement.
There will be 25 countries in the European Union and we must equip ourselves so that we can achieve closer relations between the Member States.
Closer relations mean more traffic and more cultural, economic and commercial exchanges, for exchanges involve the transfer of knowledge and wealth, which enables Europe to open its doors to successive enlargements, the ultimate goal being to achieve the full unity of our continent.
That said, I have to note that this evening's debate is based principally on the work of the Van Miert Group and, in particular, on the priorities which have been set according to criteria which, in my opinion, need to be analysed in depth.
I cannot list them all, so I will confine myself to mentioning the 10 major trans-European corridors planned and the fact that these infrastructures have essentially been assessed, first and foremost, with reference to the present European Union rather than the future EU, in the sense that a great deal of pressure has been exerted by the countries who are already Members while those who are, in any case, already knocking at the European Union's doors had no bargaining power, with the result that we are now essentially in a position where we do need to consider their needs.
I would mention, not by chance, by way of example, corridor 8, one of the two corridors which concern Italy. On the list of these priorities, it has been given almost the lowest urgent status, whereas a large bridge is to be opened providing a link with the Balkans, whose peoples, despite the effects of the recent war, are already displaying an accelerated growth rate and are a model example of how communities such as those of southern Italy, an area inhabited by 20 million citizens who, precisely through relations with the Balkans and the East, can play a major role within Europe, can become leaders in development.
Madam President, pending the arrival of news which we have not received, please would you forward my observations in the form of recommendations, at least, and, perhaps, concerns.
Madam President, Trans-European Networks (TENs) are a bit like the Loch Ness monster of the European Union.
Whenever the European economy is faring badly, we are entitled to a debate on TENs.
The Commission, however, and the Council even more so, are behaving like an opera chorus.
They are singing 'Let us march, let us march', while jumping up and down on the spot.
One report on TENs follows another, but the projects adopted advance at the speed of a funeral cortege.
The fact is that every economy lives by its infrastructures.
Trade and the internal market need these cross-border networks.
Europe is cruelly lacking investment in the railways, piggyback transport, motorways, waterways, ports and airports.
We are lacking interconnected gas and electricity networks.
Often, infrastructure decisions collide with ecological considerations.
It is no longer politics that decide: it is ultimately the administrative courts.
Sustainable development, however, cannot be achieved without economic and social development, full stop.
Nor is the lack of transport infrastructures and the permanent traffic jams, the traffic congestion, in the interest of sustainable development.
How can we implement the Lisbon strategy without consistent investment in infrastructure?
What is more, these investments, as I have just said, are also in the interests of sustainable mobility.
Madam President, Europe needs to give itself the resources to match its ambitions.
It is not enough to make the European Investment Bank contribute; it does not have unlimited resources.
Why not take up Jacques Delors' idea of funding TENs with a Community loan?
Borrowing to invest, to create the conditions of future sustainable growth, should be an objective common to all true Europeans.
Europe is suffocating under its contradictions.
We manifest a will to become the most competitive economy in the world, but real policy gets lost in parochial considerations.
We need stability, but without growth there will be neither stability nor full employment.
The United States is much more pragmatic.
The US federal deficit for the current year alone is equal to more than five European Union annual budgets.
While the Americans are investing 3% of their GDP in infrastructure, we are hovering around a miserly 1%.
The requirements for projects under way or planned are EUR 400 billion.
The requirements identified by the Van Miert Group have been estimated at EUR 600 billion.
Up to now, Community funding has been in the order of EUR 15 billion.
Clearly, therefore, there is a huge gulf between the objectives announced and the actual efforts made.
Madam President, I regret the Commissioner's absence, as I wished to thank her for indicating she was favourably disposed to the creation of a major central axis through the Pyrenees, with significant railway capacity.
This would benefit sustainable development too.
I also regret the absence of Commission representation, because we would welcome a prompt response from the Commission concerning the Commissioner's proposal for the new trans-European networks.
Finally, I feel obliged to rectify a comment made in the House this morning.
Mr Mayol i Raynal proposed the recreation of a State of Catalonia extending from Fraga to Mahon.
I am bound to state I am completely opposed to Fraga becoming part of such a state.
Fraga has been part of Aragon since the Middle Ages. Consequently, it is not part of Catalonia and never has been.
I would like this minuted, please.
Madam President, we are today discussing the trans-European networks, and it is unfortunate that we are doing so in the absence of the Commission and of the Council.
When we look carefully at matters, the fact is that, according to the calculations, the European Union is foregoing half a percentage point per year in economic growth because, for example, the infrastructure is insufficiently developed and not functioning efficiently.
If, moreover, we were to achieve - as is probable - an improvement of between 25% and 50% in our air quality - at least in quite a few areas - we should be setting our sights more firmly upon combined transport, that is to say on a combination of rail, road and water.
When the European Union has set itself two important objectives - the first in Lisbon, concerning the competitiveness of our continent, and the second, which has since been insufficiently implemented, in Gothenburg, concerning the sustainability of economic development on our continent - it is rather strange that there are already many contradictions in transport policy, in terms of many very different investments and trends, and of the fact that - although we hope this will soon happen - roads are, to some extent, still not paying their way in the light, for example, of the Road Costs Directive.
I hope that the Commission will soon examine the proposals of the committee chaired by Mr van Miert and will present this Parliament with a practical proposal as to how, in the future, the trans-European networks should be developed.
What is first of all necessary is a list of priorities and, secondly of course, the funding.
Mr Goebbels and others have already referred to this.
Credit financing alone will not suffice.
Nor is it enough to organise private capital, something that is also incredibly difficult to do.
What we see in the case of many projects - and Commissioner Kinnock has already submitted proposals in this respect and set up his own group of experts - is that, in actual practice, a private-public partnership really only works in the case of a few such projects if nothing is also done to increase public investment.
In my view, it should really be considered whether, for example, there is the possibility, in the case of carefully targeted cross-border projects that are priorities specifically in terms of European cohesion, of permitting quite specific exemptions from the deficit calculation Ã  la Maastricht.
The Presidency's proposals on this subject were very problematic because they were couched in too general terms, and I believe we must give them more specific wordings.
The Commission and the Council should now be called upon finally to reach decisions and genuinely to propose a realistic funding concept.
I just want to say that Parliament had only, in this case, requested a statement by the Council, a fact that is also stated on the agenda.
The Commission was therefore not expected to be present.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that we were to have a discussion with the Council, but, as we are quite aware, we are partly to blame, for we extended our previous work.
The fact remains - and I, too, agree with the Members who have made this point - that it is a pity that this opportunity cannot be fully exploited.
There is not much point in holding the debate if the Commission and the Council are not here, but let us, at least, use it to discuss the matter amongst ourselves; in any case, there are very few of us left in the Chamber.
Before I go any further, I would say to Mrs Frassoni that I, too, am concerned that sustainability should be placed at the heart of the project and that it should, so to speak, be one of the screening criteria for what we want to do.
However, I am much more concerned at the unsustainable nature of the present situation.
As the Socialist Member, Mr Goebbels, said - I do not know if you heard him, Madam President - in actual fact, our citizens are already playing an enormous price in terms of quality of life and quality of the environment now, precisely because of the situation in our continent of malfunctions, traffic jams, traffic overloads and the impossibility of smooth traffic flow.
That said, however, I, too, believe that, at this juncture, we, too, as Parliament, should launch an 'Operation truth' if we do not want the Van Miert report to be just another pipe dream or set of low priorities, for when we start to call priorities 10, 20 or 25 projects involving, as we all know, such huge costs, the likelihood is that none of the projects on our list are actually going to be treated as a priority.
I am sure Parliament is capable of carrying out this 'Operation truth', starting by making people shoulder their responsibilities and by asking ourselves, if we want a European transport policy and if we want a large-scale infrastructure policy, what price we are prepared to pay for this policy and, in particular, which choices we are prepared to make.
Otherwise, we will continue to hold virtually useless debates like this and, above all, we will continue to raise the expectations of our citizens and of some of our political leaders too, and it would and will be more damaging to fail to meet those expectations than to fail to implement a project.
I therefore feel that, while we are waiting for the Commission and, above all, the Council, to explain to us what the actual possibilities are behind the intentions expressed so clearly by the Italian Presidency at the start of its mandate, we can start to lay down this challenge.
If we are to do it, let us get on with it, but we must do it properly and sit down round a table to work out what it is actually possible to achieve.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that Mr Lunardi will have time to glance at the Minutes of this sitting, for he will find some useful recommendations for his work in the Council Presidency, first and foremost relating to the danger - which has already been pointed out by Mrs Frassoni and which I, too, fear - that, on 1 October, the adoption of this list of 18 projects compiled by the Van Miert Group will be rushed through more in the style of a ratification.
Clearly, to adopt the list without any strategic assessment of the environmental impact, profitability or practical safety of any of the 18 projects would be merely to rubber stamp it.
The Commission is being called upon to rubber stamp the 18 projects submitted by the governments.
I would like the Commission to know that, when Parliament is asked to give its opinion, it will refuse just to give its seal of approval or ratify them, not least because some of the proposals and demands of the Member States are nothing more than whims.
One example, in particular, which we have discussed at length with Commissioner Van Miert, is the project to build a bridge over the Straits of Messina.
There is clear, solid opposition to this bridge from all the local communities concerned.
Its profitability is questionable, there are deep concerns as regards safety and, most importantly, the environmental impact would be terrible if we were to build a pylon taller than the Empire State Building on the outskirts of the city of Messina.
In response to our objections and to the request for clarification which we put to Mr Van Miert, to find out what the exceptional grounds were for selecting this project, it was explained that the Italian Government had put forward strong arguments for it, to the effect that this bridge would save 5.5 million Sicilians from isolation.
Madam President, as a Sicilian, I can tell you that this is not true.
The isolation of the Sicilians is caused by the fact that getting from Palermo to Messina involves a five-hour train journey, not the fact that it is 20 minutes by ferry from Messina to Reggio Calabria.
We have had to sideline another project - a genuinely key project - corridor 8, which would have made it possible to link southern Europe to the Balkan countries and would, moreover, have helped to confirm our particular consideration for the economic future of the Balkans, in line with the intentions of the Italian Presidency.
With regard to all these considerations, I hope that Parliament will have the opportunity to return to the subject and to discuss it with representatives of the Commission and the Council here in flesh and blood.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0284/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the re-use of public sector documents [7946/1/2003 - C5-0251/2003 - 2002/0123(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr W.G. van Velzen).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you that we have achieved a great innovation.
The first reading was at 23.33 on Tuesday evening, and it is now 21.02 on Wednesday evening, so I must say that we have made tremendous progress.
As far as I know, this is the first time that we have had a second reading on Wednesday evening and then the voting on Thursday.
In that sense, then, we have taken a step backwards.
The use of public sector information is naturally a very important issue.
We talk so often about the re-use of public sector information, saying 'it was agreed in Lisbon that the European Union should become 'the most competitive ? knowledge-based? society in the world'.
Premiers go home afterwards with tears in their eyes because they have just said that.
As soon as we get back to reality, however, we feel fierce anger, because what then lies ahead of us is an endless struggle.
At the second reading, we had to deal with a Council common position containing a large number of comments which, it has to be said, did not have a great deal to do with the ambitious objectives agreed in Lisbon.
To illustrate: one could say that auctions of third-generation frequencies, for example UMTS, have now fetched so much money for the Member States that they would say 'we are now prepared to make as much information as possible available free of charge'.
The reverse is true.
Public sector bodies simply want more money for the use of public sector information.
My colleagues and I have had to fight extremely hard with the Council in order to take a step forwards on that point.
I am very happy, therefore, that we have indeed been able to take that step.
Nevertheless, we have to accept the fact that reality is far more difficult than we should like.
Then, of course, there remains the point to which I am always referring.
Imagine that you are an entrepreneur in a small SME in Italy.
You are not, but imagine that you are.
Imagine also that you want public sector information that you intend to re-use.
You must imagine that scenario in a Union that is soon to have 25 Member States all having their own, unpublished, assets lists.
You then have to contend with a situation in which you have to use a pink form in one case and a green one in the other; in language X in one case and language Y in the other - and you have to keep on top of all of this as an entrepreneur in a small SME.
That is simply not possible.
For this reason, I am also very pleased that we have finally been able to convince the Council, too, that there must be an assets list stating explicitly which public sector information is available for re-use and - if this can be done at all in these days of the Lisbon objectives - that it is also available on the Internet.
We have managed to achieve this at the second reading, and I am extremely happy about that.
We have also managed to tighten up the cost principles raised by the Council considerably and to make it clear that it is by no means always necessary to demand reimbursement of costs from citizens or enterprises that want to use public sector information.
In some cases, however, for example where bodies are concerned which the government has privatised, and which themselves have financial commitments, there is no other way.
However, express limits then have to be imposed on this.
That point proved a very difficult one - including internally.
We discussed it at great length, but, in my opinion, obtained a good result.
The Council did not want to use the word 'information' - it only wanted to speak of 'document'.
I asked the Council, therefore, whether it is a European document society that we have or a European information society.
Of course, everyone saw the humour in that, and ultimately we did reach the compromise that we could keep the word 'information'; even though 'document' is used throughout the Directive.
I should like to tell one final anecdote.
We wanted a situation in which information follows promptly after submission of a request.
In our enthusiasm, we said that this had to be within three weeks.
We then spent approximately one hour squabbling with the Council as to whether that deadline should be three weeks or 20 working days.
I was then convinced by the fact that working weeks are shorter than five days in some Member States.
Some Member States have a lot more days' holiday than others.
We finally changed it to 20 working days: this could mean three or four weeks in one Member State, and approximately five weeks in another, but there you have the multiformity of the European Union.
Finally, I should like to thank my colleagues, in particular, for the confidence they have shown in me.
I have been able to count on a great deal of support from Mrs Read and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel in my negotiations in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Thanks to them, and to the excellent cooperation with the European Commission, we have come through, and we can in any case present a result that I believe satisfies our minimum expectations.
We are going to carry out an evaluation in three years' time, and I hope that the Council will then have progressed slightly, and that we are really going to take the Lisbon objectives very seriously.
I should like to thank everyone for their confidence and for the help they have given me.
Mr President, availability of content is one of the essential factors for the development of new Information Society services, in particular third generation mobile services and beyond.
Content in the digital economy covers all types of information, text, images and sounds that can be transmitted over the networks.
It is the 'water' flowing in the pipes of the Internet.
The advance of broadband critically depends on the availability of suitable content.
Public sector information is a key content resource.
It is collected by a large number of public sector bodies in their execution of public tasks.
Examples are geographic information, legal and administrative information and tourist information.
This information can be re-used and built upon to make new information services.
One good example of these services is the re-use of digital maps for mobile applications.
There are some examples already on the market, but this directive will make them much more frequent.
The directive will create legal certainty for companies that want to make Europe-wide information products on the basis of public sector information.
It will stimulate the creation of new information services based on, or incorporating, public sector information.
The key elements for achieving this are transparency, non-discrimination and fair competition.
I am glad about the progress achieved since the Commission made its proposal for a directive in June 2002, and count on a rapid adoption and transposition of the directive.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, for his interest in this topic and for the thorough job he has done.
The amendments tabled for the vote in plenary are the result of negotiations between Parliament and the Council.
If all the amendments are adopted as they stand, this will make it possible to finalise the directive at second reading.
The Commission can accept all the amendments.
These amendments constitute a considerable improvement on the text of the common position.
Mr President, I wish to thank my colleague, Mr van Velzen, for his commendable work and his energy in the negotiations he had with representatives of the Council when drafting the compromise amendments.
Furthermore, at the very start I also want to thank the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen for his expertise and contribution, which made it possible to bring this Directive into existence.
I support the compromise proposals reached by the rapporteur in conjunction with the Council, because that way we would be spared the laborious and always risky Conciliation Committee debate.
The European Parliament wants the Member States to implement this directive swiftly, as, when they do, its benefits for the public and business will be indisputable.
Genuine free mobility in Europe will not come about until its citizens and companies have clear ideas about what documents are available where and at what cost.
Harmonisation is needed in this area too.
The compromise amendments take a stand on inter alia the availability of public documents, where possible through electronic means.
I agree with Mr van Velzen that it would be a lot more logical and realistic to speak about public information rather than documents.
Not all documents are printed exclusively on paper anymore.
Various electronic publishing formats are rapidly becoming more common and records are being kept in electronic format more than before.
It is very important that the public sector sets a good example as we journey towards the information society.
Many public documents consist par excellence of that intelligent and meaningful content which is so much spoken about, especially in connection with wireless services.
The various forms have to be available on the Internet.
Users will therefore definitely come along for different applications, for 3G, 4G or 5G, when there is meaningful content.
I, at least, can no longer get enthusiastic about ordering merely amusing images for my cell phone.
Another controversial issue has been how much public agencies can charge for their services, or whether they can demand money at all.
Right from the outset I have promoted the policy whereby public documents are of universal use and belong to everyone.
Agencies and institutions paid for out of taxes are obliged to do the job they were originally set up to do, which is to provide a service for those who own and finance them, the taxpayers.
For basic services, materials and data, however, specialist organisations must be able to recover their costs and make a reasonable charge.
The question of whether a charge should be made takes on a new aspect when we start talking about customised services produced for individual customers or, in this case, ordinary citizens.
These are typical chargeable services, for which the public sector also has to be able to demand payment.
A customised service could include design and preparation work to produce a map, for example, perhaps for a car orienteering competition, as the Commissioner mentioned.
Compiling basic data the way an individual customer wants it, the compilation of statistics for example, is a customised service.
In such a case it is only reasonable that the official body undertaking the specialist work should charge for services rendered in accordance with normal market economy legislation.
The upkeep of specialist organisation know-how, development work and developing new technology must be made possible out of revenue either on taxes or these chargeable services - customised tasks.
In many Member States many kinds of specialist know-how are in the hands of public institutions, for historical or cultural reasons, for example.
A final word: this is an area which will take us on towards the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
In which year that will happen none of us know, but this is one small step in that direction.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, who has worked so hard and with his customary thoroughness to get us to the stage of this compromise.
I particularly want to draw attention to some things that are in the compromise and some things that, quite properly, are no longer there.
Firstly, I draw attention to the special needs of the trading bodies that apply particularly in the United Kingdom, such as the Meteorological Office, the Ordnance Survey and the British Geological Survey, which, unless they had been protected with the ability to get a reasonable return on investment, would have had their own work and their own positions seriously jeopardised.
I am grateful to the rapporteur for the way in which he has accommodated this.
Secondly, the cost calculation method is included in the criteria.
That is important for all sorts of people and organisations which, we hope, will make use of the ability to re-use public sector documents.
It is right that libraries, museums, universities and other archives, which would have been covered in the original proposal, are now excluded from the directive.
Once we all realised what a serious disadvantage they would have, there was an agreement that such a proposal should no longer be included.
When I took over as shadow rapporteur on this report, I did it with little knowledge of how interesting it would be and how, very soon, it would become apparent that the re-use of public sector documents would prove to be such an important economic motor.
We can see the limited re-use which currently exists, how it can be extended and how important it is going to be, as the previous speaker said, in the Lisbon conclusions.
I want to draw attention to just one other thing, namely the review of this directive, in which I hope this Parliament will be involved in future.
One of the things that rightly concerns many of us is the extent to which this directive would encourage cross-border re-use.
If we discover in our review period, when the Commission does this, that cross-border re-use has either not happened or been very limited, then we might well have to revisit some of the elements in this particular proposal.
Otherwise, I commend to you Mr van Velzen's work and the compromise for which my group will happily vote.
We look forward in the future to seeing how the fruits of this work are going to bring immediate benefits - long-term benefits, employment benefits and business benefits - to the citizens of the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, of course, wish to compliment my colleague Mr van Velzen on his diligence as a rapporteur.
He has extracted the best out of the situation.
Every citizen in Europe has the right of access to information collected and stored by the public sector.
Indeed, transparency on the part of the public sector is a good thing for democracy, and democracy comes free of charge in Europe.
In addition, public sector information has significant economic potential.
The Directive should lead to the emergence of an active trade in public sector information in the European Union, as in the United States.
There is enormous unexplored potential, which could create a large number of jobs if exploited commercially, particularly via SMEs: small and medium-sized enterprises.
I envisage a central role for the public sector here in giving impetus to a new market.
The Commission presented an ambitious proposal; but a number of Member States evidently have little interest in it.
They have toned it down so much that we are left with the question whether the single market in public sector information will function in the longer term, let alone the short term.
It has become clear that Member States are not prepared to make public sector information available free of charge, despite constantly making a great song and dance about eEurope and an information society for all.
Fine words.
We have to follow things through.
For information to be generally accessible, it goes without saying that the marginal costs of reproduction and distribution can be passed on.
Now, however, it is permissible to increase the costs by 'a reasonable' profit margin.
That is undesirable, as it creates unlimited possibilities for the authorities to make a profit: after all, who decides what is 'reasonable'?
The proposal again talks about public sector documents instead of public sector information.
This means that there is no guarantee that information reproduced electronically is also covered by the definition.
Thus, public sector bodies are tempted to limit accessibility to printed documents.
Straightforward access to public sector information, preferably via the Internet, reduces the distance between the European authorities and the citizen.
The public sector should be encouraged to make as many documents as possible available to citizens electronically, therefore.
That is a crucial precondition for the creation of eEurope: an information society for all.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like, at this late hour, most particularly to thank my colleague, Mr van Velzen, for the work he has done as rapporteur.
In the manner we have come to expect of him on the basis of many other such tasks, he has, at second reading too, been very committed and successfully thrown himself into getting his report adopted.
Until literally the last minute, he has been fine-tuning the compromises in collaboration with the Council.
In common, I am sure, with the majority of this House and of my political group, I share the view that public information should be made generally accessible in the interests of everyone involved.
With the approval of the present directive, we are taking a sound and sensible step in this direction.
The authorities in the Member States have vast amounts of information available, accumulated over long periods of time.
People and companies ought to benefit from this wealth of information.
General access to public information is capable of releasing important impulses for growth, competitiveness and employment within the European Union.
With the help of public sector documents, new services and benefits may be generated in the IT sphere.
In my opinion, the documents assembled by the administrations are, in any case, being made accessible by this Directive only in a very moderate way.
The authorities therefore also have the time required to adjust to the new conditions.
The Council and Parliament have taken account of the corresponding reservations from first reading.
Let us not forget, in this connection, that differences still exist in the national traditions of administration and have to be taken into account.
In those cases in which the Member States allow the publication of public sector documents, the directive now provides uniform ground rules on a Europe-wide basis.
I should like here only to go into a few areas that should be particularly emphasised.
Specific sensitive areas such as research, the arts and documents containing commercial secrets are rightly excluded from the scope of the directive.
These exemption regulations guarantee that the directive will not infringe the rights of third parties.
When funds are scarce, authorities should also, in my view, definitely be entitled to demand fees for making information available, as well as a suitable profit margin.
Let us not forget that many authorities are, in part, self-financing. Moreover, the business of, for example, gathering, updating and looking after up-to-the-minute data also costs money.
It is important, however, to maintain a suitable balance.
The costs must not, of course, give rise to any excessive barriers to the re-use of documents, and I think that the directive now also makes this clear.
Of extraordinary importance to the success of the directive is the preparation of central lists, providing people and companies with rapid overviews of the available documents.
This, of course, is where, especially, use of the Internet comes in.
If a particular authority no longer makes documents available or no longer updates them, its decision not to do so should be published as soon as possible.
This would give those affected a bigger safety margin in terms of planning.
The long fought-for cross-border use of public documents is to be welcomed.
Let us not, however, overlook the existing language barriers that make such use more difficult.
It would, in my view, be completely counter-productive to impose translation obligations upon the Member States in the long term.
Let us protect ourselves against tendencies of that kind.
Finally, I have to state that this directive constitutes an appropriate and well-balanced approach that takes account of people's and companies' interests, without however ignoring the national traditions of administration.
Let us therefore vote tomorrow in favour of accepting the directive.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr van Velzen has again worked skilfully.
He does so smoothly and shrewdly and the results just pour out.
I wish to thank him for that.
There are many kinds of information, and public information is one.
Administrative data must obviously be free of charge to the public and it has to be obtainable from one place, or portal.
As far as the business world is concerned, it will obviously pay for renewal to be possible at the point where information is created, thus getting a return on investment.
This is an important area.
It is estimated that public sector information is worth in the region of EUR 70 billion a year and the content industry employs about four million people in the European Union.
That is a lot.
This market is worth more than EUR 400 billion.
Even the value of the mobile communications industry is set to rise in the near future to around EUR 20 million in terms of its content, and that is content on a relatively tiny scale.
Knowledge and information are the most important factors in a democracy and an economy.
The fact that we are saturated with information separates us from the less well-off.
It is a security factor and an instrument of war.
'Information poverty' hits the same people as social poverty.
Would the chance of a little charity not help? After all, information does not shrink at the point from which it is distributed to others, no matter how much of it is shared.
I would furthermore like to ask the Commissioner whether this could not be one new element in our development assistance programme: the sharing of information and knowledge, because we will not have any less of it even if we share it with others.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0269/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on adopting a multi-annual programme (2003-2005) for the monitoring of the eEurope 2005 Action plan, dissemination of good practices and the improvement of network and information security (MODINIS) [7948/1/2003 - C5-0252/2003 - 2002/0187(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Imelda Mary Read).
. Mr President, I will not need five minutes, which is not an indication of the importance of this report - quite the reverse.
The MODINIS programme aims to create a legal base for the continuation of activities for monitoring the eEurope plan from 2003 to 2005 and for the dissemination of best practices.
It also allows for the launch of preparatory actions for the development of a European policy in the area of network and information security.
To indicate the sort of actions that are going to be financed in order to reach the goals set out in the programme, it covers things such as data collection, a revised set of benchmark indicators, studies to identify good practices in Europe, workshops and studies, looking in particular at the adjustment of industry to the structural change generated by digital technologies and the transformation of society.
One interesting activity which is of particular value is the support of the Information Society Forum, consisting of web-based experts and looking at challenges facing the development of the information society and, of course, the normal programme of targeted conferences, seminars and workshops.
There are many others.
The question for our second reading is: how is this to be financed?
Because the dates are crucial.
The work is to cover the years 2003 to 2005, and we are already well into 2003.
The original European Parliament proposal for the budget was EUR 25 million and the dilemma I faced was how to reach some sort of compromise that was not delayed so long that it would prevent the money reaching its necessary targets.
After some discussion with both the Commission and the Council, I have proposed a compromise of EUR 21 million, remembering that this figure will be adjusted in the event of enlargement.
This is a good basis for a compromise and I think that colleagues from all sides of the House will support this compromise budget provision.
When we do that, it will enable the MODINIS programme, which is very carefully and tightly focused on achievable objectives, to help us reach the Lisbon goals.
I commend both the amendments and the report to you.
Mr President, as Mrs Read has said, the MODINIS programme plays a central role in the implementation of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan.
The information society policies in the EU have three pillars.
The first pillar is the regulatory framework.
This Parliament has contributed to the adoption of this regulatory framework which entered into force last summer.
The objective of this framework is to create a pro-competitive marketplace so that different technological platforms will compete with and complement each other in Europe, offering high-quality services at an affordable price to everybody.
That is the first pillar.
The second pillar is then the IST programme - the Information Society Technology programme, whose task is to guarantee that we will have state-of-the-art technologies and applications available in Europe.
That is the very important second pillar.
The third pillar is the one which binds these two together.
That is the eEurope 2005 Action Plan by which we try to disseminate best practice throughout Europe.
This year we have had very successful efforts, especially in the field of e-government and e-health, with two ministerial conferences, in which Members of the European Parliament participated.
Our Member States and regions are moving from a pure technology focus to solutions, looking at how technology can facilitate higher-quality public services, higher productivity and better tailor-made services.
MODINIS is the financial instrument to monitor, benchmark and disseminate these best practices.
It will be important to assess whether national or European initiatives, taking place in the framework of the eEurope Action Plan, are producing the expected results.
The role of MODINIS will also be to finance preparatory actions in the area of network security, such as awareness-raising actions of Members States and analysis of security risks.
We - all three institutions - are working on the proposed regulation setting up a European Network and Information Security Agency, and we will have the opportunity to come back to this issue in one of the next part-sessions.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Read, and the European Parliament for its support on this topic, as is illustrated in the budgetary amendment to the proposal.
I can confirm that the Commission can accept the amendment.
Consequently, the whole legislative process could be speeded up by facilitating a second reading agreement.
This would further allow the prompt implementation of the MODINIS programme.
I look forward to continued cooperation on the implementation of this programme, as has been the case in the past.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish also to thank Mrs Read for a brilliant report which we are able fully to support.
This is a very important area we are here moving into, as Mrs Read's report also clearly shows.
Modern society is completely dependent upon our having efficient procedures, well-educated populations, proper security and people who are able to understand how to use the services on offer.
I think that, as previously mentioned in connection with Mr van Velzen's report, we must, in monitoring progress, also look at what things cost and how cheaply they can be made.
There are no doubt public sector services within, for example, the spheres of tax and of company registration where it is not perhaps sensible to demand payment, in so far as people themselves answer the questions by using the Internet and keying in their own data.
In that way, we should save on the number of public employees, of whom we shall have a shortage in the period ahead of us.
In Denmark, we have benefited a lot precisely out of getting people to, for example, key in their own tax data using the Internet or push-button telephones.
It does not cost a penny, and it saves the public sector enormous resources in terms of staff.
It would also be worthwhile monitoring how we deal with the wireless sector.
What results would we achieve, and what distribution would we have?
In particular, what price are we to pay?
In my country, the standard connection to private homes is, in any case, two megabits.
In Japan, it is eight megabits and, insofar as I have understood correctly, at a very much lower price than we pay.
We must ask ourselves how we can ensure that the prices we pay, whether in relation to private households or businesses, are not so high as to prevent us from being competitive in relation to the rest of the world.
This aspect of the monitoring is also, therefore, extremely important.
Another thing we must also monitor is the use of the teaching material being developed.
If we look at use of the Internet and computers today, the development of hardware and high-speed networks may be reasons for their fairly widespread use. A still more significant development is, however, the highly teaching-oriented software systems that have come onto the scene.
It is therefore worthwhile tracing the development whereby, for example, elderly people can very easily make use of these opportunities.
Perhaps we should also look for a moment at the early part of children's development and consider the ways in which we monitor how quickly they find their feet.
I come from a small language area and am therefore able to state that getting computers used depends to a certain extent upon how rapidly our children in the small language areas learn to speak English. That is because all instruction etc. in computing first takes place in English.
A lot of material is not translated into the small languages, but it is necessary to become familiar with it if there is to be early use of computers and a situation achieved in which the new teaching methods are used in the education system, enabling much more to be learned much faster than has been the case in the past.
In conclusion, I want finally to say how impressive it is that, within the areas concerned, we have seen quite a few countries combine in making large joint purchases in order to bring the prices down.
This is something with which we are familiar from the defence area, and it would also be only natural if we were to benefit from such advantages within the administrative areas.
This state of affairs must no doubt also be part of what the monitoring addresses.
I wish once again to thank Mrs Read for a brilliant report and for her constructive cooperation, and I wish to thank Commissioner Liikanen for the support he has given to Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0298/2003) by Mr Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on public access to Parliament, Council and Commission documents (implementation of Regulation 1049/2001/EC in the year 2002) [2003/2022(INI)].
. Mr President, I wish to begin, unusually, by congratulating the institutions and all those who work within the institutions.
It has become somewhat fashionable to attack the European Union project and its institutions.
However, I want to pay a sincere tribute to those who work in the institutions and have made the registers and access to documents a reality.
Today I looked at a briefing from an NGO which said that it was weary of congratulating institutions.
That mystifies me absolutely.
We need to congratulate where there is good work, and encourage good practice to spread across every department, DG and institution.
Before I make some pertinent comments on the report, I want to pay tribute to my colleague, Mrs Maij-Weggen, who leaves this House this month.
I have worked very closely with her on this report from its very beginning when we were working on Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, and without her contribution we would not have this outstanding regulation.
Let me begin with some items in my report.
I do not intend to use my full five minutes.
As a rapporteur, it is important to listen - something politicians are often accused of not doing!
Let me raise some issues that need highlighting.
We need to have greater and more succinct information on how our citizens can access this right to the information contained within the documents.
We need common coding amongst the institutions so that the process of accessing information is simplified.
In relation to the Commission at least, which has a number of registers, I would also welcome the establishment of a single register, even if it is only a single doorway into the other registers.
We have yet again to reinforce the notion that we are making ourselves accessible to citizens, who may not know about this right or how to access it.
I also want to talk about the case of exemptions.
I wish to reinforce that there are no blanket exemptions on access to documents.
Every request must be considered on a case-by-case basis.
There have been some criticisms about the blanket refusal to give access to legal opinions.
Where they fall within the legislative process there should not be a refusal, and, again, every request must be on a case-by-case basis.
The European Parliament's committees - even the non-legislative committees - must apply the principle of transparency and at present the standard of transparency is not uniform from one committee to another.
There are a number of sensitive documents which have not been registered with the institutions.
This needs to be reviewed.
I welcome Mrs Maij-Weggen's opinion and recommendations and, in particular, her view that the European Ombudsman should give an assessment of the regulation: how it is working and how the exemptions are applied.
We need a common methodology to be applied by each of the institutions and the agencies - we must not forget that the agencies and organisations set up by the institutions must apply the regulation.
They should use a common approach in assessing their annual reports, and then comparison will become fruitful and productive.
Everything I have said may imply that there is much to do.
Of course there is, because we aspire within the European Union to perhaps defy our critics, to prove them wrong, to connect with our citizens and to prove that the European Union project is one that we should be proud of and should celebrate.
We have not got it right.
Sadly, perfection often eludes us in human endeavours, whether by politicians or anyone else.
However, our commitment to try is there within Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and in the spirit of those people who have worked to make access a reality.
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Cashman for his work and congratulate him on his detailed report on the issue we are debating today, namely transparency.
All three of our institutions are firmly committed to transparency and are determined to honour that commitment.
I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Commission and provide more detail on some of the key points raised by Mr Cashman.
Mr Cashman stated considerable progress had been made, and that this should be recognised. I agree with him.
Our annual report has recently been released, and presents a fairly detailed overview of the situation.
I also agree with Mr Cashman that there is scope for further improvements and that such improvements must be effected.
In addition, case law is facilitating the interpretation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
Consequently, the use of this important tool facilitating transparency will improve, and democracy will therefore be strengthened.
In this connection and by way of example, I should like to refer to the decisions handed down by the Court of Justice at Luxembourg concerning the non-disclosure of legal opinions. The decisions of the Court confirm our practice, which recognises the institutions' need to preserve the independence of such legal rulings.
In other words, time for reflection is needed.
Clearly, therefore, progress is being made.
According to this report, a further step towards the aim of maximum transparency should be the creation of a single register of documents to replace the current registers.
Nonetheless, if what we are about is making it easier for the citizens to search for and identify documents, the crucial factor is not the choice between one or several registers. Rather, it is a point of entry to a unified portal, where clear information is given as to which documents are contained in each register.
Mr Cashman rightly pointed this out. In any case, further consideration must be given to the technical solutions that will enable us to move towards better integration of these instruments in the future.
I should also like to refer to the significant progress made with regard to the number of documents directly accessible.
By way of example I could mention the Commission's agendas and the minutes of our meetings.
It goes without saying that it is our intention to strengthen this approach and develop it further.
For instance, between now and the end of the year the register of documents concerning comitology will become accessible to the public.
Further, the practice regarding access to documents concerning infringement procedures has been updated. This was another of the criticisms made by Mr Cashman.
Now, when proceedings are completed, the assumption is that such documents may be released.
In this connection, it should be borne in mind that Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 provides protection where it is required, namely for investigations conducted under such procedures.
In this way, for ongoing, unfinished cases a balance is struck regarding the aforementioned assumption on non-disclosure.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out that the Commission has never refused access to documents without providing suitable justification for its decision.
The Commission always invokes Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
Quite simply, the unspecified exceptions referred to in our annual report relate to cases in which access to documents was refused on the basis of a number of the exceptions provided for in the regulation, not on a single one of these.
It was therefore impossible to be specific.
Such refusals amount to 12% of the refusals to provide information.
In other words, they amount to 38% of 30% of the refusals.
I would like to thank Mr Cashman for his recommendations on how to improve transparency still further.
His suggestions are useful for all the institutions, and due account will be taken of them.
We shall consider possible improvements to allow better integration of instruments for archiving and identifying documents.
We shall also take up Mr Cashman's suggestion and consider a common methodology for the drafting of annual reports. This would facilitate comparisons.
Mr Cashman's suggestions concerning the evaluation report, due to be presented by the Commission early in 2004 will also be borne in mind.
The three institutions dealt with all these issues yesterday, at a truly productive and fruitful meeting.
Some problems remain.
We have reservations concerning the possible creation of a directive harmonising national legislation in this field, as mentioned by Mr Cashman in his report.
There is no appropriate legal basis for such a step.
I am aware that Mr Cashman himself appreciates the difficulties and shares our misgivings. Mr Cashman made this clear at our meeting yesterday.
In the light of all this, I truly believe that the assessment of a year of implementing Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 has to be very positive. The rapporteur indicated as much.
Of course, this should not be an excuse for complacency.
On the contrary, it should encourage the introduction of further improvements to the initiatives and measures adopted.
All is not perfect, but I do believe it is fair to state that things are going well.
It should be emphasised that this is an important instrument of transparency. It grants clear and unequivocal rights to the citizens of the Union.
It is worth highlighting, however, that as far as the Commission is concerned this instrument has been used mainly by law professionals. In particular, it has been used by law firms.
This needs to be borne in mind.
What this suggests is that, generally, the citizens tend to use conventional methods of obtaining good quality, clear, precise and relevant information on activities undertaken by the institutions. They favour this approach, rather than consulting specific documents.
It is also true, however, that universities and non-governmental organisations, for example, have made considerable use of this facility.
This is an area closely linked to transparency.
We must maintain our efforts to ensure continued improvement of the information made available by the institutions on their activities.
Mrs Maij-Weggen is leaving the House. I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for the excellent work she has undertaken over the years.
She has striven to ensure transparency and to improve the quality of the information available to our citizens. In so doing, she has helped to promote effective democracy.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my thanks for the excellent report by my colleague Mr Cashman, and also for the positive commentary by Commissioner de Palacio.
Mr Cashman and I have worked together on openness a great deal in recent years.
That cooperation has always been very positive, very constructive and productive, and that way you start to become good friends too.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs made a number of comments on the first assessment by the Council, the Commission and Parliament regarding the implementation of the Regulation in its first year.
We observed that the number of requests for access to documents that were refused by the Council and the Commission is still too large to be readily acceptable.
In fact, we should like to see another assessment of the situation by the European Ombudsman for 2004, so that it can be ascertained where further improvements can be made with regard to Article 4, for example, in order to bring about an even greater access to documents; including in the Council, in particular.
An important point regarding the Council is that it differentiates between documents of Member States acting, on the one hand, in their capacity as Council members and, on the other hand, as individual Member States.
That leads to unequal treatment, with significant restrictions regarding documents of Member States who themselves hardly have any legislation on openness.
In the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the most appropriate solution is to ask the Member States to adopt open government, too; the Commission would have to submit a directive on this.
That is the appeal we make to the Commission: to see whether it can submit a directive that ensures that open government is the same in all the Member States.
That would be a good thing for the citizens of those Member States, and also for the citizens who call on EU documents, because it would mean that they had equal access whether they requested them from Sweden, Greece or Portugal.
That was my last intervention here in Parliament: I should like to thank Mrs de Palacio, and I should also like to thank the Presidency for its kind words earlier today.
If I may, Mrs Maij-Weggen, I would like, together with the Members, to thank you for your work in the European Parliament over the past few years.
Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Cashman on his report.
I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Cashman's sustained efforts to promote transparency and access to documents.
I have had the opportunity of working with him and serving as rapporteur for the group for other reports regarding access to historical archives.
Throughout, Mr Cashman has always impressed me with his great commitment to these issues.
I must also join with previous speakers in congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen and commending her on the example she has set.
A few minutes ago she was taking her leave of us outside the Chamber.
Nonetheless, she is working to the very end of her time as a Member of the European Parliament, and is back on the floor of the House speaking on a serious issue, namely access to historical archives. I offer her my congratulations.
Further, I am grateful to her for serving as a role model for a young politician like myself.
All of us working for Community institutions are concerned about access to information. We are also concerned about the image Europe presents to its citizens.
We tend to be criticised for being distant.
We also receive complaints that Community institutions are hard to understand.
In my view, facilitating access to documents is the best way to bring Europe closer to its citizens and enable those citizens to understand us better.
I believe a suitable policy on public access to documents will prove a vital tool in bringing the institutions closer to all the citizens.
The citizens need to be convinced of the transparency and efficiency of our institutions and even that they actually serve a purpose.
As politicians, it is our duty to keep the citizens informed. Further, as European politicians, it is our duty to require the institutions to be as transparent and accessible as possible.
The rapporteur congratulated the Community institutions on their recent progress regarding access to documents, and on putting in place the technology required to facilitate access to information for the citizens.
I would like to add my voice to his.
It is true that much remains to be done. It is also true that our group endorses many of the complaints referred to by Mr Cashman in his report.
There is certainly a good deal of work outstanding.
Nonetheless, it is important to strike a balance between efficiency in transparency and access to that information on the one hand, and the potential cost of such measures on the other.
Allow me to mention an example of a measure I find too expensive.
A number of colleagues on the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs asked for video recordings to be made of many parliamentary sittings and committee meetings, and for the recordings to be accessible through the Internet.
The cost of this cannot be justified at present, though it might be in the future.
I agree with those who advocate that the measures adopted should include the simplification, codification and unification of the registers of the three institutions.
I shall now turn to what is perhaps the most controversial point mentioned by the Commissioner, Mrs Maij-Weggen and by the rapporteur himself.
It relates to access to Member States' documents when the latter are acting as individual Member States and not in their capacity as Council members.
Mr Cashman's initial proposal is indeed too ambitious. It is not possible to go that far.
Nonetheless, it would be appropriate to draw up some kind of proposal requesting Member States to be just as transparent as Community institutions.
The citizens would not understand why a Community document should be easier to access than one originating from their Member State.
Consequently, we shall support Mr Cashman's amendment to his own report tomorrow. I refer to the amendment deleting a few words from section 16 of the report, in the interests of clarity.
This is all thanks to Mrs Maij-Weggen's proposal in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Mr President, my colleague Mr Cashman has once again had his reputation of being a good chess player put to the test, and his strategy of being perfectly amiable may indeed be the one that in fact leads to success.
I personally incline more to the 'aggressive journalist' tendency, and, in my professional life, have found, rather, that you only get anywhere by going straight to the point and really piling on the pressure.
In terms of their content, the points have already been explained by Mrs Maij-Weggen, who has once again gone into a lot of detail, this time in listing the information she possesses about who refuses access to documents - too little information on her part in the case of 'who' - where and when this has happened, and about who is requesting such access.
Because we are almost experiencing something of a mood of celebration in the House, not least as we mark Mrs Maij-Weggen's departure, we have also been thinking quite constructively in saying: please, Commissioner - and this applies still more to the Council - do not imagine that it is out of any lack of interest that so few journalists try to gain access to documents.
Journalists have come to believe that they might as well be looking for needles in haystacks as trying to find the documentation they need.
According to yesterday's Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, 'Nothing is more exciting to the public than what is supposedly not there'.
Whereupon, the information enters the public realm through other routes and becomes, sometimes justifiably and sometimes completely unjustifiably, the subject of scandal.
Might it not be an idea - and one that you could take on board today - perhaps to take the trouble to visit amazon.de or amazon.com?
The way it works is that, even if you have something and nothing in the way of information - just a clue as to a book's title or an author's name - you arrive at the relevant page and are immediately told: 'Customers who bought this book also bought ?'
With amazon you can go on to make and accumulate purchases, so it might be imagined that, in the case of the European Commission, documents in use might immediately be traceable.
They are really very well managed, to the point of being childproof, youthproof and, if you like, with a guaranteed future.
I therefore believe that a standardised portal along amazon lines - partly, but not exclusively, computer-driven and greeting people with the words, 'Hello, you are now at our Brussels premises.
What do you need?
How can we help you?' - would really help matters along, enabling a lot of what we are constantly talking about in this House to be achieved.
The debate in progress today is, in many ways, reminiscent of the developments surrounding the Freedom of Information Act in the late sixties or early seventies.
I personally remain an adherent of the principle that someone actually needs to have only an idea that something might be there and does not need to make a specific enquiry.
That is something which still has to come about, and that is what the revision next year is for.
This is something one can look forward to with some optimism if one hears as many good intentions as we have heard today.
Mr President, I, too, wish to compliment my colleague Mr Cashman, in particular, and echo his tribute to Mrs Maij-Weggen.
Progress has definitely been made.
More and more documents have been put in the public domain.
The question is, however, whether citizens can find them.
Guaranteeing access is not sufficient. Accessibility is also chiefly to do with a clear structuring of the data.
In this connection, Mr Cashman has called for Community codes and a register.
I think that that is a good idea.
Accessibility of data is an outstanding means of remedying the negative image of the European Union as remote and bureaucratic.
In addition, openness and accessibility of data are an important key to democratisation.
This morning, we voted on the McCarthy report.
That is an example of tremendous citizens' participation in legislation.
Citizens must be able to familiarise themselves with the early stage of legislation in order that they may influence it.
The computer is an incredibly effective means of involving citizens in this.
On a personal note, I was absent from Parliament for three years, and was able to retrieve a large amount of the data I wanted by computer.
However, I also frequently ran aground in the soup of links, and ended up empty-handed.
I think that a good deal more must be done in that regard.
The computer also represents an environmentally friendly and paper-saving way of working.
I think, therefore, Commissioner, that we have to set to work in particular on extremely user-friendly computer programs.
In my opinion, there is still room for improvement there.
It is a crying shame, however, that the European Council, in particular, is defaulting.
Countless complaints arrive at our door, especially in the fields of justice and foreign affairs.
Nor does the lack of clarity over which Member State does what square with openness, or with the new Constitution, which extends obligations to all the institutions and agencies.
I think that the proposal on this issue was one of the last in a series of good ones by Mrs Maij-Weggen, and I shall gladly support it.
Mr President, I too want to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, and his co-rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen on their assiduous work on considerably improving this regulation, increasing transparency and facilitating people's access to the institutions' documents.
The result of the review carried out in 2001 is encouraging.
Clear progress has been made, and the trend is towards a more open attitude which will hopefully also lead to people making better use of their rights.
Mr Cashman's report clearly shows, however, that there is still a very great deal to be done and that there are still serious deficiencies.
One such serious deficiency is that, when electronic systems are created, this is in the form of more than one system instead of a uniform system.
I am grateful that Commissioner de Palacio emphasised this, together with the fact that a uniform and coordinated electronic case handling system is needed, whereby cases might be monitored throughout the whole process.
Otherwise, it will be impossible for people to acquaint themselves with such a process.
The Council seems, however, consistently to interpret Article 4 of the Regulation too restrictively, that is to say where general security is concerned.
Something must be done about this as soon as possible.
In Amendment No 2, we have proposed a change to paragraph 4 in order genuinely to bring this about.
Paragraph 16, which talks about a harmonisation of the legislation on open government in the Member States' administrations, worries me a little.
I do not believe that we would in that way obtain increased openness and greater access to documents.
I propose, instead, that you vote in favour of Amendment No 3 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Cashman both for his excellent report and for succeeding in bringing to plenary an extremely important report containing essential provisions with almost unanimous support.
In my view, over and above the democratic deficit which we all condemn, this debate reveals the existence of a discrepancy between what it is possible to achieve and what is necessary.
I fully agreed with the first part of Mr Oreja ArburÃºa's speech, but then he appeared to take a step backwards regarding the need to make committee debates public too, which are much more like proper debates than the debates in the Chamber and are certainly much more of a political exercise.
Transparency and access to documents are not just a slogan - they mean, first and foremost, democratic control on the part of the citizens.
If we look now at the possibilities for democratic control of the institutions' work, we see that they are extremely limited.
In the context of major policies - justice, home affairs, foreign policy, defence - the European Parliament is, as a general rule, merely consulted.
The national parliaments are informed, the Court of Justice has limited powers and, lastly, of course, the citizens benefit from direct access to documents.
For example - as has been pointed out - there is no justification for banning the disclosure of which Member State has tabled a particular proposal in the Council or of how it voted.
We see this as a serious violation of the citizens' civil and political rights.
The citizens, like we members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, are being denied the right to know what their governments are doing and to express an opinion. Thus, democracy is being prevented from working as it should.
Moreover, it was the European Ombudsman who noted, in one of his special reports to Parliament, that it makes no sense to keep legal opinions secret when they are not like communications between lawyers and clients.
I fail to understand why this step towards greater transparency is so feared by the institutions' legal services and is, likewise, concealed by politicians.
Another positive aspect of the report is the criticism levelled at the Commission for bowing to Member States' refusal to allow citizens access to their correspondence with the Commission in the context of infringement proceedings, whereas, in our opinion, the same regulation gives the Commission a facility to take independent decisions which it is refusing to use.
Our fear is that, in this way, the Commission is covering up the misdeeds of the Member States and, in so doing, acting unlawfully itself.
I believe, for instance, that, concerning what happened with regard to the requests for access to Spain and Portugal's correspondence on the infringement proceedings which the Commission intended to instigate against these countries for violation of a taxation directive - given that the Catholic Church is exempt from paying VAT - there is no reason for the public not to know the grounds on which the two States convinced the Commission to file the case despite the fact that genuine infringement had clearly occurred.
I feel that we need to look at practical cases in order to see what is necessary, not just what is possible, in this attempt to reconcile genuine needs and make good the democratic deficit.
Mr President, certainly there have been shortcomings - a great many of them - in the area of transparency.
The fact is, however, that it can now be observed that the three institutions have undergone a minor revolution when it comes to openness and public access to documents.
If we take 2001 as our starting point, when we began with quite a closed culture, we can now observe how Parliament hands out 90% of all documents requested and how the Commission and the Council hand out 60% to 70% of them.
There is, however, still something to reflect upon in this context, namely the basic principle that it is openness that is the rule and secrecy that is the exception.
We all know this, but it has probably not percolated right down through the organisation and to the people.
I am convinced that it will happen, but we have a responsibility to give some impetus to the process.
Further analysis is required of quite a few issues that are topical right now.
I am extremely pleased that Mr Cashman is expressing a wise position - one which Mrs SchÃ¶rling has also put forward and with which I agree.
I should like to thank him.
It concerns harmonisation of the Member States' legislation.
I do not believe that anyone in this House really wants to contribute to there being less public scrutiny.
I therefore believe that this is an issue that must be reviewed carefully before the positions are established.
Certain areas really must be discussed.
One such area, which we have discussed at length, is the sensitive issue of the statements from the institutions' legal services.
Where these are concerned, we are now awaiting a court decision.
I hope that it will soon be possible to open up certain areas and that we shall not see the systematic classification of documents as strictly secret.
A first step may perhaps be for a time limit partially to be imposed upon secrecy.
Certain expressions must be defined more clearly so that they cannot be misused, for example concepts such as the overarching general interest and issues that are sensitive in terms of the legislative process.
Openness and access to documents is, however, a long way from just being a question of giving people formal rights.
It is just as important that the institutions and their documents genuinely become accessible.
There is clearly now at last an increasing interest in EU issues around Europe.
We are beginning to see a growing debate, but the institutions appear still not to have succeeded in fully turning this increased interest to good effect.
I hope that we shall be more successful and manage to make the institutions people-oriented.
The legislation on openness is preparing the ground in this connection.
At the last meeting of the interinstitutional committee, we discussed possibly producing material showing the successful work that has been done and the opportunities available to the public.
The EU and its institutions are sometimes very distant from the people.
No advanced computing expertise and specialist knowledge of how the institutions operate should be required in order for people to be able to benefit from the regulations on openness.
There is still a good deal to do where these are concerned.
As many speakers have emphasised in the course of the debate, simple user-friendly registers are required.
There must be simple ways of keeping track of the legislative process.
There is a wealth of computer portals and home pages and various other ways of obtaining information, but what are required are focus, consolidation, user-friendliness, simple language and, of course, a simplified procedure for finding material.
It must not be too difficult.
Changing the EU's institutional culture takes time, but we have achieved a lot in a short time.
I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is the institution that is setting the pace where issues of openness are concerned.
In this connection, I wish especially to address Mr Cashman and thank him not only for his report but also for the considerable amount of work he has done over many years and the friendship to which all this work has given rise.
I should like to address some sincere words of thanks to Mrs Maij-Weggen now that she is to finish and say what a real pleasure I have found it to work with her, what an incredible amount I have learned and how much knowledge I have acquired.
I have also learned a lot about flexibility from Mrs Maij-Weggen, something that is an important feature of European cooperation.
We have also developed a friendship.
I wish to conclude by sincerely wishing her success in her continued work.
Mr President, nothing could be more apposite than what is happening this evening.
A few rooms away from us, fellow MEPs are sitting reading the reports on what has happened in Eurostat, but they have been gagged.
As a sincere Europhile, it pains me every time I come across this culture of secrecy.
Why do so many people within the EU institutions continue to believe that it is acceptable to carry on public activities without total and comprehensive public scrutiny?
An exhortation to the Commission: do not let the Eurostat scandal sully the good work you have done during the historic years when Europe was being reunited.
I want to thank Mr Cashman for his report and the excellent work he has done in order to open up the EU and its institutions.
I should like to make a few brief comments.
It is true that a lot has obviously improved, but that is not enough.
We are not here to stand around hugging one another.
The rules on transparency should apply to all the institutions, including, for example, the ECB and Eurostat.
It is worrying that the Council has begun to discover its own methods of classifying documents as strictly secret.
Simpler and more comprehensive registers are needed.
The Commission should have one register, not several.
All documents must be registered, something that does not happen at present.
The number of refusals of requests for documents has increased.
That is a completely wrong road to go down and is not in the right spirit.
Openness must be the rule rather than the exception.
It is important for the culture of openness to be established before enlargement.
With this in view, the staff of the EU institutions need to be educated about the regulation and convinced of the advantages of openness.
Finally, the report should have shed more light upon Parliament's deficiencies.
We need to improve in this institution too.
Thank you, Mr Cashman, openness is emphatically democracy's best defence.
. (ES) Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members who took the floor.
I welcome their comments on this our common endeavour. Actually, we are working together in order to provide a better service for the citizens and to ensure democracy is exercised in a more responsible manner by all those involved.
I endorse the Vice-President's statement.
We have engineered a revolution.
The Vice-President provided most of the leadership in this field in the course of her parliamentary duties.
Today, we are debating the Cashman report.
Yesterday, internal discussions were held between the three institutions to consider the progress achieved.
The Cashman report is certainly helpful in identifying areas where there is scope for improvement.
We have indeed accomplished a great deal, but we should set our sights still higher.
I expressed my views at yesterday's meeting, but I believe it is appropriate to reiterate them before the House today.
Commission records refer to the refusal of 30% of requests for information.
It should be stated that the Commission only records requests requiring implementation of Regulation EC No 1049/2001.
By contrast, Parliament records all requests.
If the Commission recorded all direct consultation of information available to citizens where recourse to Regulation EC No 1049/2001 is not required, the percentage of requests refused would be minimal.
As stated in the Cashman report, it is very important for us to agree on the methodology for recording results.
It may prove appropriate for all requests for information to be recorded.
If that were done, the Commission would appear outstandingly successful in making information available to the citizen, as I said earlier.
Well over 90% of requests received positive responses.
We have provided information only on the number of requests for information coming under Regulation EC No 1049/2001 that it was necessary to refuse.
In each case, individual reasons and justification were provided, with reference to the provisions of the regulation in question.
No information was provided for other requests.
Clearly, the process needs to be improved.
A better quality of service is needed, as the Cashman report rightly points out.
This too was discussed at yesterday's meeting with the Vice-President.
All three institutions must adopt a common approach when responding to requests for information and invoking exceptions.
Yesterday's discussion should prove most helpful in this regard.
We are to research and assess the feasibility of actually running a joint training programme for officials, especially regarding archives.
Clearly, at the end of the day, some information simply cannot be provided and is not provided. That is the case here and in all countries.
It even happens in countries boasting of maximum transparency.
Some documents are not really documents as such. Rather, they are instruments supporting the exercise of the right to think and reflect.
They cannot be released. The same applies to issues involving the rights of third parties.
These rights could include the right to defence, in criminal cases, or economic rights in business cases.
There needs to be protection in such situations, and they are provided for in the aforementioned regulation.
Mr President, I should like to thank the whole House for its interest in this subject.
I do not know if Mr Cashman or Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld will be present when the next report on the subject is presented.
I might not even be present myself.
Nonetheless, I trust the House will then be able to agree that a step forward has been taken.
That is our shared ambition and we shall do our utmost to achieve it.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0292/2003) by Mr Lisi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes and vehicle refinishing products and amending Directive 1999/13/EC [COM(2002) 750 - C5-0632/2002 - 2002/0301(COD)].
Mr President, this summer we had record temperatures all over Europe.
We also had very high levels of ozone concentrations all over Europe and the two phenomena are unfortunately linked.
Ground-level ozone, or photochemical smog as it is also called, is the result of three components: VOCs - volatile organic compounds - NOx - nitrogen oxide - and sunshine.
Ozone is an aggressive gas which attacks our respiratory systems and damages plants, even at relatively low concentrations.
Member States have committed themselves to achieving significant reductions in VOC emissions in 2010 in order to meet the so-called national emissions ceiling.
As requested by Member States, this proposal for a directive targets a group of products which contributes significantly to total VOC emissions in Europe, namely paints and varnishes for buildings and products for vehicle refinishing.
Limiting the solvent content in these products is considered to be the only practicable way to help reduce VOC emissions and, consequently, air pollution from this major source.
For the sake of clarity, I also want to emphasise what this proposal does not aim to do.
The purpose is not to establish or harmonise measures for the protection of the health of workers or human health in general.
Although national or Community measures for these purposes obviously have to respect the general requirements under the Treaty, they clearly fall outside the scope of this proposal and are therefore not restricted or modified by this proposal.
This proposal has the simpler and broader aim of improving the quality of the air we all breathe, by reducing emissions of VOCs, thereby reducing the formation of ozone.
We have to act now if we want summer sunshine and fine weather to be experienced as sources of pleasure, rather than sources of air pollution and threats to human health and the environment.
. (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has said, the proposal before us today is a proposal concerning the reduction of organic solvents in paints, and it is a proposal which is part of a wider environmental strategy, namely the attempt to comply with national emission ceilings, in this case VOC emission ceilings.
The proposal can therefore be considered to be one of the measures necessary for the global improvement of the quality of the air which we, ourselves, breathe, and we cannot fail to give this measure our full support.
Precisely because we believe firmly in this goal which - as the Commissioner pointed out - has been brought so tragically to our attention this summer, we know that it is in our interest and in the interest of future generations to ensure effective environmental protection.
For these reasons, I have taken a very simple line on this report right from the beginning of the legislative process: the achievement of the goal of this directive is closely linked to guaranteeing the quality of the products covered by the directive, in other words paints.
The logic is, indeed, very simple. There is a threshold below which the quality of the products available on the market will inevitably fall and, if the quality - not forgetting that, more often than not, these are paints which are used as protective films, particularly against atmospheric agents - drops below an acceptable threshold, the effect will be the opposite to that which we desire.
In the medium- and long-terms, there would, indeed, be an increase in the applications of the paint necessary and, therefore, inevitably, an increase in emissions.
I have therefore attempted to strike a balance between what it is possible to do technically, without going too far below an acceptable level of quality, and what needs to be done, for precisely the reasons just mentioned.
I will now briefly review the key points of the directive.
As regards the objective of the directive as such, there were different reactions from the Members, particularly in respect of workers' health and certain national laws protecting workers.
Just this evening, the Commission explained that the goal of the directive is to protect the environment, and to do so without prejudicing or affecting existing measures taken at Community or national level to protect the health of workers, as, moreover, is stated in recital 14.
Some of the Members have retabled amendments to this effect in plenary but, after the Commission's comments, I reiterate that we must reject this proposal for expansion and vote against the amendments, in particular Amendments Nos 2, 10, 16, 49, 54, 80 and 82.
However, I support Amendment No 84, which helps us to define and specify the purpose of the directive more clearly.
In addition, there is an issue of labelling.
Personally, I support the Commission's proposal to entrust the labelling requirements for the products in question to a committee, first and foremost because, in the light of the manifold efforts on the part of industry to provide consumers with clear information, the committee can benefit from looking at existing best practice.
I do not feel it would be appropriate to lay down further requirements, and that is why I call upon the House to vote against Amendment No 20.
With regard to what is known as the substitution approach, set out in Amendment No 23, I do not believe it is applicable in this context, for the companies and the industrial system we are addressing need facts and certainties - which we are providing in this directive - precisely in order to be able to invest in research and develop the formulas necessary to achieve the objectives.
Then there are many amendments relating to the thresholds, in other words the percentages proposed by the Commission and changed by Parliament in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I will not go into them all.
These are proposals which take us below the acceptable threshold I mentioned just now and must, therefore, be rejected.
Lastly, I would like to mention other points relating to minor derogations for vehicles and historic buildings, monuments and such like, which the Commission has accepted and which I call upon the House to adopt, and a few amendments relating to the definition of solvents and their boiling points, which I believe are going to be covered in this evening's debate too.
I would like to end by thanking all my colleagues for their extremely valuable contributions in committee.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would thank my colleague Mr Lisi for the report he has presented on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products.
His report very sensibly complements the Commission's proposal in many areas, especially when it comes to the sensitive interfaces between economics, ecology, consumer protection and safety in the work place.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in this case hydrocarbons, have a considerable part to play in the formation of ground-level ozone.
Emissions are also formed from components of products containing solvents.
In many Member States, health problems in connection with ground-level ozone and smog have increased considerably in recent years.
In the case of sensitive population groups, ozone pollution may lead to irritation of the eyes, sore throats and breathing problems.
In the environment, account is to be taken of effects upon photosynthesis.
I support the Commission's initiative to introduce Community-wide measures for reducing VOC emissions.
I consider the product-related approach selected here to be basically sensible.
The fact is also to be welcomed that 70% of decorative paints are now water-based.
I also expressly support the extension of the directive, agreed to by a significant majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to include dangerous substances in addition to volatile organic compounds present in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products.
This approach would combine necessary measures in a single directive and prevent unnecessary bureaucratic expenditure.
If the dangerous substances are, however, incorporated into the directive, it must also still be possible realistically and sustainably to apply the required minimum standards, that is to say the minimum and maximum values.
What, then, we are talking about is optimum environmental and consumer protection without, in the process, endangering the competitiveness of our European paint industry, as well as the painting trade that is closely bound up with it.
That being said, jobs would also be endangered by the attempt, which goes far beyond the Commission's proposal, to replace dangerous substances, either fully or to a greater extent, by the year 2010 Europe-wide.
That is a threat to the entire paint industry, and first and foremost to small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as a severe setback for our European economic area.
With a view to protecting the health of users and consumers, volatile organic solvents and dissolvents should not, however, be replaced by substances that are dangerous to health.
Injury to consumers' health due to problematic new ingredients such as allergens, or long-lasting damage to interiors due to heavily volatile components of decorative paints, must, in any case, be prevented.
Environmental and consumer protection have the highest priority.
The quality and usability of products ought not, however, to suffer in the process.
If the principle of rapid and complete replacement were really to be put into practice, we should have to accept some crucial losses of quality, especially in the cases of paints and varnishes.
I personally would not expect either myself or anyone else in the European Union to accept a situation in which the varnish on the door of a private house soon flakes just as quickly as the paints on the wall of the house fade.
We need a reduction in solvents and dangerous substances in paints and varnishes, but we need a plan that can be put into practice.
It is technically impossible to reduce the proportion of volatile organic solvents to below 300 grams per litre by 2007 and still further by 2010, but it is technically possible and sensible to reduce the proportion of these substances to 400 grams per litre by 2007 and to a permissible maximum value of 300 grams per litre by 2010.
At the same time, reasonable maximum values need to be applied to limit the side effects caused by the inhalation of paints and varnishes by tradesmen and handymen.
The purpose of the directive must be to employ practicable measures in order, in the medium term, to reduce the proportion of paint and varnish solvents in emissions Europe-wide.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to say a word of thanks to the rapporteur for his work on the Directive on paint.
It is an important environmental directive.
Solvents are one of the main causes of ozone formation, and this has serious consequences, first of all for public health: respiratory diseases and breathing problems can be ascribed to emissions of volatile organic compounds.
Vegetation and agricultural crops are also damaged.
We are right to now impose limits on solvents, and, as far as my group is concerned, those limits could be tightened up further.
The study carried out by the Commission reveals that the environmental gain could be increased further by imposing rather more ambitious limit values.
For this reason, our group advocates lowering the limit values in line with the study carried out by the Commission.
We by no means agree with the view of the rapporteur and the previous speaker that a reduction in solvents would also entail a drop in quality.
Experience in a number of countries has shown that Europe can still have beautiful, good-quality colours even with fewer solvents.
Precisely because of the imposition of limits, the paint industry has undergone a period of intensive innovation, the end of which is still a long way off.
It is my firm opinion that innovation is also the basis of employment.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists also has an objection of principle, however.
The Directive on paint does not say a single word about 'painters' disease': as if there were no one working with paint; as if there were not painters clutching a brush day in, day out.
Painters' disease is a disorder of the nervous system.
Exposure to solvents can have serious consequences, such as memory loss, loss of concentration and premature dementia.
Some countries have taken measures to protect painters against this disease by permitting solvents and promoting sensible use of paint.
These measures have produced good results.
Not one single Member State should be deprived of this possibility, either now or in the future.
The Directive on paint is a harmonisation directive and will without a doubt be a good thing for the industry, which would like to see clear, unambiguous rules in the internal market.
Harmonisation must not be at the expense of social achievements, however.
This Directive would result in those Member States who wish to pursue their national policies no longer being able to do so, and that is absolutely unacceptable to my group.
We have therefore submitted proposals to right this wrong.
Let me put it very clearly: if the internal market means that the trade unions are deprived of the right and the opportunity to champion better working conditions, then my group will say 'no'.
I have to say that I find it rather surprising that we have to discuss this here at all.
For years now, the European Union has been advocating sustainable development.
The point of departure for sustainable development is reconciling economic, environmental and social aspects with each other.
Since Johannesburg, the whole world agrees on the necessity of sustainable development and on the necessity of expressing this in the form of tangible policy.
Sadly, on this, the first - the best - opportunity of bringing together economics, social objectives and environment, social objectives are not being given their due.
I call on the rapporteur, therefore, to have another good look at the various amendments that strengthen the social aspects of the Directive, and to support these.
I am joined by a number of fellow Members from various groups in finding this internal market Directive too one-sided by half.
The veneer of social varnish is really far too thin to offer genuine protection.
Much greater stress should be laid on working conditions.
Mr President, notwithstanding the Commissioner's comments earlier today about her eyesight, I have decided to move forward in this rather vast auditorium so that I can at least see her for this evening's debate.
Two years ago we approved the National Emissions Ceilings Directive and the Ozone in Ambient Air Directive, for which I was rapporteur.
The former, in particular, set ambitious and legally binding targets for reductions in pollution and improvements in air quality.
Before us now is a measure requiring the paint industry to make changes in its production methods which will help ensure that these targets are met, at least with regard to the reduction in volatile organic compounds - one of the precursors of ozone pollution.
It is, as far as I am concerned - and I agree with the Commissioner - very definitely a measure that should address primarily the issue of air pollution rather than that of health problems associated with those who use paints.
MEPs have been lobbied extensively by industry which, for the most part, wants less stringent restrictions on the use of VOCs than are proposed, and by environmentalists who argue the opposite case.
I am pleased that in committee we had 110 votes and the Liberal Democrats were on the winning side in 103 of these, striking the balance between the two alternative views.
In judging the conflicting amendments- I as a mere politician have in general put my trust in the Commission's air quality experts.
I have been criticised by allegedly greener Members for doing this and for not being sufficiently ambitious by supporting the target limits proposed in the Annex.
I have worked with the Commission's air quality experts on the ozone matter and I can assure the House that I did not find them unambitious - quite the opposite.
On reflection, I have decided not to support amendments to raise the boiling point defining VOCs to 280Â°C, but to stick with the ecolabel standards.
However, if the Commission can propose a modification or a derogation that allows the continuation of the rather good B&Q labelling scheme in Britain, I would welcome some proposals along those lines.
Finally, some of those environmentalists within the NGOs, who have called in effect for the complete abolition of solvent-based paints within just a couple of years, should go and spend a little time working in industry and return with a more balanced perspective.
Environmentally speaking, I want us to move forward quickly but I am conscious that lemmings can move forward quickly and I do not want European industry to have to emulate them.
Mr President, volatile organic compounds in solvents, which cause ozone pollution, are in particular pumped out by cars, but are also released as a result of painting the woodwork on the exterior of houses.
The European Commission is right to propose a revision of the existing Directive, which aims to restrict this air pollution.
One striking feature of this is that the deadlines for the achievement of the standards are very long.
Economic arguments, in particular, seem to have been decisive in this.
It became clear during the preparation of this revised Directive that there is a conflict of interests.
The trade union movement, especially the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers, has experience of the 'painters' disease' Organic Psycho Syndrome (OPS), which is caused by solvents attacking the central nervous system.
For example, in the Netherlands - a small country - where the use of volatile organic compounds has been severely restricted by law since 1 January 2000, a few thousand workers are still suffering from this serious disease contracted in the past.
If no new victims emerge there now, it will be thanks to the low limit values that set the standard at a maximum of 100 grams of solvent per litre of paint for a large number of products, and to the compulsory replacement with alternative products.
The fear is that harmonised regulations at EU level that are not as strict as those in force in the Netherlands will contribute to a renewed growth in the number of victims in the Netherlands.
What is to stop us from making protection in all the countries of the EU just as good as in the Member State with the most far-reaching measures, so that those who work with paint may stay healthy everywhere?
Tightening up the regulations in this way is opposed by the countries that have not yet taken these health-protection measures, and in particular by the industry producing chemical raw materials and the paint industry.
The chief concerns of the industry are harmonisation and stability.
International companies want to be free of the obligation to take separate measures for each Member State.
In their view, the existing rules are not being controlled and complied with as it is, and they use that as an argument for rejecting stricter rules.
In addition, they want the standards that are to be complied with to be laid down for many years and not constantly tightened up.
In their view, the use of aggressive substances would actually benefit the environment, as these reduce the frequency with which it is necessary to re-paint.
They also refer to assurances given by the European Commission and its officials all along that this Directive would exclusively concern emissions into the environment and not the protection of the health and safety of people at work.
Following on from my contribution to the consideration by the committee, I am concerned with two matters in plenary, too.
I am concerned firstly with the retention of national protective measures for workers while EU standards are not as strict, and secondly with the improvement of the EU standards now being proposed.
In a number of amendments, I propose at least following the standards in the Decopaint study.
That study was carried out at the request of the European Commission, but, sadly, was not then incorporated into the proposals.
There is still time to correct that mistake now.
In addition, we should not wait until 2010 to lower limit values, but do it as soon as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the Commission for this proposal for a directive on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in paints and varnishes.
It is an extremely sound proposal which will entail a considerable improvement where such emissions are concerned.
We just heard Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m describe the necessity for improving air quality.
Better air also means a better environment, which in turn means better health.
The health aspect automatically has a role to play in this connection, then.
I wish to thank Mr Lisi for the groundwork he has done.
Thank you, too, to my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We had an extremely good vote in the committee, which improved the proposal for a directive.
I am, for example, pleased that we adopted an amendment to the effect that paints and varnishes should not contain substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction.
As it is, as many as 84 amendments have been tabled in the Chamber, and I myself take responsibility for a number of them.
Together with Mr Meijer from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I have, for example, tabled Amendments Nos 62-77, dealing with limit values.
We think that the Commission has settled for too low a level when it comes to achieving these reduction targets.
According to the Decopaint report, to which the Commission too refers, there are two alternatives.
I wonder why the Commission chose to settle for limit values higher than those in both these alternatives.
My Amendments Nos 79 and 81 are based upon the assumption that we shall see a continued trend towards paints with ever lower contents of volatile organic compounds.
This directive should also, therefore, be reviewed in 2008 in order for it to be possible to reduce the limit values further.
I also wish to mention the issue of the boiling point.
I believe that the discussions conducted by the industry in recent days really do not serve their purpose.
We think that the definition based upon a boiling point of 280 degrees - and which is also clearly recommended in the Decopaint report - should apply, because it gives consumers a precise definition.
Mr President, the proposal by the European Commission is based on the scientific Decopaint report, which was commissioned by the European Commission and drawn up following long, thorough research.
I and my colleagues were therefore staggered that the Commission largely disregards the conclusions of that report.
Without any statement of reasons, newer, higher limit values are proposed, which are not based on any research.
What they are based on cannot be determined.
I should like to hear an explanation of this point from Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m; for it is unacceptable for the Commission to simply brush aside the conclusions of the Decopaint report.
I have therefore submitted amendments to rectify this, and shall also be supporting other amendments that have the same objective.
After all, we are talking here about substances that pose a risk not only to the environment, but also to public health.
Exposure to these substances can result in damage to brain functioning and ultimately to disablement.
Several Member States have therefore taken legal measures to curb this risk.
It is important that this protection continue, including in the new Directive.
The current Commission proposal does not provide for that possibility, and should therefore be amended on that point.
Surely it cannot be the aim of the Commission to offer less protection to workers than is currently the case.
It is extremely important that these measures remain permissible now and in the future.
I also support the amendments with this purpose, therefore.
Finally, I should like to add that this dossier is further proof that the environment and public health are closely related to each other, and that it is therefore sensible for these subjects to be dealt with by the same committee in the coming term, too.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done so far.
I am quite sure we can carry on with this work and make sure that we have a good result in the end.
I also want to start by congratulating the Commission - yes, I do mean it!
When we started to look at this proposal we had to bear in mind that it came out of the original discussions on the control of VOC emissions from some years ago when we first looked at the problem: the emission of VOCs from large industrial plants, from large garages, from large petrol stations and so forth.
At that point we recognised there was a serious problem.
Yes, we could take action to control large-point sources - and we did.
We asked the Commission to come forward with some proposals to solve the other problem we had identified at that time, which was the hundreds of thousands of small-point sources across the Union in different places, largely associated with the use of paints, but many other issues as well.
Sometimes it was small garage paint-shops, sometimes it was domestic use of paint, sometimes it was other substances in other places.
I wish to thank and congratulate the Commission.
It has actually tackled this issue as we asked it to do.
It has brought forward a proposal which is very good, not quite perfect - but nothing ever is - and is taking a proposal from this Parliament seriously and acting on it.
The Commission has also recognised that this proposal to reduce VOC emissions is going to have an important effect on the environment.
It is going to reduce ground-level ozone.
It is going to make sure that we reduce the incidence of asthma caused by ground-level ozone.
It is going to cut plant damage. It is going to reduce other environmental effects.
It has not been easy to come forward with this proposal.
It has disclosed a large number of technical issues that we had not originally foreseen.
We thank the Commission for tackling those complex issues we did not at first expect.
Mr Davies has already mentioned that there are some technical issues that we still have to tackle.
We cannot ignore, for example, some of these issues which are still left on the table.
I appeal to the Commission to accept the amendments proposed by some of my colleagues on the question of occupational health and the impact upon the health of workers in these circumstances.
This is an issue we cannot ignore.
We have to go forward with it.
We should also mention the importance of maintaining a degree of choice and competition in the marketplace for consumers.
We should therefore continue to uphold the equal technical criteria for all paints and not give an unfair advantage to water-based paints.
Let us have those options available to people.
Let the market be free.
Let us have some competition.
Let us stay inside the equal label criteria we already have.
Finally, we have to recognise the real difficulties of applying these new proposals in every circumstance and on every application that we find in the vast array of options inside the European Union.
I would ask the Commission to think carefully about some of the exceptions we have looked at here: small quantities of paints prepared in traditional ways, often for traditional uses, whether it be for old cars or for buildings.
There are many old buildings in Britain.
It is a place where we perhaps have too many old buildings which in some cases require specialist, old fashioned, old-style paints to maintain their fabric.
I appeal to you to have some respect, not just for the present environment that we live in, not just for public health, but for the old environment, the built environment, the one we are trying to preserve.
It would not hurt too much to accept amendments on those questions as well and to give us a rounded proposal we can all be proud of, that we might even get a second-reading agreement on.
Mr President, firstly, I should have started by thanking Mr Lisi for his work as rapporteur on this important proposal.
I do it now instead and hope he will forgive me for not doing so earlier.
Allow me to return to the question of the purpose and the scope of the proposal.
A number of the amendments adopted by Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are motivated by concern for the protection of the health of workers.
Some of these amendments - 10, 16 and 26 - aim to emphasise that the present proposal will not restrict or prejudice national or Community measures established in order to protect the health of workers from exposure to solvents in paints and varnishes.
The Commission agrees with the principle underlying these amendments.
Measures for the protection of the health of workers fall outside the purpose and scope of this proposal, and the proposal therefore does not prejudice such measures in any way.
The Commission also agrees that it may be useful to clarify and emphasise this point directly in one of the paragraphs of the proposal.
However, and for exactly the same reason, the Commission cannot agree to include a number of amendments which directly or indirectly aim to enhance the protection of workers' and consumers' health from exposure to solvents in the paints and other products covered by the proposals - Amendments Nos 17, 20 and 23.
The Commission finds that these amendments, rather than reducing the risk for human health, might inadvertently serve to create confusion about the scope of the proposal.
A number of the amendments voted by the committee - Amendments Nos 11, 13, 14, 32, 33 and 34 - contain useful technical clarifications with which the Commission can agree to a greater or lesser degree.
As an example let me just mention the proposal that the part of the VOCs in the paint which reacts to form the coating film remaining on the painted surface should not be included when assessing compliance with the VOC content limit value.
That is Amendment No 11.
This makes sense from an environmental point of view, as it is the part of the VOCs that evaporates into the atmosphere we want to reduce.
However, there is a practical sticking point: for the time being we do not have any recognised standard or method for calculating the weight of those VOCs which remain bound in the film.
Such a standard has to be developed in order to allow for this deduction.
The Commission also finds it reasonable to accept that Member States, under strict conditions and in limited quantities, may grant derogations for special paints, as you mentioned, for the restoration and maintenance of vintage cars and historic buildings.
That concerns Amendments Nos 6, 19 and 22.
In total, the Commission can, to a greater or lesser degree, accept 20 of the 83 amendments tabled for the vote in plenary tomorrow.
Of the remaining 63 amendments, which the Commission cannot accept for different reasons, most are of a fairly technical nature.
Allow me to make only a few comments on these amendments and our reasons for rejecting them.
Four amendments - 5, 27, 81 and 83 - aim to oblige the Commission to present tighter limit values and/or enlarge the scope of the present values at some later date.
Quite apart from the question of principle concerning the Commission's right of initiative, we firmly believe that it would be unwise to guess at what we should do in four or five years in order to improve air quality.
When we have the results of the Clean Air For Europe programme in a couple of years, we will be in a much better position to assess if, where and what action might be needed in order to improve air quality in a scientifically and economically justified manner.
Amendment No 12 proposes enlarging the scope of the directive by including VOCs with a boiling point - as several Members have mentioned - up to 280Â°C rather than the 250Â°C proposed by the Commission.
This is not acceptable to the Commission.
Firstly, because organic compounds with a boiling point above 250Â°C have a very low volatility: it takes several days for them to dry out and they have a very limited ozone formation potential.
In other words, they are of little environmental concern.
Secondly, because 250Â°C is the boiling point chosen to define VOCs in the EU eco-labelling scheme.
It would be both inconsistent and bizarre to choose a stricter definition for this proposal.
Mr Davies, B&Q/Kingfisher will be able to continue to use their labelling scheme.
No less than 36 amendments - 36 to 53, 55 to 57, 59 to 63, 65, and 67 to 77 - aim to change the limit values proposed by the Commission.
The Commission is aware that intense lobbying activities have been going on, both from industry and from environmental organisations, with a view to either softening or tightening the limit values proposed by the Commission.
However, so far the Commission has not been presented with convincing evidence that the values of the proposal are not well balanced, economically justified and technically achievable within the deadlines proposed.
Therefore the Commission, at this time, finds that it should stand by the limit values, procedures and deadlines proposed.
Thank you for your explanation, Commissioner.
There was one thing I did not understand.
You spoke about Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 13, both of which you consider acceptable.
If I have understood correctly, Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 13 exactly contradict each other.
One makes it possible to include diluents under the definition of solvents, and Amendment No 11 excludes just that.
Could you clarify this for me once more?
It is rather a technical question, but it is ultimately important as regards our voting list.
- (IT) Mr President, while the Commissioner takes note of the matter, I would like to say that I agree with Mrs Corbey.
This is exactly the sense of the proposal contained in the voting list proposed by the rapporteur: Amendment No 11 and Amendment No 13 are contradictory.
I would, however, say to Mrs Corbey that this is the result of a mistake on the part of our committee.
I therefore call upon the House to support and adopt Amendment No 11 but to vote against Amendment No 13, precisely in order to establish a definition of 'thinners' which is consistent with the rest of the legislation.
Mr President, we are just trying to see whether we have made any mistakes in interpreting the content of these two amendments.
We have accepted both of them in principle and, as far as we understand, they do not contradict each other, but we are looking into the details of the text.
Perhaps you can provide us with a better explanation of how you interpret them as contradicting each other.
We think they have the same content and the Commission has accepted them in principle.
I do not want to reopen the debate now, so I propose that we proceed with our work.
In the meantime, Commissioner, our services can attempt to clarify the situation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission (B5-0275/2003) by Mrs Jackson, on the progress report on European Union participation in the plan of implementation of the world summit on sustainable development.
Mr President, the oral question from Mrs Jackson and the draft resolution before Parliament today on the same subject are all very timely.
One year after our return from Johannesburg we must keep up the momentum and maintain political leadership in the European Union by delivering on our Johannesburg commitments.
I want to address the specific points in Mrs Jackson's oral question before taking the opportunity to add a few more general points on the Johannesburg follow-up.
Let me start by addressing the last issue raised in Mrs Jackson's question: the Commission's role in making sure that sustainable development becomes a major and regular aspect of forthcoming Spring Councils.
I would like to make three points in response to this part of the question.
First, by adding an external dimension to the GÃ¶teborg strategy, the European Council conclusions mean that the European Union's sustainable development strategy is the main vehicle for the implementation of the Johannesburg commitments.
Consistent with this approach, the Commission intends to continue addressing the follow-up of the World Summit in its annual synthesis reports in preparation for the Spring European Council meetings.
Second, the Commission is also undertaking an overall review of the sustainable development strategy to be ready by the time the new Commission takes up office.
The review, covering the period up until 2009, will further integrate the World Summit implementation into the revised strategy.
Third, the Commission services are now preparing a stocktaking document on the Summit follow-up that will be submitted by the end of 2003 and that may also include proposals for further action.
We want Parliament to be more closely involved in discussing the implementation of the World Summit commitments.
Let me now turn to the first part of the oral question, reporting specifically on the water and energy initiatives.
In our stocktaking paper on the World Summit follow-up the Commission plans to submit to Parliament and to the Council a detailed report on both initiatives.
'Water for Life' aims to bring sanitation and water to those who lack it most.
Currently 2.2 billion people die from water-related diseases each year, a figure that is unacceptable.
The EU initiative is focused on Africa, but will also cover other regions.
A ministerial conference in Addis Ababa in December 2003 should help to develop ownership among all African stakeholders.
The Commission has tabled an ambitious proposal to allocate EUR 1 billion from the European Development Fund to set up an EU water fund.
This money is already reserved in the budget, but the Council has so far been reluctant to free up the resources.
The European Union Energy Initiative for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development addresses access to affordable and sustainable energy services.
Nearly 30 developing countries from three continents have joined the initiative.
To take it forward in Africa the Commission will sponsor a high-level energy event to be held in Nairobi on 20 and 21 November 2003.
As in the case of water, ownership and awareness in recipient countries are essential to make progress.
Still on the subject of energy, the EU also launched in Johannesburg the Renewable Energy Coalition.
The Commission has agreed to host the Coalition secretariat.
We intend to work intensively in the coming months to ensure the Coalition is fully consolidated in time for the 2004 World Renewable Energy Conference in Germany.
On the final part of the oral question dealing with strengthened governance for sustainable development, this is clearly an essential requirement for progress in the World Summit implementation.
In this regard, the European Council has stressed the need to reinforce UNEP and to consider its institutional upgrading by creating a UN environment agency.
This is an important objective and our interaction with UNEP must be enhanced right away.
In the short term we need to expand UNEP's role in the World Summit implementation.
The results of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum in February 2003 should help to achieve this objective.
The results were very positive on chemicals, with a decision on the strategic approach to international chemicals management, setting up a process that should culminate in an Intergovernmental Conference in 2006.
UNEP was also asked to take an active role in the pursuit of the ten-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, agreed in Johannesburg.
The Global Ministerial Environment Forum will meet again in Korea in March 2004.
Water, sanitation and human settlements - the three items on the CSD agenda for 2004 and 2005 - will be the main focus of discussions.
Nevertheless, some of the unfinished business on international environmental governance will also need to be addressed, including matters such as UNEP's funding, the reinforcement of its scientific basis and its role in enforcing international environmental agreements.
Let me turn to some of the broader issues associated with the World Summit implementation and reflected in the draft resolution.
One year ago I came to Parliament and told you that the European Union could be proud of the leadership role it played during the Johannesburg Summit.
I also told you that our slogan for the summit would continue to guide us in the implementation phase: From Words to Deeds.
My own assessment is that work is in progress to implement our commitments across the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, both internally and externally, but events, and most recently the failure of the trade talks in CancÃºn, show the scale of the challenge we still face.
In March 2003 the European Council identified a set of priorities for implementing the sustainable development strategy and the Johannesburg outcomes.
Foremost amongst those priorities is policy coherence between external commitments and internal policies.
The reform of the common agricultural policy and the fisheries policy is a step in the right direction.
However, further efforts are needed in these and other areas, such as energy and transport.
Our credibility will suffer if unsustainable trends persist or if our policies have detrimental impacts outside the EU, in particular on the development opportunities of the poorest countries.
On sustainable consumption and production, the EU has been playing a leading role by promoting a broad mix of policies and tools, such as integrated pollution prevention and control, the eco-management and audit scheme and eco-labelling, as well as sectoral instruments in key areas such as energy or agriculture.
But we should not try to reinvent the wheel: we are assessing the measures and instruments implemented so far and identifying gaps.
We are also working with Member States to provide an overall assessment by the end of 2003.
Poverty eradication has been, and will continue to be, at the centre of our World Summit commitments, as will the development dimension.
This is a key issue when working towards the achievement of all internationally agreed development goals.
On the issue of financing for development, the Commission has been asked by Member States to closely monitor the commitments made before the Monterrey Conference.
Continued efforts will be needed to stick to our commitments against a background of sluggish economic growth and fiscal austerity.
In concluding, let me welcome Parliament's support in pushing for the EU to be in the forefront when it comes to delivery.
Two weeks ago the European Commission adopted a communication on our cooperation with the United Nations.
It was entitled: 'The Choice of Multilateralism' and in it we stated that the EU should adopt a determined front-runner approach to the negotiation and implementation of important initiatives in the fields of sustainable development, poverty reduction and international security.
We also called upon the UN itself to follow more closely an approach based on benchmarking and clear targets in the follow-up to major conferences, such as the World Summit.
I am confident that I can count on Parliament's continued support in pursuing these efforts.
Mr President, firstly, I too wish to say thank you to Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
I am well aware of her commitment to these issues, and the information she provided about what has happened following the Johannesburg Summit was welcome.
I also wish to thank Mr de Roo for his draft of a sound resolution, which we shall vote on tomorrow.
We all - or many of us at least - had high expectations prior to Johannesburg, but the outcome fell far short of these.
To a certain extent, I believe that the difficulties have to do with the fact that the work on sustainable development in a way runs counter to our traditional method of working.
In this context, we are required to work horizontally, that is to say to integrate the objective of economic growth with those of social development and of the effective protection and responsible management of the physical environment.
