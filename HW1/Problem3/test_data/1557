Until this is guaranteed, over-hasty and ill-considered expansion must not be allowed to occur.
According to the FRONTEX Annual Report for 2006, the apprehension figures at Schengen's current external borders (mainly Austria and Germany) are still far higher than those at the EU's external borders, so it is highly doubtful whether the expansion should be approved.
Indeed, the question is whether Schengen should not be abolished in part, especially since the Austrian Interior Ministry's report on human trafficking indicates that almost 50% of illegals in Austria have entered the country across the Schengen border with Italy.
in writing. - I do not oppose the suggested temporary solution to guarantee the existence of a network for SIS 1+ for the period from 13 November to 17 December 2008.
However, I cannot support the use of the passerelle in Article 67(2), indent 2, of the EC Treaty as suggested by Mr Coelho.
That is why I have chosen to vote against the report.
(SK) I am in favour of a reasonable compromise that would achieve a balance between health and environmental protection on the one hand and agricultural production on the other hand.
This is why I voted for the report prepared by my Slovak colleague, Mrs Irena BelohorskÃ¡, who is a recognised expert in the field of prevention and treatment of cancer diseases.
I congratulate her on the report which is based on her vast experience as a medical practitioner and which introduces a balanced strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides.
I believe that this report will contribute to the adoption of more effective measures for better information of the general public and lead to the setting up of correct application methods and a gradual reduction in the use of pesticides in agriculture.
A possible solution is to support farmers in ways that would encourage them to reduce the use of artificial fertilisers in their fight against diseases, pests and weeds on their farms, and in doing so help achieve a gradual changeover to bioproducts.
The report can inspire consumers not to choose, at a market or in a supermarket, only the best-looking produce but to give priority, for the sake of their health, to less visually appealing but healthier bioproducts.
(CS) All of us wish to breathe clean air and halt the melting of the glaciers.
At the same time, in spite of energy saving programmes, our need for energy is growing exponentially.
At stake is also Europe's dependency on gas and oil imports.
We must therefore invest in the development of renewable sources and tackle issues of nuclear power plants safety, in particular the question of final disposal of radioactive waste.
In this way we could obtain up to 14% of our energy from clean sources.
We cannot ignore, however, the fact that 32% of our energy comes from fossil fuels, employing 300 000 people and substantially polluting the environment.
This is why I welcome and have supported the report by Mr Reul on conventional sources.
I agree with the rapporteur that we should review investments and also develop those technologies capable of increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel energy production and reducing emissions.
We have much to work on.
(LT) Today we have reached an important decision on the strategy on the use of pesticides.
I voted in favour of the resolution.
We are well aware of the fact that the air we breath is polluted and therefore poses health risks and that the food we consume has been processed using chemicals that are dangerous to human health.
Our children, the future generation, are growing up in these conditions.
I am absolutely certain that the hazards that pesticides pose to human health must be reduced.
Therefore, we should take decisive measures and do our best to find the necessary funds.
I welcome the plans to require the Member States to draw up action plans highlighting the areas in which pesticides would be entirely banned and making substantial reductions in the use of pesticides within the next 10 years.
in writing. - (PT) It is well-known that, in July 2006, the Commission presented a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, together with a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for Community Action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides and a proposal for a regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, with the aim of reducing the general risks and negative impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment.
The risks associated with pesticide use have already been reduced, but, in some areas, particularly in countries which have for a long time used intensive agriculture, these can still be found in the soil and water in undesirable quantities.
This also means that countries such as Portugal, with more traditional agriculture, should receive more support in order to maintain less intensive agricultural production.
However, we do not feel that the solution lies in substituting GMOs for pesticides.
While the undesirable effects of chemical pesticides on human health are well-known, the precautionary principle should be applied with regard to the effects of GMOs on human health as these have not yet been studied.
This Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides only relates to plant protection products, in other words to one area of pesticides.
in writing. - (PL) I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has adopted a new directive on the production and use of pesticides.
The directive tightens up the conditions under which trade in the chemical substances used in the manufacture of plant protection products may be permitted.
The outcome will be beneficial to the citizens of the European Union, especially as regards their life and health.
In addition, the directive details the cases in which spraying from the air may take place.
It also recommends lowering the amount of pesticides used and prioritising non-chemical alternatives.
The report by Mrs BelohorskÃ¡ is worthy of support, if only because of the very wide but also up-to-date scope of the provisions.
There can be no doubt that European Union citizens no longer wish to have daily contact with toxins, and do not wish to consume contaminated products.
Our citizens do not wish either to be affected by carcinogenic or toxic substances, or by substances with endocrine-disrupting properties.
In response to these clear expectations expressed by European society, it was appropriate also to support a ban on the use of pesticides in rural and urban public areas.
The use of pesticides in areas surrounding hospices, sanatoria, rehabilitation centres, clinics and hospitals should be banned.
Such a ban should also extend to parks, public gardens, sports and leisure areas, school grounds, children's playgrounds and similar locations.
in writing. - (DE) The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides is an important addition to the proposal for a regulation and a directive which has been voted on at first reading today.
The Thematic Strategy is needed because the use of pesticides in the European Union has not decreased, despite the successful measures adopted voluntarily by some Member States between 1992 and 2003, and remains at a high level.
The BelohorskÃ¡ report underlines, once again, the need to apply the precautionary principle in the use of pesticides.
(LT) I consider the report on conventional energy sources and energy technology to be of the utmost importance.
The realities of life are forcing the EU Member States to change their attitude towards energy within both the EU and the world markets - resources, the energy mix and security of supply.
I would like to emphasise the importance of nuclear energy, as it is a secure, reliable and environmentally friendly resource.
The fact that Germany, which has 17 nuclear power plants, produces six times more CO2 pollution than France, with its 59 nuclear power stations, is very persuasive.
Nuclear energy is particularly important for countries that are not rich in renewable energy resources such as wind, solar energy, water and biomass, the use of the latter being particularly expensive.
Electricity is of the utmost importance and should be accessible to everyone.
I voted in favour of the report and would like to stress the importance of EU assistance for the construction of nuclear or other environmentally friendly power plants.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I just feel a need to clarify a few points about the new generation of nuclear technology.
It is worth remembering that Italy's nuclear power stations were shut down following a rescinding referendum in 1987, perhaps rightly so, although that has gradually placed us in a situation of dependence on foreign sources of energy.
However, the new generation of nuclear technology, which is clean and safe and environmentally friendly, is undoubtedly necessary to confront the problem of energy supply and climate change.
The energy mix must hence be updated and, along with renewables, clean coal and gas, nuclear will enable Europe to limit its dependence in future.
For this reason I voted in favour of the building of fourth-generation nuclear power stations, which will enable energy to be generated in a safer and more environmentally friendly manner.
I do, however, still have doubts, serious doubts and concerns, about the storage of nuclear waste.
The report may consider the problem of waste storage solved, but quite frankly I disagree: the waste problem is crucial and, if it is to be solved in the near future, requires a huge amount of investment in research.
To conclude, I believe that the choice of energy mix - just three more seconds please - to ensure security of energy supply for the Union in coming years must be altered as research progresses and in particular as new technologies develop.
(DE) Madam President, my colleagues from my delegation and I myself voted against the Reul report because we do not believe that nuclear energy is either safe or clean, and nor do we believe in the new generation of nuclear power plants and the new generation of nuclear energy.
If it really is the case - and there are reports and statistics about this - that nuclear energy is to have a massive impact in terms of reducing our CO2 emissions, then we will have to have a substantial increase in the number of our nuclear power stations.
That is neither realistic nor practicable.
For that reason - and I will speak more on this subject when the next report comes round - effective measures to improve energy efficiency and also to cut CO2 emissions from cars would be a better way of making Europe a healthier place and convincing other countries and continents to follow suit.
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote against the report as we do not consider it to be balanced and, among other things, it fails to address important problems in relation to nuclear energy.
Nor do we believe that the Union's energy research funds should be used to develop new generations of reactors for nuclear fission.
We question the value to the environment of synthetic fuels produced from fossil sources, or hydrogen gas extracted with energy from the same origin, or nuclear energy, as none of these energy sources is sustainable in the long term from an environmental or supply point of view.
We also believe that fossil fuels must be actively phased out in the long term, which is not mentioned in the report.
We think that CO2 capture can be an important part of reducing CO2 emissions, but other energy-saving, efficiency-boosting measures and the development of renewable energy are more sustainable in the long term and should be the final goal.
in writing. - (PT) This report contains various positive aspects, including the recognition of the role of conventional energy sources and the need to use these in order to produce energy, opening up prospects for the relaunch of nuclear fission energy and calling for the lifting of restrictions on new coal-fired power stations.
It also opens up prospects for the relaunch and mining of coal and calls for international cooperation, including with countries outside the EU, such as China and India.
In addition, it emphasises the value of endogenous resources and places the contribution of renewable energies on a more realistic plane.
It contains certain criticisms of the production and use of liquid biofuels and points to the need for countries to encourage more R&D in the area of energy, particularly as a way of overcoming environmental and nuclear safety problems.
However, it also contains various negative aspects, including the association of the growing problems in the oil market solely with contextual and episodic issues, while disregarding the strategic issue of depletion of resources and continuing to ignore the enormous potential of biomethane produced from waste, an approach which is already being implemented in various European countries.
This is the reason for our abstention.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this own-initiative report on energy issues which canvasses many areas of energy efficiency, supply and conservation.
I did not support amendments endorsing nuclear power: my view is that sustainable, renewable energy resources should be developed and that research & development efforts should focus on these areas first.
in writing. - (DE) In principle, we all agree that we need better energy efficiency and more rational energy transmission and that the expansion of renewables is important.
Nonetheless, the promotion of renewables must not be used as a pretext to curtail even more of the Member States' sovereign rights by the back door as part of the EU's Constitution.
As this point is not made sufficiently clear in the present report, the report must be rejected.
Despite the ongoing expansion of renewable energy sources, we will remain dependent on conventional energy generation for many decades to come, and we must therefore ensure that it becomes more environmentally friendly.
In the EU, however, there still appears to be a fixation with nuclear power, which is not only reflected in its glowing description as an 'environmentally friendly source of energy', which itself is a mockery, but also in the generous funding of the nuclear research budget.
I see in this a failure to rethink our approach in any discernible way, which is another reason why I reject the report which is the subject of the vote.
in writing. - (DE) The Reul report is an apology for the nuclear industry.
Flying in the face of common sense, nuclear energy is depicted as the technology of the future, with even more EU research funding and budgetary resources to flow into the development of this high-risk dinosaur technology.
Indeed, despite the recent 'incidents' at Vattenfall's nuclear plants, the focus is on expanding nuclear energy in Europe.
In light of these incidents, it is extremely cynical to claim that nuclear energy generation is becoming 'ever-safer'.
Instead of continuing to invest in this troublesome energy form, with a deliberate failure to address the issue of final storage, a social and ecological revolution should finally be the aim.
This means breaking apart the private monopolies which exist in the nuclear industry, providing a massive injection of funding for renewables and localising energy production.
Given that it is the nuclear companies, in particular, which have initiated a new round of massive price increases, there is an urgent need for action.
The report merely serves the profit interests of Europe's nuclear industry.
The call for new nuclear power plants in Europe is unacceptable.
The legal basis for funding for an indefinite period is to be enshrined in the Reform Treaty.
This is yet another reason to reject the Treaty.
Every additional cent for EU nuclear funding is one too many.
Promoting energy production from renewable resources, solar, wind and hydro power, is the only sustainable energy policy.
in writing. - (PT) When it launched the Energy Package at the beginning of this year, the European Commission highlighted the need for a technological action plan for fossil fuels and underlined the fundamental requirement for a pragmatic approach towards nuclear energy.
The reality is stark: there are no alternatives to fossil fuels which are as cheap and as efficient.
This means that these fuels will remain the central and essential component of the EU's energy policy beyond 2020.
This is why we must find new solutions to the energy supply issue in the EU, bearing in mind the need for competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply.
As a result, all investments in the development of new energy technologies, firstly to reduce environmental impact and enhance the safety of existing installations and secondly to develop new energy sources and ensure more efficient and cleaner use of fossil fuels, are of particular importance.
As it is essential that Member States and the EU concentrate their efforts on energy research, from more efficient use of energy sources to new technologies and the cleaner use of existing energy sources, I voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Reul on conventional energy sources and energy technology.
The report raises a very important current issue that calls for broad debate within the European Union, namely that we need a unified strategy and should develop a common energy policy.
Ensuring Europe's energy security is a priority issue, and the Commission's proposal to submit a European Strategic Energy Technology Plan to the 2008 Spring European Council is therefore very welcome.
As a world leader, the European Union must also take the lead in the development of modern energy technologies whilst maintaining all the relevant economic and environmental standards.
in writing. - (SV) I have chosen to support the report because the EU has conducted an unusually balanced discussion of the need to include nuclear energy in Europe's future energy mix.
Among other things, the report states that 'nuclear energy is indispensable if basic energy needs are to be met in Europe in the medium term', and that 'nuclear energy is currently the largest low-carbon energy source in Europe and [it] stresses its potential role in combating climate change'.
At present nuclear energy is responsible for one third of the EU's electricity supply and will always be one of the most important energy sources in many EU Member States.
When the issue of CO2 emissions is raised, it is unfortunate in my view that greater attention is not given to nuclear energy.
If we are to meet future energy demand without greater dependence on fossil fuels and rising CO2 emissions, the development of safe, new nuclear energy will become increasingly important.
Unfortunately, nuclear energy is not included among the measures that are considered to be realistic with a view to achieving the target of between 20% and 30% by 2020.
(CS) Today we gave the car industry the task of developing engines which will reduce CO2 emissions to less than 120 g/km. Currently the figure stands at 157 g.
I want to warn, however, those who applauded this proposal that reducing emissions is greatly hindered by the increasing number of drivers in general as well as the high number of drivers driving old vehicles.
Double regulation of advertising will not solve the issue.
It is well-known that the majority of people give priority to cost-efficiency when buying a car, rather than the vehicle's environmental impact.
Costs, but also emissions are growing also because of the imposition of increased vehicle safety.
Ladies and gentlemen, until vehicles with a lower environmental impact and running costs become more affordable, road transport's share of emissions will not show any considerable decrease.
This is why I was not among those applauding today's report.
Neither the committee's report nor the Commission's strategy are sufficiently comprehensive.
This is why I supported other proposals, related to fines for exceeding emission limits and especially fiscal measures and car fleet renewal support.
(SK) The report just adopted on the future CO2 strategy for cars contributes without any doubt to one of the most polarised debates taking place in the European Parliament at present.
At stake are not only the environment, and therefore the health of EU citizens, but also the competitiveness of an important industry.
I voted for the amendment since it represents a compromise between both aspects.
It pays attention to environmental protection and at the same time provides suitable and realistic terms for the European car industry.
Car advertising represents up to 20% of total advertising turnover for publishers of printed media.
Laying down mandatory advertising requirements as stipulated in the original report by Mr Chris Davies would breach the fundamental principle of freedom of expression.
This is why I voted in favour of the amendments that leave out the controversial paragraphs 36 to 41 of the report.
I supported the PPE-DE motion inviting car manufacturers to sign up to a voluntary code of practice on car advertising.
After most amendments were adopted, in the final vote I voted for the report by Mr Chris Davies.
The outcome of the vote is a clear political signal in favour of preparing European legislation dealing with the issue of cutting CO2 emissions.
(DE) Madam President, we do still have the legislation by means of which Parliament can demonstrate that we take climate protection seriously in Europe, and we need to summon all our efforts so that we can genuinely achieve, through that legislation, everything that we have not voted on today.
I think it is regrettable that we have not committed to a 120 g/km ceiling from 2012.
More than ten years have passed since our industry promised to achieve this with its proposed self-regulation on the grounds that this approach would be better and more efficient, and I would have liked the House to send out a clear climate policy message today.
We have not done so.
That is why I have also voted against the report, and I hope that in the legislation, we will show more grit and determination and make it clear that we really take climate issues seriously in Europe.
(CS) I voted against the proposal of the report on the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars, although for reasons different from those mentioned here earlier.
I voted against the proposal because with it we are moving away from an integrated approach, contained in the earlier strategy documents, and placing the whole burden of CO2 emissions reduction on the European car industry instead.
I also disagree with the call for an obligatory allocation of 20% of advertising space.
It bears a dangerous resemblance to the information campaign on the harmful effects of smoking.
Such an approach overall turns CO2 emissions reduction into a dogma which, when translated into future binding legislation, will result in a reduction in our competitiveness.
(DE) Madam President, I voted against the Davies report because, in my view, we have taken what is, in essence, an unacceptable and unrealistic decision by envisaging uniform CO2 efficiency categories for cars.
There should have been a sliding scale based on size and weight, primarily to level the playing field for manufacturers in the European Union.
Let me give you an example: it makes a difference whether I heat a house or just one room.
That is why it also makes a difference whether I drive a large car or a small car.
That is why there needs to be segmentation and a sliding scale based on weight.
We have missed that opportunity, which I think is regrettable, and with this decision - which I did not support - we have also missed the opportunity to establish a measure of balance between the interests of the environment and those of industry.
(DE) Madam President, I voted against the Davies report because, as a result of the amendments adopted, we are still a long way from the optimum situation, which is to protect the environment, on the one hand, but also promote employment in Europe and not burden the consumer unduly with excessively high prices.
In essence, the decisions that we have taken are at the expense of employment and the consumer.
In technical terms, we have moved away from the integrated approach which would have been essential to create a situation in which everyone contributes to cutting CO2 emissions, not only the car manufacturers but also the manufacturers of other vehicle components.
We have abandoned that route.
What is more, we have not included weight and we have not completed weight segmentation, which is important for European competitiveness, because it is the higher-weight vehicles that are at the forefront of innovation, the innovation that Europe needs.
We have set timeframes which are difficult or expensive to achieve and we have taken the absurd step of not heeding the call for CO2-based taxes in the Member States, which means that the old vehicles which pump out CO2 are still on the market and on the road.
That is why I have voted against the report.
Madam President, I have two points to make, the first on the procedure, the second on the voting list.
On the voting list: firstly, there was no mention of paragraph 3; secondly, I think we should look again at what happened about Amendments 52 and 51.
If you look at it, 51 is clearly the nearest to the original text and should have been voted first.
52 is furthest away and should have been voted second.
I would ask that the Presidency look at this because that is clearly what should have happened.
So, on those procedural points, I would like some answers.
Secondly, on the politics of it, this was the first real vote on climate change.
It was not a piece of legislation - that will come - but, by failing to support the 2012 date backed by the European Commission, I think that the ALDE Group and the PPE-DE Group in this House failed the first test on climate change and the people out there will be looking at what happened here today and wondering whether we really are serious about the commitments we made back in March to reduce CO2.
We talk about Europe being a Europe of the environment.
We have to do it in legislation if it is ever going to happen.
in writing. - (FR) Mrs Castex voted for the Davies report on the reduction of CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles.
While France continues to be monopolised by the Grenelle Environment Forum, the European Union has in turn added another valuable building block to the quality of our environment by adopting a strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from private vehicles.
Mrs Castex is very pleased that Parliament has called on the European automotive industry to ensure that new vehicles do not emit more than 120 g/km of CO2 by 2012.
This French Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcomes the Carbon Allowance Reductions System (CARS), as this mechanism will impose financial penalties on manufacturers who fail to meet their quotas, while at the same time issuing credits to those who have taken the initiative by achieving emissions that are below the limit value curve.
in writing. - (SV) We have essentially voted in favour of Mr Davies' report on a strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from cars.
In order to reduce CO2 emissions, it must be a priority to reduce the proportion that comes from car traffic.
It is important to find more environmentally friendly alternatives to using cars.
However, in our view car manufacturers should be given the opportunity to choose themselves how they wish to meet the environmental targets set by us politicians.
Legislation should not regulate in detail how this should happen.
We also oppose the rapporteur's rules on advertising, which are unjustified and restrict freedom of expression.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report.
Some 19% of all CO2 emissions produced in the Community now come from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles.
The European Union must commit itself to an ambitious and realistic target for reducing average emissions from all vehicles placed on the EU market.
The impact of road transport on air quality must be reduced as the vehicle fleet is gradually renewed.
I welcome the adoption of the deadlines that have been set by Parliament.
If verifiable and measurable actions are to be taken by the automotive industry after 2011, setting 2015 as the date for achieving a threshold of 125 g/km seems perfectly reasonable to me.
Indeed this corresponds to the entry into force of the Euro VI emission standards.
For legislation to be effective it must above all be realistic and the industry has for a long time been putting environmental issues at the heart of its policies.
When it comes to climate change the priority must be to reduce CO2 emissions in absolute terms.
in writing. - (NL) The Davies report deserves support because of the political signal it sends.
All sectors will have to do their bit to remedy the climate change problem, including the European car industry.
That is why I warmly support the compromise to achieve a maximum of 125g CO2/km by 2015.
For the Netherlands, the Davies report has another extra dimension that is undeniable.
Because of the problem of particulate matter in the air in the Netherlands, it is necessary that measures be taken at European level to tackle this at source.
If this does not happen, then for transport-intensive areas like the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol airport, it will be impossible for us to meet the present and/or stricter norms for particulate matter.
I am in favour of better information to consumers about the environmental friendliness of particular cars, like what we have now for fridges and washing machines for instance, but I voted against the proposal for cigarette-type warnings to be made compulsory in all advertising and marketing statements from the car industry.
In the area of advertising and marketing, I have more faith in self-regulation than all kinds of European legal obligations.
in writing. - (DE) I voted against Mr Davies' report on the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles.
Having initially voted in favour of the report in the direct voting in plenary, I then withdrew my vote in writing, as noted in the parliamentary records of 25 October 2007.
In my view, the report is extremely arbitrary and fails to take appropriate account of the needs of Germany's automobile industry or environmental concerns.
For example, the report does not differentiate between the various weight classes of vehicles and therefore makes unrealistic demands of car manufacturers.
As regards advertising, an increasing comparison is made between labelling needs for tobacco products and vehicles.
The rapporteur (Mr Davies, an English Green Liberal) was only prepared to compromise on one point at the very end of the process during the deliberations on his report.
This was much too late to formulate a sensible recommendation from Parliament which could have secured the support of all the groups.
in writing. - I voted for the original version of this report, which proposed tough limits on emissions of 120g carbon dioxide/kilometre by 2012.
Unfortunately, the proposal was weakened by Tory and Liberal MEPs to allow for a higher emissions limit and a longer phase-in period.
The overall strategy is good, but it is a pity it has been weakened unnecessarily.
in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has approved the Community Strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from passenger cars and I welcome this very much.
This initiative will enable us to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and at the same time contribute towards achieving the EU's more general environmental targets and energy security objectives.
Nevertheless, I believe that the message that this vote has sent to the Commission and to the international community at large could have been a more ambitious one.
The 120 g/km threshold for CO2 was first put forward in 1995 as a feasible target for the automotive industry.
Now 12 years later its implementation is still being resisted, even though technological advances have meant that CO2 emissions can now be reduced more than was possible a dozen years ago.
In being satisfied with a maximum mandatory limit of 125 g/km of CO2 Parliament does not go far enough.
For this reason I voted against Amendments 42 and 52 because their objectives, under the pretence of being prudent and realistic, are in fact simply too moderate.
At a time when the consumer is becoming increasingly sensitive to pollution from motor vehicles, any measure aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from this source will benefit the car industry, the consumer and, of course, the planet itself.
in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the proposals to introduce a binding average emissions ceiling, albeit with some concern.
In my view, a sliding scale based on the size and weight of the vehicle would have been preferable.
Although I otherwise tend to be in favour of voluntary commitments from industry, I believe that binding legal requirements are essential for the automobile industry: experience has shown that voluntary commitments here would be bound to fail.
As we know, a reduction of around 5% in greenhouse gas emissions from the EU-25 was achieved between 1990 and 2004.
Not for road traffic, however: in stark contrast, this sector saw a rise of 26%.
There is clearly an urgent need for action here, and the car industry must make its contribution to cutting emissions.
The year 2012 for the introduction of the ceiling has been criticised on the grounds that it does not allow a long enough phase-in period.
However, this date has been in discussion for years, and the industry has known what to expect for a very long time.
The issue which we must always consider, however, is balancing environmental interests and the interests of the car industry, as this is also in the interests of jobs and competitiveness in the European Union.
This is a buoyant industry and it is important for the EU.
Without robust industries, we would have no money for environmental programmes!
(LT) So far the Member States have only succeeded in reaching an agreement on the consolidation of indirect taxation - excise duty and VAT, determination of the minimum rate, the application of numerous VAT exemptions.
I doubt that a minimum excise duty rate - for fuel, for example - would increase economic competitiveness.
It is more likely to result in increased prices and reduced consumption, particularly in view of the global increase in prices.
The proposed coordination of excise duties would constitute an unbearable burden to new Member States.
The proposed consolidation of tax bases at EU level would have been more appropriate for the economies of the 15 old Member States, as they have similar development levels.
This proposal is a step towards the consolidation of tax on profits.
The greatest burden would fall on the weaker economies of the new Member States.
This would lead to a loss of opportunity for them to benefit from tax competition as well as accelerate their economic growth.
It would deprive them of the chance to raise their standard of living to match that of the old Member States.
I voted against the report, as it was ill-timed, in spite of the amendments.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats believe first and foremost that taxation policy should be a national matter.
The report also stresses the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States.
We chose to vote in favour of the report as in many ways it stresses the role of taxation policy in the Member States as regards employment, welfare and the environment, as well as a well-functioning internal market.
in writing. - (FR) I supported Amendment 20, as tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which seeks to delete paragraph 17 of the Wagenknecht report concerning the contribution of taxation to the Lisbon strategy.
In order to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market I am in fact in favour of any measure that contributes towards fiscal harmonisation within the EU.
While taxation is still essentially a matter of national sovereignty, it has very quickly become apparent that we need to ensure a minimum degree of fiscal coordination between the Member States.
This is why, in matters relating to indirect taxation, the Commission has gradually established a minimum rate for excise duty, in order to reduce distortion of competition.
Yet in the report that is being voted on today, paragraph 17 now seeks to re-examine this very system and proposes to replace it with a code of conduct.
I do not believe that it is sufficient merely to 'encourage' Member States when it comes to coordinating indirect taxation.
What is more, I believe even less in the effectiveness of a code of conduct on excise duty matters: this is likely to provide even greater temptation to unpick the EU's rules and practices, which would in turn create the sorry situation of unfair competition in this area.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against the final text because, among other issues, it assumed a position of defence of economic and financial groups, as highlighted by the rapporteur who removed her name from the report before the final vote and called for it to be rejected.
The resolution aims to ease the rules and procedures so that large undertakings can easily enter the various markets and reap the largest profits with the least number of obstacles in any Member State.
Furthermore, we consider that the fiscal sovereignty of Member States in terms of defining their own fiscal policy must be respected in all discussions on this issue.
This is not what has happened here.
A supposedly common European fiscal policy which promotes 'tax competition' would only serve the interests of major European and international capital.
Available data show that, in the last 10 years, there has been a significant drop in the average rate of taxation of corporate profits, whilst income tax has remained virtually unchanged.
We regret that the proposals made by the rapporteur, which highlighted the redistribution potential of taxation and pointed out the transfer of the tax burden from high incomes to lower incomes, have not been included in this final text.
in writing. - (SV) The June List is firmly opposed to this report, which seeks to move towards a common taxation and customs policy for the EU.
It is amazing that today the European Parliament is taking decisions on matters for which there is no common policy.
It is not for the EU to decide on taxation matters and promptly to call on the Member States to harmonise their national taxes.
In addition, it is entirely unreasonable to try to move towards the imposition of a Community tax.
In the report it is also possible to see how the Lisbon Strategy opens the door for the EU to tackle new policy areas, with supranationalism, new projects and increased costs in their wake.
The June List is voting against this report, as taxation must be decided nationally and sovereignly by the Member States.
in writing. - (FR) The report on the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy, as voted on by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, constitutes an acceptable compromise between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the one hand, and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on the other, and I support it.
I am also glad to see that we have succeeded in maintaining this balance during the vote in plenary.
For me the key point in the report is paragraph 4, which underlines the benefits of healthy tax competition in the European Union.
If indeed we wish to achieve the objectives of economic growth and employment, as set out in the Lisbon Strategy, we must ensure that we do not impose too great a tax burden on undertakings, for it is they who create the jobs.
What is more, we should never overtax employees and consumers, either directly or indirectly, for they make a considerable contribution to growth.
Tax competition forces Member States within the Union to moderate their fiscal demands and to be more efficient in the management of public spending, and this can only be of benefit to the taxpayer.
The common consolidated corporate tax base, which is another controversial theme in the report, would in my view bring an element of coordination to fiscal policy that will render European corporate taxation less bureaucratic and more efficient.
in writing. - (EL) Tax policy is used to redistribute income for the benefit of capital.
It is used by all centre-right and centre-left governments, and governs capital in the EU.
There is no common tax policy because of intra-imperialist conflicts.
Even if such a policy existed, however, capital would be furthering its own profitability at the expense of ordinary people's income and needs.
Amid unrelenting competition, capital now moves easily and rapidly from high-tax countries to countries with lower taxation.
Indeed, in all the Member States, the corporate income tax rate is decreasing at the expense of personal income.
However, this is not true of tax on labour income, which remains constant, while indirect taxes and VAT have risen, increasing inequality and the gap between rich and poor.
This is also reflected in OECD figures, which show that indirect tax in the form of VAT rose to 6.9% of GDP in 2006.
Thus capital is systematically being exempted from tax and the levy on workers is being increased through indirect taxation.
This is happening in Greece as well: corporation tax has been reduced by 10% and VAT has increased by 1%, with a further increase of 2% on the way.
This is the barbarity of capitalism, which creates inequality and poverty for the majority of people, and we must reverse this.
in writing. - While the report contains a number of positive elements concerning greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden, I cannot support any increased role for the European Union in relation to taxation, which would further undermine the economic sovereignty of Member States.
in writing. - The Fine Gael delegation in the European Parliament decided to oppose the Report on the final vote because of the proliferation of references to the CCCTB and related matters.
We support the Lisbon Agenda and are in favour of the Report, such as recognising the positive aspects of lower taxation and the benefits of tax competition, but do not accept the right of EU Institutions to interfere with the rights of Member States, such as Ireland, who are also in the Eurozone.
Interest rates are set by the ECB and the Growth and Stability Pact sets borrowing and inflation requirements.
Tax policy is therefore one of the instruments left to those Member States under the Treaty and should be safeguarded.
in writing. - There are many ways in which fiscal attitudes across the EU could be helpful in generating a series of better conclusions for the Lisbon Strategy.
Simply put, the incentivisation of growth of small businesses and job creation, as well as environmental issues, is seen as a positive.
This is for Member States to undertake and follow through - such is their competence.
Consolidating tax bases at an EU level would not make the difference suggested by the rapporteur.
The EPLP maintains that many good things towards the Lisbon Strategy can be reached by Member State action rather than EU action.
in writing. - (DE) In its vote today, the European Parliament has shown that a majority of its Members support a taxation policy which serves the interests of the top ten thousand and is to the detriment of the large majority of people living in the European Union.
Although some of my proposals were accepted - after all, no one is keen to openly champion the cause of increased rates of VAT, higher taxes on earned income or better opportunities for EU-wide tax dumping - the proposals we made on increasing taxes on wealth and financial transactions and limiting tax dumping through the introduction of a uniform consolidated corporate tax base were rejected by the majority of Members.
As the final report after the individual votes was almost unrecognisable as my original draft, with certain aspects of its content deteriorating further in the version of the report agreed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I felt compelled to remove my name from the report and call for Members to vote against it in the final vote.
I welcome the fact that relevant sections of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also felt unable to endorse the final version of the report, as the outcome of the voting shows.
Today, the House has passed up the opportunity to heed calls for a more equitable and socially compatible taxation policy and adopt this as the clear position of the European Parliament.
Instead, the EU's misdirected policies have yet again been confirmed unquestioningly by the majority in the European Parliament.
in writing. - (SV) Today I chose to support the report on the contribution of taxation policy to the Lisbon process.
I advocate healthy tax competition and a common consolidated corporate tax base for international companies, without harmonisation of tax levels and with an option for each Member State to remain outside it, if it so wishes.
It is also important to lay down the Member States' sovereignty in the field of taxation.
I also take exception to any attempt to move towards an EU tax.
(SK) I admire and respect the determination with which some countries have introduced a smoking ban not only in offices and in all workplaces but also in restaurants, pubs, bars and clubs.
We have economic impact studies that have not confirmed worries of restaurant owners about an income loss.
We also know that the treatment of respiratory cancer diseases and other illnesses costs us up to EUR 50 million.
In Scotland, the number of people admitted to hospital with myocarditis has decreased by almost 20% since the introduction of the smoking ban.
Children born to women smokers as well as to women exposed to passive smoking during pregnancy are born prematurely and have lower than normal birth weight.
I appeal to the Member States of the European Union, including my own Member State, to introduce without delay effective laws that would result in a smoking ban in workplaces and restaurants, and in effective measures for reducing the overall use of tobacco.
(RO) At the same time with voting on this report, I would like to emphasize its importance for the future of the European citizens and of the entire European Union.
I welcome the strategic approach of the smoking issue, including passive smoking, as well as the proposal of concrete and exigent actions to fight against it and its negative consequences at a European level.
Also, I am convinced that a strategic approach of this issue should include the smoking prevention policy, as an essential element, by developing a true system of education in this respect.
Today's reality is obvious; there is a clear and increasing need for awareness as regards the consequences of smoking among the entire European society.
It is not less important to focus these efforts of prevention on educating children and youth, as well as their parents, in advance, in order to ensure a smoke-free Europe for future generations.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to explain my vote on the report by Mr Florenz on combating the worrying phenomenon of nicotine addiction.
I wish to emphasise that I voted in favour of this report, despite being an advocate of freedom for smokers and despite obviously being a defender of pluralism.
Nonetheless, the problem of the harmful effects of so-called passive smoking, that is to say the effect on non-smokers of being surrounded by smokers, is very alarming indeed.
Suffice it to remind the House that the deaths of 650 000 people a year are smoking related.
This figure includes 80 000 passive smokers, some of whom are children.
That is the reason why we should impose limitations on the freedom of certain individuals in order to prevent deaths.
(FI) Madam President, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with this report.
It is excellent that we are adopting a clear position against passive smoking.
I voted for this report because it is high time we acted at European Union level to prevent people from actually being exposed to the dangers of tobacco smoke.
As we heard earlier, 650 000 people die each year from the effects of smoking.
It is time to take action.
Despite my support for the proposal, I know that it will be difficult to put into practice and implement everywhere.
Article 11 incorporates the notion that smoking should be banned in private cars everywhere in the EU if underage children are present.
This is a good aim, but we have to consider how it might be monitored.
A smoke-free environment is a goal we should strive for, but in future we will need to pay more attention to ensuring that the action we take is reasonable and that compliance with the law can be monitored.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of course we all know that smoking is bad for our health.
Nevertheless, I voted against the report on a smoke-free Europe as a matter of principle, for it is true to say that nowhere else has the state asserted itself quite so successfully as in the fight against smoking in public.
Countries in the EU - and that includes us - are intervening on an unprecedented scale, with their smoking bans, in citizens' private habits.
We are experiencing a state-sponsored prohibition policy across the board, designed to train people to change their behaviour.
The report itself makes this clear.
Unanimity - or, as we have it today - virtual unanimity is no guarantee of freedom.
The opposite is true.
In essence - and this is something we should recognise - freedom thrives on the opportunity to deviate from the norm.
Concerned citizens are on the march, we have the nanny state, and all those who have anything to do with this and support it think that it has nothing to do with liberty.
They are quite wrong!
(DE) Madam President, yes, I also voted against the report on a smoke-free Europe, although by doing so, I am subjecting myself to what is tantamount to a witch-hunt, even in the House by the way.
That is the reason why so many of our fellow Members simply did not have the courage to vote against the report, even though they do not want this nannying policy either.
Of course I am in favour of protecting non-smokers, children and young people, but a matter of principle is at stake.
Firstly, we have no health policy competence. That lies with the Member States.
Anything else is a violation of subsidiarity and is a constructed competence at EU level.
Secondly, and more particularly, we have had enough!
We have had enough, ladies and gentlemen!
For years, the EU has waged war on smokers, alcohol and the obese in Europe, apparently on the assumption that our citizens are stupid and need nannying through legislation.
That is precisely what I am opposed to.
The citizens who I represent are not stupid.
A prohibition policy is always counterproductive and my job is to represent people, not nanny them.
Madam President, if ever there was an issue that cried out for subsidiarity, it is surely that of smoking.
Pass over the hypocrisy of subsidising the growing of tobacco in the European Union while penalising its consumption.
Disregard the double standard of discouraging smoking within the EU but encouraging it outside.
Focus instead on the more basic question of what any of this has to do with Brussels.
Surely the legal and fiscal status of tobacco is a national prerogative, and the question of where and when we may consume it should be decided more locally still: in a privately-owned space by the proprietor of that space, and in a public space by the municipal authorities.
It ought to have nothing to do with national governments and certainly nothing to do with the European Union.
Subsidiarity, colleagues - remember that?
(PL) Madam President, during this sitting we have debated the report by Mr Florenz on limiting the right to smoke cigarettes.
I voted against this report because I believe that restrictions should only be imposed in cases where smoking will harm other people.
We cannot, however, ban people who wish to harm themselves from doing so.
That amounts to an intrusion into the rights of the individual that goes beyond the rights of any employer.
The issue of treatment-related costs is of course relevant, but that is simply a matter for those responsible for insuring others.
If it were deemed appropriate, the rates for smokers could be increased to cover treatment costs.
There is another issue worthy of mention too, namely subsidiarity.
Previous speakers have already referred to it and of course I entirely agree that this issue, which is in any case essentially flawed, must come under the competence of national authorities, not that of the European Union.
in writing. - (DE) I welcome all measures in the Member States to inform citizens about the risks of smoking.
In my view, all these measures fall within the purview of the Member States, not the European Union.
I have therefore rejected the Florenz report in the final vote.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mr Florenz's report on the 'Green Paper: Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level' as I consider it essential that appropriate steps are taken to reduce the number of deaths and serious illnesses caused by tobacco smoke.
In that regard, I support the call for the Commission to amend Directive 2001/37/EC on tobacco products in order, in light of new scientific advances, to revise the rules on the use of additives and other substances in these products, particularly in relation to carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic additives.
in writing. - (FR) Strasbourg is not Qom and the European Parliament is not the 'supreme leader' who has been sent down to dispense propriety and righteousness across the Union.
Everybody now knows that smoking is bad for your health.
But life itself is dangerous, for it always ends in death.
I personally have never smoked in my life.
While it does not shock me that some adults are prepared to take the risk, I never cease to be amazed at the proselytising of the ayatollahs on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who, by issuing own-initiative report after report, are attempting to 'save the planet' to the detriment of human beings and their weaknesses.
I say 'no' to these zealots.
in writing. - (PL) As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and also as a non-smoker aware of the many negative consequences of cigarette smoking in one's immediate surroundings, I welcome the report by Mr Florenz entitled: 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke'.
I believe it is entirely appropriate for the European Parliament itself to send out a firm and unequivocal message to all EU citizens and Member States making it clear that we do not wish to see people smoking in public places, notably in restaurants, in bars and on public transport.
We particularly do not wish to see people smoking in the workplace.
We are also calling for stricter measures against the sale of cigarettes to minors.
In addition, I think the introduction of restrictions should be accompanied by a wide-ranging information campaign that should cover more than the harmful effects of smoking.
The latter are generally well-known, but it also needs to be made clear that non-smokers' rights to live in a smoke-free environment cannot be dependent on or restricted by smokers wishing to exercise their right to smoke at the expense of non-smokers.
If our appeal for a Europe free from tobacco smoke is to bear fruit, we Members of the European Parliament should set an example and give up smoking at our workplace.
That means no more smoking in any Parliament premises.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for this report which seeks not only to support Member States in the strict measures they have adopted to combat tobacco addiction, but also to promote better public health.
Not only is tobacco smoke a major source of air pollution, the chemicals contained in cigarettes expose smokers and non-smokers alike to serious risk.
This is particularly true in enclosed spaces, such as workplaces, bars and restaurants.
It therefore seems essential to me that we should clearly and unilaterally ban smoking in such places.
Imposing strict legislation designed to provide maximum protection for the health of our citizens cannot effectively be achieved without a real effort at alerting and informing the public as to the risks associated with tobacco use.
I also welcome the willingness that has been expressed to direct information campaigns at certain target groups, especially the young, pregnant women and parents.
Finally, I regret that an amendment has been adopted calling on the Commission to investigate the health risks associated with chewing tobacco and the impact this has on cigarette consumption.
I believe that this request does not belong in a report such as this, for the health risks presented by chewing tobacco, namely cancer of the tongue and so on, are generally recognised.
in writing. - I voted for this report, which sets out the options for reducing the harm caused by tobacco smoke across the European Union.
It does not call for EU legislation, but calls on Member States to institute comprehensive smoking bans within two years.
The UK already has such a ban, but given the harm tobacco causes I support this sensible approach being extended across the EU.
in writing. - (DE) Smoking bans are, of course, in the interests of public health and, for public buildings, are therefore to be welcomed.
It is also sensible to protect children and young people.
However, with these particular groups, it would be more helpful if people set a good example and maintained existing anti-smoking campaigns.
It is hypocritical, however, for the European Union to attempt to prescribe smoking bans wholesale for all Member States when it has shown itself to be incapable of even reaching an agreement on facilities here in the House.
Our democratic system and modern attitudes to life are based on freedom of choice and, logically, this should apply to smoking as well.
If a majority of the population is in favour of a smoking ban in restaurants, then this will come into effect over the short or the long term.
There is already a trend for people to become non-smokers and, in line with the principle of sovereignty, it should remain a matter for each country to decide whether smoking bans should be introduced in restaurants, for example, and what form these bans should take.
in writing. - (EL) I have supported the Florenz report on the Green Paper 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke'.
I believe it will contribute to public health protection and help substantially in reducing the harmful effects of smoking, both in young people and in chronic smokers.
It will achieve this by pushing for the immediate prohibition of all additives that strengthen addiction and by promoting preventive measures at European and Member State level.
in writing. - I strongly support smoking bans in public places to protect public health and to avert the dangers of passive smoking.
A Scottish ban on smoking in public places has now been in place for 19 months, and figures show that since the smoking ban was introduced there has been a 20% reduction in heart attack admissions to hospital.
The smoking ban has therefore saved lives and has been effective in promoting better health for Scots.
I look forward to seeing this approach applied across the rest of Europe.
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Florenz entitled: 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke'.
Tobacco smoke is a very harmful substance.
It contains thousands of chemical substances, including over 250 carcinogenic and toxic components.
Even the slightest exposure to these substances can contribute to the development of tumours.
Tobacco smoke particles are deposited permanently in enclosed areas causing air pollution that even the best ventilation systems cannot deal with effectively.
Thousands of people die each year in the European Union as a result of passive smoking.
These deaths could be prevented.
It has to be possible for every European Union citizen to live and work in surroundings that are free from tobacco smoke.
This must be emphasised particularly in connection with public institutions and premises.
Seventy per cent of the population of the European Union is non-smoking.
We must bear this in mind and ensure that these people are able to live in a clean and safe environment.
(SK) I voted against the report because it does not clearly reflect the European Union position on Turkey.
It is necessary to freeze accession talks with Turkey completely. There are numerous reasons for doing so.
At present Turkey is an untrustworthy partner.
By refusing Turkey's EU entry, in other words by telling the Turks the truth about their future EU membership, we would help the country democratise their society at last.
Turkey continues to occupy a Member State of the European Union: 40% of Cypriot territory is under Turkish military occupation.
There is no freedom of religion in Turkey.
Non-Muslims, Christians, members of the Orthodox Catholic Church and Protestants all suffer from persecution because they are not allowed to build churches.
Five hundred Orthodox churches have been destroyed while everywhere in the European Union Muslims are building mosques.
There is no freedom of speech in Turkey.
Turkey denies the massacre of one-third of the Armenian population in the past.
It is getting ready for another military intervention in Iraq.
It is not solving the issues of the Kurdish minority on its territory.
Turkey is not in Europe and does not belong in the EU.
A privileged partnership with Turkey, instead of full membership, will be quite enough.
(DE) Madam President, I did not vote for the resolution on Turkey because I am greatly concerned that the Turkish Parliament has agreed a military strike against Iraq.
This could not be taken into account in the report, but is a very topical issue.
Taking measures against a terrorist group is rather different from voting to invade a neighbouring country.
It is not in the EU's interests to see any destabilisation of Iraq.
We should be reminding Turkey that, as a candidate country, it should be considering EU interests within the framework of common interests.
This shows that full membership for Turkey - which I do not support, incidentally - with its shared borders with Iran and Iraq would mean a complete redrawing of the political map within the EU.
In my view, we should spare ourselves the associated risks.
(NL) Madam President, I voted against the Oomen-Ruijten resolution because I think that Parliament should play a more active and a more ambitious role in monitoring the negotiation process with Turkey.
Now it seems that we have to make sure that we do not hurt the sensitive feelings of Mr ErdoÄan and Mr GÃŒl.
It is becoming increasingly clear that Turkey is a candidate country unlike any other.
Turkey evidently does not need to adhere to the Copenhagen criteria so strictly, despite all the promises from the Council, the Commission and Parliament that it would have to.
The way things are going we should not be at all surprised that more and more citizens in the European Union are turning their backs on the Union.
(NL) Madam President, this new vote on Turkish accession is a clear illustration of the fact that not only for most of our citizens is Europe far away and of no great concern to them, but that the European institutions themselves are increasingly alienating themselves from the citizens of Europe.
To the Eurocrats, Europe is not really Europe any more, as we blithely proceed to prepare for the accession of a country that is not European at all, not European in historical, cultural or religious terms, not in the euro, and not even European in geographical terms.
What is more, this whole business has been pushed down our throats in a fundamentally undemocratic way, because the vast majority of European citizens really are against the accession of Turkey, but they are not allowed to have their say.
The citizens are not allowed to have their say on Turkey, just as they are not allowed to have their say on the new Constitution that we are not allowed to call a constitution.
Are the Eurocrats actually afraid of democracy, afraid of consulting the people?
This Europe is operating in an increasingly undemocratic and antidemocratic way, and it will all end very badly.
(FI) Madam President, two weeks ago Hrant Dink's son Arat Dink and the publisher Serkis Seropyan were sentenced to prison for a year under Article 301, that is to say for insulting Turkishness.
What was their crime?
Over a year ago, thus prior to the murder of Hrant Dink, their newspaper Argos published a story stating that Hrant Dink, in an interview with Reuters, had said he thought the killings which took place in 1915 were genocide.
The newspaper was therefore only reporting this, and that is all.
I therefore think it is vitally important to vote in favour of our resolution calling on Turkey to acknowledge the Armenian genocide.
I say this as a friend of Turkey.
It would be good if Turkey understood that this is not meant as an anti-Turkish stance.
It is more about the custom the EU has of trying to create a better society in which the horrors of history can be avoided.
A mindset where national identity protects itself with a penal code in which Article 301 is a continual frame of reference, and in which the mistakes of a nation are denied, is in serious conflict with this custom.
One of the bases of the European identity is that history is looked straight in the eye and held to account.
The Armenian genocide is a historical truth.
Parliament will be demanding that Turkey acknowledge it in the resolution on the start of negotiations.
in writing. - (FR) I wish to support the amendments made to the text that has been submitted for today's vote on relations between the European Union and Turkey and in doing so would recall the conclusions reached at the European Council held in Brussels in December 2006. These set out the principle whereby, as far as enlargement was concerned, the European Union would require each candidate country to comply fully with all the Copenhagen criteria, but that any enlargement would still be subject to the Union's capacity for further integration.
Quite a few of you will have been aware for some time of the doubts, or rather the concerns, that I have had about the European Union's ability to continue to function properly if Turkey were to become one of its Member States.
Of course Turkey is a 'friendly' country and in geo-strategic terms is a very important partner for the European Union.
I am therefore completely in favour of the EU maintaining a privileged partnership with Turkey.
However, I am fiercely opposed to that particular country becoming part the Community.
Moreover, I believe that the problems of integrating Turkey as a potential Member State will become increasingly clear as the accession negotiations progress.
in writing. - (FR) I congratulate the rapporteur on having tabled the resolution on relations between the European Union and Turkey.
The motion for a resolution by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is a consensual and balanced document and in it she has sought to cover all the issues relating to this particular problem.
On the one hand the resolution congratulates Turkey on having recently held free and fair elections, calls on the Turkish Government to accelerate the process of reform and welcomes its intention to adopt a new civilian constitution.
The motion for a resolution further calls for a new political initiative to be launched for a lasting settlement to the Kurdish issue.
It also refers to attempts at reaching a settlement to the Cyprus question within the UN framework.
On the other hand, and this is in accordance with the position being supported by France, I welcome the fact that the resolution recalls that Turkey's accession continues to depend on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and on the EU's capacity for further integration.
For all these reasons I have decided to support the adoption of this resolution at the final vote in plenary.
I can only once again express my deep regret that Parliament has not formally called on Turkey to officially recognise the Armenian genocide of 1915.
in writing. - (PT) As we highlighted earlier, many questions are raised by the negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU.
This process is being encouraged by the major powers which, despite the contradictions, are aiming to integrate this great country into the EU's 'single market', thereby gaining control of its economy and using its geo-strategic position for their own plans in the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia.
The resolution is therefore illuminating in this respect as it underlines 'the importance of Turkey as a transit hub for the diversification of gas supplies to the EU' and 'energy projects involving Turkey in the South Caucasus', and also 'the geo-strategic position of Turkey in the region' whose 'role in transportation and logistics will become more important in the coming years'.
The following are some of the other important aspects that should be underlined:
Turkey has not made any steps towards recognising Cyprus - an EU Member State - and still militarily occupies the north of this island and disregards UN resolutions on this issue;
the Turkish authorities are still engaged in repression against the Kurdish people and are still denying their legitimate cultural, political, economic and social rights.
in writing. - (EL) The report on the progress of Turkey's course of accession to the EU includes utterly spurious congratulations to the Turkish Government and the new president.
The report is a hypocritical and ineffectual expression of wishful thinking about human rights in vague and general terms, condemning terrorism and mentioning the joint struggle waged against it by the EU and Turkey.
On the other hand, there is no reference whatsoever to the continuing occupation of Northern Cyprus by Turkish military forces.
There is not even a token condemnation of Turkey's continuing refusal to recognise the Republic of Cyprus, and no pressure brought to bear on this issue.
There is no condemnation of the Turkish regime's policy of contesting Greek sovereign rights or of its threat to use force against neighbouring countries.
There is no serious condemnation of the barbarous persecution and crimes committed by the Turkish authorities against the Kurdish population.
There is not the slightest allusion to the political persecution, at the hands of the Turkish middle class in all its guises, both pro-burka and secular, of communists and other progressive-minded people.
Despite all this, Turkey is urged not to use disproportionate force in the impending attack on northern Iraq!
In the context of the EU, the report reflects the objectives of powerful imperialist countries in line with their geopolitical interests in the wider area.
It is in the interests of the Turkish people and other peoples in the area to oppose Turkey's integration into the EU and its imperialist plans.
in writing. - (FR) This resolution loses its impact because important amendments relating to the recognition of the Armenian genocide have been rejected by the majority of Members.
I am and will remain in favour of Turkey's accession to the European Union.
However, this accession process has to recognise some historical facts.
Moreover, I am totally opposed to the contradiction that Parliament has now introduced.
In paragraph 5 of the resolution of 28 September 2005 it in fact called on Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide and regarded this admission as a precondition for accession to the European Union.
The decision to omit the Armenian genocide from the new resolution is a step backwards and one that I cannot support.
in writing. - (PT) Regardless of the end result, the current negotiations with Turkey must bring about the reforms which the country so desperately needs and which, in themselves, are the most important aspect of a country's potential accession to the EU.
In this context, we must regard the AKP's victory more as a commitment to economic reform than as a vote for Islam.
Given recent developments, the Kurdish issue must be tackled in conjunction with the United States, bearing in mind the issue of Iraq where the Kurdish north is peaceful.
On the other hand, we cannot refrain from criticising the Kurdish terrorist attacks on Turkey or the lack of integration and acceptance of Kurds within Turkey itself.
Finally, we can never highlight enough the geo-strategic importance of Turkey in relation to the security of Europe's borders, energy supply, particularly as an alternative to dependency on Russian gas, as a partner in dialogue with Islamic countries and on the Iraq issue.
For all these reasons, the EU's strategy must be to negotiate seriously and firmly.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the resolution that urges Turkey to accelerate the pace of its reforms.
We have to call on Turkey to do more: to ensure civilian control over the military; to have zero tolerance of torture; to provide protection for women and minority groups, and to recognise the Armenian genocide.



The handling of the Kurdish issue also has to be used as a criterion for assessing the reform process.
The report that we have voted on urges the Turkish Government to launch a political initiative aimed at finding a lasting settlement to the Kurdish problem.
It also deplores the violation of Iraq's territory, while at the same time, of course, condemning the violence perpetrated by the PKK.
This is not about targeting Turkey as such, it is about recalling that we cannot have double standards, that we cannot sell off cheaply the values that we hold dear.
It would also be disastrous to continue to ignore public opinion, which was again expressed in a poll carried out by Notre Europe before the Lisbon Summit.
The people of Europe are concerned about ill-prepared decisions on any future enlargement and about the EU's capacity to absorb any more countries after the huge wave of new accessions that took place between 2004 and 2007.
in writing. - (DE) I support the resolution on Turkey.
The Turkish Government must be vigorous in implementing reforms at last.
As for the Armenian genocide, although Turkey's admission of this genocide is not part of the Copenhagen criteria, a country which aspires to join the EU must surely face up to the dark side of its history.
Overall, Turkey has a very long way to go before it meets the Copenhagen criteria.
Substantial deficits in relation to human and minority rights, civil and political rights and the general weakness of Turkey's democracy vis-Ã -vis the military still exist.
There is still no progress on the Cyprus issue.
For that reason, we must continue to push, this year, for the ratification of the Ankara Protocol.
Without this, and also without the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island, there can be no solution.
Turkey apparently refuses to understand that there are 27 Member States of the European Union and that one of these is the Republic of Cyprus!
As regards the conflict in the south-east of Turkey, the plan to launch an incursion into northern Iraq has existed at least since spring 2006.
At present, it is to be feared that the invasion will indeed take place.
However, a country which - despite international support for the securing of its borders - claims the right to violate international law as it sees fit disqualifies itself from accession to the European Union once and for all.
in writing. - (PL) I abstained in the final vote on the report concerning EU-Turkey relations. This was because, despite negotiations lasting several months, the resolution makes no reference to the issue of Turkish responsibility for the massacre of Armenians in 1915.
Turkey is attempting to impose censorship on the international community regarding this matter.
The most recent proof of this was the pressure brought to bear on the US Congress.
The latter nevertheless stood firm and adopted an appropriate stance.
It is a mistake to give in to unjustified pressure from Turkey on this matter.
I should like to add, however, that I very much appreciate the inclusion in the aforementioned resolution of statements concerning the rights of Christian minorities in Turkey, such as the right to train clergy and Church institutions' right to legal personality.
in writing. - (FR) I decided to abstain on the resolution on EU-Turkey relations in order to signal my opposition to the accession negotiations currently under way.
Two recent events should make us aware of the risks associated with this hypothetical accession.
First there is the political crisis that the country went through before the new President of the Republic was sworn in: this illustrated the tensions that exist within Turkish society and also the fragility of that country's institutions.
I am also thinking of the tensions that have built up at the Iraqi border and the risk that this could destabilise one of the few areas in that country where violence has been contained.
The Turkish Parliament's decision to authorise the army to make military incursions into Iraq is unacceptable.
Turkey is playing a dangerous role in the region and the EU should not lend any support to these populist and aggressive actions.
All this only reinforces my conviction: if we enlarge the Union to the borders of Iraq, I do not see what we will have left that is European.
I believe that Turkey is still unfit to join the EU.
It is up to us to put forward an alternative option: here the 'Mediterranean Union' proposed by Nicolas Sarkozy certainly offers an opportunity that should be seized by the EU and by Turkey.
in writing. - (SK) I did not vote for the European Parliament resolution on EU-Turkey relations because enlargement of the European Union and Turkey's entry into the Community are rather serious matters requiring more detailed knowledge and more intensive debate.
In my opinion, in the accession process the same rules should apply to all countries.
The proposed amendments calling for an admission of the Armenian genocide and for an apology to Armenia and the Armenian people were not adopted by the plenary.
Only such an admission and apology can give impetus to the process of reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia.
Furthermore, Turkey continues to hinder progress in the search for a solution to the Cyprus problem.
The cross-border military operation against Kurds who live along the border with Iraq, approved in a declaration issued by the Turkish Parliament, will not lead to a constructive solution to the terrorism problem in the country.
It will simply lead to the destabilisation of the entire region.
There is also no visible progress in the matter of freedom of religion within the territory of the Republic of Turkey.
The safety of Christians living in Turkey and respect for their rights are not guaranteed.
In recent times we have witnessed violent attacks on Christian priests, missionaries, publishers or converts.
Turkey has also not re-opened the Orthodox Church's seminary without which the very existence of this ancient church is threatened.

EU-Serbia relations (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Kacin, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EU-Serbia relations, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on relations between the European Union and Serbia.
Rapporteur. - (SL) Today I am speaking as a rapporteur, but at the same time as a Liberal Democrat, as a Slovene, as a former Yugoslav and as a European.
Just 15 years ago the country in which I was born disintegrated in a number of bloody wars which lasted for almost an entire decade.
Today many countries of that region, including Serbia, are still faced with the destructive effects of the conflict.
To these fragile and young democracies membership of the European Union is a powerful incentive for further democratisation.
The European Union, which these countries wish to join as soon as possible, is based on common values and standards, one of the most important of which is the rule of law.
However, in the case of the Balkan countries the issue is not only reform of the judicial system but also full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.
Serbia has so far failed to honour its domestic and international duty to arrest four remaining fugitive war crime indictees, including MladiÄ and KaradÅŸiÄ, who stand accused of orchestrating the slaughter of nearly 8 000 civilians in Srebrenica.
Anybody who kills a single human being commits a crime, but those who commit genocide represent an international and political challenge.
I visited Srebrenica before preparing this report.
I believe in Serbian self-respect.
That is why I insist that the Serbian state has to prove it is cooperating with the ICTY.
In May, a new pro-European government took office, with ICTY cooperation as one of its key objectives.
That is a development which I warmly welcome.
I also welcome the fact that the Government moved against, arrested and delivered two of the six most wanted fugitives, Tolimir and Djordjevic.
Those arrests demonstrate that Serbia is able to locate and arrest the remaining war fugitives.
As Chief Prosecutor Del Ponte has stated, the principal obstacle is not ability, but rather translating ability into tangible results.
This is why the EU cannot afford to waive its conditionality at this crucial juncture.
As the tensions surrounding Kosovo's future status mount, it would be wrong to think that caving in on EU conditionality and bending over backwards to make concessions to Belgrade will serve either the EU or Serbia in the long run.
Turning a blind eye to war criminals may suit modern day Realpolitik, but it will not contribute to long-term peace or regional stability.
It is often repeated that Serbia is the key to stability in the region, but politicians in Belgrade are wrong to assume that this will mean preferential treatment for Serbia.
Serbia would do well to use its abundant talents and potential to act as an example to its neighbours in the region, rather than leaving them to languish because of Serbian recalcitrance.
It is true that the EU will not be complete until the Balkans form part of the Union, but this cannot be at any price, and certainly not at the price of undermining international law and ignoring fundamental European values.
The citizens of Serbia are entitled to know the truth about the recent policies of war committed in their name.
It is also for this reason that I support the recent initiative by the Special Prosecutor to uncover the political motives behind the assassination of Prime Minister DjindjiÄ.
It is for that reason too that I regret the leniency of the sentences delivered by the Serbian war crimes court to four members of the Scorpions for the execution of six Muslims from Srebrenica.
There is tremendous economic and cultural potential in Serbia, and a vast area of talented individuals in all spheres of life.
The new Government has proved itself to have a number of dynamic and ambitious ministers.
There is no doubt that Serbia possesses the administrative and institutional capacity to deal professionally with further EU membership negotiations.
Progress has been made in a number of areas in recent months, for instance in the conclusion of the technical talks on the SAA negotiations, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, CEFTA and the election of an Ombudsman, a Governor of the Bank of Serbia, a Commissioner for Public Information and the members of the Council of the State Audit Institution.
Disappointingly, however, there has been little tangible progress on the nomination of judges to the Constitutional Court.
In addition, the public denigration of civil society actors who criticise the Government or try to draw attention to sensitive issues, such as war crimes, continues.
In this regard, I condemn the recent events in Novi Sad, where a neo-Nazi organisation attacked a peaceful gathering of individuals who had gathered for an anti-fascist demonstration.
It is imperative that the relevant authorities find the perpetrators and thoroughly investigate the crime.
At the same time, I recognise that the EU's strict visa regime, which prevents ordinary Serbs from meeting with their counterparts in the European Union, acts as a brake on Serbia's democratic progress, and contributes to xenophobia and nationalism.
I welcome the agreements which have been negotiated.
While these mark an important first step, the ultimate goal must be to liberalise travel for all citizens of the region.
Do you know that only one tenth of Serbs possess a passport?
We have to give something concrete to the rest of the population.
I urge the Council to ensure that the agreements enter into force at the beginning of next year, as well as calling on the Council also to establish a concrete roadmap for visa liberalisation.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my assistants, fellow Members, the Committee on Foreign Affairs secretariat, the political groups, the Commission, the Serbian Mission to the EU and the Serbian Office for European Integration.
In concluding my intervention, I would like to add a short personal note.
As one of the very few MEPs born in the Western Balkans, I am very proud to have worked as rapporteur.
My country, Slovenia, became an EU member not because it was easy, but because it was difficult.
We managed, just like Serbian politicians, intellectuals and business people will also manage, when they decide to do so.
I call on Serbia and the Serbian people to wake up now, to start helping themselves, to help their neighbours, to help the entire region and to join us.
Do it.
You are strong enough.
Together we will manage.
I thank the House for its forbearance as regards the usual time allocation.
I apologise to the House on the rapporteur's behalf.
Thank you.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Serbia naturally lies within the European space and we all recognise that, in recent years, it has been faced with major challenges; in fact more than this, with extremely difficult challenges due to its importance to the stability and development of the Western Balkan region.
The European Union has tried to help Serbia overcome these challenges by reinforcing and making more tangible and visible the benefits of the European perspective.
We have therefore tried to prove to the Serbian people and authorities our commitment to bringing Serbia closer to the European Union.
We have tried to show that there is an alternative, by helping the pro-European political and social forces which are favourable to pursuing the necessary reforms to consolidate the country's democracy and development.
The stabilisation and association agreements represent a fundamental step in bringing the Western Balkan countries closer to the Union.
They also form an essential instrument for clarifying the European perspective.
In that regard, we feel that it is very positive that the Commission has completed the negotiations with Serbia on the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
We sincerely hope that the conditions for the Commission to sign the agreement will shortly be met.
There is firm political support in the Council for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to be signed as soon as the necessary conditions are met.
However, before the Council can implement the agreement, Serbia must fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court.
The ability for people in Serbia to travel more easily to the European Union would also reinforce the ties between us and undoubtedly contribute to the democratisation process and to the pro-European Union sentiment in Serbian society.
The visa facilitation and readmission agreements which were signed in September and which will enter into force in January 2008 are, in our opinion, vitally important.
The Commission has agreed with Serbia to begin dialogue on the liberalisation of visas after the entry into force of these agreements.
The EU has also made it clear to Serbia that its integration process is not linked to the issue of determining the future status of Kosovo.
In fact, every country moves towards becoming a member of the European Union on its own merits and in accordance with the conditions of the stabilisation and association process and the Copenhagen criteria.
To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must once again reiterate the significance that the Presidency of the European Union attributes to the opportunity of discussing with the European Parliament the importance, for both Serbia itself and the region, of securing a European future for Serbia.
There can be no doubt that the Western Balkans remain one of the European Union's priorities and that our ultimate goal is to create a situation of peace, stability, democracy and prosperity in the region.
This is why we have a vision of the integration of these countries within the Union, with the stabilisation and association process remaining the framework for preparing for this potential accession.
Serbia is a country of high geo-strategic importance to the stability of the whole region, which is why progress in this process is essential to achieve the EU's ultimate goal with regard to the Western Balkans: to see this become a region of stability, peace and progress.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Kacin for his solid report, which captures the essential aspects of the current state of EU-Serbia relations.
I have asked my services to follow up on the recommendations of the report, which has already been useful in the preparation of the Commission's annual progress report, due to be adopted on 6 November.
Your report highlights a number of areas where both the European Union and Serbia need to intensify efforts, which I fully support.
I particularly agree with the importance granted to visa facilitation and with the call for progress now to be made on visa liberalisation.
Precisely for that reason, the Commission has indicated its intention to start a dialogue early next year, with each of the countries of the Western Balkans, on a roadmap for visa liberalisation, by defining its requirements and conditions.
This issue is of immense importance, not least in terms of giving concrete evidence to the young generation of the region of what Europe really means.
We are at a very critical juncture in our relations with Serbia.
Over the past fortnight I have had intense discussions with the Council Presidency, with Member States and with the Serbian authorities on the state of affairs.
It will come as no surprise that the Kosovo status process and the stabilisation and association agreement, including ICTY conditionality, were the main items.
The deadline of 10 December for Kosovo talks is fast approaching, and the work of the international troika is entering a crucial phase.
We fully support the work of the EU's representative, Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger, and we will leave no stone unturned in seeking a negotiated solution.
It is now essential that the two parties - Belgrade and PriÅ¡tina - assume their responsibilities and engage seriously in constructive and creative proposals that can lead to a negotiated, sustainable solution.
I have also had intensive discussions with Member States and with the Serbian authorities on the stabilisation and association agreement.
That agreement will constitute a political milestone in our relations with Serbia. It will be the gateway towards candidate status for membership of the European Union.
The Commission has first negotiated and then finalised the technical work on the draft text of this agreement, which is currently being assessed by Member States in the Council working group.
It is working intensively with the Presidency and Member States to complete a legal-linguistic review of the text so that we, as the European Union, are technically ready to sign the agreement soon, provided that the political conditions are in place - namely full cooperation with the ICTY - which should lead to the arrest of the remaining indictees.
This is, to my understanding, in line with the recommendation in your report, addressed to the Council.
Concerning the ICTY, as I have said before, for the moment I see Serbia's part of the glass as being half full rather than half empty.
I have made it clear to the Serbian Government that signature of the SAA is within reach.
It is now a question of political will and translating ability into results.
We are ready, once Serbia is ready by meeting the conditions.
The ball is now clearly in Serbia's court.
At the same time we should also appreciate the efforts Serbia has made up to now.
Too often, these tend to be forgotten in our debates.
Since 2004, Serbia has cooperated in locating and handing over 20 of the 24 ICTY indictees. That shows that our policy of conditionality works.
However, ICTY cooperation cannot be a stop-start process, and more needs to be done to achieve full cooperation, especially concerning intensified search operations and access to archives and documents.
The Chief Prosecutor will return to Belgrade tomorrow for two days, and the Commission will take her findings strongly into account when making our assessment on the initialling of the SAA agreement.
Signature will then depend on full cooperation with the ICTY, and we will assess that together with the Council.
This requires Serbia to do everything in its powers to locate and arrest the fugitives and to provide the ICTY with all the necessary information leading to their arrest and transfer to tribunal in The Hague.
To conclude, Serbia indeed has tremendous economic, cultural and intellectual potential that is just waiting to be released in the pursuit of the country's European future.
The Commission is fully committed to Serbia's European perspective.
I am convinced that the country can make relatively rapid progress on its European road once it meets the essential conditions.
That is crucial, not just for Serbia's European aspirations, but for the stability and progress of the whole Western Balkans.
It is, therefore, high time for Serbia to turn the page on its painful past, and to fully approach its European future.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, all in this House would agree that Serbia has a European future and that this European future is highly desirable, both for Serbia and for Europe.
The question then is how to get there from here.
The heart of the problem is that, whilst Serbia certainly has some of the characteristics of a democracy, it is still some way from having a stable, democratic infrastructure.
The legacy of communism and of the wars following the disintegration of Yugoslavia has left deep marks on Serbian society, hence the operation of trustworthy, neutral institutions is that much more difficult to sustain.
The weakness of the rule of law, the corruption and nepotism, and the worryingly high level of casual violence are all indicators of a society that has to undergo a significant shift before democracy can be regarded as complying with the Copenhagen criteria.
Perhaps the most toxic part of the legacy is the way in which nationalism retains its attractiveness for a politically important part of society, a part of the elite included.
For the protagonists of Serbian ethnic nationalism, Serbian citizenship is understood as coextensive with the Serbian nation.
This bears very hard on the non-Serb part of Serbian society.
In this area, the country's political elite has a great deal of work to do.
Only Serbia - the country's political elites and Serbian society - can make the necessary shift towards democracy, human rights and citizenship.
The conclusions of this thoughtful report, on the other hand, offer cogent indications as to how that transformation can be made and how Serbia can once again take its place in Europe.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, with winter just around the corner, the political atmosphere in Serbia is heating up.
That is why, by participating in the preparation of this report, the PSE Group is trying especially to grasp the situation of a nation that lost a privileged position in the former Yugoslav Federation, a nation where nationalist outbreaks have damaged the entire region, wrecked many lives, claimed a number of victims and received bombs and rockets in reply.
In spite of everything, the majority of the country's population wants nothing else than to follow the European path and, by doing so, to heal its own and its neighbours' wounds.
This report tries to help, in a friendly and yet demanding fashion, to draw the road signs for this important path.
I would especially like to thank our colleague, Mr Kacin, who put into this report not only a lot of work but also sense and heart.
I would like to emphasise the successful work of the pro-European Serbian Government in this not-so-easy situation.
Its activities have allowed the European Parliament to suggest signing of the stabilisation and association agreement, perhaps even by the end of this year.
Yet whether the country will be able to turn a page in its relations with the EU depends largely on the Serbs themselves.
We, for our part, will keep strongly to our opinion that the agreement will be signed only when Serbia shows results in capturing the remaining war criminals.
The PSE Group has proposed a few amendments to the report which seek to soften the formulation of sensitive issues for Serbs.
These suggest, inter alia, changing the formulation of Recital M to underline that inter-ethnic reconciliation is paramount for securing stability in the region.
We are of the position that Kosovo is a separate problem, which is why it remains almost untouched in this report.
The solution to that problem should not divert Serbia from the European path along which, after time, it is forecast to meet with Kosovo and former Yugoslav republics, and indeed with the rest of Europe.
on behalf of the ALDE group. - (HU) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kacin, on his constructive and balanced report.
In 2003 the European Union committed itself to the integration of Serbia into the EU because of its conviction that Serbia is an important factor in regional stability, and that Serbia's future lies in Europe.
From this point onwards, the pace of integration depends entirely on Serbia.
Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague is an important prerequisite.
Progress has been made; two out of the six most wanted war criminals have been handed over, but the most serious war criminals, MladiÄ and KaradÅŸiÄ, are still at large.
Further efforts are needed.
The biggest test of strength for both Serbia and Europe is the issue of settling the status of Kosovo.
The current situation is the most serious obstacle both to regional stability and to Serbia's EU integration.
We expect Serbia to act in a constructive manner in order to resolve this situation as quickly and as satisfactorily as possible.
Progress has been made in the field of minority rights; the number of violent assaults has fallen, and minorities have been granted new rights under the constitution.
The progress made, however, is far from adequate: regulations relating to National Councils are not yet in place and legislation guaranteeing self-determination for minorities is lacking.
There are also European tasks that Serbia needs to undertake, given that in practice the Constitutional Court is non-functional, the justice system is slow and subject to political influence, and corruption and organised crime permeate all areas of economic and social life.
If Serbia genuinely desires integration, it is vitally important that it steps up its efforts in these areas.
Europe will give Serbia all possible assistance in order for it to carry out these tasks successfully, but it is Serbia that must undertake the tasks.
We must emphasise that the responsibility and the obligation to do everything in their power to ensure the successful integration of Serbia into the EU lie with our Serb friends themselves.
Thank you, Mr President.
Mr President, the Commission will soon be taking a decision on the stabilisation and association agreement to be concluded between the EU and Serbia.
I support this agreement.
It will send out a clear message at international level that Serbian membership of the EU is on the current political agenda.
This is the country's first significant step towards EU membership.
Although many colleagues have spoken about the difficulties which Serbia has faced in the past and the ongoing problems that there are concerning Serbian accession and the stabilisation agreement, we must also give recognition to the tremendous road which has been travelled despite the difficulties which have occurred.
As with all relationships between countries that are in close proximity to each other, there will still be difficulties in the future with regard to how Serbia will deal with the issue of Kosovo, their ongoing cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal, and in particular with regard to their relationships with other neighbouring countries that were formally part of Yugoslavia.
However, the clear message being given by the authorities in Serbia is that there is an ongoing desire on their part to see progress being made.
They are willing to hear the best practice models that we can encourage for them.
And look at what the European Union has delivered in the past - over EUR 165 million in the reconstruction effort.
The issue that we must all remember is that the Balkans War continues to be a huge psychological scar on the development, not just of Serbia, but of other countries.
And indeed, if you look into the recent past of any of our own countries, there are similar psychological fractures which took us a while to overcome.
We should give some leeway to allow for Serbia to make that transition and that progress.
Our role and our duty is to ensure that we act as a good neighbour, as a faithful teacher of how best things can happen, but also to reward the good things that have happened.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to extend my warm thanks to the rapporteur for his sound and comprehensive work.
We very much welcome the fact that the European Parliament makes clear and regular contributions to the political debate about the situation in South-East Europe.
Serbia plays, and has played, a prominent role in this region.
That is why it is essential to underline, time and again, that Serbia's future lies within the EU and that we are good and reliable partners.
However, it takes at least two to build a partnership, and so I appeal to Serbia to continue along the path towards EU integration and to play a constructive role in the resolution of the Kosovo issue.
We expect unlimited cooperation with the Hague Tribunal at last - that point has been made several times - and compliance with the criteria of European standards.
I very much hope that the better opportunities for travel will also make a contribution here and bring about improvements in the future.
What I cannot endorse, however, are the proposals that have occasionally been made to apply different standards to EU accession.
I am pleased that the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the representative of the Council take the same view, especially as we paid dearly for this not long ago.
I have great understanding for the difficult and painful position in which Serbia finds itself, but I repeat, it takes at least two to build a partnership.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, as in any country that has lost a recent war resulting in the loss of territory and influence, nationalistic feelings of superiority also enjoy strong support in Serbia.
Rather than isolating and punishing Serbia because the war criminal Ratko MladiÄ cannot be found, it should be offered a future in which guarantees are also established for the ethnic minorities in Vojvodina, SandÅŸak and PreÅ¡evo.
My Group supports the efforts of the Kacin report towards overtures with a view to Serbian membership of the European Union.
Unfortunately, paragraph 8 added by the Committee on Foreign Affairs pre-empts the decision on Kosovo.
After 10 December, Kosovo will probably be unilaterally recognised as a state by America and a number of Member States of the European Union, and Serbia will unilaterally take back the northern part of Kosovo.
This is why we do not share at all the confidence that the future status of Kosovo can only contribute to stability and integration.
While this groundless optimism in paragraph 8 is maintained, my Group is withdrawing its support for this report.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this report's opening sentence is: '... the future of Serbia lies in the European Union'.
It goes on to say: '... the future of all countries in the region lies in the EU'.
The countries of the region are of course Croatia, Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania.
Some of them have historic enmities that have erupted in tragic wars in recent times.
The EU, of course, believes that if they joined everything would resolve itself in sweetness and light.
But follow through one consequence of what would actually happen if they did join.
These states have a combined population of over 24 million people. Many of these people would take up their right to move to other parts of the EU.
On past experience, many of them would come to Britain. Britain is already swamped with immigrants and asylum seekers from the EU and beyond.
The British Home Office has an unofficial policy of moving different ethnic and religious groups of asylum-seekers to different parts of the UK for fear of the violence and conflicts that might erupt between them.
If Serbia and other Balkan States were eventually to join the EU, Britain would import yet more of their historic hatreds and blood feuds onto British soil.
The way forward for Serbia and for her neighbours is as democratic, independent nation states, resolving their problems peacefully - not to join the European Union.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, the European authorities, and in particular the Kacin report, generally seem to treat Serbia not as a sovereign state but as a naughty schoolboy, a ne'er-do-well, someone the European Union has the right to give good marks and bad marks to.
Serbia gets good marks when it acquires a government that is described as being pro-European.
This pro-European reference of course means being liable for and subject to the dogma that pertains in Brussels.
It gets bad marks when the Serbs prove less than enthusiastic about collaborating with the International Criminal Tribunal.
Here it is useful to recall that this Tribunal has scorned two principles that in fact go to the heart of our justice system: the legal sovereignty of states and freedom of expression.
As a result, Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party that represents 28% of the electorate, has been imprisoned in The Hague since February 2003 and is still awaiting a verdict, even though he turned himself in voluntarily.
This Tribunal is therefore blatantly violating the very principles that have been declared by the European Union, namely respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights. To tell the truth, Mr Seselj's only crime is to be a Serbian patriot.
The rulers of the European Union, who wish to break up the nations of Europe, cannot in fact forgive the Serbs for having resisted the destruction of their state, and in particular the secession of Kosovo, the historic heart of Serbia.
The treatment inflicted on the Serbs in Kosovo is a warning to all the peoples of Europe.
If today the Albanians are calling for the establishment of a Kosovar state, it is because immigration from Albania and the falling birth-rate among Serbs have given them a majority in a province where, some fifty years ago, they were in the minority.
The Kosovan example should compel us more than ever to reaffirm the right of the peoples of Europe to be themselves and to make their own decisions, in other words to preserve their identity and sovereignty, and in an enlarged European Europe of nations and homelands there should also clearly be a legitimate place for the people of Serbia.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kacin has presented a report which has attracted very broad support in the House.
A number of us contributed to that effort.
I therefore do not intend to discuss the finer points of detail, but would simply like to make various comments in a personal capacity.
Serbia's democratic forces were too late in making the radical break with the MiloÅ¡eviÄ era, much too late.
As a result, cooperation with the Hague Tribunal was not addressed seriously and credibly, which was why cooperation within the Stabilisation and Association Agreement was also delayed, then suspended, then resumed, and now we are waiting again.
In other words, Serbia's path to the EU is already mapped out and Serbia has the capacity, but it does need to make efforts of its own.
The unresolved Kosovo issue hangs like a dark cloud over Serbian politics and is having a paralysing effect.
Who is suffering as a result?
That is easy to answer: the young generation.
After the embargo and the NATO bombing - and the Serbs have Mr MiloÅ¡eviÄ to thank for both of them, not the democratic forces which are in government today - young people now face another intractable problem, namely Kosovo.
This is impeding efficient political work as well, which plays straight into the hands of the radicals and their cronies at the top.
Thankfully, visa facilitation will finally create some breathing space, and this is something which we in Parliament have long been campaigning for.
We want to see young Serbs participating very soon in our education and youth programmes which we opened up with effect from 2007.
I would also like to pay tribute to the very positive work being undertaken by the Vojvodina regional parliament in relation to tolerance and youth cooperation, which is having a major impact.
A great many young people have come together in the Danube region this year, and this is a marvellous example of a commitment to tolerance and peaceful social relations.
There is a great longing for normality in Serbia.
Politicians should be doing more for the present and the future and should leave the past behind.
They should also be doing much more to improve the daily lives of ordinary people, to ensure that they do not lose popular support.
(DE) Mr President, in the speech made by our esteemed colleague Mr Kacin, there were two things missing, in my view.
The first was the expression of thanks to the generous President, and the second, more importantly, was the balance which is certainly expressed in his report.
We worked well together and I would like to thank him very much for that.
I think that this has developed into a very good draft report.
In saying that, I echo what Commissioner Rehn said.
Some substantial progress has been made, but when assessing a country, both the positives and the negatives should be mentioned.
Substantial progress has also been made in terms of cooperation with the ICTY.
However - and here we are in accord - this progress is not enough.
I hope that an agreement will be reached with Carla del Ponte in the next few days, and I made it clear on behalf of my Group when I spoke to Minister LjajiÄ that all the issues have to be resolved.
We cannot stop halfway and we cannot stop three-quarters of the way either.
Full cooperation has to be established.
That is the common position of Parliament and the European Union as a whole.
As I see it, the crucial issue in this country is that unfortunately - and here I would echo what Doris Pack has said - the nationalists often still seem to be setting the agenda.
You cannot overtake extremist right-wing nationalists even further to the right, which is what some people are trying to do.
This simply leads to chaos.
The fact that Mr NikoliÄ held office as the Speaker of Parliament, even if it was only for four days, is scandalous.
Given the difficulties and sensitivities of the situation, how can anyone think of having the leader of the extreme right as the Speaker of Parliament?
It is scandalous.
This is not the way to conduct politics and take Serbia forward.
That is something which repeatedly confirms that Serbia is actually pursuing a nationalist course.
I hope that all the forces of the centre will reflect for a moment and realise that there has to be a clear dividing line between the nationalists on the one hand and the rest, whether they are now Conservative or Socialist, on the other.
The centre is the only force which can take the country forward, provided that they are not tempted to dally with the nationalists.
Yes, we need to do more about visa-free travel.
A step towards visa facilitation has been taken, and now we should be moving towards visa-free travel so that young people can come to Europe and see what it is all about.
That is what young Serbs need, and that is what Serbia needs as well.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, first I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kacin, for an excellent, thorough report.
The report mentions the difficult problems which thwart relations between the EU and Serbia, but it also highlights many positive factors which have emerged in Serbia's development.
I would like to stress the importance of natural relations in the development of EU-Serbian cooperation.
It is important that young Serbian nationals should have more opportunities to travel abroad on student exchange and cultural programmes.
There has been positive experience of this with many countries in the context, for example, of the Erasmus Mundus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes.
Natural relations with Serbia will also be given a boost with the visa agreement that has been concluded.
We must ensure that the agreement takes effect before the end of the year, at the same time as we speed up visa processing and develop support action to increase travel opportunities for young people and professionals in particular.
Finally, I want to say that the European Agency for Reconstruction has also fulfilled its role in Serbia.
Its work is now coming to a close and the Agency's tasks can be transferred to the Commission units, with the emphasis on support for administrative and judicial development.
In this way, we can encourage Serbia and other countries in the region to enjoy closer relations with the European Union.
(PL) The report refers to recent changes in Serbia.
Much still remains to be done, however, notably in the area of cooperation between the Government and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.
Despite promises made, Radko MladiÄ has not been arrested and handed over to the Tribunal in The Hague.
The lack of progress in this area of cooperation is cause for concern and impacts negatively on perception of the action taken by the Serb authorities to strengthen the rule of law.
The new constitution and the provisions relating to the protection of human rights and the rights of national minorities, the security services, the judiciary and the army, and also the efforts to eliminate corruption, do represent movement in the right direction.
There are certain shortcomings to the reforms, however, such as the failure to appoint a Constitutional Court which would act as the guardian of democracy.
It is essential for the measures adopted and the commitments entered into by Serbia to be monitored.
Despite the progress made, much still remains to be accomplished in Serbia.
(NL) Mr President, Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, we are attempting today to underline the positive developments in Serbia, and let there be no misunderstanding about it, there is nothing wrong with that.
It is important for the European Union that Serbia develops towards democracy and it is important that we, the European Union, acknowledge that process and, where possible, support it.
It is the same endeavour being undertaken at present in other EU institutions, in particular in the Council.
We must not overdo it, however, ladies and gentlemen.
Even if Serbia does everything it is asked to do in this report, but at the same time it plays a negative and destructive role in the negotiations on the future of Kosovo, then that will of course have negative consequences for the pace of Serbia's overtures toward the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, that is how it should be.
That is why I find it incomprehensible and not good that up to now the link - which I believe is a real link, everyone knows that - between the Serbian position in the negotiations on Kosovo and Serbia's route in the direction of Europe is not made.
I am therefore appealing to fellow Members to support the amendment in which this link is made.
There is a connection between the Serbian position on Kosovo and the pace and content of the negotiations between Serbia and the European Union.
The refusal to make that link up to now is explained by the argument that we - the European Union - do not want to make things even more difficult for the democrats in Serbia, for President TadiÄ, and so we have to keep quiet on the difficult issues.
Ladies and gentlemen, I disagree fundamentally with that assessment of the situation.
I agree with the predecessor of the present Commissioner, Chris Patten, who recently wrote that it is a misapprehension if we believe that we are helping the democrats by being soft, by not being candid and honest to Serbia.
By not being open and honest, we are strengthening Kostunica who can then say: if we take a hard line we can force the European Union to make concessions.
That is not the way forward.
Once again I beg you, be positive, but be honest and make things plain too.
The citizens of the EU and Serbia are entitled to that.
(EL) Mr President, the EU shares responsibility for the unjust and dirty war waged by NATO against Yugoslavia.
It is jointly responsible for the murder of thousands of Yugoslavs; for the enormous destruction inflicted on the infrastructure, factories and the country as a whole, and for the use of enriched uranium.
Those who should be arrested, tried and sentenced for war crimes are Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Javier Solana (the former NATO Secretary General) and the other leaders of the countries that attacked Yugoslavia.
Unfortunately, nothing of the kind has happened.
Yugoslavia has been dismantled; you are creating protectorates and you are now trying to annex Serbia.
You are asking for a declaration of repentance from a people who did what is self-explanatory: they defended the independence of their country.
You may receive such a declaration from the government, but the young people will not forget and will not forgive the crimes of ÎÎÎ€Î and the EU.
You are now continuing the same policy with the independence of Kosovo and the creation of a new protectorate.
Among other things, the measures proposed in the report are an attempt to redeem slaughter and destruction by using money from the workers of Europe.
The measures aim to present the murderers of the Yugoslav peoples as saviours in a bid to create favourable conditions for linking Serbia to the imperialist chariot, and for European capital to take over the country.
The Communist Party of Greece condemns this report and believes that the interests of the Balkan peoples will be served if we do not forget, but struggle against the EU and the barbarity you are nurturing.
(NL) Mr President, Mr Kacin's solid wide-ranging report gives a balanced view of the socio-economic development of Serbia.
The dark and bright sides are both presented: excellent growth figures against high unemployment, for instance; in concrete terms, 7.2% against over 20% for the past three years.
Direct foreign investment is essential for Serbian development and that is exactly what is lacking at the moment.
The causes are obvious.
They can mainly be traced back to Belgrade's image problem.
What frightens off foreign investors, more than anything, is protracted political insecurity - byword Kosovo - and also the marked slowing down in the pace of market reforms on the part of Belgrade.
That brings me to a crucial question.
Is Serbia standing in its own way?
The Kacin report opens with the proposition that the future of Serbia lies in the European Union; the European conditions en route to that are perfectly well-known to Belgrade, as is European commitment to cooperate on that route.
In the end the Serbian authorities should themselves answer the pressing question: is Serbia standing in its own way?
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Mr Kacin's report is excellent, a professional piece of work.
One can tell that he was born in the region and knows it well.
My comments are as follows:
1.
The principle of values.
It is vital that no one should be allowed to enter the European Union with the kind of legacy where not only is there a failure to investigate collective crimes and mass murders, but where it is not even permitted to remember them, to remember the dead.
This has been a minimum human right, the right to human dignity, since Antigone.
In a place where this point has not yet been reached and is not even being called for, we should not be surprised if radical groups are prowling the streets and gaining strength, or neo-fascists are on the march in Vojvodina.
This must be resolved, because if we fail to do so, it is not only Serbia that we should be worried about, but also Europe.
2.
I think we should at least undertake what we ourselves have set out as regards this report.
In other words, let us not weaken it with amendments, let us not censor the resolutions we have made or the points made in them, but cite them exactly as they are.
The same goes for territorial arrangements, which Mr Kacin has quite rightly brought into his report from the Commission, because no one will understand what we want if we pointlessly water it down.
3.
We must help Serbia, and not just talk about doing so.
After relaxing visa requirements, we need to abolish them altogether so that ordinary Serbs are able to enter Europe whenever they wish.
Until then, there is no point in harping on about Serbia's European Union prospects, as we cannot take the third step before we take the first.
The same goes for Serbia's membership of CEFTA, for implementation of the Association process, and its future within the WTO.
My last remark is that we need a bottom-up society, and one that demands proportionality, both for representation of ethnic minorities in the public administration, which is vital, and for ensuring appropriate forms of autonomy.
Lack of proportionality signifies a lack of trust, and if there is no trust we will not really be able to move forward towards new, long-desired cooperation in the Balkans.
Thank you.
(FR) Mr President, the Kacin report deals with Serbia, not Kosovo, and not with what will happen after December.
It is also true to say that it does not link Serbia's reaction to the Kosovo issue to the promise of accession to the European Union.
Mr Lagendijk is upset about this, while my Group welcomes it and takes the view that here Parliament can deny any political bargaining or double diplomacy.
It is true that there is one question that is constantly raised, namely the International Criminal Tribunal and Serbia's cooperation with it.
Now Mrs Del Ponte has just sounded the alarm bells, or at least something very like it, in referring to the intransigence being displayed and is using the European Union as a link with everything that affects human rights, in other words conditionality, and I believe she is not wrong.
I do not believe, as Mr Lang does, that this is simply a matter of handing out good marks and bad marks.
I take the view that the issue of nationalism, this culture of impunity, with four wanted criminals - and not small fry either - still running around free in Serbia, is intolerable.
Furthermore, I would say that we know from experience that a country has everything to gain by recognising its past and acknowledging its crimes.
We called on Croatia to make huge efforts and we asked Bosnia to do the same; and these are the very same efforts that enabled us to rebuild Europe after the Second World War.
All this goes to the very heart of what we value most. It is not a matter of handing out points, it is the very core of our values and it is the key to reconciliation in the Balkans.
Finally I would add, even though we are not discussing Kosovo, that the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic, who visited the European Parliament several weeks ago, reaffirmed to us that whatever happened about Kosovo his country had no intention of resorting to arms.
I remember these words and, without linking this to the Kacin report, I hope that this appeal has reached the ears of his own people.
(PL) Mr President, I have noted the negative attitude adopted by certain European countries towards Serbia over the years.
Serbia is perceived as the country that is implementing Russia's policy for the Balkans.
Another aspect has been largely overlooked, however.
Serbia lies on one of the main routes for the expansion of Islam into Europe.
Personally, I am in favour of maintaining the best possible relations with Turkey and other Muslim states, but it is not in Europe's interest to allow constant humiliation of a Christian country whilst favouring Muslim ones.
This may have far-reaching consequences for our continent in the future.
What the region concerned needs is stabilisation, not incitement to racial and religious tension.
The ongoing democratisation of political life in Serbia must surely be welcomed by all.
Our relations with Serbia should respect that nation's pride and national tradition.
Only then will Serbia turn to the Union in preference to other powers, and stabilise the region at the same time.
(DE) Mr President, the future of the former Yugoslav republic of Serbia lies in Europe.
That applies to all the republics of the former Yugoslavia.
As is the case for every potential candidate, there are conditions that apply to accession to this community of values, and I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur not just for his report but also for making it clear in his speech what these conditions are.
Unlimited cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is indeed a precondition for the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
I find it hard to stomach that war criminals such as MladiÄ and KaradÅŸiÄ still have so many sympathisers, not only among the general public but also among the police, the military and many public office-holders in Serbia: in other words, the very people with whom we will soon be negotiating Serbia's closer relations with the EU.
Dealing with the past is not a formal condition for closer relations with the EU, but it would help the Serbs, their immediate neighbours and the EU as a whole.
The Kosovo issue, too, must be viewed separately in formal terms, but I find this nationalist stonewalling very unhelpful.
I also think it is wrong to purchase a Russian veto in the Security Council with generous sell-offs of key companies to Russian firms.
At the end of the process - according to Belgrade's calculations - the EU is expected to provide compensation, in the form of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, for concessions which have not actually been made in the Kosovo issue.
That will become apparent after 10 December.
I therefore fully support Mr Lagendijk's position.
The level of cooperation on the issue of Kosovo will thus be one of the factors which is either more helpful or more of a hindrance to Serbia's closer relations with the EU, and Belgrade should take note of that fact.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, last year Serbia went through some significant changes which I am convinced were also successfully negotiated.
The difficult and painful process of dissolution of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro was successfully completed.
Democratic parliamentary elections were held fairly and freely and a new pro-European government was established.
Substantial and much needed economic growth followed.
After a 13-month break, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations between the Serbian Government and the EU resumed.
There is a realistic prospect that in the near future the signature of the SAA may take place.
This would be a significant step on the path to Serbia's EU membership.
As has already been mentioned today several times, the condition for this is Serbia's cooperation with the ICTY.
I trust that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, during Carla del Ponte's visit to Belgrade, at least some of the obstacles will be overcome, such as, for example, full access to archive documents in ministerial departments.
In my short contribution today I will not make any comments on Kosovo as we are discussing the report on Serbia.
What I would like to do, however, is to commend Serbia for its responsible and proactive approach and its collaboration in the context of regional initiatives such as the Stability Pact and CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Agreement).
This collaboration is evidence of Serbia's clear interest in developing and sustaining good relationships with its regional neighbours.
(PL) Mr President, Serbia is a European country that has made considerable progress towards integration into the European Union over the last few years.
One could of course mention a number of problems that may not actually be greater in Serbia than they are in Albania or in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although it seems we are prepared to turn a blind eye in the case of the latter two countries.
I believe we should create a system of incentives for Serbia to encourage it to try even harder to meet European standards.
Nevertheless, the goal, namely the European Union, should be clearly visible.
There is certainly a point in what Mr Gahler said about relations between Russia and Serbia.
It should be made very clear to Serbia, however, that its place is within the European Union and that it will be easier for us to work with Serbia if it is inside the Union rather than if it remains outside.
That much seems obvious to me.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Serbian authorities must show greater commitment to cooperating with the Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, so as to ensure that the war criminals are caught.
We all agree that this is a precondition for the safety of the entire Balkan area and for the entire European Union, as well as a legal and moral obligation.
We must also see to it that the Serbian Government renews its commitment to a climate of peaceful coexistence among all the ethnic groups living in the land.
The Ministry of the Interior has already been undertaking initiatives to prevent and control inter-ethnic incidents in Vojvodina since 2004, but the participation of minorities in social life and their proper institutional representation must be promoted.
We are all in favour of an immediate settlement on the status of Kosovo this December.
Nevertheless, many problems will remain unresolved, beginning with the need to clamp down on Albanian organised crime which is destabilising the whole geographical area, including the areas bordering on Macedonia and Albania, thus greatly endangering the overall safety of the Balkans as a whole.
Kosovo must not be abandoned to its own devices.
We must demand that the safety of the entire Balkan area be secured by means of a continued European Union presence.
From this point of view, accelerated entry into the EU by Serbia would stabilise the area, not least with respect to illegal trafficking in every field possible and imaginable: trafficking is rife throughout the Balkans, beginning with the environmental sector.
We must call on Serbia to act quickly to introduce a proper environmental policy in respect of energy, as well as water treatment and an integrated waste cycle, so as to prevent organised crime from getting its hands on this sector too.
(HU) Mr President, the report by Mr Kacin marks a turning point in the attitude of the European Parliament.
For a very long time, the European Parliament one-sidedly rewarded the Albanians and punished the Serbs in every statement it made on Kosovo.
Here at last we have a credible, objective picture of Serbia, and the reason why this is crucial is because we must ensure that Serbia is no longer given the role of punchbag or scapegoat.
This does not mean, however, that the Serbs will not some day have to come to terms with the crimes of the MiloÅ¡eviÄ era, just as the Kosovo Albanians, and every people, must come to terms with their historical crimes.
It is good and proper that we are drawing Serbia closer to the European Union, and I agree that visa facilitation is not enough; we should establish a visa-free regime for Serbia's citizens, and it is at least as important to speed up the process of granting Serbia candidate status.
Here we have Kosovo, which presents a huge risk; according to Council of Europe intelligence estimates, around 100 000 refugees, Serb refugees, are expected to leave Kosovo, and it will be largely Vojvodina that has to deal with this situation.
Thanks are due for the fact that Mr Kacin's proposed amendments give an objective picture of the inter-ethnic processes in Vojvodina, of the atrocities that still persist, and of the need to legislate on the legal status of the National Councils, the need for proportional representation of minorities in the police force and the judicial system, and the need to maintain minority radio broadcasting and funding for it.
All in all, I congratulate Mr Kacin: drawing Serbia closer to the European Union is an important step.
Thank you for your attention.
(HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Madam President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this report, and believe that the version adopted by the Commission is a particularly good and balanced one.
Serbia's prospects for European Union membership are especially important for Hungary.
We have a fundamental interest in seeing our neighbour admitted into this Community as soon as possible.
This represents the only alternative for reconciliation as opposed to inter-ethnic strife, war, and discrimination against people or humiliating them because their mother tongue or customs happen to be different.
Obviously, we are not indifferent to the fate of Serbia's Hungarian ethnic minority, and indeed we have made an effort to keep the issue of Vojvodina on the European agenda.
Something that is very important, and I am glad to see that it is in the report, is to draw attention to the need to maintain the multi-ethnic character of Vojvodina that has evolved over many centuries.
The basis for this multi-ethnicity is the coexistence of different ethnic groups, the kind of coexistence that is based not on silence and humiliation, but on genuine equality before the law and equal opportunities.
At present, unfortunately, this is not part of day-to-day reality there.
I believe it is particularly important to maintain the region's ethnic balance and its special characteristics, and, in my opinion, resettling Serb refugees in this region would jeopardise chances of maintaining this precarious balance and could exacerbate inter-ethnic conflict.
We have already seen a good many ugly examples of such conflict in the recent past.
In this connection I would draw your attention, for example, to a case that remains unresolved to this day: the fate of the ethnic Hungarian youths who were given a disproportionately severe sentence in a clear-cut example of ethnic discrimination in Temerin.
All in all, therefore, the Balkans need the European Union, because the spirit, principles and institutional system of the European Union, and the fact that it is consistent - and I lay particular emphasis on the latter - will be able to bring about a life that is liveable.
Thank you very much.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have naturally followed this debate with great interest and I have of course taken note of the suggestions and concerns that many Members have voiced.
As it happens, the result of this debate seems clear to me: it points to the fact that only by giving Serbia a truly European perspective can peace, stability and progress be achieved in that country, and also stability in the whole Western Balkans region.
This is absolutely accepted as the Council has repeatedly asserted that the future of Serbia naturally lies in its future membership of the European Union.
We all know that this plan cannot be without conditions.
There must of course be conditions which will and must relate to the internal political process within Serbia itself, to respect for democratic values and to respect for those values specific to the rule of law.
However, these conditions also of course relate to Serbia's essential cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal.
Much has been done by Serbia in this respect to cooperate with the Tribunal.
We all know that other actions and steps will have to be taken.
However, please allow me to express a note of confidence and encouragement that the Serbian authorities will be able, by the end of this process, to take the necessary steps so that this cooperation becomes full cooperation.
We in the European Union must help Serbia.
We believe it would be a strategic error to leave Serbia and its people in a kind of limbo without any direction, perspective or plan.
This is a strategic error that we must not commit and, to this end, we must do everything we can to prevent it.
I must also of course welcome the progress made in relation to the possibility of the free movement of Serbian nationals within the European space.
We must continue along this road.
Something has been done and this and the other initiatives that we are taking must be duly applauded.
We must also offer future prospects to the youth of Serbia as it is naturally through and with them that a democratic Serbia can be built which fully shares our values and principles and which aspires to be an integral part of the European Union.
Commissioner. - (FI) Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank everyone for an objective and responsible debate, as well as the rapporteur for a very factual report.
Judging from the discussion, there is broad consensus in Parliament and the Union as a whole that Serbia's future is in the European Union and that the European Union's door will be open to Serbia when the country meets the conditions, and that its government has the means to take Serbia into Europe.
The majority of Serbian citizens support and endorse this development.
The Serbian government is now playing the role very much of a guard: it has the keys in its hands.
I hope that the Serbian government will now use its keys and implement the will of the Serbian people - the will of the Serbs to turn towards the European Union.
You may be sure that we shall take note of the views expressed in the report, and that we will also include them in our own progress report.
(EL) The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 25 October 2007.
EU-Africa relations (debate)
(EL) The next item is the report [2007/2002(ÎÎÎ)] (Î6-0375/2007) by Mrs Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the state of play of EU-Africa relations.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the report on the state of play of relations between the European Union and Africa.
This sets out a shared vision on the part of Africa and Europe on future cooperation with a view to promoting development in Africa and combating poverty.
The strategy must amount to more than just defending present policy.
It is about a vision, based on shared values and principles, on mutual respect, that is geared to the well-being of people.
Africa and Europe have a long shared history, but relations between them really have changed: it can no longer be one-way traffic.
Now it is about an equal partnership to tackle together problems that are affecting both continents, such as security, trade, migration and climate change.
The European Union produced a European strategy for Africa in 2005.
I was also the rapporteur on that occasion.
In our view that strategy had two important shortcomings.
It was a strategy that was too much for Africa, but without involving Africa, and Parliament and civil society were not sufficiently involved in the development of this strategy.
I am pleased that we are now talking about a Joint EU-Africa Strategy and that Parliament and civil society will be more involved this time.
This cooperation augurs very well for the future.
Madam President, this strategy should provide us with the structure and direction for joint action in the future.
The fight against poverty and the Millennium Development Goals must continue to occupy centre stage.
Although the most recent MDG figures permit a degree of optimism, in sub-Saharan Africa 41.1% of people still live on 1 dollar a day.
This situation cannot be improved with development aid alone.
It is also necessary to foster economic growth.
The economic partnership agreements being negotiated at the moment could be a good instrument for this, provided - and I stress this point - they have sustainable development at their core and provided they are more than just European trade agreements.
I would very much like to hear from the Commissioner about the situation regarding the possible postponement of the deadline of 1 January 2008.
Madam President, African governments are, of course, primarily responsible for development in their own countries.
They have become more independent, both politically and economically.
