After proposals from Mr Fischer and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der, this week it is Mr Jospin' s stance that augurs a European future based on nation states.
I listened to the news with approval, both because I belong to the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and because, since I was elected to this Parliament twelve years ago, I have supported achieving political union without sidelining the nation states.
A confederation of states, respecting the principle of subsidiarity and respecting differences, would enrich a united Europe and its peoples.
I do not agree with the emphasis placed on the convention model as the body to prepare for the coming umpteenth Intergovernmental Conference, because a Parliament which cannot change a comma in the text drafted by the convention becomes a democratic fiction.
We have already endured that situation.
We do not want the bill on the future of the Union submitted to us for consent as well, because that is the same as being told that we can debate as long as we like but we cannot amend the text.
The future of Europe cannot be entrusted just to a convention, however enlightened and elite, but it must remain a prerogative of the representatives of the institutions and of the people's elected representatives.
We are also puzzled by the fact that there is talk of the role to be played by the national parliaments before our own Parliament has finally been granted the prerogatives proper to an institution elected by direct universal suffrage.
We are beginning to eliminate the democratic deficit Altiero Spinelli spoke of long ago, but it still exists and we fail to eradicate it because we talk too much and do too little.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mrs Seguro on their joint report and the work involved, and the Constitutional Committee and the other committees who worked towards this debate.
We have had the work in committee and now we have to make a choice in plenary.
Conservative MEPs will be opposing this report, not as a verdict on the Treaty of Nice, but rather to initiate a change of procedure in preparations for the next IGC and to raise the subject of galvanising public awareness and participation in the post-Nice debate.
The hallmark of the report is its proposal for the formation of a convention to prepare for the next Intergovernmental Conference This convention would consist of representatives from the Commission, national governments, the European Parliament and national parliaments and it would prepare the agenda and the proposals for the next IGC.
We are not convinced this is the right course.
Moreover there are a number of clauses that we Conservatives are unable to support in this report, such as the inclusion in the Treaty of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights or the extension of QMV to cover taxation.
However, despite the connotations surrounding the subject of this report, there is no explicit "yes" or "no" given to the Treaty of Nice itself.
It raises however the important points of increased democracy and transparency for the next IGC.
We believe that there should be an early IGC.
I agree with that part of the report, which calls for this, because this would place the main choices before the European public, including I hope by then some enlargement countries, so that they could make their choices at the next European election.
I look forward to the debate at that time.
Mr President, the Treaty of Nice represents both a failure and an opportunity.
It is a failure because it does not contain the necessary reforms for the Union to appropriately confront all its present and future challenges.
For example, it does not include either co-decision as standard or the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Nice is also an opportunity, however, because the announcement of the next IGC leaves the door open to a new phase in European integration, whose objectives are to respond to the demands of the citizens, to put an end to the democratic deficit, to implement the European social model, to intervene, with our own ideas, in globalisation, in order to regulate it, and to complete enlargement without turning the EU into a mere free trade area.
Today more than ever it is essential that we opt for a bigger and better Europe, for a more political Europe with more European policies, for an enlarged federal political Union which is more democratic and efficient.
Because our present situation must not be weakened in the future, by renationalising policies such as cohesion. On the contrary, we must complement the euro with an economic government for the Union, build a social Europe and provide a realistic budget which is sufficient and progressive.
The key to this new cycle must be to adopt a European constitution by means of a radically democratic process which goes way beyond Nice and is led by a convention, made up equally of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament - whose final composition will have to be set within this framework - and national parliaments, which produces a constitutional proposal which will have to be formally adopted before the European elections.
Tomorrow, on voting by a majority for this magnificent report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro - who I congratulate on their work - the European Parliament, as we hope also national parliaments will do, will demand of governments that they accept this option and understand its message; Constitution and convention - not more Treaties or more intergovernmental deviation - and that they do not once again respond timidly to the great challenges facing us.
Mr President, an unbecoming process and a still worse result, is what many here in Parliament are saying for a variety of reasons.
All right, perhaps that is the case, but democracy is a human creation after all, and only a human creation.
One thing is quite clear, however.
Those who vote against the Treaty of Nice are voting against solving the EU' s most important problem right now, namely that of enlargement.
That is how simple it is, irrespective of the reasons given for voting against.
Those who establish the ground rules have defined the Treaty of Nice as the turning point for enlargement of the Union, and that is the case, irrespective of the fact that others want to see different ground rules.
We could therefore try to find new ground rules for the future, but ones which do not affect ourselves alone but, above all, involve the people.
Moreover, I must appeal to the media to participate in this process and, it might also be said, perhaps to take their public service remit seriously for once.
Mr President, I find it pleasing that is that there are so many participants in this debate that it is going on longer than planned.
However, I regret that since it has gone on longer I must leave the debate in order not to miss the last flight to Sweden.
To return to the beginning of the debate and the contributions that were made then, I do not know whether I can promise Mr Cox an Irish pub with beer, or whether I can promise Mr Voggenhuber a European bazaar, but as I said in my introductory statement, as Swedish Foreign Minister I believe in a genuinely open forum - a convention.
I can agree with what Mr Poettering, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, Mrs Kaufmann and others have said, that a convention is an important part of the preparations.
However, at the same time we must remain open to other preparations as regards national committees and debates, as regards technical preparatory groups and the like.
I would like to come back to Mr Cox' s comparison with the Irish pub, where no doubt the beer represented the convention.
I have also been to Irish pubs and I agree that the beer plays the most important role, but there has also been the possibility of having a mineral water, a fruit juice or a glass of wine, so we can no doubt show the same generosity when it comes to preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.
The decision on whether or not to have a convention will be taken in Laeken, but it is my hope that we will move in the right direction in Gothenburg.
I would also like briefly to touch on the criticism of Nice.
I believe that it is over-hasty to say that the decision-making process is worse following the Treaty of Nice, as some speakers have done.
After all, we know the problems that we see arising when decisions have to be taken unanimously.
Now we are making decisions by qualified majority in many more areas.
At the same time, in practice it is often the case that where we have the right to take decisions by qualified majority compromises and decisions are forced through, and it is very unusual for there to be a formal vote.
When we evaluate the Treaty of Nice I believe that we will see that in practice the decision-making process has actually been improved.
Moreover, I would like to agree with the speakers who said that Nice was decisive for being able to continue with the enlargement and that Nice has therefore played an important part in ensuring that what is the most important matter for the Union today, namely enlargement, will continue to be important.
As far as that is concerned, as President-in-Office of the Council I also think that it is pleasing to be able to state that we now have an agreement between the Member States concerning free movement of labour, which also allows us to move on in the enlargement negotiations.
Finally I would like to thank you for today' s debate.
Mr President, for some unknown reason I have not been able to speak amongst the draftspeople of the opinions of the different committees, but I am now going to give the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believes that the non-introduction of co-decision is one of the main issues left undealt with at Nice. Therefore, agriculture is still receiving discriminatory treatment in comparison with fields connected to it such as public health, consumer protection or the internal market.
We believe that the Nice Summit has left the public with the image of States which are excessively concerned about the distribution of internal power within the institutions and has led to serious doubts over the Council' s capacity and political will to reach the necessary agreements required by agricultural policy.
These reforms must respond to the increasing demands of the European citizens, to the challenges of enlargement and to our commitments within the World Trade Organisation.
Furthermore, we believe that following Nice the complex process of decision-making is becoming even more complicated, if that is possible, and this may paralyse the coming reforms of the CAP.
We do not want this situation to endanger the guarantee of the European farm model which - we must not forget - is a fundamental element of the European social model.
For all these reasons, we ask that the next Intergovernmental Conference consider the modification of the agricultural chapters of the Treaties in order to introduce co-decision.
We sincerely believe that the new agricultural policy, based on the principles of multi-functionality and sustainability, requires and demands co-decision in order to achieve greater democratic legitimacy, greater transparency and also - of course - greater coherence in the agricultural policy which European society is demanding.
Mr President, the basic philosophy behind the Treaty of Nice is how to strengthen the unifying policy of integration and do more for European monopolies.
This endeavour is still encountering problems, including among the very people who inspired it, as to who will have the upper hand in Europe following enlargement.
The pitiful bartering on qualified majority voting which took place in Nice, and which almost blew the Summit apart, confirms this and anyone who talks of a European family is guilty of hypocrisy.
The report under discussion today applauds the anti-democratic and reactionary provisions of the Treaty of Nice and lobbies for even more anti-democratic arrangements, such as the abolition of the veto and various other issues, the integration of foreign policy and defence and security policy, the inclusion of fundamental anti-grass roots rights in the Treaty and the facility to circumvent national parliaments by creating a special convention to table a proposal for a constitution.
This is an unacceptable proposal; the people of Europe are already fighting against the thrust of it and will continue to do so.
Mr President, I approve of the MÃ©ndez de Vigo-Seguro report, which represents an excellent summary of the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The reunification of Europe is indeed a historic turning point, but a turning point which calls for a far-reaching reform of the institutions of the Union.
The Nice Summit exhausted the intergovernmental method which necessarily involves difficult mediation between national interests.
What is needed now is a constituent convention to define, before the European elections, a model capable of guaranteeing democracy and efficiency in Union action.
The report avoids exacerbating the argument about the Treaty of Nice, but clearly condemns its limitations.
However, we cannot remain silent, waiting for Laeken, at a time when influential spokesmen of national governments are addressing issues fundamental to the future of the Union.
Chancellor SchrÃ¶der has spoken of a European federation, Prime Minister Jospin of a Europe of nations. I do not know what Aznar and Berlusconi will say, but I do know that the specific problems of the Community and the reform of the institutions are two sides of the same coin, and I do know that Europe must become a political area with a democratic soul.
Parliament cannot stand on the sidelines of this debate.
The future of Europe cannot be left entirely to market forces and confrontation between national governments.
Parliament must promote a debate going beyond the pragmatism that ties the hands of the national governments.
Because of the things we have heard, that debate also tells us we must be braver and more forward-looking if we claim to be realists.
Mr President, I also want to thank Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro for this excellent report, which reflects the opinion of the vast majority here in the European Parliament.
I am sure we will find that tomorrow in the vote.
I should also like to note, however, that this is the first time the European Parliament is not saying a clear yes to a European treaty.
This is something new and different from Maastricht and Amsterdam.
I think it should sound an alarm to the governments that negotiated this treaty.
We are not saying a clear yes because we are not satisfied with the results and because we believe neither freedom of action nor, of course, democratic control are guaranteed in a Union that is now being extended to 20 or 25 states.
The formal obstacles have been removed, but there are still material problems of efficiency and transparency.
This is a cause for concern.
It is why we cannot say a clear yes.
We want something to be done about what happened in Nice.
I can only agree that there must now be a convention to prepare for the next European treaty.
It must have a clear mandate to produce a treaty that the citizens, too, can read and understand.
It must be a mandate for a constitutional treaty, a document that will create the basis for this enlarged Union.
I should like to confine myself to a core subject for this convention, namely removing the democratic deficit in the Union.
We all talk about it, but we still have different ideas about how it should be done.
I believe the most important institution for the citizens is the European Parliament, not the Council of Ministers.
This Parliament must therefore be strengthened.
We unite people, not states.
We therefore need the Europe of citizens and not just a Europe of governments!
Mr President, five arguments.
First, yes to the constituent convention, but it also needs to represent the regional level.
Secondly, we need a federalist constitution based on subsidiarity from Union to Member State and from Member State to regional community.
The third argument is the trickiest: we need a sort of pyramid-shaped constitution of European citizens with us, the powers and institutions of the Union, at the top, the logic of the states, at least those that remain, at the second level and the regional constitutions taking up the most space.
That brings me to the fourth argument, which is that the Treaty of Nice will only be swallowed if we have already done this groundwork.
Finally, the constitution must offer an international guarantee to the minority populations of Europe.
Mr President, basically, my views have been covered in the initial position taken by Mr Kaufmann and my other fellow Members on behalf of our group.
I should just like to say briefly that the Nice Summit was held against a background of total indifference on the part of the citizens of Europe, despite the fact that it has serious repercussions for them, and total indifference on the part of the governments towards the citizens of Europe.
This is clear from both the content and the fate of the Charter of Human Rights.
Yet again we witnessed the crudest form of bartering, in contrast to the grand declarations being made by the German chancellor, the French Prime Minister and so on. The point is, where was this attitude, where were Mr SchrÃ¶der's and Mr Fischler's dreams when negotiations were taking place in Nice?
Having said which, here we are, post Nice, and I think that the European Parliament can help take us in a new direction; one step could be making up the huge democratic deficit and taking part in constitutional procedures and another could be moving towards certain policies to benefit the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, this is the first time in fifty years, if you look back on fifty years of European history, that those responsible for Europe have had to judge a treaty which puts Europe back.
Until now, all the treaties, each in their turn, have been treaties which push Europe forward to a greater or lesser degree.
This is the first treaty which puts Europe back.
For a long time, there have, in fact, been two stakes on the table and two historic stakes at that: the first is to build up European power and the second is to give those in charge of this power, those in charge of this European power, democratic credentials.
Power on the one hand, democracy on the other.
Then along comes the Treaty of Nice establishing European impotence for a long time to come; it brings impotence to the heart of the European institutions and it brings a lack of transparency, which is the opposite of European democracy.
These were the two stakes, and both have been lost.
Which is why the Europe of Nice will not work.
What we are, in fact, offering the countries which we have invited to join us and which are joining us, and some enthusiastically so, is a fools' bargain.
They are entering a house in which European impotence and a lack of transparency are the main features.
That is why I fear, even though I hear what is being said about post Nice, that post Nice will fail to come up to our expectations.
In Nice, we bought a one-way ticket, which is why the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro resolution is a critical resolution.
I would like it to be even more critical, however, which is why I shall abstain.
Mr President.
I would like to join in the praise that many Members have given to Mr Seguro and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
I share Mr Corbett' s view that if the rapporteurs had not done such a good job then Parliament would in all probability have recommended voting against Nice.
Despite the fact that I share the criticism that has been advanced, I believe that a no vote would have been much worse than a yes.
The reason for this is that the important enlargement process would then have been delayed, which is not something that I want to see happen.
I agree with much of the criticism.
The major critical viewpoints concern the fact that following Nice the Treaty is more difficult to understand, which also affects our citizens' ability to participate in the Europe debate.
It is a difficult treaty that is difficult to understand.
Moreover, it risks becoming ineffective through the fact that we have made it more difficult to make decisions by qualified majority.
It is true that more areas are covered by qualified majority voting, but these are not that important.
The really important areas were not brought into this form of decision-making, which is unfortunate now that the Union is being enlarged.
This is something that we must change.
We need more decisions by qualified majority and codetermination rights for Parliament.
The second form of criticism concerns openness and the way in which the Treaty was negotiated.
I have heard that some have likened the negotiations to the choice of a pope, with people having shut themselves away in a room and then come out with a compromise.
No outsiders were allowed to participate in the process.
Let us not do this again.
Let us start the convention, and let it become the starting point for the next Intergovernmental Conference.
After all, it does not mean that we must not carry on national debate with organisations and others.
In this connection I also think that it is important that we accept our responsibility as politicians.
We must not make the institutional debate the main issue; we must start from the objective questions: What do we actually want to do with the EU?
How is this to be done?
What tools shall we use?
We must start with the objective debate.
Mr President, the key question remains: has Nice prepared the European Union for the pending historical enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe?
The answer is clearly no!
Nice is too restricted as a step forward.
We should not, however, throw away the baby with the bath water.
The new Treaty also contains upbeat points, and it would be a serious political mistake simply to wipe this new Treaty off the table.
What matters now is to look to the future, to a wider and, at the same time, deeper debate on the EU' s future.
Everything seems to be focusing on the Belgian Presidency and the Declaration of Laeken.
However, we should not create any false hope: Laeken will not bring a new treaty and cannot provide a solution for the shortcomings which Nice has left behind.
Laeken must, however, outline a roadmap, the agenda, the method and timing, to reach a new Intergovernmental Conference which will need to rectify Nice.
Let us hope that both the present and candidate Member Sates will then be ready for an unmitigated deepening of the European integration process.
Mr President, President of the Council, the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice will make possible the enlargement of the EU.
This was also its main task.
All fifteen national parliaments in the Member States will ratify the Treaty during 2001, irrespective of how dissatisfied and critical the majority here in the European Parliament are.
Consequently, we Swedish Christian Democrats feel that item 42 concerning the consent of the European Parliament to the accession Treaties for the candidate countries could be worded so as to be considerably more positive and welcoming.
How will item 42 be received in Estonia, in Poland or Cyprus?
Neither can my party approve item 25, which opens the way for the introduction of a common European level of taxation - and with decision rules based on a qualified majority.
All our historical experience shows that new tax levels and new decision levels for tax deductions lead to higher taxes and less money left for the citizens.
Another core issue for the decision-making competence of every national parliament and national government concerns defence policy.
Sweden' s Christian Democrat party therefore cannot approve item 34 either, which calls for defence policy to be included in the so-called closer cooperation.
At the same time my party wishes to welcome two historical improvements that are proposed in the report.
Firstly, it is time to improve citizens' and the national parliaments' insight and control of the Council' s work and to make the Council' s meetings open when the Council acts as legislator.
We must have this openness if we are to be able to talk about democracy and not just about diplomacy within the EU.
In other words, we are in favour of item 11 and Amendment No 68.
Finally, the principle of subsidiarity needs to be clarified. We are consequently in favour of the PPE-DE' s Amendment No 77 concerning definition of the EU' s powers.
Mr President, the enlargement process is the bridge from the old Europe to the new.
The debate that we are having today and the report that we are discussing is a first step in that process.
It is important, however, that we do not allow ourselves to become prisoners of old ideas.
Despite our misgivings about one aspect or the other of this report, we should be brave enough to give the leadership that the people of Europe expect from this Parliament, the elected representatives of the people of Europe.
This report does not close off any options.
It does not seek to give a view on the ratification of Nice.
That is being left to the Member States whose responsibility it is.
I happen to be campaigning in Ireland for a "yes" vote but it is a critical "yes".
I have my criticisms of the Treaty of Nice, but it is important that we be brave enough to say, "Of course, we have problems, but it is important that the enlargement process gets under way".
Most importantly in the debate about the future of Europe is the kind of Europe we want: do we want a democratically participative Europe, do we want a socially inclusive Europe?
If we do, it will not happen by accident.
We must get involved in the debate, we have to persuade people here and in our own Member States.
We must provide not only a forum at European level through a convention, but also ensure that there are fora in every Member State, so that people in each Member State can talk and debate with each other with other people in Europe.
Mr President, the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice is taking place at a defining moment in our relationship with the European Union.
Before the end of this decade, instead of being a major beneficiary of EU funding, we will become a net contributor to the EU budget.
Fortunately, this is not having any significant impact on the attitude of Irish voters to the Treaty of Nice.
Unlike the Spanish and Italian governments, Irish citizens are not being selfish about the effects of enlargement on our future share of structural and cohesion funding.
Instead there is the positive recognition that we have an obligation to assist the fledgling democracies in the former communist countries.
Nevertheless, they have real fears about aspects of the Treaty.
They are particularly concerned that the traditional, consensual, decision-making process of the EU is being abandoned in favour of a system whereby larger Member States will exercise power at the expense of smaller countries.
They are also worried that enhanced cooperation could create a first and second-class citizenship within the EU.
Furthermore, the establishment of the Rapid Reaction Force under the Amsterdam Treaty has worried some people that it will bring to an end Ireland's military neutrality.
I do not share these concerns, but Irish citizens need assurance in these points, not only in the context of this debate, but also with regard to long-term Irish interests within the EU.
If they want to maintain Irish influence in Europe, and especially the respected reputation that we have painstakingly built up over the years, the best way of achieving this is to ratify the Treaty of Nice: to reject it is to reject enlargement and unravel the process.
However, no one can afford to be complacent about the outcome of the Irish referendum.
Bearing in mind that voters will be going to the polls in both Britain and Ireland next Thursday, it would be somewhat ironic, indeed tragic, if we were to witness a massive rejection of euro-scepticism in Britain while at the same time it gained significant ground in Ireland.
In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteurs, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, for their excellent report.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro.
Nice was in many ways a failure and, in my view, the IGC method is obsolete.
Nevertheless, we will be voting in favour of the resolution, for Nice has created the minimum conditions for enlargement.
Those who have suffered under that dictatorship for too long should not suffer under our lack of sufficient internal reforms.
Another reason for casting a positive vote is because what seemed inconceivable until six months ago, even in this House, is now increasingly becoming a possibility in Laeken, namely a true convention of the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the governments, the European Commission, together with the social organisations and the citizens.
The citizen' s input is crucial to ensure that the convention does not degenerate into a technical debate for experts which is unintelligible to the citizen.
Mr President, that convention may not turn into a no-strings-attached talk shop: practical compromises must be reached which only in the final stage are rounded off formally by the IGC.
Prior to that convention, we, as European Parliament, will this autumn have to put our own specific ideas about Europe' s future on the table, and the resolution is right to point this out.
I would like the following: a European government whose prime minister is elected with a mandate on all matters which are best dealt with jointly, for example agriculture.
This would lead to more political integration and a new European federation.
I also want more subsidiarity, however, for that means that we will be better able to meet the local and regional needs.
More than anything, I want more democracy.
A valuable, powerful, democratic European Parliament, elected by the European citizens, with codecision in all areas of policy, and with a European constitution founded on the Fundamental Rights Charter.
Mr President, we have a fine future ahead of us, and I believe that we did some sterling work in this resolution.
I therefore hope that we as a group will be achieving a decent majority for a better approach.
Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Mr President-in-Office, the Treaty of Nice fails to go far enough not only in institutional matters but in a number of important spheres.
Take the very topical example of the common European trade policy.
It is based on common principles and there is in principle majority voting.
The small extension now being made in Article 113, Services and Intellectual Property, is counteracted by six exceptions and three proposals to the Council itself not to go beyond the spheres assigned to it.
At the same time, the consultation of the European Parliament provided for up until now is eliminated with the result that today, unlike in the USA, there is no possibility for Parliament to play a formal part in Europe, either at national or European level, in broad areas of trade policy.
We therefore demand, as clearly formulated in item 27 of the MÃ©ndez de Vigo/Seguro report, that the European Parliament be fully involved in the common trade and external economic relations policy, both in the framing of policy and in the negotiation and conclusion of agreements - and here with codecision - because if the national parliaments no longer have any powers over common trade policy it is urgently necessary for the European Parliament to take their place as an element of democratic control and that formal provision be made for it to do so.
Otherwise, when it comes to negotiations with the World Trade Organisation we as the European Parliament will be faced with an American Congress with full powers to act and able to give guidance to its administration whereas the European Parliament still has no formal powers in this respect.
I therefore call on the Swedish Presidency to show the way forward so that the Belgian Presidency can get an effective revision of Article 133 adopted by the Council in Laeken when it comes to rectifying the Treaty of Nice.
Mr President, honourable Members, may I say a few words on behalf of the Commission at the close of this long debate, starting by reiterating how much I personally, who am in charge of the reform of the institutions for the Commission, have appreciated the quality and efficiency of the parliamentary debates held here or in your Committee on Constitutional Affairs under the chairmanship of Mr Napolitano over the ten months leading up to Nice.
I should like, therefore, to thank you for that and to thank the pairs of MEPs who have addressed these questions in turn, be it Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, Elmar Brok and Professor Tsatsos during the IGC or Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, whom I should like to thank today.
We, the Commission and the European Parliament, have worked well together so it is hardly surprising that we have the same take on the contents of the Treaty of Nice.
I have already had occasion to say, and I shall repeat today, that this treaty is, in my view, a useful, short-term treaty.
It is useful because of the advances which it makes: Article 7, the reform of the jurisdictional system, which certainly needed reforming, more flexible reinforced cooperation, which we certainly need and the legal basis which you wanted for a clear and transparent statute for the political parties.
It is useful, above all, as many of you have emphasised, because it changes the light from amber to green as far as enlargement is concerned.
It is a useful treaty, but it is a short-term treaty.
What I mean by that, ladies and gentlemen, is that, in my view, the answers which it provides to the institutional challenge of creating a Union of thirty members which functions properly will not stand up in the long run to the problems which this Union of thirty members will encounter in the medium and long term.
There are too many unanimous votes and too many rights of veto.
We know full well that, with thirty members, this right of veto will be a source of impotence or collective weakness.
Codecision does not apply generally to all Community legislation, as we wanted, and it is a pity that the European Parliament plays no part in commercial policy.
Finally, to say that the voting system will remain or become more complex is an understatement.
At this stage, and before you return your verdict in all good conscience and responsibility, I should like to repeat that this treaty is useful, that it is a short-term treaty, that we need to take note of it, that we need to use it and that we then need to move on.
Its main merit is that it paves the way for proceeding smoothly and quite quickly towards enlargement.
Another of its merits is contained in the annex, as if the heads of state and government realised, at five o'clock in the morning once they had signed the text, that they could not leave it at that and they decided to start a new exercise there and then, as if they too had a bad conscience.
Well, both the European Parliament and, more importantly, the Commission, will have to commit to this new exercise, which takes us up to 2004 and for which a new method has been authorised, proving that the intergovernmental method alone has had its day.
So now we have time to start a real public debate.
As I said to the ministers of foreign affairs the other day we must find a way, in Gothenburg first of all, and perhaps in Laeken, but mainly in Gothenburg, of making an overall assessment of the national debates which are held, rather than holding a series of juxtaposed debates, a way of exchanging practices and information, of sort of cross-fertilising these national debates.
The Commission, like the European Parliament, will be standing by at the Council's side, ready to turn these national debates into a European debate when the time is right.
This public debate should enable us to make a sweeping examination of the weaknesses of the institutions and, over and above institutional questions, to start discussing the European project once again.
What is our common objective?
Do we want to remain a large market which functions well with a single currency or do we want to go beyond that?
How can we reinforce the community of values, the community of solidarity which has existed between us for the past fifty years?
To prove that this European project obviously needs to evolve, but that it has borne fruit, especially with the Community model, which has functioned well, and with Community policies, which have been so useful.
I should like in particular to remind you of the fruits of the policy for which I am responsible, the policy of cohesion.
This is what is so important about the major debate to which we are committed.
Then, in 2002 and 2003, we will need to find a way of structuring this debate, of structuring our work so that we can prepare the final Intergovernmental Conference properly.
That is why, in 2002 and 2003, as President Prodi said, we too are in favour of setting up a convention of all four institutional partners, along the lines of the model which worked so well for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the national governments and the Commission.
Having said which, I have not replied to all the questions raised, especially concerning the association of the candidate countries because we hope, in 2004, to carry out a major reform which will affect them directly, just as if affects us, today, in the Union.
I think they too should have a place at the convention table.
We shall also have to decide how best to organise the work of this convention.
We know full well, ladies and gentlemen, that this convention - and I say this to reassure the Member States which have concerns on this count - will not take any decisions; it will make proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, which will then have to take the final decisions quickly and at the highest level.
This convention, however, from my point of view and in the light of the different experiences which we have had and which I personally had in Amsterdam, Nice and in the fundamental rights convention, this convention is, I think, the best way of ensuring that the next IGC is a success.
It is the best way of achieving greater transparency, of having a real debate, because the four institutional partners involved in this preparatory work and in these proposals have the means, just as you have the means, of going beyond these doors and explaining what is happening to the elected representatives and citizens of our countries.
This therefore is the sine qua non to transparency and it is the sine qua non to proper democratic explanation.
I should therefore like to say, on behalf of the Commission, that we are in favour of this convention in 2002 and 2003, because it is instrumental to the success of the exercise started in Nice and to real reform - this time in 2004.
In all events, as far as the European Commission is concerned, it will participate fully, you may be sure, in preparing the various stages which will take us towards major reform between now and 2004.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Council and Commission mission to Korea
The next item is the statements by the Council and Commission on the results of the Council and Commission Mission to Korea.
Mr President, the European Parliament has requested that the Council provide information on the visit to the Korean peninsular made by Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson on 2-4 May in his capacity as President of the EU.
Talks were held in Pyongyang with the North Korean leader, Chairman Kim Chung-il, and the number two in the North Korean power hierarchy Kim Chong-nam, and in Seoul with President Kim Dae-jung.
The High Representative Javier Solana and Commissioner Chris Patten participated.
The initiative for the mission was taken in December last year when President Kim Dae-jung visited Stockholm, in connection with receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, for talks with the Swedish Prime Minister Mr Persson.
President Kim Dae-jung emphasised that Sweden' s long-established contacts with the countries on the Korean peninsula could play a valuable role during the Swedish Presidency.
Following discussions between the EU Member States and also with representatives of both North and South Korea a decision on the mission was made at the EU Summit in Stockholm on 23-24 March 2001.
The visit was based on the Council' s conclusions and guidelines from October and November 2000.
During its visit to Pyongyang on 2-3 May the EU delegation had long talks with substantial content with Kim Chung-il, and thereafter this was presented to President Kim Dae-jung in South Korea.
In summary, the results were good.
Firstly, an assurance was given that North Korea will stand by the common declaration made at the inter-Korean Summit in Pyongyang in June 2000.
An assurance was also given that Chairman Kim Chung-il wishes to see a second summit, but that the time must be right for this.
Chairman Kim Chung-il emphasised secondly the importance of relations between the USA and North Korea and inter-Korean relations developing in parallel.
Thirdly, he confirmed that North Korea would stand by the 1994 framework agreement between North Korea and the USA, as well as by the missile moratorium until 2003.
However, missile exports would not cease until North Korea received promises of compensation for any lost export revenues.
The exports were a purely commercial issue.
Fourthly, North Korea also acknowledged the need for economic reforms and agreed to send a North Korean delegation to Europe to learn more about the market economy.
Fifthly, Chairman Kim Chung-il confirmed that North Korea was willing to start a discussion on human rights with the EU.
From the EU side it was emphasised that the issue of human rights is of central importance for the EU' s policy.
I hope that a first meeting will be able to take place during the Swedish Presidency.
Sixthly, the need for better working conditions and inspection of aid projects by the UN and non-governmental organisations in North Korea was discussed.
Finally, I would like to say that the South Korean side was very positive towards the results of the meeting, particularly the assurances concerning a second summit and missile defence.
The EU' s visit was a fruitful one.
However, the results of our efforts cannot be finally assessed for a couple of years yet.
The USA will naturally play an important part in the continued process, but the EU' s efforts are not unimportant.
Mr President, the European Union strongly supports President Kim Dae-jung's sunshine policy and it was on this basis that the mission led by GÃ¶ran Persson, in which my colleague Chris Patten participated, took place.
The Union's role in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is complementary to that of the three main players: South Korea, United States of America and Japan.
Contrary to some press speculation, this mission was not intended as an attempt to supplant the American role: the US was briefed in advance and fully supported the initiative.
Thus press reports of an EU-diplomatic challenge to the United States were way off the mark.
The timing, however, was influenced by our desire to help maintain momentum in the reconciliation process on the Korean peninsula while the United States is finalising its policy review.
The visit obtained, as we have already heard, significant results and the European Union team had some five hours of interesting discussion with President Kim Chung-il during which it was able to address its concerns in full.
We are now following up in five areas: first, existing assistance is being continued.
A maximum allocation of EUR 7 million is foreseen for humanitarian assistance and EUR 20 million for food aid and food security under the 2001 budget.
The most appropriate projects to support and the conditions to be applied will be discussed with North Korea in the coming weeks.
Secondly, preparations to launch our technical assistance are moving ahead and a project identification mission to North Korea is expected shortly in order to agree the design of two pilot projects with the North Korean authorities: these will each be close to EUR 1 million and will aim particularly at training officials in key ministries and at basic institution building.
Third, preparations are going ahead to organise discussions with North Korea on human rights in Brussels on 13 June.
Fourthly, we are exploring ways to develop a dialogue with North Korea on economic reform by organising study visits to the Union.
Fifth and finally, we are studying options for diplomatic accreditation arrangements with North Korea following the decision to establish diplomatic relations on 14 May.
Since this will require negotiations, I do not wish to speculate at this point on the detail.
Meanwhile, we await with interest the completion of the US policy review on North Korea and hope that this will lead to progress in the inter-Korea reconciliation process.
Mr President, I should like to start by offering my very sincere thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission for the information which they have given us about the Union mission to North Korea.
The European Union must, indeed, be aware of its own stake in the future of the Korean peninsular.
Last January, the European Parliament asked both the Council and the Commission, following a visit from an ad hoc delegation, to take the measures needed to consolidate the policy of rapprochement between North and South Korea and open up North Korea to the international community.
In calling for the normalisation of relations between the European Union and North Korea, we did not mean to imply that we recognised a political regime which is a far cry from the fundamental values which we preach; we meant to imply that we support the so-called sunshine policy which President Kim Du-Yung has inaugurated with much courage and determination, because we realised that, without the active support of the international community, this policy would be doomed to failure in the long term and would quickly run out of steam in the short term.
That is why we appreciate the efforts being made by the Council and the Commission to achieve normalisation with a view to laying down coherent lines of action as regards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
I was interested to note that the European Union insisted on extending the rapprochement initiated with South Korea and the commitments made to it to Pyongyang.
We have always insisted that the entire nation should have access to foreign aid and that NGOs should be able to work in satisfactory conditions.
Other measures, such as granting visas and working facilities to European journalists would help to create the trust needed to put this rapprochement on a more stable footing.
I should like to close simply by saying that we must not overlook the fact that the process initiated will be long and gradual but that it is important in order to maintain the peace in this part of the world on which our own stability and security also depend.
Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes very much the official visit to North Korea and to Seoul by the Council, Commission and the High Representative of the CFSP.
Commissioner Patten, when he reported back to the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, said that the visit had gone ahead with modest aims, but those modest aims have been achieved and we welcome that.
As a parliamentarian, I am rather disappointed that the delegation managed to fit in 75 journalists but could not manage any parliamentarians on the grounds that the delegation was a small one.
I hope on future occasions the Commission and the Council might consider taking some parliamentarians along, particularly in the light of the fact that relations between North Korea and the European Union were pioneered by the European Parliament, over two years ago, when we sent our first official delegation.
I welcome the fact that there were good talks with Kim Chong-il.
Clearly North Korea is a state of concern.
We welcome the fact that they are continuing their moratorium on missile tests until 2004.
I recognise that at the moment they have very little option but to export military equipment.
They produce hardly any goods that anyone wants to buy apart from military equipment.
So it is hardly surprising that the No-dong I and No-dong II weapons which have a range of 1 300 kilometres have been sold to Iran, Syria and Pakistan or that the North Koreans are giving military aid to the Congo, Iran, Ethiopia and Syria.
The problem will be if they continue to test the Taepodong, which will have a range of something between 4 000 and 6 000 kilometres.
Obviously we welcome the moratorium.
We welcome the further aid that is going to given in the form of food aid.
We need improved access for European Union monitors to make sure that the aid is being distributed properly.
We welcome the increased assistance in the agricultural sector, particularly in the life of what we have been told that there is now some recognition that reform has to take place.
It is important to train North Koreans in modern industrial and clerical skills and we need to give aid in a non-nuclear energy sector as well as raising the textile quotas.
It is important that we have a human rights dialogue and I welcome the fact that on 13 June that dialogue is going to take place.
No one has mentioned KADO; the European Union is participating in the KADO programme for building two nuclear power stations in North Korea.
Unfortunately, we have cut the budget this time compared to the last time and if we are serious about assisting Kim Dae-jung with his sunshine policy that sends exactly the wrong signals.
We are very keen that diplomatic relations be established and I urge the Commission and the Council to consider placing an office in Pyongyang rather than making the Beijing office responsible for North Korea.
There will be no day-to-day contact if that is the case.
There is a distinction at the moment between the EU and the US and we hope we can move forward together, but if we cannot we will have to move forward separately, because the direction we are going is the right one.
Mr President, even those of us who have been lucky enough to have been to North Korea more than once find it hard to understand what that regime wants and where it is going.
After a surge of optimism last year, North Korea' s apparent process of opening up towards the outside world and developing relations with its southern neighbours has entered a period of stagnation.
Some would even say it was going backwards.
Well, personally, I wonder whether the visit by the European delegation last month was not a little premature.
Commissioner Patten told us yesterday - and it was repeated today - that human rights were also discussed during the talks, and they are systematically violated in this last of the communist dictatorships.
He did not tell us what the outcome was though, which suggests to me that not much was achieved.
Would it not have been better to obtain concessions in this delicate area first and then grant the reward of a visit to Pyongyang?
We hold cards that can induce the North Korean regime to treat its citizens decently and we are morally obliged to use them.
Another aspect of this visit that worries me is the relationship with the United States, which has a dominant position in that region and responsibilities far greater than Europe' s.
Commissioner Patten has told us that, even in this case, Washington was consulted about the visit. However, as the Commission mentioned, influential American commentators - including former Secretary of State, Mr Kissinger - were quite astonished at this mission, which gives the impression of wanting to fill and profit from a void temporarily left by the United States where, as we know, a review of policy on North Korea is in progress.
I would like reassurances from the Commission and the Council on these two points.
Mr President, I just thought I could make a few comments and reply to some of the questions.
Mr Santer, we can agree with everything you said and I also understand that working conditions for NGOs was one of the issues raised during the visit: the delegation understood that things have improved in the last year although there is probably very much more to be done.
To Mr Ford, maybe we are sometimes rigid in how we set up our delegations.
This was in the troika formation and journalists come anyway.
They were not part of the delegation, but they come.
Sometimes, of course, one could invite MEPs, but I understand that on this issue there is a good cooperation between the European Parliament, Commission and Council and I hope that can continue.
I do not have the right to say that in future there should be participation of MEPs, but we have noted your comment on this.
As regards the modalities of establishing diplomatic relations, this will soon be discussed with the North Koreans and I understand that no decision has yet been taken on the opening of a delegation, where it should be and how it should be done.
I hope I have covered the most important issues raised.
Thank you for your contributions.
Thank you for this additional response.
At the end of this debate, I received six motions for resolutions on Korea, in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Environmental policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
(A5-0172/2001) by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on bringing our needs and responsibilities together - integrating environmental issues with economic policy (COM(2000) 576 - C5-0012/2001 - 2001/2004(COS))
(A5-0171/2001) by Mrs HulthÃ©n, on behalf of Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on environment policy and sustainable development: preparing for the Gothenburg European Council (2000/2322(INI))
Ladies and gentlemen, on a point of order: Mr Blokland, you have made generous use of your time.
I grant you this with pleasure, as I do the next rapporteur, of course, but I would point out that we are now desperately running behind schedule.
I will have to try to monitor your speaking times more closely.
Mr President, I can overlook the fact that the previous speaker spoke a little too long on this subject.
Five minutes to debate sustainable development in a 25-year perspective is not much, and it is an art to be able to keep to the time margin exactly to the second.
The question is what we mean by a 'sustainability strategy' ?
Is it a new political buzzword that we are attempting to invent here in Parliament?
No, it is not.
It is an inheritance that goes back further in time.
We have had this task ever since it was decided in Rio nearly ten years ago that each nation was to establish a sustainability strategy.
So what is sustainability?
What are we actually talking about when we discuss sustainability?
Well, we are discussing the future of coming generations.
We are discussing what development, what life we want future generations to have - in other words, how their lives are to be managed as regards social issues, ecological development and the economy.
However, we must bear in mind that it is easy for us who live in a fairly small, rich part of the world to say that we want to leave behind us, for others to inherit, a situation that is just as good as that which we have.
For an overwhelming majority in the world, the desire must be for their children to have a better life than they had.
The process in Parliament for producing this document, which is still to form some kind of basis or contribution to the Gothenburg Summit, leaves a great deal to be desired.
Parliament has had to rush to keep up with the Commission in order to be able to produce it or be given any opportunity at all to get its viewpoints across concerning the form this development should take.
This is not satisfactory.
It is possible that the Commission itself had plenty of time, but Parliament should still be given a real opportunity to discuss these matters - not just from an environmental perspective.
The whole of Parliament, the committees working on social and economic issues and all the other committees that are actually concerned should be involved.
Otherwise, we restrict the issue and make it just an environmental issue, which it is not.
As far as which areas of policy it would be desirable to look at in such a document, including in the light of the direction that the treatment of the issue is to take in Gothenburg, I believe that we must primarily start from the ecological perspective.
Both the social and the economic perspectives are, of course, important, and we know that they rule our lives.
However, if we do not have a well-functioning planet in ecological respects, it will be very difficult to discuss social and economic issues.
It is quite simply a prerequisite that our ecology is in equilibrium.
The Commission' s text, which we feel despite everything takes the current economic systems as its starting point, is then perhaps not entirely satisfactory.
The point has somehow been missed.
It is about utilising the economy that exists.
It is about trying to set the limits we want to have on the market.
It is about finding the management tools that we can use ourselves in our own budget and our own purchasing.
If we want to create a sustainability strategy for the European Union, we must certainly observe the problems that exist within the Union, but it is completely impossible to isolate the Union from the outside world.
We must see ourselves as part of the planet, in the global context.
What we do in the Union affects the world around us. We must not export that which we do not want to have ourselves.
We must review our trade relations and our agricultural policy, as well as the negative effects that the latter is having on the opportunities for other countries to develop.
We also have a responsibility in international trade relations.
Moreover, without the local perspective, there will not be any sustainability strategy.
The point of the Agenda 21 work was that it provided, and is providing, opportunities for voluntary organisations, players at local level, municipalities and citizens to participate in the process and understand what it is about.
In the final analysis, it is about the responsibility of the individual and about the fact that it is actually necessary to change our behaviour in every area.
The Commission, but naturally also the Council, must think about how we can encourage people to feel involved, and ensure that this is the case, so that it does not just become a message from on high.
Finally, I would like to say something about political leadership.
It is essential that the message that will be given in Gothenburg is clear in order for it to be effective.
It cannot be simply an empty manifesto.
There must also be evidence that the Commission and the Council really want to move from words to actions.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am very happy to have this opportunity to be present during this debate today.
The debate is addressing the strategy for sustainable development and integration of environmental issues in economic policy.
The fact that these issues are high on the agenda is an expression of political will regarding change and renewal.
When sustainable development was written into the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were criticised for it not being sufficient and for implementation not being compulsory.
Distrust was expressed regarding our common policy and the abilities of the European Union.
This criticism can no longer be levelled at us.
Now we must take a stand on concrete proposals, goals and funds, based on the Commission' s well-formulated proposal for a strategy for sustainable development and the reports presented by Mrs HulthÃ©n and Mr Blokland.
An effective policy on sustainable development requires direct and clear social criticism.
Biodiversity is under threat, acidification continues, eutrophication is increasing, chemicals are building up in our bodies, air pollution is becoming deadly, climate change is accelerating - and all this is happening at this very moment.
We must not, however, forget the great opportunities we have: research is expanding, we have an increasing focus on education and lifelong learning, skills are growing and being passed on, new technology is being developed, efficient solutions are becoming more common, the problems within agriculture and fishing are breeding new ideas and new solutions and political will is strengthening.
We must now adopt a holistic approach in which various political areas cooperate.
The economic, social and ecological perspectives must be interwoven and given equal weight in all political areas.
We must propose concrete measures, changes in principles and clear goals.
Now is the time to formulate a vision for the future.
The goal for Europe is to be the world' s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy.
That goal must be coupled with the ecological aspect in Gothenburg if we are to be the region taking the greatest responsibility for nature and the environment.
It is also important for the policies to be based on the everyday lives of citizens.
Research, education, democracy and participation are all preconditions for taking joint responsibility.
In the continued work on a strategy of sustainability, dialogue with civil society and between the institutions of the European Union must be strengthened.
The aim for the Presidency ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg is to adopt a strategy which will link the Lisbon Process with the strategy for sustainable development, establishing the ecological dimension by setting a number of clear, monitorable targets in order to reverse the negative trends we see today.
It will require all future decisions in the EU being tested from the perspective of sustainability.
It will clearly show Europe' s aim of reducing our impact on the climate and actively taking part in global cooperation.
It will mean discarding unsustainable subsidies.
It will lead to the adverse impacts of chemicals on health and the environment being minimised and it will ensure that sustainable development continues to be discussed at the highest political level.
I would like to emphasise the importance of having the political courage to establish concrete, timetabled targets for achieving sustainable development.
As such I am happy to see that the report from Mrs HulthÃ©n, which the European Parliament is examining today, expresses the same view.
I would particularly like to mention the requirements in this report for a climate change programme and targets for renewable energy, the requirement for changes to transport policy, the requirement for a new chemicals policy based on the precautionary principle, the requirement for a sustainability analysis of all decisions, and the requirement for a strengthening of the sustainability perspective in the European Union' s global work.
As the report says, it is important that Parliament continues to push the issue forward and to critically review new legislation within the EU.
When it comes to global responsibility, I would particularly emphasise what Mrs HulthÃ©n brought up in her report.
Sustainable development cannot be achieved unless the global perspective is addressed.
This is therefore the vital task for us.
The European Union must take a leading role in the work towards global sustainability.
We must be clear in our work to ensure that next year' s World Summit for Sustainable Development in South Africa achieves the necessary results.
As part of the preparations for the European Council in Gothenburg and for the summit in Johannesburg, last weekend I received 250 young people aged 20-25 from 110 different countries around the world.
The meeting recognised no borders between countries or between people.
So what do these young people have?
They have involvement, they have enthusiasm.
What do they lack?
They lack patience, they lack fear of tackling difficult and complex problems.
What do we owe them?
I believe what we owe them is to lay the foundation for their faith in the future by being clear, by establishing concrete, political measures, by showing that we have the political courage and the political will to reverse the dangerous trends in the world.
What do they demand of the EU, particularly following the US action on climate policy?
They demand that the EU takes a clear lead in the global work towards sustainable development, against poverty and against the environmental destruction now taking place.
To summarise: sustainability on one continent is unsustainable sustainability.
As Mrs HulthÃ©n said, we can never assume that one part of the earth can live sustainably while the rest of the earth suffers poverty and environmental destruction.
In his report, Mr Blokland highlights the correlation between depletion of our natural resources and the impact on the environment on the one hand and economic policy on the other.
The conclusion is that the absence of price tags on scarce resources and environmental impact leads to insufficient integration of environmental considerations and economics.
To me it seems clear that a vital element of future sustainability policy is to better internalise environmental costs into the costs of goods and services in the economy.
The proposals presented in the report are important instruments for further development of the strategy for sustainable development and sectoral integration.
The Presidency' s view is that it is important for environmental integration to be included in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines.
In this respect, market-based financial controls must also be used to a greater extent to put a price on scarce resources and to assess whether subsidies and tax exemptions have an adverse impact on the environment.
Development of a strategy for environmental integration must include targets, timetables and follow-up mechanisms in the BEPG.
I would like to end by referring to the conclusion in Mr Blokland' s report.
Measures are needed now to avoid the need for more expensive measures later.
I can also add to this a report from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, which shows that it generally takes considerable time for nature and the environment to recover from the environmental destruction we have caused and continue to cause.
I believe this conclusion complements that of Mr Blokland.
In other words we cannot afford to wait.
We must act now, and the reports before us today are an important step forward ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg and the summit in Johannesburg next year.
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on behalf of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, even though that was a very last-minute edition which I think exemplifies a lot of what is wrong at the moment with the way we think about sustainability within this institution.
We are not integrating our social, economic and environmental policies.
They should be pulling in the same direction, and they certainly do not at present.
It is also exemplified by the fact that the one Commissioner we have with us this evening is the Environment Commissioner.
I welcome her here, but when we are discussing sustainability I would very much like to see in future the Commissioners from my own committee, and also at least from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
If we are to have long-term sustainability and develop a truly green economy, we have to take care to foster environmental-friendly businesses and use resources efficiently, and that includes the way in which we use our workforces.
Hence my committee' s call for rapid progress in enabling people to work efficiently through effective consultation and participation, because democracy is also part of sustainability, as are reduced working hours and good quality work in safe working conditions supported by an effective system of social security.
If we are demanding that businesses provide social and environmental audits, as we quite rightly do, we need the accountants and other professionals than can do that.
If we want builders who can construct energy-efficient buildings, we need to train them.
Hence my committee' s call for all European Union funded training initiatives to take the environmental dimension fully into account, if we are really preparing people for the future.
Social inclusion, as has already been said, is a key component of a sustainable society, hence the need for a guaranteed minimum income to provide for basic needs.
We must combat discrimination and poverty.
At present the dispossessed feel they have no stake in the future and that, under anybody' s reasoning, is a wicked waste.
Sustainable development is about creating a world in which there are no losers.
We cannot achieve this goal if we continue with policies that pull in different directions and even undermine each other.
Our common future depends on finding an effective way to ensure integration and sustainability.
Mr President, the compatibility of ecology and economics has been much talked about for many years.
The problem is that while there is in theory no internal contradiction between economic growth and preserving the environment, up until now economic growth has in practice normally been detrimental to the quality of the environment.
However, on the other hand, economic decline combined with rising unemployment and poverty have also always resulted in a loss of environmental quality.
So it is a very complex subject and one particularly difficult to grasp because we still have no universal indicators for putting a monetary value on environmental assets.
We need yardsticks that are valid for all the EU and we can conceive of them only for the EU.
The Commission must put its communication on a statistically secure footing if we are not to continue building castles in the air.
Even assuming that we have such a secure footing, the question remains as to what conclusions should be drawn.
Many things have been considered.
Subsidies, tradable emission rights or the so-called eco-taxes, that is environment-related taxes or levies.
Models for these exist.
It is important, however, that such models should be introduced in all EU Member States in the same way and at the same time, so as to offer fair opportunities to all involved.
Only fair competition will ensure that environmental measures, of whatever kind, find acceptance.
Subsidies must be examined for their effectiveness and changed or replaced by other measures if necessary.
Trade in environmental assets must be fair.
Environmental taxes and levies are worthwhile and effective only if related to emissions and imposed in such a way as to be neutral in their effect on the amount of tax paid by the citizen.
In no case must such taxes and levies be misappropriated and spent on other areas than the environment.
That is the only way we shall actually meet the justified demands of our citizens and of people outside the EU for a healthy environment.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sustainable development is our key challenge for the next 20 years.
Sustainable development is a beautiful concept which articulates the belief that economic growth can go hand-in-hand with improving the environment.
Until now, this has rarely been the case, as economic growth has been at the expense of the environment.
We now need to improve our production methods so that they take the environment more - or even more - into account. We also need to change our thoughts and actions, and to consider environmental costs, so that environmental protection starts to pay off.
The Gothenburg European Council needs to take an emphatic first step in this connection.
I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report.
His realistic approach has in any event generated a few specific building blocks to develop further.
I should also like to thank Mrs HulthÃ©n for the conviction and tenacity with which she has presented her vision on sustainable development.
The concept of sustainable development must be translated into concrete proposals and decisions.
I should like to home in on three points in this connection: production standards, bio-diversity and compliance.
Sustainable development must be given a practical dimension.
We want to focus on the development of concrete product standards, standards which curb the use of energy, standards which restrict, or ban as much as possible, the use of dangerous substances, and rules to enable the environmental cost to be reflected in the price of the product.
Such standards are important in the food sector, as well as the building materials, clothing, paint and natural packaging sectors.
In my opinion, we stand to gain a great deal on an environmental plane.
The standards must also aim to prevent waste: less throw-away packaging, less wear-and-tear, more sustainability and more sustained quality.
If products do reach the end of their useful lives, re-use and recycling should be the obvious choice.
The major challenge is then to create markets for all the product waste and all waste substances.
Moreover, such markets also yield new employment.
Passing on environmental costs to the consumer is important, but not everything can be expressed in money.
The protection of nature and bio-diversity is also a value in its own right without having an immediate economic value.
The protection of bio-diversity is a theme which must recur in many policy areas.
Needless to say, we must also adhere to the Bird and Habitat Directive.
Which brings us to the third point: compliance.
There is a great deal of sound European legislation.
It is therefore necessary to comply with these laws.
However, that is often a problem.
Not all Member States enjoy the same good reputation in this connection.
Mrs HulthÃ©n and Mr Bowe asked in Strasbourg how the Commission intends to deal with this problem.
The replies which the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, gave, were disappointing to say the least.
I should therefore like to ask the Commission once again in what way it intends to address the Member States on the issue of inadequate compliance with European rules.
I should also like to underline that Parliament could be far more involved in compliance.
I should like to be issued with half-yearly reports on the state of affairs in terms of compliance with legislation.
Mr President, honourable Minister, Commissioner, sustainable development involves many factors.
It is terribly easy to write about wonderful dreams and to use fine words.
I would like to see those attending the European Council in Gothenburg dare to point the way forward.
I would also like the courageous step to be taken of examining the EU' s own accounts, its own system of subsidies.
Mr Blokland addresses this in item 5 and Mrs HulthÃ©n in item 33 of her report, that is, that we need to revise the agricultural subsidies.
I am happy to see that the Commission' s declaration is a little more stringent in stating that, when the common agricultural policy is reviewed in 2002, greater emphasis should be placed on quality than on quantity.
Agriculture is still Europe' s main industry, with agriculture and forestry being responsible for our cultural heritage, our recreation and biodiversity.
The issues are chemicals and nutrients in the water, air quality and public health.
So the question must be: How sustainable is the EU' s own subsidy system for agriculture?
Is it not time to use some of this money for sustainable development, rural development, protecting biodiversity, removing chemicals and growing food which we can eat happily and safely?
If only the EU would dare to take such an initiative, indicate the direction to be followed and declare 'we will go that way' !
Mr President, Commissioner, the paradox with the European Union is that its environmental legislation has played a pioneering role for many countries in the Union, including my own, and will certainly play a pioneering role for the candidate countries, and yet many of the European Union's sectoral policies do in fact contradict criteria for sustainable development.
I refer mainly to the agricultural policy and, general speaking, to the emphasis placed on economic growth with too little thought for sustainable development. This is stressed in a recent OECD report which I should like to bring to the attention of the Commission and the Council and which is far more critical than usual of the Commission's texts.
I think that what we urgently need, and this is the gist of our support for the two European Parliament reports and the Myller report attached to them, is to change direction.
Politically, we have three demands of Gothenburg.
First, the European Council needs to endorse the Commission text without watering down the guidelines proposed by the Commission.
Secondly, the Environment Council to be held a week after Gothenburg needs to take account of the demands of the European Parliament for the Sixth Framework Programme.
Thirdly, the Belgian Presidency must be instructed in Gothenburg to take specific action on the guidelines decided in Gothenburg.
As far as economic aspects per se are concerned, the ECOFIN Council needs to revise the agenda.
Subsidies for environmentally damaging production methods should be abolished and replaced by incentives for more environmentally-friendly production methods. We need environmental and social criteria for public procurement.
On the question of indicators, the fact that the restricted list of indicators does not contain a single environmental criterion is intolerable.
We also need to think about national accounts which integrate environmental data.
These are a few of the things we want to think about.
We need the means to do so, however.
We shall be watching to see, under the Belgian Presidency, if the European Council in Barcelona really will be the first European Council to integrate an environmental, social and economic strategy.
Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the Commission' s proposal on sustainable development.
It is clear that it could have gone a lot further in many areas, but even so I must say that it was tougher than expected and that it contains several proposals which, if carried out, will really make a difference compared with today' s policy on the environment.
Above all, I would like to highlight the requirements to limit road transport, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, remove harmful subsidies, change procurement regulations in favour of the environment and adapt the common agricultural policy.
If this is carried out, it will prove an important step in achieving change.
The question now is whether these concrete proposals will survive the European Council in Gothenburg.
I hope that they will, and that these proposals are not removed from the final document, but remain. Perhaps the general comments could be shortened instead.
I believe it can make a real contribution to changing this policy.
I wish the Swedish Presidency luck with this.
However, the proposal is inadequate in one area, that of international cooperation and links with the World Trade Organisation and environmental regulations.
Mr President, we need to apply a real environmental policy in Europe in order to respect the environment - our environment - in recognition of the fact that we have a duty to pass the natural universal heritage on to future generations intact.
In doing so, we must ensure that environmental policy in Europe is based not on ideology but on the concept of responsibility.
Let us apply the principle of subsidiarity to the management of pollution problems.
For example, local authorities should have carte blanche to deal with air pollution in our cities.
Polluted rivers are a matter for the countries along their banks.
They should be free to decide what to do - as long as they are efficient.
Changes to the climate of the planet, on the other hand, are a global issue.
Europe should take a common stand at international environmental fora and should set the Member States objectives in framework directives, leaving them to decide how to achieve them.
To conclude, we should not regulate everything from Brussels or Strasbourg.
Decisions taken closer to the ground will be more suitable and, by definition, better understood.
Surely the ambition of the European Union is to be better understood by the people.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs HulthÃ©n for presenting her report on sustainable development, which she produced under great pressure of time and difficult circumstances.
The PPE-DE will support the report. It contains important emphases for environmental policy.
We are not, however, really in agreement with the wording on every point.
In the matter of what it says about economic and social policy, in particular, it would have been good if we had had more time also to discuss them with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
If, for example, in item 32 we are calling for a minimum income and talking about access to essential services, that should not have its place in a report on environmental policy that has actually been prepared only by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but only after intensive discussion with the Social and Economic Committees.
I also regret - and it was no doubt also due to pressure of time - that we have taken up only one point on the development policy aspects of sustainable development, because anyone who has looked into sustainable development and the Rio process knows that development policy is a key part of the entire issue.
I think more could have been said about that.
That is not, however, a recrimination, because it was simply difficult for Parliament to cover everything properly under such pressure of time.
One point in the report and in what Commission President Prodi said about sustainable development has caused quite a stir in Germany.
It is found here in items 21 and 22 of this report.
It concerns the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies, especially on coal.
I personally believe that it must indeed be our aim in the long term to completely abolish environmentally harmful subsidies.
However, I think we must be very cautious about specifying a date in the very near future.
If the PSE Group is calling for an end to them before 2005 in its forthcoming report on the Sixth Environment Action Programme, that will lead to mass redundancies and then we will certainly not achieve the objective sustainably.
I therefore believe we should clearly state the objective, there is no dissent about that, but we should also give thought to alternative employment...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent reports.
It is vital that this issue of sustainable development is placed high on the political agenda.
It is a question partly of solidarity, that is, solidarity with coming generations and EU solidarity with poor regions and poor people, and partly of a global responsibility, of how the EU interacts with the rest of the world with regard to trade and development policy.
Sustainable development concerns all policy areas.
It is well known that it concerns transport policy, agricultural policy and energy policy, but it also concerns social policy.
In this regard I do not share the views of the previous speaker.
Social policy is also naturally part of sustainable development.
Good social policy and fair economic policy are vital.
Sustainable development is also about a whole range of methods.
It is not the case that the current methods of legislation are poor.
The legislation must continue.
The legislation we have in the EU must be implemented better.
We must use tax instruments, which have often been emphasised by Parliament.
The new approach is that we must integrate the ecological aspects of the Lisbon Process.
The next time the Council gathers in the spring in Barcelona it is not only economic issues, social issues, issues of lifelong learning, issues of investment policy and industrial policy which must be addressed.
The Council must also be a 'Sustainability Council' by ensuring that the ecological aspects are integrated into policy.
The new strategy which is being developed, and which we in Parliament warmly support, is crucial.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs HulthÃ©n and Mr Blokland, on two important reports, not only for us here now but for generations to come.
Naturally, my group supports these two reports wholeheartedly.
Both show the necessity of integrating environmental policy, social policy and economic policy, if we are really to achieve sustainable development.
However, this must happen now and not simply be a goal for the future.
The Cardiff Process is good, but it is proceeding far too slowly.
It is also very clear that a break in current trends is vital, to put it mildly.
As Swedish Minister for the Environment Kjell Larsson says, what is needed now is political courage within all the institutions and in all areas.
The Commission' s document on integrating environmental policy into economic policy states that there is no contradiction between economic growth and environmental protection.
If this is the case, how can we explain the fact that increased production and increased consumption have eaten up all the environmental initiatives which we have so far carried out and are carrying out?
Such a view does not fit in with the times.
Therefore, economic development must be adapted to ecological requirements, otherwise there will be no sustainable development.
We must all realise this.
The proposal from the Verts/ALE adopted by the committee states that the adverse environmental impact resulting from some EU subsidies must be examined, particularly with regard to the current energy policy and common agricultural policy.
They must simply be phased out.
We cannot afford to keep them in place.
Mrs HulthÃ©n also mentions, as other people have also said, that the strategy must not only be for the EU but must also constitute a global starting point.
Ten years after Rio, this really must be addressed...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, how can we preserve our resources and improve environmental health and social well-being in a balanced manner, without affecting any of the three pillars of sustainable development?
The Gothenburg Summit will try to provide an answer to these questions and will demonstrate the maturity and political capacity of our governments to deal with the challenge of a new order of peace and prosperity for the twenty-first century.
The first step consists of severing the link between economic growth and the intense use of resources and unwanted effects such as pollution.
In this context, I believe that we should welcome the reports by Mrs HulthÃ©n and Mr Blokland.
To turn the European economy into the most competitive and dynamic economy, based on knowledge and not on the intensive use of resources, will require a better and greater use of market instruments in order to achieve greater levels of efficiency for our procedures and products, but will also require other factors to be taken into account simultaneously.
If we want to eliminate forever the spectre of the loss of competitiveness or the threat of industrial conflict in Europe, we need more than ever, and urgently, to move ahead in a way which is uniform and coherent between all the Member States.
It is even more important that we do so from a global point of view, by means of international agreements which resolve the legal and practical difficulties which face many of our legislative actions.
We also need to establish realistic timetables which allow companies and society in general to adapt to the new market conditions and introduce the necessary reforms, thereby reducing the possibilities of unwanted effects if they are dealt with within too narrow a margin for manoeuvre.
Lastly, I think it is essential, in order to successfully bring the process of change to a conclusion, to enjoy a broad social consensus which includes commitments with social operators and the gradual but firm replacement - of course - of the social values of the old order - based on the possession and accumulation of goods - with other values of a society which is ethically and civically more advanced, based on the enjoyment of the less materialistic aspects of life.
Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, it is not and can never be a choice between employment or the environment.
Wealth, growth, enterprise and development need not, and do not, consume the environments of mature societies.
On the contrary, it may be observed that there is a clear relationship between the quality of the environment and the wealth of a nation.
Throughout the EU and North America recent years have seen dramatic reversals in the pollution of air and water due to technological improvements driven by legislation and societal expectations.
In the same period there have been profound increases in the extent and quantity of habitats and natural resources that are formally recognised and protected.
The infrastructure, organisation and technology that are needed for a cleaner environment are all achievable because of the wealth and surpluses of the local economies.
Significant environmental pollution of air and water and the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources have become characteristic of the early stages of developing industrial economies, as they were once with us.
Environmental protection requires surpluses, education and vision together with institutional maturity and stability.
A strong lobby in favour of environmental protection is a good and necessary part of any mature democratic society.
We must be committed to ensuring the widest range of opinions and values, and that they are nurtured, expressed and considered because debate can only increase knowledge and improve the quality of decisions.
Likewise, environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective.
Environmental scaremongering hampers open debate by inflating a stateable risk, for example the presence of a toxin, so that it becomes an inaccurately perceived threat, for example by failing to acknowledge that the quantity of the toxin falls significantly below any threatening dose.
I believe that great sensitivity, tolerance and compassion must be employed whenever it is proposed to employ the environmental standards of a developed economy to the economies and environments of emerging economies.
The EU' s history has shown that localised overloading of environmental carrying capacity can be a temporary phase of an emerging economy.
We need to acknowledge ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, thank you for the various constructive contributions which we have heard.
I would, of course, also like to join in congratulating Mrs HulthÃ©n and Mr Blokland on their reports.
It is right to discuss these two reports at the same time, as they definitely belong together.
It is remarkable to think that the concept of 'sustainable development' has been around for 15 years now and has been kept alive despite so many people criticising it over the years for being woolly, difficult to achieve in practice, difficult to establish practical results for, etc. However, it still no doubt offers us an opportunity to link together economic policy, environmental policy and social policy and not just to see the problems, but also the opportunities inherent in this concept.
Therefore, it is important to develop indicators, as pointed out in the debate, and to follow this up in a sensible way.
I believe we are just starting to develop effective indicators which, in the long term, may lead to new economic concepts in general, a sort of new definition, including a new economic definition.
At the same time, we must of course continue to work on developing effective indicators and effective monitoring of developments.
It has felt as if we have been pressed for time, but I would like to say that we have received more than 100 written comments, all in plenty of time.
Almost all environmental organisations, social organisations and even major business organisations have formulated their proposals and sent them to the Commission.
We also looked extremely carefully at the proposal contained in the report by Mrs HulthÃ©n.
In our proposal, we at the Commission have said that we naturally wish to ensure that this is a proposal owned jointly by many different stakeholders in society and that we will follow it up in such a way that we also consult various groups in society.
In this context, Parliament will naturally also have an active role.
It could be said that the Commission' s proposal for a strategy for sustainable development has remained the same during negotiations for this proposal.
The priorities we established from the start have remained throughout, and the proposals along the way have reflected this.
I would also like to comment on what has been said about the international perspective, for this is incredibly important.
The Commission has said that we must continue to become still more practical and to follow up our views on how to act internationally.
As such, it is important for us to set our own house in order, show how we will be addressing these issues and show leadership before we start telling the rest of the world what they should be doing.
Of course, the global perspective must be present in everything we do.
At the same time, our strategy for sustainable development also emphasises, as Mrs Paulsen pointed out, that we must ensure that we rid ourselves of inconsistent policies and subsidies which are actually not good for the environment and which are not favourable to sustainable development.
I think this is clear in the programme.
The next step is to address this at the European Council in Gothenburg.
It is important to ensure that it is not watered down during this Summit, but that we can actually stick to a plan as ambitious as the Commission' s strategy and get all Member States to work to achieve it.
I believe it is a good aim for the Belgian Presidency to follow up matters in the way described by Mr Jonckheer during the debate.
As has also been mentioned in the debate, I think too that it makes sense to review the way the European Parliament and our own institutions must be changed so that we can live up to the ideal of sustainable development and create these links between economic and social issues and environmental issues.
To this end, we in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council will probably have to review our way of working so that it can become effective and so that we have a way of tackling cross-border issues rather than just looking narrowly at limited areas.
It will be exciting when we now review policy in areas such as agriculture and fishing, transport and equal opportunities.
This will be the moment of truth for us and for the EU as a whole.
These were the most important comments, with the exception of the issue brought up by Mrs Corbey of the way implementation will be carried out.
I would say that I have been clear from the beginning that we have good legislation, solid legislation, which was also the conclusion of the report on the Fifth Environment Action Programme.
At the same time, we must also ensure that we implement this legislation.
Therefore, it is important that we monitor implementation in this area too.
It is no doubt possible to find further measures to strengthen the monitoring procedure, but the means already in place to ensure that Member States meet their obligations in line with the legislation must be strengthened.
In addition, we must make it clearer for citizens of the EU how well Member States are doing.
I believe this can help to put pressure on countries.
Finally, I would like to comment on how we define sustainable development, as this was brought up in Mr Blokland' s report.
The Commission' s strategy for sustainable development starts with a quotation from the Brundtland Commission report which contains a definition of sustainable development.
The section containing this definition also addresses ways of combating poverty.
This is naturally vital.
I emphasise once again the significance of a global perspective, but if you have read the Brundtland Commission report carefully, you will see that our definition is correct.
I believe it is important for us to keep to this definition as it is excellent and spells out our responsibility towards future generations, which is what it is all about.
Thank you for this debate.
Let us ensure that we can put these issues into practice.
Council. (SV) Mr President, I would like to comment on what has been said in this debate.
Several speakers have mentioned economic growth and its impact on the environment.
There is a rather outdated view that economic growth always has an adverse impact on the environment.
However, it has also been pointed out that poor economic development creates a major risk of damaging the environment.
The term 'decoupling' , that is, the importance of being able to separate the trends for economic development and those for environmental impact, is becoming increasingly central to environmental policy discussions.
This is actually nothing new.
We have been working on this for many decades without perhaps using this particular term.
I would put growth in the EU at around 30 percent over the past 10 years.
At the same time emissions of greenhouse gases have fallen by 4 percent.
This means that for every one million euros of production, emissions of greenhouse gases are approximately 55 percent lower.
This shows that decoupling is already taking place.
At the same time we must become even more successful and ensure that we achieve more than a marginal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Emissions of NOx in Sweden per EUR 1 million of production is now down by approximately 60 percent.
The equivalent figure for emissions of SOx is around 80 percent.
These are two further examples of decoupling.
Now we must redouble our efforts, including in areas where we currently see no reduction in environmental impact and where economic growth has been a contributory factor to this.
The issue of subsidies and international costs has also been brought up by several speakers.
As I said in my introduction, I regard this as a key issue with regard to environmental policy, now and in the future.
At a global level, it is actually quite amazing that we currently have subsidies which, according to some, amount to 200 billion dollars a year for non-sustainable energy, that is, fossil fuel.
This is an incredibly large amount, which shows that instead of internalising the environmental costs, we are actually externalising them and redirecting them.
Removing this type of subsidy and focusing on proper internalisation of environmental costs in prices must be a key element of EU and global development.
Biodiversity has also been mentioned here, and this is something close to my heart.
I would like to point out that we have major problems with biodiversity here in Europe, something which far too few people are aware of.
Something in the order of 55 percent of all species of bird are endangered, as are no less than 45 percent of butterfly species, to mention just two examples.
Our targets cannot simply be met by introducing Natura 2000 areas, although this is an important part of our nature conservation policy.
We also need environmental issues to be integrated into the common agricultural policy.
Many of the endangered species are dependent on a small-scale agricultural landscape which is currently disappearing.
It is vital that we prevent this from being repeated in the new countries which we hope will become members of the EU.
However, it is not just a matter of integrating this approach into the common agricultural policy. The same must be done with the common fisheries policy.
The condition of marine biodiversity is in fact much worse than that of biodiversity on land.
The marine ecosystem around our coasts is in crisis.
If EU citizens could see what we are actually doing to our seabed and sea water and the effects this has on biodiversity, there would probably be an environmental revolution in the EU.
It is therefore also important to integrate the environment into the common fisheries policy and to see marine ecosystems as vital elements of the biodiversity we must work to preserve.
Mr Jonckheer also pointed out that the sectoral approach directly opposes environmental policy in the EU.
It is exactly this which we will be putting right through sectoral integration.
I also agree with Mrs SchÃ¶rling that this is proceeding too slowly.
I therefore hope that, based on the Presidency' s synthesis report, the European Council in Gothenburg will be able to draw up clear guidelines for continued work on sectoral integration.
I believe, Mr President, that these comments will suffice.
Thank you, Mr Larsson.
The debate is closed.
The vote on both reports will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Community Environment Action Programme (2001-2010)
The next item is the report (A5-0175/2001) by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision laying down the Community Environment Action Programme 2001-2010 (COM(2001) 31 - C5-0032/2001 - 2001/0029(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, representatives of the presidency, to begin with I would like to thank my colleagues on the Environment Committee.
It is thanks to your flexibility that we are now approving Parliament' s opinion on the sixth Community environment action programme.
Criticism has quite justifiably been directed at the fact that the reading of the programme in Parliament has been given far too short a deadline considering the importance and extent of the issue.
As you know, this is due to the programme being delayed in the Commission.
However, as we wanted to make our own contribution to the Gothenburg Summit, the first summit to be devoted to environmental issues, it has not been possible to avoid this rush, nor the Committee having to vote so late in the day.
I would like to thank the chair of the Committee, the Committee and group secretariats and the assistants to the Members for organising the voting.
I would also like to thank the Swedish Presidency and the Commission for excellent teamwork.
During the preparatory work we achieved successful cooperation with the Commission, although opinions on the nature of the programme have not always been unanimous.
During the period spent preparing the environment action programme we have been able to reach reasonable unanimity on the areas of emphasis suggested by the Commission being the right ones.
As far as the environment is concerned, the greatest worries are climate change, the loss of biodiversity, threats to health caused by environmental problems, the sustainablity of natural resources and sustainable waste management.
Differences of opinion have been caused by the way problems requiring a decision have been addressed in the programme.
The Commission wanted a more descriptive programme and as the rapporteur for the Environment Committee I have chosen a policy whereby we have sought, wherever possible, concrete targets in terms of quantity and quality as well as clear timetables for the priority areas chosen.
Although the environment action programme is drawn up for a ten-year period, I have also proposed targets for a period exceeding this.
For example, preventing climate change will require a time perspective of decades.
Sufficiently ambitious intermediate targets must be laid down to ensure that the long-term targets are met.
When instructing the Commission on drawing up the programme in March a year ago, the Environment Committee also demanded that concrete targets and timetables be set.
How far the environment ministers get in reaching a united opinion in one week' s time, remains to be seen.
I wish them every success.
It would send a really strong message to the citizens of Europe regarding the EU' s environmental commitment were Parliament and the Council to take to the Gothenburg Summit a common opinion on what we wish to achieve.
In my view it is vital that the EU' s environment programme contain clear targets and timetables for achieving them because this is the only way of ensuring that the programme and its realisation can be evaluated sufficiently unambiguously.
The evaluation halfway through the programme must be based on verifiable progress on the basis of which we must be able to make the necessary corrections in order to achieve the targets.
Achieving environmental targets requires cooperation.
Environmental issues must be included in all Community policies and decisions.
We will not prevent climate change or enable healthy air for our citizens to breathe unless we reduce emissions from energy production, transport and industry.
Decisions on what is to be done in various policy areas and how we can enable environmental issues to be linked to principles, will, however, be made within these different sectors.
Therefore, these also require greater environmental expertise.
Environmental assessments must also be included in economic decisions.
The Commission and the Council must change the way they work so that environmental issues can be integrated with all Community decision-making.
The Commission has proposed an interesting idea of creating new thematic strategies, thematic programmes for the problems causing the greatest concern.
I see this as particularly welcome.
Parliament and the Council must, however, be included in decision-making via the normal co-decision procedure.
Enlargement is both a challenge and an opportunity for the European environment.
The programme should present ways in which enlargement will become a major opportunity to improve our environment.
We must also boldly take the lead in international environment policy, as well as trade policy and development cooperation policy.
We must also ensure the major participation of citizens.
This requires the provision of clear and visible information on environmental issues.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I congratulate Mrs Riitta Myller on her work and also for the attention she gave to some of the proposals that we have adopted, although, of course, she could have gone a little further.
I would highlight as particularly important the fact that she has welcomed the proposals that we advocated on the need to reform the common agricultural policy, on the premise that we must foster and support the development and implementation of strategies for incorporating environmental issues into the relevant sectoral policies and that we also need to protect agricultural production, taking account of food safety, the precautionary principle and the sovereignty of food, promoting the specific characteristics of the regions and more natural production methods.
Furthermore, as you all know, the importance of renewable raw materials will increase with the efforts made to achieve a more sustainable economic system, in which forests and cultivated land are of particular importance.
In order, however, to enable sustainable development and economic and social cohesion to take place, the procedures for internal support must give special consideration to the situation of farmers and family-based farming and to the legitimacy of specific aid for public interest goods and services in the framework of a multifunctional system of agriculture.
The procedures must, of course, also take account of the differing degrees of agricultural development in the various Member States of the European Union and in the applicant countries.
Mr President, we agree with the rapporteur and the Commission on the priority objectives of this programme and we agree that it is very important and that it will mark out the European Union' s environmental policy over the next ten years.
These priority objectives are in the spotlight every day and the press refers to them on a daily basis: climate change, the promotion and preservation of biodiversity, the sustainable management of resources and the protection of health and the natural environment.
Those are the priority objectives and it is therefore essential to take measures more energetically than has been the case up till now.
Firstly, it is necessary to apply the legislation.
As the rapporteur said, it is necessary to integrate environmental policies and other policies: agriculture, transport, energy.
This has still not been done properly.
We need more sustainable models of production and consumption.
I believe that we need to change the model of production and consumption; otherwise, we will not be able to achieve the objectives marked out by both the Commission and the rapporteur.
The interest in this programme is clear.
It is demonstrated by the fact that we have spent hours voting on more than 350 amendments and that today, despite many amendments presented by the different draftspeople having been taken up, almost 300 amendments are still to be submitted to the House for its approval.
I believe that, in the view of the Committee on Petitions - and I am referring to the specific experience of this committee - there are two fundamental issues, which the rapporteur has taken up.
The first is the application of Community law.
The Member States do not apply it and this is demonstrated by the fact that the European Commission has had to take several Member States to the courts for various reasons (nitrate pollution, for example).
Spain is currently being prosecuted over the existence of more than seven illegal dumping sites.
The first fundamental issue is therefore compliance with environmental legislation.
The second is the promotion of citizen participation.
We have noted in the Committee on Petitions that of the 1100 or 1200 petitions registered each year in this committee, 40% relate to the natural environment.
This demonstrates that not only ecologist groups but also platforms of everyday citizens have an enormous interest in preserving the environment in which they live and that it is they who are complaining.
They take care to study Community law and they make complaints to us and then have the patience to await the result of procedures which sometimes take too long.
That is another problem: when a complaint or a petition is presented, there are so many delays in the responses of the governments and the procedures are so long that, sometimes, the damage is done irreversibly and, on other occasions, the citizens who complain about these irregularities lose patience.
In the view of the Committee on Petitions, these are the fundamental issues: the participation of the citizens, speeding up the procedures and, above all, compliance with Community law.
A few months ago we held a debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the fact that, although the environmental legislation in the European Union is extraordinary, it is not complied with.
We must find a method for complying with it.
We are proposing certain amendments aimed at penalising those countries which do not use the Structural Funds or the Cohesion Fund in projects for preserving the environment.
This is unfortunately the only thing the governments understand.
We also have to find other mechanisms to speed up the procedures so that the citizens do not lose patience.
Mr President, I believe that this is an extraordinary programme.
I hope that tomorrow most of the amendments presented by the rapporteur and some of the groups will be approved and I believe that what we have to achieve is for the programme to be implemented properly over the next ten years.
Mr President, we regret the little time available to us because this project has not been able to lead to a democratic and open debate, as we would have liked, and this would have contributed to making the population and civil society more aware of what we are dealing with in Parliament.
We as a group have always supported the Commission because we have believed that this was a great project.
It has been criticised for being too light, but I believe that not everybody has understood that the Commission' s proposal consisted of transferring specific policies into thematic strategies; and this is because the thematic strategies are a new way of working, a more scientific way, where the details are going to be studied in greater depth: the technical levels and the technical solutions, the viability of projects, the situations of the countries and the type of legislation which would be suitable.
We have therefore largely supported the project in the form in which it was drawn up by the Commission.
We believed that our margin for presenting amendments had to be limited and narrow, in order not to completely change the system of the project.
We wanted this balanced academic nature of the Commission' s project to be respected.
Furthermore, we firmly believe that one of the best policies in the history of Europe is the environmental policy: it has fantastic teams of officials and, at the same time, teams of experts to advise them, and it seemed to us that it was not a question of creating another parallel project.
Now that the situation has taken a new turn towards numerous amendments, we have introduced some priorities to supplement the project, not to correct it, because there are already many approved directives and it seemed to us that it was not a question of looking backwards.
We have therefore introduced initiatives, for example, on the urban environment, on the countryside, on a sustainable culture, on the issue of animal feed and the control of the food chain, an issue which we would have put much more stress on if the document had been produced before now.
Therefore, we have wanted to strengthen and extend it, thereby showing that our group has a great interest in this policy.
However, I must say that certain amendments have been introduced which, if approved, will oblige us to reject the general project. Because we cannot allow a project of this type to talk about, for example, the indiscriminate civil liability of all persons who have companies or initiatives.
For example, Amendment No 68, if applied directly, would oblige any mountain farmer with cattle which causes problems for the environment, to take out civil liability insurance.
This is absurd.
Some of the amendments are excessively tough and are going to have repercussions for the citizens.
The same must be said of an indiscriminate rate on hydrocarbons and on energy which may penalise the weaker sections of the population who take two hours to get to work because they live in the outskirts of the cities.
To sum up, we have believed in the project and we are supporting it.
We support the Commission.
We support the idea as a whole and most of the ideas within it.
We do not, however, believe this is a Christmas tree, as one Member says, which any old thing can be hung on.
Neither is it a project for Gothenburg. It is a project for Johannesburg, which we want to present proudly in 2002, supporting the Commission and European policy.
Mr President, it is very significant that Parliament is devoting a large part of its agenda today to a debate on the future of the Union with three reports - the HulthÃ©n, Blokland and Myller reports - dealing with three complementary aspects of the same strategy.
The HulthÃ©n report is a contribution to a more definite strategy for sustainable development, the Blokland report explores the relationships between economic policy and environmental issues in greater depth and, finally, the Myller report seeks to provide a series of consistent objectives and effective instruments for pursuing those objectives in terms of environmental policy.
Tomorrow' s vote on the sixth programme only represents a stage in this important project we have undertaken, but it is no less important for that.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has sought to strengthen the text and make it more binding as a crystal clear demonstration of our determination to take concrete steps to safeguard and improve the environment around us, especially in view of the limited achievements of the fifth action programme.
In that context, I would like to thank our rapporteur and briefly comment on two points which seem to me particularly important.
The first relates to the need to consolidate the involvement of local authorities in the action programme.
While it is indeed important to set objectives at continent level, we must not forget that only committed, continuous action on the ground can actually secure a profound change in habits and customs, instilling a new culture of eco-compatible planning into every level of our local institutions.
In that connection, I venture to draw your attention to Amendments Nos 52 and 53, already endorsed by the Committee on the Environment.
We must succeed in ensuring that all the instruments provided by the programme - legislative, fiscal, financial, scientific, cultural and informative - can actually be used.
For this - and here I come to my second point - it is fundamentally important to strengthen training in environmental policy for all the players operating on the ground.
I am not just talking about administrators, but also about economic and social players and individual citizens, whom we must succeed in involving in this collective effort so that we can indeed make a qualitative leap in the protection of our environment, hence putting on greater pressure for the achievement of ambitious objectives at global level.
Mr President, I remember that at a very early stage, even before the Action Programme was before us, we had a talk with the Commissioner, during which we made it clear that the sixth environment action programme should be a brief document, taking the form of a pamphlet, with clear priorities and objectives.
I remember that the Commissioner shared our view.
Unfortunately, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I have to say that we are disappointed with the ultimate outcome.
It is a document which may provide an excellent analysis, but which is far too long and which does not contain any clear priorities and, in actual fact, which does not set out a clear policy, except for wanting to make the environment cleaner.
Other than that, however, the document offers little in the way of transparency.
That is, by the way, not a personal criticism of the Commissioner: we are very satisfied with her work in other areas.
Despite this, the Commission saw an opportunity to produce something which we did not actually want.
Allow me to move on to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
We have a great deal of appreciation for the work which the rapporteur has done. In many ways, she re-wrote the document.
Ultimately, however, the result of the work of the Environmental Committee is not really what we had hoped for either.
It is increasingly resembling a hotchpotch: everyone has a say and makes proposals, which leaves us ultimately with a kind of wish list.
I cannot shake off the impression that if someone had at some stage proposed to clean up the moon while we were at it, the Commission would have adopted that too.
That is not the right way to go about things, of course.
We may produce whole reams of fine words and give the impression that we are doing something worthwhile, but that is not strictly speaking the case.
It is also perhaps questionable whether a ten-year programme is really what we need in this day and age.
Too much chat, which, in fact, fits into the Dutch political culture perfectly: we too talk endlessly about all kinds of things - the infamous Dutch culture of consultation and deliberation, referred to as the 'poldermodel' being a case in point - but it subsequently takes an incredibly long time before something actually gets done.
Perhaps we need an entirely different approach, for example by establishing very clear issue programmes in the short term, alongside regular legislative programmes, in respect of which the Commission is doing a sterling job.
Allow me also to make a constructive comment and indicate which, in our view, should be the minimum priorities: climate change, energy, waste and bio-diversity.
We should have placed the emphasis on these aspects, instead of producing a document which indicates how beautiful the world should become on all scores.
We do not welcome many amendments because we then cannot see the wood for the trees.
Strictly speaking, we are not against the proposed details in the legislation, but we are of the opinion that it is unnecessary to include those in the Action Programme now and to regulate those matters from Brussels and Strasbourg.
It would be far preferable to implement this at national and perhaps even at regional or local level.
Mr President, transparency and details are two different things in our view.
We will therefore vote against a good number of amendments, not necessarily because we are opposed to them, but because we believe that those points should not be laid down by the European Parliament at this stage.
We therefore offer our hesitant support to this process.
Finally, I should like to propose the following: next time a document of this kind is drafted, we must ask the Commission officials to go back to using typewriters instead of word-processors.
In that way, it might be easier to keep to the point, because then there would not be the constant temptation to copy sections from existing documents into the new document.
It is also true that short documents save trees.
I cannot therefore but support the honourable Member.
Mr President, the Sixth Environment Action Programme is perhaps the most important policy document which we need to address during this mandate period, as it will guide environmental legislation and environmental policy in the EU for a long time to come.
It also forms a vital cornerstone of the strategy for sustainable development.
I would like to pay homage to Mrs Myller, who has worked excellently together with the shadow rapporteurs.
She also involved us all at a very early stage by allowing us to put forward proposals which she then took into account.
I believe we have raised the ambitions of the Commission document to a higher level, particularly with regard to the scope, aims and timetable of the programme.
The Commission and Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m received a great deal of criticism that the proposal was far too tame and was aiming too low.
The criticism came from all sides, including from the two institutions, the Council and Parliament.
However I would like to thank Margot WallstrÃ¶m for the fact that we have a Sixth Environment Action Programme.
We have perhaps forgotten that the Commission initially did not want the Sixth Environment Action Programme at all.
Only during questioning by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in conjunction with Mrs WallstrÃ¶m being put forward as a candidate for Commissioner, was the promise of a Sixth Action Programme given.
I am convinced that it not only required political courage but also a great deal of stubbornness and energy to carry out this promise, which is important to remember.
There are many important points which I will not have time to address now, but I would like to point out that the Committee has done a good job in deciding that the relevant strategies as well as the targets, funds and timetable should be drawn up as a framework directive, so that the matter can be handled in a democratic manner in Parliament and by the Council and so that we can enter the decision-making process and influence it.
I also believe it is good that the wording on public procurement, biodiversity, the precautionary principle and the substitution principle with regard to the chemicals strategy has been included.
Mr President, now that the fifth environment action programme has failed and political terms such as sustainability, waste reduction, cutting greenhouse gases and the much-vaunted international conferences and ecological organisations are politically bankrupt, the European Union's sixth environment action programme has taken exclusive and open recourse to the private sector in order to manage the environmental crisis, culminating in morally and environmentally perverse practices and tools such as trading in greenhouse gases.
Of the five strategic avenues, the two most basic are, first, finding new ways of working more closely with the market via businesses and consumers and, secondly, empowering people as private citizens.
This is the simple, crude and cynical way in which acute environmental problems are dealt with by the European Union which, with its bombing of Yugoslavia and its depleted uranium bombs, has inflicted incalculable damage on valuable natural resources, not to mention all the other disasters.
One last but illustrative point.
In Greece, there is no water on the plain of Thessaly, with the result that about a million people have nothing to drink and the plain is drying up and turning into a Sahara desert.
The diversion of the upper reaches of the River Acheloos, which is a major environmental project with hydroelectric energy and some irrigation functions, is on hold because the Community Support Frameworks, the famous packages, do not fund this sort of project.
Does the House not think that the European Union, which claims to be fighting for the environment, should review its position on and fund these projects?
Mr President, during the assessment of the fifth environment action programme, clear and challenging observations were made about the different environmental issues nearly two years ago.
Despite all fresh environmental legislation, an increase in the activity in terms of transport, energy and agriculture has put more pressure on the environment.
This is partly caused by the fact that many Member States fail to implement environmental legislation.
The conclusion of the assessment was that the objectives of the fifth environment action programme were not met.
Consequently, implementation and compliance, including the necessary inspections, of current EU legislation must be granted absolute top priority.
In addition, the remaining part of the present Environment Action Programme is yet to be carried out.
In the light of the enlargement, every effort must be made to achieve this also in the candidate countries in the shortest possible time.
The solving of environmental issues in those countries is very high on the list of priorities.
In addition, the environmental gain is potentially at its highest in those countries.
Finally, Mr President - and that is not a criticism of Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m or the rapporteur, Mrs Myller - there is a risk that this proposal will not have more impact than a paper tiger.
I can support many objectives, but these can only be obtained once the objectives of the fifth Environment Action Programme have been met.
It is therefore not a bad thing if the sixth Environment Action programme can only be laid down at a later stage.
In the meantime, all efforts can be focused on the implementation of the present legislation of the fifth Environment Action Programme, and the Council will also have the time to assess the profusion of amendments tabled by Parliament.
Mr President, evaluating an extensive and not always specifically formulated ten year programme for EU environmental policy is a difficult enough task in itself.
What the rapporteur has made of it makes the matter even more difficult.
I think that what the Commission laid before us was a very good starting point.
I really feel sorry for the Commission officials who presented a very good report because their good work was changed so much.
I am unable to congratulate the rapporteur.
In the discussion on the evaluation of the Fifth Environment Action Programme with a view to the sixth, three essential concerns were repeatedly formulated in the fundamentals, and thankfully I find them here again: streamlined EU legislation, a voluntary approach to implementation - so far as possible - and greater involvement of the consumer, whose behaviour we want to influence, after all.
Because it is no longer the 'What' that is at the forefront of environmental policy today.
We are agreed on that - industry is, too - but how we get there, that is where the controversy lies!
As I see it, the EU way is often twin-track, contradictory, difficult to implement, bureaucratic and costly out of all proportion to the ecological purpose.
Such legal errors are then multiplied fifteen fold in the implementation.
If, as I very much hope, we are to have enlargement very soon, there will be twice as many, because in the end with all these mistakes the dogs always bite the last one in the chain.
That is not industry, it is the consumer.
The implementation of existing EU environmental legislation addressed in the Environment Action Programme and rightly called for repeatedly by Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m makes good sense and is also consistent with our repeated call for streamlined legislation.
I find there is a lot missing from this environment programme.
I am sure we could have included it.
Only what the rapporteur has made of it does not improve matters.
I feel sorry for the Commission officials!
Mr President, Commissioner, when I read the Commission proposal, at first I said: 'Splendid!'
That was when I read the communication.
Then I looked at the articles and found that something had happened between communication and articles.
There is always something missing.
If you look at it closely, you can see precisely what it is.
In the communication, the strategic objectives - and the related measures - are set out quite clearly.
In the articles there are only vague allusions.
Sometimes something has been lost altogether, in the case of noise, for example, which in my opinion is a key environmental factor for human health.
The communication describes the types of pollution and lists the measures.
Then you come to the articles; in Article 2 you still find the objective of reducing pollution, especially long-term pollution, from noise.
Then when you come to the measures concerning health in Article 6, however hard you look, Commissioner, I can find not one specific measure about noise.
I therefore think it is right that we should now bring the things that you listed quite rightly and very well at the beginning of the communication back into the articles, thereby making them binding for the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
Either list of examples can be used.
If we are to set about using an instrument of this kind, we need a degree of strategic orientation.
In connection with water, for example, we read: "phasing out the discharge of hazardous substances" .
I don' t think there is even one person in the European Union who says he wants more hazardous substances to be discharged into water.
The questions of when such a thing happens, however, and what hazardous substances are, need to be rather more closely defined!
There is nothing about that at all.
The next bullet point is "Revising the bathing water directive" .
What does "revising" mean?
Does it mean raising the standards?
Does it mean the same standards as in the drinking water directive, or does it mean protecting human health?
So we need greater clarity here.
Now a word to the PPE-DE: I admit we have a few motions here about whose content we can discuss.
We must do that, but we must do it in the second reading because that is when things get polished up.
I really must ask you at the first reading to give us a mandate to negotiate and back the report.
Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Myller on her very sound report.
Since 1972, we have had Environment Action Programmes one, two, three, four and five.
A few years ago, key officials in the Directorate-General for the Environment said that they had done enough, and that there was no need for a sixth environment action programme. If the Member States implement what has already been decided, then all will be well in the environment.
We as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance protested loudly against this, and we asked candidate-Commissioner, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, to issue a sixth environment action programme anyway, which she did; she has kept her promise.

We have to say that we, along with Mr Lange, believe that the legislative component is rather flimsy.
The extensive explanatory note was much better.
That is why we as majority in Parliament wanted to include this extensive explanatory note in the legislation.
Hence the many amendments.
We have now also received the Prodi paper for the Gothenburg Summit.
It has to be said that this paper contains a number of interesting ideas which go even further, such as the abolition of subsidies for fossil fuels until 2010, and 7% bio-fuels for cars and lorries, also in 2010.
We as the Group of the Greens have tabled amendments of that ilk.
We hope that the Socialists and Liberals will support them, so that they can be incorporated in the legislation.
If that is the case, Parliament will be supporting an ambitious programme for the next ten years.
According to the Liberals, climate, waste and bio-diversity had to be included.
Without the sixth environment action programme, the whole issue of bio-diversity would have been overlooked.
It would not have been given priority in the current policy.
That is why I welcome this fresh initiative.
Mr President, on the eve of the Gothenburg Summit, we needed to find a way of reconciling the environment and economic growth, that is, of combating the deterioration in the environment while giving companies the means to develop.
The sixth action programme makes a more or less felicitous attempt to do this.
It suggests that Kyoto needs to be ratified if we are to combat the greenhouse effect efficiently and calls for greater protection for our cultural and natural heritage, as the honourable Member Mrs De Veyrac stresses in her report - and on this we agree.
There are also issues which give us cause for concern, however. For example, we are moving on to the sixth programme without any real evaluation of the results of the fifth programme, which is completely irregular.
We also feel that programming over a ten-year period is much too long, to the point at which theory has prevailed over practice in the Commission communication, a document of 90 pages no less.
As for transparency of decisions and access to documents, I trust that these will not go unheeded, as recommended in the Korhola report.
Finally, the objectives of enhanced protection for biodiversity through the Natura 2000 network are proving troublesome.
Almost every Member State is having implementation problems due to the lack of clarity in the texts and their restrictive interpretation by the European Court of Justice.
Article 225a of the Treaty of Nice provides for the facility to create judicial panels to hear at first instance certain classes of action brought in specific areas.
There is good reason to bet that the environment sector will be one of the first to set them up, given the context.
Is this the best way of protecting the environment?
I very much doubt it and I call for a sixth programme which is rational, realistic and humanist in its application.
Mr President, this is one of the most important documents we will be debating in the field of the environment in this parliamentary cycle.
Given its enhanced legal status, this document will be of greater significance than any of the other environmental action plans I have seen going through Parliament in the last 10 or so years.
I am, therefore, concerned at the speed with which it has been considered by Parliament, driven at least in part by an ambitious presidency that will be here today and gone tomorrow.
Mrs Myller is in no way to be criticised as she has striven very hard to begin the discussion on the substance of this debate very early on, but that has not stopped some of her colleagues from coming forward with a long last-minute shopping list of demands stretching far into the future.
However, we should not despair.
The proposals are still there at the centre of the document in the amendments.
The Commission can still rescue it at second reading.
The rapporteur will have the chance of getting a core of sensible amendments together at second reading that will have the support of the clear majority of Members of this House.
I, like many others tomorrow, will vote for this report and the bulk of the amendments, knowing that by going forward to the second reading we are taking steps in the long process of developing an environment policy for the European Union which will outlast all the presidencies and all the ministers that this Parliament will see, and which will probably also outlast most of the Members of this House.
In that sense, we all have to recognise how small a part we play in the bigger overall process.
Mr President, the Environment Action Programme has galvanised Parliament into a high level of activity.
It has stirred up contradictory reactions, reactions of disappointment and satisfaction.
I am one of those who are actually quite pleased: a great deal of thought has gone into selecting the topics, and I welcome the emphasis on climate, health, bio-diversity and waste.
In my view, however, we could have been more specific, more to the point, and more precise.
Rapporteur, Mrs Rita Myller, has compiled an excellent report, which I back entirely.
Her report contributes towards a better and more specific Environment Action Programme.
The sixth environment action programme must become the mainstay of European strategy for sustainable development.
That too receives my unqualified support.
Two matters are of key importance to me.
First of all, compliance. I am pleased that the Commissioner has placed so much emphasis on proper compliance.
She has also confirmed this in the previous debate.
I am of the view that Parliament could play a more significant role in that compliance.
One of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy states that Parliament should be issued with half-yearly reports on the state of affairs, which affords an overview of compliance by the Member States and instances of encouragement by the Commission, and, if possible, the effectiveness of the legislation.
Such a report can be hugely beneficial to national parliaments: they can be the first ones to point out the governments' non-compliance with European obligations.
In that way, various parties can join forces and can turn the sixth environment action programme into a success.
Commissioner, I should like to have your opinion on the possibility of these half-yearly reports.
My second point concerns international cooperation.
Sustainable development should not remain within European borders.
That is why the Environmental Committee is calling for protection of the hot spots in tropical regions.
International agreements are important.
Unfortunately, Parliament has insufficient authority in this respect, and international negotiations are not public.
