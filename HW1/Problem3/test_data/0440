Countries which are members of NEPAD commit themselves to respect for human rights, to the prevention and resolution of conflicts and to the principles of democracy and good governance, but also â and this is a cultural revolution â to the campaign against corruption.
In brief, what we have here is African regional integration which will create optimum conditions for encouraging private investors to take part in the economic and social development of these African countries.
At last we see a credible African initiative based on the principle that the participation of the private sector is a vital complement to public assistance in meeting the enormous needs of the African continent.
This report is based on two vital central themes, the prevention and resolving of conflicts on the one hand and good governance on the other.
Peace and stability are the prerequisites for any development.
This is true in the case of public investment, but even more true in the case of private investment.
After a conflict, the authorities can start to invest again fairly quickly, but the same is not true of private investors, who first of all have to regain confidence.
From this point of view, the conflict in the Ivory Coast runs the risk of having negative consequences on the economy of the region for many years.
Good governance is just as vital as stability.
Democracy and respect for the rule of law are conditions which are essential to economic and human development.
In the case of NEPAD, it is Africans themselves who are ensuring that these principles are met and who are making strong commitments.
NEPAD consists of ten priority themes, the most important of which are good public governance, good governance of the private sector, infrastructure â and we know how important that is â education and health too of course, agriculture, the environment, energy, and, finally, access to markets in the developed countries, something which is difficult at present.
NEPAD has received very favourable responses from the industrialised countries, particularly from the European Union and the G8, as we saw last year at Evian, although the resulting aid has not always fulfilled the expectations of the instigating countries.
Generally speaking, the Commissionâs report welcomes the NEPAD initiative and requests that it be implemented promptly.
It highlights certain areas where there is a need for improvement, and warns against potential risks.
The report notes the criticisms of many people who are involved in African civil society, and encourages member states of the African Union, and especially those countries which promoted it, to allow active and democratic participation by all sectors of civil society, including NGOs, trade unions, employersâ organisations and churches.
This report also reminds us that NEPAD is a social and economic programme of the African Union for the development of Africa, and not an independent institution.
It reiterates the firm belief that the role of providing the impetus for and exercising parliamentary control over NEPAD naturally falls to the pan-African parliaments which will be set up between now and the end of the year, and that duplication of effort and expenditure and institutional proliferation and overlapping should be avoided.
Finally, this report attaches the greatest importance to the implementation and democratic parliamentary control of the African Peer Review Mechanism.
Finally, this report is balanced.
It represents the essence of this Parliamentâs political sensitivities.
I hope that it will be adopted as it is, without any amendments, apart from a few oral amendments.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Commission welcomes Parliamentâs support for NEPAD and for the African Union.
The new pan-African reality born with NEPAD and the African Union deserves our special attention and full support.
We must not lose the momentum created by recent major changes in Africa, whose leaders took the initiative to extricate the continent from poverty and marginalisation, with ownership as a guiding principle.
In fact, those whom I often call the heroes of NEPAD could be said to have demonstrated that ownership is something you take; it is not something you are given.
This has been the real inspiration of the entire initiative.
The Commission is committed to supporting pan-African initiatives.
We are in the process of building structured relations with the African Union and NEPAD institutions.
The European Commission remains strongly committed to supporting NEPAD and the priorities and objectives of the African Union.
The presence of President Prodi at the African Union Summit in Maputo in July 2003 and the development of the dialogue between our Commission and new pan-African structures demonstrate that stance.
The fact that their administrative and executive arm is called the African Commission is a pleasing comment on what we represent in Europe, and certainly we are in the business of launching assistance for initiatives at continental level to demonstrate this close working relationship.
Numerous political contacts to date between the European Commission and the African Union Commission have been preparing the ground for launching a strategic, structured dialogue between the two bodies.
In tandem, a regular dialogue is being developed with the NEPAD Secretariat.
The establishment of other pan-African institutions, including the Peace and Security Council and the Pan-African Parliament, affords new prospects for dialogue between the European Union and Africa as a whole.
The other week the process of ratifying the Peace and Security Council Protocol in African Union Member States reached the point where this institution is now being formally launched.
We look forward to the same development very soon as regards the Pan-African Parliament.
At the same time, the European Community is providing tangible support for pan-African initiatives.
Peace and security is of special importance here: it is a prerequisite for all development.
The establishment of a peace facility to back African-owned and African-led peace-building actions will mark a breakthrough.
Leadership by the African Union in this area has been essential and still is.
I will dwell a little on the establishment of the peace facility.
Following the request by the African Heads of State in Maputo in July 2003 that part of their national allocations be 'shaved off' to establish a peace facility, the Commission proceeded quickly.
After intensive discussions with the EU Council and our ACP partners, they both gave the go-ahead for the facility.
We are now entering a more operational phase in which we are preparing a specific financing proposal for 250 million euros; it is planned to be submitted to the next meeting of the EDF Committee.
This is therefore moving forward.
Three fundamental principles underpin the philosophy of the peace facility.
Firstly, ownership is to strengthen the capacity of the African people to deal with African conflicts.
We hope the facility will provide the necessary financial 'muscle' to accompany the political resolve of the African Union and consolidate the continental architecture it has designed with the Peace and Security Council as its key institution.
Secondly, there is to be solidarity through financial contributions from all African countries.
Thirdly, there is development, it being acknowledged that without peace and stability there can be no development in Africa.
We want to develop an appropriate response to the new pan-African context.
We â the European Union â still face the challenge of treating Africa as one entity.
Our assistance to the continent as a whole should be set in a coherent framework.
This calls, inter alia, for action to ensure that our national and regional cooperation programmes are consistent with NEPAD and African Union priorities and objectives.
This process is in the hands of our African partners, and the Commission will make sure in the months ahead that it is reflected in our 'mid-term reviews' under the Cotonou Agreement and with regard to the other country strategies relevant for the rest of Africa.
The Commission put forward concrete proposals in its communication on EU-Africa dialogue last July to build bridges between the various agreements linking the European Union and Africa.
That communication aimed to promote a substantive discussion on the most promising avenues and future practical arrangements for EU-Africa dialogue and cooperation.
I will conclude by saying that Mr BÃ©bÃ©ar's report and the debate here today are welcome contributions to this discussion.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to thank Mr BÃ©bÃ©ar for his excellent report.
NEPAD is a vision, a concept in the minds of African heads of state, covering the whole African continent, and sets out a strategic framework for Africa's renewal.
This vision must include a democratic voice via a parliament and the involvement of civil society.
It is, however, the African Union that should be the main instigator of policies laid down under NEPAD, based on regional integration.
The objectives and principles are everything that we in Europe would ask for and insist on, including eradication of poverty, raising the status of Africa on the world scene, making good governance a basic requirement, building a peaceful, secure and stable continent able to energise its economies to take advantage of world trade, and trying to ensure that the millennium development goals in the area of health and education are met.
In Europe we are already assisting with all these objectives.
We must continue to support and encourage the NEPAD vision, but action would speak louder than words.
It will take very large sums of money to achieve these goals.
One can only hope that the oil-rich states will contribute.
With peace and stability, there are huge natural reserves that could also help them achieve their vision.
With a peer review body, one hopes that the heads of African states will now take responsibility for their own destiny and that the problems of instability and poverty will be eradicated, with human rights being a top priority, especially for women and children.
Â Â  Madam President, NEPAD and its implementation agency, the African Union, offer, as all of us would agree, no quick fix for the problems of Africa.
Fulfilling the promises will not be easy and Africa and, indeed, outsiders such as ourselves, will have to be in this for the long haul.
As the report points out, NEPAD was initially and consistently intellectually scarred by inadequate consultation, particularly at grassroots level â it was leader-led.
We hope that we will ensure that, as far as the African Union in its future work is concerned, there will be far more consultation at grassroots level with civil society.
Perhaps the result of this, as far as NEPAD is concerned, for instance in relation to our last debate, is the modest reference in NEPAD to any kind of social sector issue.
There is hardly any mention of HIV/AIDS at all, and this has to be a very glaring and serious contradiction in NEPAD's proposals for action.
As the Commissioner said, we now move on to working with the African Union, which will now be given the task of working through the policies and implementing them.
How will the Commission support efforts to build the kind of coherence that will be necessary now between NEPAD and the AU's strategy?
Is it of concern for instance that the peer group review mechanism is somehow now being increasingly institutionalised and separated off as a kind of separate secretariat?
Should this not be of some concern to us?
The Commissioner talked quite rightly about the importance of the peace facility.
Does the Commission intend to offer commensurate funds for the other work â the self-led development work â of the AU on democracy, human rights and good governance?
Will we be offering similar support for that work, which has to go hand in hand with the work that will need to take place on conflict resolution and peace-building?
As the report says, it is important that the AU is the legitimate political and mandated institution at this stage.
Peace and governance cannot be dealt with through declarations such as NEPAD.
What we need now, as the last speaker said, is much better focus and action.
Â Â  Madam President, will NEPAD be the tool of African renaissance when other plans have failed?
The Greens are perhaps the only ones who doubt it.
Of course we support the human-rights aspect of NEPAD, though we regret the fact that it is often merely theoretical.
We shall not linger here on the contempt, on the part of the authors of NEPAD, for any prior consultation of the people regarding the drawing up of the plan, and we would point out that repression of political opponents and journalists is still happening in Africa, even in Senegal.
In economic terms, NEPAD promises the same liberalism as was created by the World Bank and the IMF, the liberalism of structural adjustment plans, the same liberalism which brought Argentina to its knees and which grapples with public services, health services, water-distribution services and education services, the liberalism which, in the final analysis, increases inequalities and poverty, in particular as they affect women.
It is time to carry out an evaluation of the impact of earlier commercial liberalisation policies on social and economic development and on the protection of the environment.
NEPAD is not short of freedoms, be it freedom of capital, free movement of goods or freedom to provide services.
Yet what has happened to the free movement of workers within the Community of African States?
What has happened to the freedom of peoples to choose their own future?
Moreover, I should like to draw your attention to the gradual regionalisation for which NEPAD makes provision.
There is a problem in that the European Union supports such zones, which are now tending to resemble scenarios in which the NEPAD instigating countries take neighbouring African countries under their political and economic wing.
Nor will NEPAD be able to claim to be a viable solution while at the same time ignoring what is at stake as a result of the terrible burden of debt borne by the countries of Africa.
Thus provision is made for reducing the debt only in the case of countries which have followed neo-liberal principles.
The European Union should seek and apply the total and unconditional cancellation of the debt.
Promoting sustainable development in Africa does not mean throwing that continent to the mercy of the multinationals and of foreign investments.
It does not mean encouraging the exploitation of its resources by foreign powers.
For example, the agricultural and mining sectors to which NEPAD gives priority will be totally dependent on prices that are fixed by the countries of the North.
Africa is not for sale.
Africa must be constructed by and for Africans.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr BÃ©bÃ©ar for producing this excellent own-initiative report.
The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is an ambitious programme, and we should congratulate our African partners on it, for it is indeed a programme developed by Africans for Africans.
This concept has now been in existence for more than two years, and following the successful establishment of the African Union and the scheduling of the first session of the Pan-African Parliament for the third week in March, the time has come for the proposed mechanisms to be put in effect.
I would like to focus especially on the African Peer Review Mechanism and explore this in more detail.
Yet I have the impression that some of its architects are a little scared by their own courage.
The Commissioner has just mentioned the heroes of NEPAD, but they must be the cowards of NEPAD, for adopting principles such as good governance and human rights means implementing them as well â and implementation means effective control and evaluation of the commitments undertaken.
Unfortunately, it is apparent that those who are responsible for the worst excesses in Africa, notably Mr Mugabe in Zimbabwe, are naturally not subscribing to this mechanism in the first place.
In all, just sixteen out of more than fifty states have joined the mechanism so far.
I believe this is exactly where we should take a positive role, be it through the EU or indeed G8.
After all, G8 committed itself to an Africa Action Plan back in 2002.
We should be targeting our support specifically to those who are genuinely improving their standards and are complying with the mechanism in practice.
This is the only way to ensure that we treat Africa individually and not as an entity, which was the Commissionerâs complaint earlier.
For this purpose, the EU but also G8 should draw up a specific timetable to fulfil the commitments which they have undertaken in abstract.
Positive outcomes could then be anticipated in Africa as well.
Â Â  â Madam President, most of the African countries that have adopted the NEPAD initiative are ACP countries.
This offers the Commission the opportunity to support the NEPAD initiative on the basis of partnership through its cooperation with the ACP.
It also offers the European Parliament the opportunity, through the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to engage in regular dialogue with the relevant countries about their needs and, indeed, the successes achieved.
The new parliamentary committees established by the ACP Assembly offer an excellent forum for this process, enabling problems to be addressed on the basis of critical solidarity.
Through their initiative, the NEPAD countries have undoubtedly laid the foundation stone for successful development based on individual responsibility.
The task now is to establish a sound basis for fruitful cooperation and create a pan-African house in which every individual finds a home worthy of human dignity.
Achieving peace in crisis regions is a basic prerequisite for improving living conditions in large parts of Africa.
In order to achieve long-term successes, especially in combating poverty, lasting political stability is essential.
This can only be achieved on a reliable basis if those who bear political responsibility secure the support of civil society.
That means that there must be active, democratic and pluralist participation by the key groups from civil society: the non-government organisations as well as the political bodies and associations, the trade unions as well as employersâ organisations, and the churches as well as cultural associations and education bodies, to cite just a few examples.
There is a particular need for womenâs equal participation in designing projects and strategies for development, for they are the key figures who organise daily life, and they are often responsible for ensuring their familiesâ survival as well.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have mixed feelings to some degree when we look at the history of NEPAD.
Even if our fellow-Memberâs report is positive â and we can endorse it on the whole â recent experience still leads us to have some doubts.
The NEPAD story was the response of the African leaders to the globalisation of the world economy.
This is understandable, because Africa is, in many ways, at risk of becoming the continent that is losing out while everyone else uses it to stock up on supplies.
It bears witness to vision, but it also has the disadvantage of being a big plan that has not been developed from the bottom up.
A major fear is that NEPAD will eventually lead to the enrichment of those who are already rich and the challenge is to see the NEPAD story not as contravening the millennium objectives, such as halving the number of poor who have to survive on less than 1 dollar.
This is an issue that cannot be solved with large trade flows, because trade has never guaranteed truly fair distribution.
Â Â  Madam President, we have heard some fine words this evening, but let us recall that the New Partnership for Africa's Development â NEPAD â was a bargain.
On the one hand the developed countries undertook to provide billions of dollars in new resources, but, for their part, the African governments committed themselves to good governance, democracy and human rights and the rule of law.
One fact is certain: without good governance in Africa, increased aid will be of only marginal value.
I note the Commission's estimate, quoted by Mr BÃ©bÃ©ar, that illegally acquired funds deposited in mostly foreign banks amount to more than half of African's external debt.
I wonder what proportion of this stolen money belongs to Mr Mugabe and his associates.
After all, it is Mr Mugabe and his ZANU-PF cronies who have systematically pillaged and brutalised the once prosperous country of Zimbabwe, brought lawlessness and starvation on its people and forced so many of them to live in fear and desperation.
I hear of terrible new cases every day.
Unfortunately, many of Zimbabwe's neighbours not only have encouraged the Mugabe regime, but also have allowed Mugabe to dictate the terms of Africa's relationship with us.
Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control.
This House has called for effective action by the Council on six separate occasions.
To date, the Council has failed to heed these calls.
On Thursday we shall insist yet again that we want effective action now!
This means not just the renewal of the EU's targeted sanctions when they expire on 18 February, but also the introduction of tough new measures.
South Africa, in particular, needs to exercise some real moral and political leadership.
After all, South Africa is specifically responsible for the good governance aspects of NEPAD.
I say to President Mbeki that quiet diplomacy does not work.
It did not work in getting rid of apartheid and it will not work with Mugabe.
He has to get tough.
I implore the African Union and the African countries to use all the resources at their disposal to persuade Mugabe and his clique to step aside.
We need to set the people of Zimbabwe free.
Let us be under no illusions: Zimbabwe is the test case for NEPAD.
Â Â  Madam President, I thank the rapporteur for producing this own-initiative report, allowing us to debate what is an important initiative.
It is important because it is a home-grown initiative.
It comes from the African nations.
Even if there are reservations, that point is extremely important.
On our own continent, it was when we realised that poverty, unemployment, dictatorship and war led nowhere that we were able to form the European Union and then move ahead.
Now that Africa makes that political decision, hopefully it too can move ahead.
In post-war Europe we could not do it on our own.
We needed help from outside.
The rapporteur talks about the Marshall Plan in his conclusions to the report.
The Marshall Plan was worth USD 13.4 billion over four years in 1948.
That was a lot of money.
Aid has to be properly spent, but proper aid has to be there in the first place, alongside better free trade and the untying of aid to African countries so that money is spent on what is needed, not on the things that we would like to see it spent on.
We can do a lot more in the EU to support this important initiative.
I hope that the Commission will play its role in making sure that we work alongside the African leaders, who want this kind of change, and in making sure that it happens.
Â Â  Madam President, the list of objectives for NEPAD is very long: it includes many different concepts such as conflict prevention, democracy and regional economic integration.
The report by my friend and colleague, Mr BÃ©bÃ©ar, is an excellent one.
However, I should like to highlight that if, as he says, all these objectives were to be fulfilled, it would cost EUR 64 billion per annum.
I do not believe that kind of money will be forthcoming.
As the last speaker said, whilst there is corruption, mismanagement, fraud and bad governance, we have to tackle the problem of poverty in Africa.
If NEPAD is a solution put forward by African governments, then there may be a chance.
We have examples of bad management and fraud: we have only to look to the news a week ago when Parmalat lost EUR 10 billion in Italy â a sophisticated, modern, western country!
So it is not surprising that there will be difficulties in Africa.
I do not condone them; I have always objected to and stamped on corruption wherever it is, especially in Africa.
We need to encourage NEPAD, especially the conception, growth and sustenance of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Africa, owned and run by Africans using the natural resources of their countries and employing their own people, with the appropriate training and help that we can give them.
That is the engine for NEPAD â the economic engine that can bring about development.
First, it must be formed in their countries, support the regional economy and then go beyond to EU and world markets.
That is what NEPAD was conceived to be.
The roof may be the African Union, the walls may be the pan-African Parliament, but the foundation of economic growth and the eradication of poverty in Africa has to be something like NEPAD.
We ought to support it.
Â Â  . Madam President, I shall start by commenting on Mrs Kinnock's remark about the need to mobilise similar support for other things as we do for the peace facility.
We do not spend similar amounts of money on all the other things: we spend much more.
What is new about the peace facility is that we are creating a basis for spending money on things we were never able to spend money on before.
Funding the implementation of the peace operations decided by Africa and implemented in an African context is a new thing.
We should make sure that we only use that money for things that cannot be funded through the regular systems already in place.
I liked Mr Corrie's remark about oil-rich African states which could do more.
We should come back to this.
I also see that it would be very meaningful in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to discuss the performance of oil-exporting economies and other similar extraction industries in Africa.
This discussion is just starting up, but that is in many cases where the big money should be found for social purposes.
The fantastic things about NEPAD were its timing and character, and the ambition of accepting exposure and measurement as regards the global criteria relating to democracy.
These African countries are saying that they want to be judged on these same principles, echoing what we had all agreed on in the Cotonou framework.
They wanted this to be taken up.
They did it up against the G8, which attracted much attention globally and, in that sense, raised the stakes in the process of democratisation in Africa.
NEPAD, and democracy in Africa, are still very new.
The best performers have had only two â at the most three â reasonably fair elections.
We tend to forget that: the best performers have experienced two acceptable democratic elections.
There is not much more than a big handful of those best cases.
However, things are moving in the right direction.
This peer review is a fantastic, very daring endeavour.
Of course they had to institutionalise.
It was a wise move to set it into the context of African Union as soon as possible, because, as Mr Van Orden correctly pointed out, what would they have done with Zimbabwe and a large number of other cases if the original five heroes of NEPAD had handled that?
They would have run out of political authority.
It would have been perceived as a kind of ganging-up â showing the others how to do things.
Instead, it was wisely embedded â if I may use that word with reference to that continent â into the African Union, which took it up.
This work is continuing.
It is quite fantastic that they are lining up standards to get through this screening in the peer review process.
I told them in one discussion that it looks as if it is more difficult to get good marks in the peer review process than it is to fulfil the criteria we have defined in order to become a member of the European Union.
It is very ambitious.
I can only recommend that everybody interested in Africa studies how they are setting the mark there.
I have warned them that it may be too ambitious, but they want this to be a global standard for governance.
They know it is not going to be easy.
Institutionally, we look forward very much to a systematic, close, well-organised collaboration with the emerging Commission in Addis Ababa.
I hope that we will get back on track and be able to manage the difficulties â also with reference to Zimbabwe.
I hope that 2004 will be a positive turning-point, enabling us at full speed to resume the EU-Africa dialogue.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is a report (A5-0477/2003) by MrsÂ Prets, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on preserving and promotingcultural diversity in an enlarged Europe: the role of the European regions and international organisations such as UNESCO and the Council of Europe (2002/2269(INI)).
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult to define cultural diversity, a concept just as complicated and complex as that of culture itself.
Cultures are constantly subject to a changing and moving process and this dynamism is an impulse for human progress.
Nevertheless, we shall have to produce a formal definition of cultural policy, cultural goods and services, and of course cultural diversity, particularly in connection with agreements under the aegis of international organisations like the WTO or the proposed international instrument on cultural diversity.
In a Eurobarometer survey on enlargement in April 2003, Europeâs citizens described culture as one of the major winners in the enlargement process, alongside environment and trade.
This testifies to the international organisationsâ commitment to safeguarding and promoting cultural diversity.
Cultural diversity forms an integral part of the European Unionâs identity, and will include other cultures after the accession of the new countries.
The EUâs external borders are shifting towards a faultline with very different cultural regions.
From 2004, the European Union will be the direct neighbour of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova.
Parallels and similarities can be identified despite the existing differences, which can be explained through migration and intercultural dialogue.
The aim, especially in view of enlargement, is to create stronger relations among both minority and marginalised cultures and stronger cultures so that no cultural conflict occurs, but instead cultural dialogue promotes mutual understanding in the interests of peace.
Safeguarding cultural diversity does not mean fencing it in and preserving it.
It means opening it up, offering individual development and marketing opportunities without subjecting it to current market mechanisms.
It is the basic pillar for identity and an economic factor at the same time.
This means that we must work not only to protect but also to promote cultural diversity.
We must place it in an international context so that exchange, development and dialogue can take place.
For example, the music and film industries appear to be very lucrative sectors in the context of international trade, especially if we look more closely at the market share of films in the European Union in 2000: American films accounted for 73%, national films in the home country 15%, and national films outside the home country 8%.
Many people only became aware of the Commissionâs negotiations in the WTO framework through the Stop GATS campaign.
Due to their lack of transparency, these negotiations caused a great deal of upset and were thus the focus of public attention.
This lack of transparency has also caused doubts and fears that liberalisation is going too far, and has reinforced the view among cultural actors that the goal of international competitiveness takes precedence over the defence of cultural diversity.
Cultural services and products are still exempt from trade liberalisation at present, but this is not secure in the long term.
Public education systems currently also fall outside the scope of GATS.
This must continue in order to safeguard free access, equal opportunities and quality.
Privately financed education markets have largely been liberalised.
What we are demanding is that there should be no more forced liberalisation in this area.
We must prevent the goal of international competitiveness from negatively impacting on cultural diversity.
That means that the protection of funding instruments and therefore of cultural diversity should not be achieved within the WTO and GATS, but through the adoption of a Convention on Cultural Diversity in the framework of UNESCO.
It is gratifying that UNESCO has decided, by a large majority, to launch work towards the elaboration of a draft Convention, and I hope that this will proceed very swiftly, for we need a decision very quickly here.
Promotion â as well as protection â is essential, as I have already said, to maintain cultural diversity.
European cultural policy must go hand in hand with pro-active and autonomous national cultural policies and indeed, in some areas, greater decentralisation in the regions and municipalities.
The different levels should not replace but must complement each other.
The internal market and hence the free trade in services must not take precedence over national funding mechanisms.
Through greater cooperation between international organisations, the unique character of cultures worldwide should be safeguarded and promoted.
Â Â  Madam President, Mrs Prets, honourable Members, this is not the first report that the European Parliament has adopted on the subject of cultural diversity. It forms part of a long chain of ideas which supplement, repeat and strengthen each other.
That is precisely why reports such as this one are so important, because each time they recall us to order and show us that Parliament is present, that it is keeping its eye on things and that it is not going to fall asleep on the job. It is ensuring that cultural diversity is a fundamental part of the European Unionâs internal and external policies.
I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Prets for this report, which is in line with what the European Parliament, the mouthpiece of European citizens, has always wanted.
You are right, Mrs Prets: cultural diversity is a fight, a fight in our everyday lives, and we are not fighting it alone: we need allies.
On this point I welcome the continuous and long-standing support of the European Parliament, support which warms my heart and which never weakens, and support which helps the Commission to make progress in its actions aimed at implementing the Treaty in the area of cultural diversity.
In this respect, Madam President, the Prets report invites us to think about what is at stake. There are many things at stake, and Mrs Prets has listed them.
First of all there are national policies, with increasingly difficult budgets admittedly, but it is essential that a part of those budgets should continue to be allocated to culture, to its diversity, and to the protection, particularly in the context of cultural production, to those who are weakest, so that our great cultural wealth here in Europe can continue to survive.
Then there are our foreign policies, and I welcome, as you all do, the fact that we have just won this battle at international level â and it is only a battle, not the whole war â in managing to persuade the majority of the nations of the world to follow us in our fight so that, with regard to international trade as well, we can preserve our cultural stakes.
We do indeed need principles to follow if the Unionâs action, both within and beyond its borders, is to reflect our commitment to that cultural diversity which is our source of life.
I believe that this process, which is absolutely unique in Europe, and which we must have invented because it would not have been possible to copy it since it did not yet exist anywhere else, has served as an example throughout the world.
I often hear that sentiment expressed on my travels to various countries, large or small, where people say to me, âThe way in which you protect your minorities and support your cultures, whether large or small, important or less important, is leading the way for us to followâ.
What better thing could we give to the world than to show it the way to preserve cultural heritage, to preserve what is most important to people, a way that involves a willingness to give priority to our hearts rather than to the market.
That is what it is all about, preserving our traditions, our cultures, our future talents, our young people seeking to express themselves. We must preserve them so that those young people can continue to express themselves in the future.
It is this human dimension of the policy that we must strengthen, at local, regional, national and international level, because cultural diversity, ladies and gentlemen, is universal: we cannot talk about âmy cultural diversityâ because cultural diversity is also the cultural diversity of other people, people who, as a general rule, are unable to express themselves unless we help them to express themselves.
I also believe that it is important that this report on cultural diversity comes just after a report on development aid.
It is a fitting symbol, because development aid is also a form of assistance which helps to preserve the culture of those who do not have the means of preserving it themselves.
Therefore our universal action in this direction is very important.
It is obvious that within the Union we should preserve our capacity to support our diverse cultures by means of local, regional, national and European funding, and the Commission is committed to the full implementation of Article 151(4), which makes it compulsory to take into account, horizontally, the cultural diversity within all the other cultures.
I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that it has become a reflex action for the Commission, even for those Commissioners who have responsibilities in sectors such as the economy, external trade or international affairs, to take into consideration the fact that cultural diversity is a part of our lives.
Therefore, our action, in this sense, is very important, and we shall not be sparing in our efforts here.
I do not have sufficient human resources to undertake to make reports on what we are doing.
I prefer to invest what human resources I do have in taking action rather than in commenting on possible action.
That is why I shall not be able to issue any supplementary reports. However, we are in the process of drawing up a report on cultural expenditure in the context of the Structural Funds.
I believe that this is very important, because the largest amount of expenditure on culture within the Union does not come under the heading of the âCulture 2000â programme, but rather from the Structural Funds.
I therefore believe that it is very important to look at the figures.
Moreover, I am in complete agreement with the idea of strengthening diversity in our cooperation and development policies with third countries.
There cannot be diversity without exchanges, in all countries and in all forms of expression, and I undertake to remind the Commissioners responsible for external relations â which is not difficult because they are already convinced of it â of the importance of making provision, in our foreign policies, for a cultural aspect, which is the human aspect and which is of primordial importance.
I do not need to remind you of what we have already achieved, over a period of very many years, with our ACP partners or of what we initiated with our Mediterranean partners.
However, what we are doing with all our partners is something new, and is perhaps in the process of becoming, thanks to Parliament among others, one of the new policies which are forging ahead.
I recently visited China. What were people talking about there?
They were talking about culture and about cultural diversity.
Moreover, the Chinese are supporting us within UNESCO.
The Chinese were also talking about education, and all this in a huge country like China, which is counting on Europe to help it to preserve its cultural diversity.
You can see, then, that we have committed ourselves to a worldwide trend which is very important, hence my satisfaction as regards the battle that we won in UNESCO.
It was not easy, but nevertheless we succeeded, in UNESCO, in persuading the nations of the world to stand side by side with us in order to preserve that which we all hold most dear.
I do not doubt for a moment that, now that the General Assembly of UNESCO has decided to create an international instrument for the preservation of cultural diversity, that instrument will see the light of day and it will be a strong instrument.
We shall be working with this end in view, not only within Europe, but also in all our international relations. In the same way as we worked in order to win the battle, we shall continue to work in order to win the war.
You will be aware that we are only at a preliminary stage in these negotiations, but I also have to tell you that we have sent a very strong signal to our partners by the publication, for the first time by the Commission, and therefore by the entire European executive, of a communication to the Council and Parliament on the European Unionâs relations with UNESCO.
This was a very strong point of departure for our partners to enable them to support us in our efforts in this direction.
We still have a certain amount of time before we need to take action.
UNESCO will make time available, and I would ask you to use this time in order to reflect, in depth, about the various aspects which are likely to be developed in this future Convention on which we shall need to consult our interested partners, professionals in the cultural sector and the cultural industries.
We must work together in order to define the detailed rules for cooperation with successive presidents of the Union, who will be conducting the UNESCO negotiations, so that Europe can prove that it is united on this occasion.
This is important, because the rest of the world, the other continents, expect us to speak with a single voice, so that the Europe of cultural diversity, the example that others must follow, does not become scattered and lost in cacophony.
It is towards that end, ladies and gentlemen, that we should be working, and I should like to conclude, Madam President, by assuring you how pleased I am to have been able to benefit constantly from the unfailing support of the European Parliament.
That has helped me enormously, and the successes which have been obtained are also your successes.
Thank you very much; you have shown yourselves to be worthy of the cultural diversity of Europeans.
Â Â  . â Madam President, cultural diversity is a popular concept in the European Union.
Most of the time, however, we avoid the problem of cultural identity, because that is far more sensitive, certainly where definitions are concerned.
This is why I should like to talk about this.
Mrs Pretsâ report largely draws on my ideas and on those of other Members, and I should like to thank her for the way in which we have been able to work together.
I therefore endorse what both the rapporteur and Commissioner Reding have said in their fine speeches to this House.
My guiding principle is that respect for a community's cultural identity is a condition for peaceful coexistence. It is also a condition for the integration of people into another cultural community without this leading to frustration and alienation.
Anyone who fails to respect a personâs culture does not respect the person himself, does not invite mutual respect and does not show any signs of being prepared to engage in a cultural dialogue which, in a world of ever more far-reaching globalisation, is necessary for cultural development.
Striving towards maintaining one's own culture should therefore not lead to isolation, xenophobia or racism.
We should, however, be aware that the market will not rescue diversity.
This is why we need instruments and resources to retain diversity, as well as opportunities of establishing this retention of cultural identity.
Despite this, languages and cultures are disappearing very fast, and I am therefore delighted with the emphasis you have placed on this principle that should lead us, also for example in the contacts with the developing countries.
I am convinced that each community should have the opportunity of safeguarding its own culture against oppression, for example from language imperialism.
Respect for languages is one of the major assets in the enlargement of Europe, one that we have already had the pleasure of experiencing among ourselves.
Finally, I hope that the instruments that are being developed internationally, along with the instruments that you and the EU will be developing, will serve diversity and will facilitate cultural identity in the proper sense of the word.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Prets, I have listened quite carefully to what our Commissioner has said.
I am sorry, but I did not really hear the answer to the clear and precise questions contained in this report.
In paragraph 45, if I have understood it correctly, there is a question which is addressed directly to you, Commissioner, and that is whether or not you intend to send, on behalf of the Commission, a communication to the Council and to Parliament, which will relate specifically to a UNESCO convention on cultural diversity.
If I have understood you correctly, you spoke about this question at length but I did not learn whether or not Parliament can expect a communication from you.
If the answer is yes, can you tell me on what date, during the course of this year, you intend to send that communication?
There is a great deal one could say about cultural diversity and its importance.
This debate does not give us sufficient time.
It is significant that we should be discussing this subject at 11.50 p.m., Harold Macmillan â the British Prime Minister and grandfather of a current Member here â who, over forty years ago, applied for British membership of the European Union, said that when discussing those things that are precious to a people, you do not sell the family silver.
That clearly applies to cultural values.
The rapporteur is therefore correct to state that cultural products and services should not conform to the normal free market of commercial and trade options.
Can we trust our governments to preserve our national, European and regional cultures?
In my own country where, one might say, foreign languages are no longer taught, where history has become simply a background to current affairs and where Shakespeare is apparently too difficult for English students, those who say 'Yes, we may trust our governments to conserve our cultures' would perhaps be foolish.
The proposals that this should be agreed at international level are correct, but we should also address ourselves directly to our own peoples and our own students.
We have a great deal to fear from internationalisation, particularly of the television media.
I hope that Parliament will continue to make positive proposals which are accepted both by the Commission and the Council, but I await a specific reply from the Commissioner on the point I raised initially.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address one particular issue where there has so far been no protection of cultural diversity in the way this Parliament would wish, and where this situation is likely to continue.
I am referring to the concentration of electronic media, especially television, which, as we know, is the key medium influencing public opinion.
Protecting media diversity is also an important element in protecting cultural diversity and cultural identity.
We cannot leave the task of affording this protection to the European judicial system, gratifying though todayâs judgment by the Italian constitutional court may be.
My earnest expectation of the international legal instrument that we hope for is that it will establish conditions which genuinely help to promote diversity in the media.
Commissioner, you have been talking about battles and wars, and we have a major battle on our hands here.
Without wishing to play down your achievements in other areas, we have been left with no troops on this battlefield so far, and that creates a rather bitter after-taste.
Diversity of opinion and pluralism in the media are valuable assets and there are many positive examples of them in Europe, despite the growing threats facing us.
That is why Parliament has repeatedly, but sadly unsuccessfully, called for a directive to restrict media concentration for years.
I would like to reiterate this call today.
My group will therefore also be supporting a supplementary amendment by Mrs Fraisse, which sets out the arguments for this and which deserves the support of this House.
I hope that it will have the Commissionâs support as well.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Prets, on her report and also Mrs Maes, on the opinion she has produced on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
In Europe there is both unity and plurality, and it is in the field of culture that this plurality manifests itself in the clearest and most obvious way.
There is plurality at European level, but also within each European State; and often, these different cultures within the States transcend the borders which mark State territories.
In this regard, the existence of different languages in the States, as in the case of my mother tongue, Catalan, used by ten million people, is a manifestation of this plurality.
When we talk about cultural plurality, in cases where this culture also has a differentiated history, its own linguistic characteristics and a structural form of society, we are talking about stateless nations, a phenomenon which also exists in the European Union.
Furthermore, in many cases, these stateless nations are manifested through the existence, in this very House, of political parties which do not correspond to States, but rather to certain territories, and I am referring for example to the Scottish National Party, the Basque Nationalist Party and the party I belong to.
In this regard, I believe that the European Union must ensure recognition of this plurality within it.
Certain States, such as the Spanish State, recognise it through their official status, but this State recognition does not exist with reference to the European Union.
It is regrettable that the European Constitution has not made progress in this direction through progressive measures, as it has on other issues.
Plurality also implies the recognition of the existence of immigration in the European Union, which will be significant in the future.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I speak on the subject of cultural diversity, I do not think that my tone will be as optimistic as that of the first few speakers, in particular yours, Commissioner. There are several reasons for this.
The first reason is that, until a very short time ago, this convention, or this international instrument, was nothing more than a Utopian idea.
I remember organising, together with my group, a public hearing in the autumn of 2002, in order to launch this idea before Parliament.
I believe that we should be modest about this, and I would not say that this idea came from Europe and from the European Union.
It came from, among others, countries like Canada, and from countries throughout the world which have established links with certain European countries.
Therefore, though I can only applaud the fact that this Utopia is becoming a reality within the European Union, I do think that we should show a little more modesty.
If I call for modesty, it is because I would not like to see this future convention becoming merely the latest in a long line of declarations.
We know all about declarations in favour of cultural diversity. We can make them, but then we have to draw up a restrictive and legislative convention which makes it possible to settle differences in a context which is that of the market.
I would like to say that cultural diversity is also tied in with the question of the market.
We must not disguise the fact that combining cultural diversity and the market represents a considerable difficulty.
That is why, on this point too, I am modest and not always optimistic.
The third reason why I am not very optimistic is that I am not sure that we really are an example for others to follow, even if we like to think that we are.
Are we really agreed, within the European Union, that we want to promote cultural diversity and, if so, what diversity?
I think that if we look at the facts, we shall find it hard to be completely satisfied with ourselves.
Mrs Junker has mentioned several problems, as have other Members.
I think that we are confronted, right at the heart of Europe and not only outside it, with problems connected with the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity.
I would simply mention the question of the support provided by public State aids, for example, which as you all know is an element which is both provisory and derogatory, and which is in no way laid down in the logic, constitutional or otherwise, of the Treaties.
Cultural diversity is therefore a right, but it is a right that we have to construct, and not a simple right to culture, to education and so on. The right to cultural diversity does not yet exist and I only hope that we shall know how to construct it.
Â Â  Madam President, the world is not a commodity.
This anti-globalisation movement slogan could form the epigraph of our debate.
If the world is not to be a commodity, we must fight against the iron law of financially solvent supply and demand, which affects all aspects of life.
Fortunately, resistance against the disillusionment of the world is becoming organised.
Some of us will shortly be among those Members of this House who will be attending the World Social Forum.
Languages, cultures, collective identities and peoples have the indefeasible right to resist Mac World.
In this sense, the report which has been submitted to us is a step in the right direction because, for nature as well as for culture, diversity means life.
The constant springing forth of life must be preserved, encouraged and stimulated.
This will not be able to happen unless we respect the principle of the equality, before the law, of all languages and cultures.
I should like, in this House as in a court of law, to call as witnesses those venerable languages and cultures which even today are still the subject of discrimination, not only in their respective States but also in our European institutions.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of cultural diversity is one which we must constantly address.
In fact, we do not need to go as far as the WTO; in this Parliament, we have repeatedly debated whether culture and the market are compatible, for example on the issue of fixing of book pricing and on the issue of copyright, and we have seen that there are widely divergent views, not only within this House but also between this House and the Commission in some cases.
Within the Commission too, views have varied very widely, and I am referring especially to the previous Commission in this context.
Certainly, we battled out the issue with Commissioner van Miert on several occasions.
I believe that cultural diversity, as a sensible countermeasure to the melting pot, is an absolute necessity and I am most grateful to Mrs Prets for producing this very comprehensive and detailed report.
I also thank Commissioner Reding for providing such a detailed overview of the work from her own perspective and for pointing out that this House is and should remain the natural ally of the Commission and especially of Commissioner Reding herself.
I would like to thank Mrs Prets especially for stating, in paragraph 15, that this Parliament reaffirms its vigilance concerning the treatment of minority populations and minority languages, including indigenous languages, in the context of the enlarged Europe.
This should be made a condition if this House endorses this report.
I believe that in an enlarged Europe, this should apply not only to the enlargement countries but also to the current Member States.
There is undoubtedly a shortcoming here, in that in the cultural field â due to what is in my view the disastrous principle of unanimity â we have been unable to launch common policies to provide minority communities and languages with sensible options for their development.
Here, we have a core Europe comprising a number of countries such as Italy, where I come from, which have broken new ground, and I say this as a member of a minority which is not Italian by origin but a German-speaking Austrian minority in Italy.
There are other countries where this development has, unfortunately, been very sluggish, and I think that this effort and the abolition of the unanimity principle can achieve some progress here.
Above all, we must address the fears of those countries which have concerns.
I think that minorities and their cultures should be regarded as bridges and not as burdens â and this is where this report can make a contribution.
Â Â  â Madam President, much is spoken about preserving and enhancing European cultural heritage.
For cultures to really flourish we need concrete action as well as speeches.
I believe that the report by my colleague Mrs Prets will help us make some progress.
There should be support for the Convention on cultural diversity as proposed by UNESCOâs General Conference.
I think the rapporteurâs approach to examining culture as part of all the EUâs different policy areas is a welcome one.
This way of considering the matter should also be extended to practical action.
The Culture 2000 programme is the most conspicuous but by no means the only instrument.
Money is channelled from the Structural Funds to projects in the field of culture, but the take-up rate could be raised with more effective systems of information.
Internal market legislation has a partial impact on the mobility of cultural products, that is, arts and artists.
We still too often run into problems in this area especially as far as taxation is concerned.
The objective set at Lisbon regarding the European information society has brought a new dimension to the field of culture.
Technology offers more opportunities and tools, but they must be harnessed in the service of culture, not the other way round.
The European cultural networks are a key resource in the promotion of cultural diversity.
I hope that we will establish a legal basis to ensure they are properly funded as quickly as possible.
I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Prets, for her personal input to promote cultural diversity.
She has organised several workshops on European art this parliamentary term.
Â Â  Madam President, as our rapporteur rightly said it is difficult and even risky to define cultural diversity, almost like defining culture itself.
Nevertheless, the resolution, proposed precisely on the basis of a concept that is difficult and risky, does not hesitate, for a good 47 paragraphs, to claim to regulate, standardise and promote so-called cultural diversity, thus deluding itself, in the age of the Internet, that it can halt the liberalisation and globalisation of culture, information and knowledge.
In this way, after in the past having risked dying of nationalism, fascism and communism, today Europe risks dying of legalism.
The text of this resolution is a clear example of this.
Its contents challenge the principle of non-contradiction and even basic common sense and end up settling for vulgar hypocrisy.
It is furthermore hypocritical to consider each type of cultural product as equally worthy, not just of survival but also of being promoted, and equating liberal culture with authoritarian culture, the culture of infibulation with the culture of sexual equality, the culture of tolerance with that of racism and anti-Semitism.
In truth, the contradictions in this resolution reflect those in our policy, which looks for allies in the developing world to protect it and to protect itself from the intrusiveness of the American audiovisual sector, in the name of respect for cultural diversity, subject then to fully financing, for example, French-speaking Africa; the culture which, in the name of assimilation, banned the veil and other religious signs in school classrooms, and which does not, however, object at all to them being imposed in an authoritarian manner in other countries; the culture that praises European democracy, even when it is noticeably absent, and claims in a racist manner, however, that the developing world is not ready for it; the culture that refuses to âexportâ freedom does not hesitate to collaborate with dictators and tyrants, today ignoring the fight of Islamic dissidents, as in the past it ignored communist dissidents from Eastern Europe.
In all this I do not see a fairer, more respectful choice to protect the heritage of the people of Europe and of the world but rather shapeless, hypocritical, and conflicting protectionism that protects the intellectual, national and regional elites, against the dynamism and the cultural conflict which, in its substance, is always ...
Â Â  Madam President, it would seem from the report that cultureâs enemy is the liberalisation of the markets and the World Trade Organisation and that individual States are the bastion of culture or cultures.
This is not the case: individual States and nationalist ideologies were the ones that wiped out cultures and people in the past.
Commissioner Reding, China has carried out the worst cases of genocide of people and of culture and continues to do so: the Tibetan people and their culture, the Uighur people and their culture.
China cannot be held up in this Chamber as an example of fruitful cooperation for cultural diversity, at least if we are using the old idea of the Cultural Revolution as a reference for the word âculturalâ.
Cultural diversity is not, in the abstract, a right; it can, of course, also be the result of rules, but of rules that must be based on the freedom of communication and of expression and not on protectionismÂ âÂ protectionism or State handouts for cultureÂ âÂ on the cultural relativism of individual States.
We do, of course, want these rules, in particular to counter the destruction of languages, but the policy of teaching only one foreign language in the Member States and the rules governing the European institutions run counter to the spirit of diversity called for in the resolution: European institutions with monolingual or bilingual agencies that publish public reports without even producing them in the official languages of the European Union.
In the explanation of vote we, the radical Members, will refer to our proposals on the Monitoring centre for linguistic policies to promote the international language Esperanto, for the right to free and non-discriminatory international communication, to preserve and maintain linguistic diversity.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for all her efforts in favour of European culture and the rapporteur, Mrs Prets, for the work she has done and above all for dealing with the many amendments.
My country, Spain, is a country with great cultural diversity and wealth and we are naturally entirely in favour of cultural diversity.
Nevertheless, I would like to say that we would have liked the report, rather than referring to non-uniform cultural identities, to have referred to the plurality of cultural identities in the European Union.
The focus used seems to us, in general, to be rather negative.
And the reality is that, in many countries of Europe, cultural identities are not uniform, precisely because they are plural and we must not forget that this is one of our great assets.
We must not forget that the right of each Member State to define, apply and adapt its cultural policies is subject to national legislation and, therefore, this must be done in accordance with their respective national legislations.
I would like to say finally that, given that there are differing positions and concerns with regard to this issue in the European Union, I believe it would be correct for us to leave it in the hands of Unesco as well.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like firstly, of course, to congratulate the rapporteur on her initiative, and also congratulate the Commissioner on her speech â and I have taken the liberty of taking some notes on her speech, which I will quote from her when talking about cultural diversity on other occasions.
I am speaking in this Chamber as a Spaniard, as a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and as a Basque.
I come from a country in which we have our own language, a native language in addition to Castilian, which is Basque, and which has a culture that goes back millennia, as does our language.
I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of preserving linguistic diversity.
I also agree that we must monitor the treatment of minority languages, including autochthonous languages.
In an increasingly united Europe, in an increasingly globalised world, we must pay special attention to cultural diversity.
The wealth of Europe â and what differentiates us from other regions of the world, as the Commissioner has said â undoubtedly lies in our cultural diversity, and we must try to export that model.
We must prevent the Union from becoming a means for standardisation, and I would like to point out that the preamble to the draft Constitution spoke of a âEurope united in diversityâ.
Nevertheless, we must prevent the appropriation of cultural and linguistic diversity for political purposes.
We must not accept the idea that the defence of language or culture, which belongs to all of us, can be used as a political weapon, a missile, or even a means for possible discrimination or division between us.
Neither language nor the defence of language can be a reason for discrimination.
Let us remember that this aspect is taken up in the draft Constitution.
We must respect cultural and linguistic diversity, it is true, but we must not impose it.
Respect for diversity also consists of respecting those people who speak another language.
Euskera must be preserved in the Basque Country, without question, but we must not impose it or discriminate against those who do not speak it.
Certain nationalist parties who have tried to use language as a political tool have moved on from racial nationalism to linguistic nationalism.
I believe that culture is the inheritance of all of us, we must all defend it and nobody must appropriate it for themselves.
Please allow me to end by quoting from the preamble to the Constitution which reads, âwhile remaining proud of their own national identities and history, the peoples of Europe are determined to transcend their ancient divisions and, united ever more closely, to forge a common destinyâ.
Â Â  Madam President, you will understand that, owing to the shortage of combatants in the plenary session, I shall not reply to all those who â and at a quarter past midnight I can well understand why â have left the House.
I would still like, however, to say a few words which I have set my heart on.
It is as a Luxembourg woman that I am speaking to you, and it was this Luxembourg woman who developed, with you, the European Year of Languages, of all languages without exception, whether recognised languages, non-recognised languages, majority languages or minority languages, because I have always maintained that there are no great languages and minor languages: there are only maternal languages and they are all, by definition, great.
We are going to continue in that direction.
We have drawn up our action plan on languages on the basis of this multilingualism, quite rightly, and let me tell you that multilingualism includes those of our languages which are not official, but it certainly does not include Esperanto, because we have enough living languages in difficulty without creating, in addition, artificial languages.
Therefore, let us teach languages to our children, and on this point I am happy to see that almost all â in fact I would say all â our education ministers are making an effort, and some of them are starting from scratch.
They are making an effort to introduce languages into primary education.
In the last two years enormous progress has been made.
We still have a long way to go, but we are moving forward, and at least those ministers who are not making an effort have a guilty conscience.
It is up to you, Members of the European Parliament, to continue to give them a guilty conscience, so that reforms are implemented at local, regional and national level.
In addition, the Commissioner repeats to every minister he sees that continued multilingualism in Europe is a matter of survival.
For now, I should like to reply to certain specific questions, even though those Members who asked them are no longer in the House.
On the question of UNESCO and our allies, it is clear that, in UNESCO, we need all the countries in order to constitute a majority to adopt a convention on cultural diversity. We also need, at worldwide level, to serve as an example of cultural diversity.
What we are trying to do then â and we are succeeding, by serving as an example and insisting on respect for minorities â is to bring about changes in attitude, particularly in those countries â and some of them have been mentioned â which are very far from being perfect, and we all know who they are.
You know this, you who are Members of the European Parliament, because you discuss the matter constantly, but we can only help these minorities by taking them with us and telling them that we will not allow them to be left aside, not by building a wall between those who are right and those who are wrong.
I should like to give you a very specific example, Last May, for the first time we opened the Cannes Film Festival with European Cinema Day.
Twenty-five ministers, proud of their national film industries, accompanied by young, well-known producers, showed the world how much importance they attach to the cinema.
In the afternoon of European Cinema Day, we and our partners worldwide organised a conference on world cinemas, so as to allow those whose voices are not usually heard to make them heard, and to give an opportunity to minority cinemas which, without the aid of Europe, would never have had a chance to express themselves.
That is how European policy should be.
It is a policy which sets an example and which demonstrates our unique model.
I shall now answer Mr Beazleyâs question, which was very specific. He asked whether we were going to draw up a communication concerning UNESCO.
Mr Beazley, I do not know whether you noticed, but in August the Commission, as far as I know for the first time in the history of the European Union, published a communication about UNESCO, which served as a way of moving things forward.
We have now won a battle.
I say âbattleâ because the war is not over yet.
The groups are hoping â and the first of them has already begun meetings â that there will now be discussions at UNESCO level.
I believe that international negotiations, in the true meaning of the term, will be able to commence either at the end of 2004 or at the beginning of 2005.
It will be at that moment, when we have the beginnings of a text, that we shall be able to define what Europe is seeking to obtain in the context of those negotiations.
It is not enough to issue a communication every three months. That would not achieve anything.
I am a supporter of what the Germans call , which means that I want to take measures which will produce results.
Our communication of last summer enabled us to get things up and running and to demonstrate that Europe was participating in the drawing up of an international instrument.
Now, as soon as discussions have produced their initial results, we shall explain what we want the main thrust of the debate to be.
Let us, therefore, be efficient and not militant merely for the sake of being militant.
I am sorry to have to say to Mrs Junker that, as far as media concentration is concerned, we may be starting off from the same idea, but we are also taking as our basis the same Treaty.
That Treaty prevents the Commission from proposing any instrument for harmonisation, preservation of diversity or pluralism in the media.
The Treaty being what it is and the Commission being the guardian of the Treaties, I cannot do any better than that.
I would never obtain the sustained approval of the Commission if I stray from the Treaty.
We can only hope, Mrs Junker, that the new Treaty, as many Members have clearly said, will contain much stronger elements regarding such diversity in all its aspects, because it is multiform.
It is concerned not only with dancing and the arts, but also â and above all â with language, minorities, the cinema and pluralism of expression, in other words the media and audiovisual technology.
This is why I would like to see the new Treaty provide more opportunities for representatives of the people first of all, but also for the Commissionâs initiative which is intended to take a further step forward.
It is said that the world is not a commodity, and that is even more true of culture.
On this point, I believe that the Commission, by its action, has very clearly demonstrated, not only at the level of external trade but also at the level of authorising national aids, for example, for the cinema and for public television stations and so on, that it is not prepared to accept that culture should be regarded as a commodity.
However, even though it is not a commodity, culture has its price, and we must pay it.
It is up to us, therefore, to convince national governments and to make it possible for Europe to be able to invest sufficient resources to ensure that these cultures survive.
It must be possible for Europe to serve as a living example to the eyes of the world, so that we can change that world, because, even though what we experience regarding diversity and respect for others is not perfect, our example is still of value.
Let us show the way, and the world will be a better place for it.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(1)
Â Â  . â I come from a country, Flanders, whose culture was crippled for decades because of domination by Belgian French-speakers.
Even today, the Dutch culture and language, particularly in the Flemish periphery around Brussels, is treated with disdain by the numerically dominant French-speaking minority.
Even within the EU, Dutch is at times ignored; it has, for example, disappeared as a working language within such institutions as the European trademarks bureau.
I am therefore well placed to know that European institutions are guilty themselves when there is talk of not respecting cultural diversity or when it is stated that linguistic diversity should also be respected.
This report, which contains a huge number of praiseworthy recommendations, has come none too soon, and I do indeed hope that the good intentions, following the enlargement of the EU, to protect all languages that are spoken in a Europe with 25 Member States, will this time not remain an empty promise.
I stress that even minority languages, such as Welsh and Breton deserve to be fostered with European support.
Europe should, where culture is concerned, put its own house in order first before seeking to take the moral high ground on behalf of the entire world.
Colleagues, it gives me great pleasure today to welcome to the European Parliament in Strasbourg the President of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, Mr MaroviÄ.
Mr President, you have come to the European Parliament at a crucial time in the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro and the European Union â and indeed, in some senses, at a defining time for Serbia and Montenegro themselves.The new Union, soon to be made up of 25 Member States, has been looking forward with hope and expectation at the process of reform and change in your country and in the wider region over the past few years.
We have also looked with sadness and deep concern at the despicable murder of Zoran DjindjiÄ last year.
It was a dark moment that brought with it, once again, the realisation that we cannot, as democrats, take for granted the real progress that has been and needs to be made in Serbia and Montenegro and in the wider region, and which recalls to us the duty of care to engage with each other and to underpin the forces of change, reform and democracy.
For that reason we, in the European Parliament, hope that the results of the recent elections in Serbia will not lead to a resurgence of the kind of nationalism that has had such tragic consequences for the region.I welcome you today as a leader whose words and deeds give us grounds for optimism.
You, Mr President, have symbolised in many ways the best of what we hope for in your region.
Your recent acts of reconciliation, which you initiated, first between yourself and the President of Croatia and then, in November, between yourself and the President of Bosnia-Herzegovina, are commendable acts of reconciliation.
Those powerful acts are quintessentially European.
They recall to us the words of one of our founding fathers, Robert Schuman, when he spoke of the power of creative reconciliation.
We need such ideas, and such men and women of political vision and courage, in the Western Balkans today.
I thank you for the leadership that you have shown in this regard.It is important that we now develop, beyond declarations and conclusions of Council summit meetings, the practical benchmarking of democratic progress between the European Union and the states of your region.Mr President, through you we want to say to the peoples of Serbia and Montenegro â and more broadly to the peoples of the Western Balkans â that we, in this Parliament, are prepared to travel that road with you.
It is not a road that you should feel the need to walk alone.It is my pleasure to invite you to address the European Parliament.
Â Â  (1). Mr President, honourable Members, it is my honour to address you at the start of this year when we expect to witness a further acceleration of our with European structures.
I sincerely believe that the upcoming political dialogues and finalisation of the feasibility study will be yet another major step towards the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement of our State Union with the European Union.
This will be of critical importance.
Without a favourable assessment in the feasibility study and accelerated work to conclude Serbia and Montenegro's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union, the process of Europeanisation and the progress necessary to guarantee a better life for all will be slowed down.
This is why we expect and call on all in the European Union to resume together the implementation of the tasks of accelerating Europeanisation with even more enthusiasm, not only for the sake of the European future of Serbia and Montenegro, but in equal measure for the sake of the vitally important security, stability and progress of the entire Western Balkans region.
In this process, the role and the importance of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro is of outstanding importance, not only for geo-strategic or security reasons, but even more because of the further promotion of democratic and European standards in the approach to the resolution of the remaining outstanding issues of this region on European integration, among which the issue of Kosovo is, certainly, of particular importance.
Dialogue and only dialogue, along with respect for UN resolutions and the active role and responsibility of the international community may eliminate the threat of ethnic tension and pressures, particularly on the non-Albanian population.
Serbia and Montenegro support the Standards Before Status policy, for it is only a multi-ethnic Kosovo, a Kosovo safe and free for all those wishing to return and live there, a Kosovo of European standards, that can become the realm of prospects and progress for all its citizens.
Throughout history the Balkans have often paid the tragic price of intolerance.
It was primarily the citizens and the peoples living in these parts that were the victims of such a policy.
Today, I am sure, we have all become more mature and realise that the way to the modern, developed and democratic world for all the nations in the Western Balkans may only be through political dialogue, compromise and negotiation.
Radicalisation trends take us backwards.
Agreement and dialogue alone open up prospects of a tolerant, multi-ethnic, multi-confessional, stable European society.
That is our vision, our political goal and our hope.
The representatives of the European Union that will be visiting our country in a few days' time will have the opportunity to witness the fact that the process of reforms in the transition of Serbia and Montenegro has not been halted, even though last year was one of huge political challenges, globally, regionally and at home.
I shall recall that the assassination of the Prime Minister of Serbia, Zoran DjindjiÄ, according to the opinion of many, with all its tragic consequences, was primarily aimed at thwarting the effective setting-up of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and at causing a general destabilisation of the region.
Our country has also resisted this type of challenge.
Security has been maintained and not only has the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro been formed, but it has also become a member of the Council of Europe and an equal participant in the European integration processes.
I do not hide the fact that we had expected to make more rapid, more intensive progress as regards joining Europe, and in particular perhaps to encounter higher levels of understanding.
Indeed, it is also possible that Europe expected more.
I do not doubt, however, that the desire for our country to join the greater European democratic family is mutual.
This being the case, it is up to both us and Europe to see where we have made mistakes, to avoid making more mistakes in the future and to do our utmost to achieve our common goal that quite certainly takes Serbia and Montenegro, and the Western Balkans, towards the promotion of European life and values.
Quite openly, our main mistake is that we were sometimes late.
On the other hand, the response of the world, or to be more precise, the response of certain institutions, was sometimes rash, or very difficult to understand for our general democratic public.
Many global analysts did not fail to notice this, mentioning numerous adverse consequences that threatened to slow down the reform-related and democratic steps taken by our State Union, particularly the last four indictments issued prior to the elections in Serbia by the Hague Tribunal.
It is difficult to bear the brunt of doubt that you are not cooperating with the Hague Tribunal in the way people at The Hague wish, despite the obvious results achieved in that field.
It is also difficult to be under pressure from some citizens who often see this cooperation with ICTY â based on the implementation of the Law on Cooperation with ICTY passed by the State Union Parliament â as being excessive on the part of the democratic authorities of Serbia and Montenegro, and to the detriment of its own citizens.
I wish to assure you that we wish to cooperate with The Hague in the future in line with the commitments made, the adopted international instruments and our national laws.
We also expect to meet with the understanding of the international and national public in this task, and to have their cooperation.
This will be yet another confirmation of our sincere commitment and belonging to the values of the civilised and democratic world that you promote in this august House.
We do not wish to be the hostages of the past, or of The Hague, or of the generals.
We agree only to be the hostages of our future for the sake of our posterity, the generations that wish to live equally and together with their peers in Europe and the rest of the world.
Wishing to stabilise political conditions, Serbia recently held early parliamentary elections.
The majority of citizens gave their support to the democratic forces.
No matter how the outcome of these elections is commented upon, it is a fact that the democratic forces won over 60% of the votes cast, and, moreover, it happened now: not in a fight against MiloseviÄ, but in the fight for a democratic and European future for Serbia and Montenegro.
This is not a time of further radicalisation, but a time when we in Serbia and in Montenegro have to do everything in our power to broaden, to the maximum extent possible, the national consensus concerning the European and development priorities of Serbia and Montenegro.
The democratic forces are already guided by this need.
They are currently working, as you are aware, to form a new democratic government, which will make it possible to carry on with democratic, reform-oriented and pro-European processes throughout the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.
A great deal has been done at the political and economic level in the past.
This is borne out by the fact that, even in this distinctive political vacuum, not only has there been no monetary instability, but on the contrary, several major capital investment contracts have been concluded with well-known corporations in the world.
Serbia and Montenegro have continued to implement the action plan for the harmonisation of the economic systems of Serbia and Montenegro, and to Mr Patten, I wish to say that yes, we still have outstanding issues, but we positively wish to finalise the Feasibility Study for negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union.
Reforms in the field of education have also been carried out in the proper way so that our country is now a signatory of the Bologna Declaration.
There is full support for our reforms in the judiciary.
There is full cooperation in the fight against organised crime, and this is also in evidence at the trials that have commenced before the Special Court for Organised Crime.
As you are aware, a special court has been established for war crimes as well and we expect that it too will soon try cases referred or to be referred to the national judiciary by the Hague Tribunal.
Reforms of the armed forces have been carried out.
Full democratic and civil control of the military has also been introduced.
The length of military service has been shortened and the border demilitarisation process has been initiated.
We expect that early this year Serbia and Montenegro will finally be admitted to the Partnership for Peace Programme.
As regards the region, mutual apologies mentioned by the distinguished President of your Parliament, Mr Cox, for crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, were not only empty words.
We continued strengthening regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations by introducing a more liberal visa regime.
Serbia and Montenegro have abolished visas previously required to enter over 40 countries.
We created conditions for the return of refugees and IDPs, and achieved further concrete, economic and cultural cooperation.
However, apologies are about the need to fully, sincerely, and responsibly face up to one's past.
It is only in this way that we can move forward.
Ideal and innocent people walk the skies.
As sinful people walking the earth, we must have the courage to recognise our mistakes as such, rectify them and forge new relations.
The delusions of the past have punished many nations in the Balkans swept by the violent winds of history.
There are almost 650Â 000 refugees and IDPs currently residing in Serbia and Montenegro, mostly Serbs from Krajina, Bosnia and Kosovo.
This speaks volumes about the sacrifices those people were forced to make by politics that pushed national wishes in front of reality.
Every policy that only pursues its own wishes and does not recognise the realism of a realistic, modern and political resolution of outstanding issues is a blind policy.
The citizens of Serbia and Montenegro, therefore, as victims of a period of their past and such a policy, rightfully expect today an understanding and an apology for all that they were forced to live through in that period of delusion and hope.
It is a delusion that it is possible to live alone, without cooperation with Europe and the world, without promoting historical friendship ties and without forging a common, stable, prosperous, democratic and European future for all its nations and states.
This feeling of understanding and apology is something that I carry deep in my bosom as President of Serbia and Montenegro and I also expect to encounter such understanding from all our friends.
I am saying this because the Belgrade Agreement has yielded positive results.
The Belgrade Agreement, forged by a democratic agreement reached by Serbia and Montenegro with the assistance of the European Union, has resulted in the present good relations between Serbia and Montenegro, rather than relations marked by a lack of understanding and by conflict.
At present we use dialogue to reach agreement on issues of common concern regarding the State Union, without outvoting and jeopardising the autonomy of either State.
Our institutions are increasingly assuming full responsibility for consistent implementation of the Constitutional Charter.
These activities, together with the efforts of the State governments, have brought Serbia and Montenegro closer today than ever before to Europe and European integration processes.
This is one of the most important goals of the State Union's operation under the Belgrade Agreement and the Constitutional Charter.
As the President of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, I am convinced that the signing of the Belgrade Agreement and the Constitutional Charter on the new State Union of Serbia and Montenegro was a good choice under the given conditions, and that it is our task now at all levels to perform our duties responsibly and effectively in accordance with the responsibilities assumed.
The economic and political support promised by Europe will surely contribute to this to the largest possible extent.
The experiences from the former Yugoslavia and from the world have shown that â to use the modern political jargon â the carrot is always more efficient than the stick.
We are even ready to have Europe set, for each of its concrete incentives, a deadline within which its expectations are to be met.
It is this type of stimulus and encouragement that we look forward to receiving from the European Union, particularly with regard to the drawing-up of the Feasibility Study.
This is why I am confident that if the results of the study are positive, and if the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is concluded in time, this will ensure that Serbia and Montenegro will travel the road to European integration.
We are all working sincerely and assiduously towards a situation in which we share the common values of a peaceful, democratic and civilised world.
I salute you on behalf of Serbia and Montenegro: its citizens, its hopes and its expectations for the life we would like to share with the countries in the region and with all the nations of Europe.
Â Â  I should like to thank you, President MaroviÄ, for addressing our House today and for bringing to this Parliament a message of European perspective and engagement on your part.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the Council statement on the programme of the Irish presidency.
For reasons which I know you will understand, I am especially pleased today to be able to give the floor to An Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, on behalf of the Council.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is both an honour and a pleasure to be here today to present to you the priorities for the Irish presidency.
Before I make this presentation, may I thank you for the reception you gave the President of Ireland, Mrs Mary McAleese, during her visit last November.
Your warm welcome to her was greatly appreciated in Ireland.
We have chosen 'Europeans â Working Together' as the theme of our presidency.
It is a theme which captures a vision of the people of the European Union working as a partnership, striving together to achieve our common goals and objectives.
We need the cooperation of everybody to achieve our ambitions.
I know that I can count on the Members of the European Parliament to work with us during our term for the greater good of the European Union.
This is Irelandâs sixth presidency.
We are taking on our task at an historic and challenging time, but we have prepared well for what lies ahead.
The overriding objective of our presidency is to secure outcomes which have a positive impact on the lives of Europeâs people.
Like every presidency, we aim to write another chapter in the success story that is the European Union.
This task deserves our full attention and we each have a part to play.
Parliament is unique among the institutions in having a direct mandate from the people.
It is central to an effective Union which is successful and which delivers.
It goes without saying that a good relationship between the Council and Parliament is vital to the Unionâs success.
The elections in June mean that the time in which we can work together will be shorter than usual.
As a presidency, therefore, we are totally committed to working intensively with Parliament at all levels so that our interaction is as constructive and productive as it can be.
President Pat Cox â of whose leadership of Parliament we in Ireland are enormously proud â has assured me that you stand ready to play your full part.
There is important work to be done.
As Europeans working together, we must ensure that the Union can take advantage of the global economic recovery.
We must create an environment which fosters more and better jobs for our people.
We must take the measures necessary to allow our citizens to live and move freely throughout the European Union in safety and security.
And we must ensure that the Union can play a positive and constructive role in the world.
The Irish presidency is the first to see the full implementation of the Seville European Council decisions aimed at ensuring a more coherent and strategic approach to our work.
Our programme is, therefore, consistent with and reflects the priorities in the annual Operational Programme for 2004, prepared with the future Dutch presidency.
It is also consistent with the Multiannual Strategic Programme for 2004-2006.
The preparation of the annual and multiannual programmes with the Netherlands and with the four presidencies to follow has been both an innovation and a practical example of 'Europeans â Working Together'.
This is a time of historic change for the Union.
We must be prepared for the future.
We want a Union that is more democratic, more accountable, more transparent and more effective.
We must ensure that the Union is, and is seen to be, as close as possible to its citizens.
A new constitution is fundamental to this.
The European Convention did outstanding work in bringing forward an excellent draft text.
I pay warm tribute to all who contributed to its proceedings.
In particular, I pay tribute to the representatives of the European Parliament who brought to the Convention not only great vitality, but also great insight.
I fully understand the importance Parliament attaches to bringing the constitutional project to a successful and early conclusion.
In my contacts with many of you here in Parliament since the Brussels European Council, we have made clear our strong support for a speedy and successful outcome to the Intergovernmental Conference.
You may rest assured that I have heard that message and I share your view.
I thank the Italian presidency for the good work it did during its term, and I want to thank it for the support and assistance it has given to our presidency.
We all hoped that agreement could be reached last month and were disappointed when it was not.
It now falls to Ireland to try to make further progress.
We have taken up this challenge and we will do all in our power to see it through.
We are determined to do whatever we can to encourage and facilitate the earliest possible agreement.
It remains to be seen whether this will prove possible in our presidency.
We know what the outstanding issues are.
Various possible solutions have been proposed.
But ultimately, if we are to arrive at the necessary compromises, what is needed is sufficient collective political will.
I am convinced that this is profoundly in the interests of the Union and its citizens, and indeed of the Member States individually â new and old, large and small.
A new constitution would help the Union respond to the demands and expectations of its citizens.
It would help the Union play a more coherent and effective role in the wider world.
On the other hand, excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing.
Stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate.
I have undertaken to consult intensely and to make a report to the March European Council.
That process of consultation is well under way.
I have spoken to many of my colleagues in the European Council already.
All of them have indicated their commitment to helping us find a way forward.
I will continue to explore with them how and when this can be achieved.
I want to be able to make the fullest possible report in March.
I can assure Parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement, I will immediately move to seize the opportunity.
I pledge to you again that the Irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office.
This issue will command the highest priority under our presidency.
The negotiations on the future financial perspectives will be critically important for the future shape and direction of the enlarged Union.
We also look forward to initiating discussions once the Commission communication is tabled later this month.
Our aim as the presidency will be to seek initial reactions from Member States and we will be working to secure agreement at the Spring European Council on the calendar and process for the negotiations.
The Irish presidency has begun in a Union of 15 Member States and will end in a Union of 25.
It is a particular privilege to hold the presidency at a time when history is being made.
We greatly look forward to welcoming the new members of the family at an official ceremony in Dublin on 1 May.
We plan to make this a real welcome in Ireland.
Community cultural events are being organised and real local involvement and international exchange will occur.
We believe that the diversity of Europeâs cultural heritage is something to be shared and celebrated.
We want the formal enlargement of the European Union to be as smooth and successful as possible.
Making enlargement work is of the greatest possible importance to us.
Integrating the new Member States and ensuring that the Council continues to function effectively will be a high priority.
We will press forward with the future enlargement agenda.
We will prioritise work in relation to Romania and Bulgaria with the aim of concluding negotiations this year.
We also welcome Turkeyâs efforts to fulfil the necessary criteria with a view to a decision to be taken at the European Council next December.
I am convinced that the accession of Cyprus continues to provide the context for a comprehensive settlement, which would enable the accession of a united island on 1 May.
We welcome the signs of progress in recent days.
As the presidency, we will support fully the central role of the United Nations Secretary-General in this process.
I urge all parties in the period ahead to demonstrate conclusively their commitment to negotiating a settlement on the basis of his proposals.
The newly enlarged Union must work for all its people.
That is why the Irish presidency has placed sustainable growth and social cohesion at the very centre of its work programme.
Four years ago in Lisbon, we agreed on the goal of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
The Lisbon Agenda is the best mechanism for achieving this goal in a demanding and competitive global context.
It is the means by which the Member States and the European institutions can work together to develop the European economy, to create more employment, to ensure social protection and to invest in a sustainable future for us all.
Next year, we will be half way towards the 2010 target date set at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000.
We have achieved a great deal already.
We have seen advances in the areas of research and development, financial services, liberalisation of energy markets, telecommunications, environmental protection and regulatory reform.
It is now much easier for workers and students to move around the European Union, to access jobs and education; it is easier to set up and run a small business; consumers are already enjoying cheaper telephone calls; significant studies have been made in terms of equality and social protection.
And Europeâs commitment to the environment means a cleaner and safer world for our children and our grandchildren.
Despite these achievements, it is increasingly clear that unless we increase momentum, we will not make Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.
We intend to use the Spring European Council this year to give renewed focus and impetus to the Lisbon Agenda.
We look forward in this context to the publication next week of the Commission's report on the Spring European Council.
Positive signs of economic progress are emerging, both in Europe and internationally.
It is imperative that we make the most of this.
We must increase our efforts to implement at individual Member State level those reforms and legislative changes already agreed, if we are to reap the full social and economic benefits.
We must also continue to implement further reforms.
Maintaining the will not improve Europe's economic standing, competitiveness or employment rates.
I have written to you, Mr President, and to my colleagues in the European Council, setting out my proposed approach and the key elements of the Lisbon Agenda, on which I intend to focus at the Spring European Council.
Our primary focus is clear: sustainable growth and high-quality employment are our twin priorities.
It is my intention that, during the Spring European Council, we will have a real debate on the most pressing economic and social challenges facing Europe.
Investment in physical and human capital, supporting higher rates of growth across the European Union economy and, equally, continuing to maintain macroeconomic stability are just some of the challenges.
A central challenge facing Europe continues to be competitiveness.
While the internal market has indeed been one of the Unionâs most important achievements, we see the further development of the services sector as the key motor of growth and job creation.
Perhaps the greatest challenge facing Europe, however, is the pressing need to create more and better employment.
We welcome the focus and the practical, country-specific messages in the report of the Employment Taskforce which was chaired by Mr Wim Kok.
Building on the employment guidelines, we will work with our European partners, Parliament and the Commission, to ensure that real progress is made.
Social dialogue will greatly assist us in addressing these challenges.
During our presidency, I look forward to working with the European social partners, through the Tripartite Social Summit in March and in other ways, to boost their involvement in achieving the overall Lisbon goal.
Before leaving the Lisbon Agenda, I also want to point out that 2005 will offer a unique opportunity for a mid-point review of the overall process.
How to stay on course to realise the Lisbon goal in the new climate represents a very considerable challenge.
The Irish presidency will contribute to the process of setting up a meaningful evaluation of the Agenda, in cooperation with our partners, including the incoming presidency.
Over the past 50 years, we in Europe have created an area of peace and prosperity.
We have also created a single market where our people can trade and do business without barriers.
We must ensure that the freedoms we enjoy are not exploited by criminal elements for illegal gains.
As a presidency, Ireland will work for the greatest levels of freedom, security and safety for all the people of the European Union.
In the justice and home affairs area, we will focus on the delivery of the outstanding requirements under the Amsterdam Treaty and the broader Tampere programme, as updated by subsequent European Councils.
This will involve a wide-ranging agenda including asylum, immigration, police, judicial cooperation in criminal matters and civil law cooperation.
The June European Council is likely to initiate an assessment of the achievements of the Tampere programme, with a view to launching a further development of the Unionâs justice and home affairs policies.
We will also focus on practical police cooperation.
We will place emphasis on the fight against drugs and organised crime and on combating illegal immigration.
The range of foreign policy issues that the Union now deals with and the breadth and intensity of the Unionâs contacts with its partners around the globe is truly extensive.
The European Union is, in every sense, a global player.
During our presidency, we will focus on a number of key areas, as well as ensuring the effective conduct of the Unionâs international commitments.
We are committed to working ever more closely with the United Nations.
We want in particular to support the UN Secretary-General's reform effort and will work to shape a positive and progressive European Union input into the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.
I welcome Parliament's decision to award the Sakharov Prize to the Secretary-General of the UN.
Mr Kofi Annan's participation in the plenary session of the European Parliament later this month sends out a clear message.
That message is that effective multilateralism is a core value which informs the Unionâs foreign policy.
The Council will be represented by Foreign Minister Cowen on this important occasion.
We will also work to advance EU-UN cooperation in crisis management.
The European Union and the United Nations are natural partners.
Under the Italian presidency, the Union signed a declaration with the UN on cooperation in crisis management.
The challenge for our presidency is to put this declaration into practice.
European Security and Defence Policy is how the Union's contribution to conflict prevention and crisis management.
As a presidency, we will also progress work on the Union's crisis management capabilities.
Europe will work with the world community to fight the spread of weapons of mass destruction and to promote disarmament.
Our presidency will be practical and imaginative in promoting human rights around the globe.
During our presidency, we will adopt the EU guidelines to support human rights defenders.
We also intend to implement the EUÂŽs Strategy on Children in Armed Conflict.
Last year saw serious tensions and disagreement over Iraq, both across the Atlantic and indeed within Europe.
The world is a better and a safer place when the European Union and the United States work together, pooling their considerable energy and resources to achieve our shared goals based on our shared values.
The United States has stressed the importance it attaches to working with key partners, including Europe.
We will continue to focus EU-US relations on what we can and should achieve together.
Our aim will be to consult and cooperate with the United States on the broad range of issues, both political and economic, that face us all.
We intend to work particularly closely with the United States on areas such as the Middle East, Iraq, Afghanistan and effective multilateralism, as well as on the extensive trade and economic agenda.
We will not always see eye to eye, but we can and should concentrate on those areas where our cooperation is to the mutual benefit of our citizens and the wider international community.
The European Union values its relationship with the Americas as a whole.
This is reflected in the fact that the European Union will have summit meetings with the US, with Canada, with Latin American and Caribbean countries during our presidency.
These meetings will provide key opportunities to strengthen our relationships.
In the Middle East, we will continue to promote the implementation of the roadmap as the basis for progress towards a just and lasting two-state solution.
Our participation in the Quartet will be based on this principle and we will work closely with our partners in an effort to move the peace process forward.
Irelandâs Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Brian Cowen, in his capacity as President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, travels to the Middle East this evening.
Enlargement gives renewed impetus to the Unionâs strategic relationship with Russia.
Our security and well-being are increasingly intertwined and we need to work effectively together.
The EU-Russia Summit during our presidency is an opportunity to set a course for our future relationship.
In the conflict prevention area, we want to focus, in particular, on the role of non-governmental organisations and civil society in conflict prevention.
We also want to integrate support for conflict prevention into our engagement and dialogue with the rest of the world.
This is particularly relevant in the case of Africa.
There are 290 million people living below the poverty line in sub-Saharan Africa.
An estimated 30 million are infected with HIV/AIDS.
Over a dozen conflict situations make this humanitarian crisis even worse.
We must work with our African partners to find comprehensive solutions to these problems.
Our overriding approach as a presidency will be to support African-led initiatives to tackle the enormous challenges the continent faces.
I would like to see greater convergence between foreign and development policy and this will form part of our approach as a presidency.
The Union has a critical role to play in responding to major developing challenges such as poverty alleviation, the fight against infectious diseases and environmental degradation.
The Union must set an example in relation to the progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and the creation of a fairer and more stable world order.
We also need to extend to our near neighbours the conditions of security, stability and prosperity that we enjoy in the European Union.
After enlargement on 1 May, there will be 385 million people living in the countries on the external land and sea borders of the Union.
Through our European neighbourhood initiative, we will enhance relations with those countries to the east and south on the basis of the values of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.
The Union has reached a shared understanding with the countries of the Western Balkans that their future lies within the European Union.
As a presidency, we are committed to the full implementation of the agenda agreed last June at the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki.
The rate at which progress is made now depends on the democratically elected governments of the region.
The Union will strongly support their efforts as they pursue wide-ranging and difficult reforms.
We are also committed to a multilateral approach to trade policy.
Since Cancun, the European Union has been reflecting on the way forward in order to achieve a successful relaunch of the Doha Development Agenda.
A successful conclusion to the current round of trade talks is vital for long-term economic growth and development in the world.
The presidency will work in the Council and with the Commission to achieve balanced progress in the negotiations.
The Union's relations with Asia are a key element of our agenda.
Our engagement will be at all levels in the region.
We will pursue political dialogue with the full range of countries, including an Asia-Europe meeting at foreign minister level in April.
We would also hope to hold an EU-Japan Summit during our term.
As I have already stated, the Irish presidency looks forward to working closely with Parliament in the coming months.
It is essential that we cooperate effectively and that we get down to work immediately.
There is a range of important dossiers which require close cooperation if they are to be satisfactorily progressed in the time available to us.
The discussions on the Membersâ Statute are of particular concern.
I pay tribute to President Cox for his personal commitment to bringing closure to these discussions.
The Parliament vote, in December, provides the basis for us to move forward together to achieve an agreement which has eluded our institutions for too long.
The Irish presidency hopes to conclude this matter rapidly and is doing all in its power to deliver a positive outcome.
As we move further into the 21st century, I have no doubt that the Union will continue to develop and to grow, to broaden and to deepen.
The Union must meet new challenges and exploit new opportunities that lie ahead.
There will continue to be healthy debate and differing perspectives among us.
We will continue to work to accommodate this enriching diversity.
We must tackle these challenges and embrace these opportunities together, united by our shared interest in the success of the Union.
The founding fathers were inspired by the dream of a future in which Europeans would never again fight each other to the death over resources, over territory or over their beliefs; a future in which Europeans would never again be divided from each other.
This year will see that dream â a Europe whole and healed â brought closer to reality.
The founding fathers dreamt also of a Europe in which ever-closer cooperation would deliver greater security and prosperity for its people.
I stand before you as a firm believer in that dream.
I come from a country where membership of the European Union â a Union which we have helped to shape â has enabled us to develop and to flourish to our fullest potential.
I profoundly wish the same for the incoming Member States.
Six months is not a long time.
But I promise you an Irish presidency that will not stint in its efforts to achieve as much as is possible in this time.
I greatly look forward to cooperating closely with our partners and with the institutions of the Union, especially with the European Parliament.
Our agenda is demanding and complex.
We have begun our work with ambition and with humility.
We call on everyone to help us with this challenging task for the six months ahead.
We know that, as Europeans, our strength is our unity.
We achieve more, and we are at our very best, as 'Europeans â Working Together'.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Prime Minster Ahern, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the best way of opening this debate is to make final assessment of the future, given that events of future months will shape the course of the Union for many years to come.
I am referring to the key institutional events, such as the parliamentary elections in mid-June and the completion of this Commissionâs mandate at the end of October.
Furthermore, negotiations are about to start on establishing the Unionâs future Financial Perspective, and the Commission will soon be presenting its proposals.
FinallyÂ âÂ and here I am moving on to the issues that I will discuss todayÂ âÂ this Presidency will see the completion of enlargement and progress will have to be made on the Constitutional Treaty and on our strategy for growth.
So, ladies and gentlemen, the best wishes that we have exchanged over the last few days are especially valuable and I am sure that MrÂ Ahern and his colleagues will employ all their determination and ability to ensure that this Presidency is a successful one.
I will start my brief speech by referring to enlargement.
After years of meticulous preparation, 1Â May 2003 will really be a day of celebration.
I am glad that these celebrations will be centred on Dublin, because the Irish people are known for their exuberance and conviviality.
I am pleased that this celebration will be geared towards young people in particular, from whom we have a lot to learn, especially in times of difficulty when there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm about the future.
Enlargement will bring about significant changes for all our institutions.
At a practical level, work will continue on the internal organisation of the Commission, and I will report back to you on this in good time.
Furthermore, I am stepping up my consultations with the governments of the new Member States in order to appoint new Commissioners.
Work is progressing very quickly and so I can confirm that at the end of FebruaryÂ âÂ as early as was called for by ParliamentÂ âÂ I will let you have the names of the Commissioners so that you can duly proceed to the hearings that have been proposed.
The aim is, of course, to integrate the new members of the College as from 1 May 2004, after they have been approved by Parliament.
The celebrations in Dublin will be a symbolic moment, which will open up new horizons.
This monumental step is like a mountain pass: when we get there, a new landscape will of course unfold before us.
We will see the final frontiers of the Union, which will be complete when it welcomes the countries of the Western Balkans.
From this height we will be able to see the new neighbours of the enlarged Europe with whom, as MrÂ Ahern mentioned, we want to create an area of cooperation, stability, security and peace.
We have already embarked upon this task with the circle of friendly countries, which increases the possibility of far-reaching and systematic cooperation with the European Union from the Mediterranean to Russia.
We propose the European model as a way of structuring relations between countries outside of Europe; everyone is hugely interested in this model: in Asia, in Latin America, everywhere.
In recent years, the world, which has become less secure, has gone through a period of profound uncertainty.
I am therefore pleased by the call from the Irish Presidency to promote strong and effective multilateralism, respect for human rights and conflict prevention: these principles are European principles.
The Union must indeed strengthen relations with the United Nations and try to find more common ground with all the major players on the world stage, starting with the United States and Russia, and thus we are right on track.
We must work together with the Member States to help Secretary-General Kofi AnnanÂ âÂ whom we will meet in two weeks timeÂ âÂ to push ahead with the reform of the United Nations, an organisation that we want to be strong, effective and present wherever peace is under threat, where people are in need of aid, where human rights need protecting.
Ladies and gentlemen, threats to security and world peace are not posed simply by armed conflicts and groups that are prepared to fight to achieve their goals.
Whilst we must show determination in opposing and neutralising terrorist organisations, conflict situations must be resolved at political level.
I therefore agree with the proposals made by the Irish Presidency to concentrate Union measures on humanitarian aid, respect for human rights and on the political, economic and social factors that fuel war and violence.
I would now like to turn briefly to the issue of the Constitutional Treaty, which was the thorniest issue on the agenda of the Presidency that has just concluded.
Firstly, I would like to say how satisfied I am with the Presidencyâs announcement that the work of the Intergovernmental Conference will begin again.
For the Commission, adopting this Constitution is an absolute priority: both the Irish and the Dutch Presidencies can count on our continued support.
2004 must be the year of the European Constitution.
The December summit clearly showed that the existing stumbling blocks would not be insurmountable if the Member States made a further effort to extend the consensusÂ âÂ which was hugeÂ âÂ on the Conventionâs proposals.
If this development occursÂ âÂ and I know that MrÂ Ahern is a master of patience and persuasionÂ âÂ then agreement may not be far away.
The cost of slowing down the process of integration is too great.
Clearly, there are risks involved in any situation and the Commission insists that we all move together towards a form of integration that is more solid and which enjoys broader agreement.
If the efforts to this end were to fail repeatedlyÂ âÂ and I do hope that this does not happenÂ âÂ then we could not, of course, oppose better solutions from other quarters but, I repeat, this does not apply to the historic phase in which we are currently working: we are now working towards us all having a Constitution shared by all the Member States.
Mr President, I would like to finish my speech with the European measures for economic growth, to which you referred very clearly.
On this subject, your programme contains a wealth of ideas and is also ambitious; it could not be otherwise, since this Presidency will host the Spring Summit, which is the main meeting to set out the economic strategy.
After several difficult years, the economy finally seems to be picking up: not too enthusiastically, but at least there has been some improvement.
The climate is becoming favourable to stimulating economic activity.
This is not the place to repeat any analysis of the objectives set out in the Presidencyâs programmeÂ âÂ which will, I guarantee, receive the Commissionâs full supportÂ âÂ and so I will just give a brief review of the ideas underlying the strategy in question.
The Spring Council will continue in the direction outlined in the Lisbon strategy, which remains the only basis that will allow Europe and its economy to maintainÂ âÂ I am not saying to increase, simply to maintainÂ âÂ its prosperity, security, social justice in a globalised world.
The Commission will, therefore, make its proposals and the Council will take its decisions; no decision will be able to bear fruit until the decisions become real policies at national level, and so we need the cooperation of the Member States to be harmonised.
The key priorities must be knowledge and innovation, that is to say, a single priority: human resources, full stop.
That is the priority.
Investment in education, lifelong learning and in research are not theoretical problems, but an objective that must be pursued at once because our international competitors are overtaking us, or have already done so.
We must, therefore, step up our efforts to become a knowledge-based economy.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we look beyond the here and now, it is clear that our growth depends primarily on developing human resources and knowledge.
I would again like to stress the need to create research centres of excellence in Europe and at world level, or even better, that are the best in the world.
They must be the tangible and fundamental symbol of our belief in the future, thatÂ âÂ as MrÂ Ahern saidÂ âÂ the future is something we can shape and make happen.
National strategies alone will not produce cutting-edge research; we need a strategy for the continent, we need the whole of the Union to pull together.
Our continent must once again become what it was for centuries: the reference point for researchers across the world.
We must put in place measures to allow young people who are currently specialising elsewhere to return to Europe when they have completed their studies.
There is no point in me giving you facts and figures: here the issue is that hundreds of thousands of people are educated here and go elsewhere, or are educated elsewhere and go elsewhere.
We are thus out of the loop of cultivating human resources in the world: either we re-enter it or the Lisbon strategy will not be fully achieved.
There is only one way forward possible: fundamental research and disseminating education throughout the European workforce.
Our young people must be able to find opportunities to study, work and be successful in Europe: that is their right.
I say this not only for the sake of young people, but also because their success is the key to our own survival.
This must, therefore, be the aim of our policies and our effort to meet the expectations of the people of Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, just before Christmas the political group chairmen had an opportunity to speak to the then-incoming Irish Presidency: with the Taoiseach, Foreign Minister Brian Cowen and the Minister for Europe, Dick Roche.
I can tell you that the meeting was professional, efficient and amicable.
I think this bodes very well for a successful Irish Presidency and by happy coincidence we have an Irish President of the European Parliament.
I would also like to mention Gerard Collins, the co-chairman of an important group here in the European Parliament, who we first met when he was still Foreign Minister.
The Irish Presidency of the time performed excellently, and I wish you every success in the coming six months as well.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned the Constitution.
For my group, for the European Peopleâs Party section of it, the Constitution is the number one priority.
The Constitution project cannot be allowed to fail simply because the Brussels Summit was unsuccessful.
You will have our full support if you manage to resolve matters during the Irish Presidency.
Everyone needs to move into action now.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats may support the principle of double majority for decision-making in the Council of Ministers, but it cannot now be considered a fundamental principle whereby we say that if it is not accepted, the whole Constitution project will fail â certainly not.
The Constitution is so important a subject that we must move towards one another.
A compromise must be found, and we need everyone to work together to that end.
Then there is the discussion about âcore Europeâ or a two-speed Europe.
I would advise against any such discussion. It is inherently wrong.
How would a core group work? How would a two-speed Europe work?
It is the wrong approach, but it is also seen as a threat to make certain governments move in a particular direction.
Let us stop talking about a two-speed Europe, let us create this Constitution and move forward together.
Mr President-in-Office, the elections for the European Parliament fall during your Presidency.
The Conventionâs draft Constitution says â although of course it is not yet in force â that the results of the European Parliament elections will be taken into account when the Commission President is appointed.
I do not know whether your Presidency will actually make a proposal for the office of Commission President at the end of June, after the elections.
I can only encourage and ask you to respect the results of the European Parliament elections if you do.
It is a question of principle.
Our group is not willing to repeat the events of 1999, when one side won the elections and the other side took up offices in the Commission.
This time the results of the European elections must be taken into account.
The Commission as a whole must be balanced.
As President of the Commission â you are laughing, and I am always pleased to see you happy âyou are already being asked for your opinion, even now, on the subject of appointing the ten Commissioners from the accession countries.
Please ensure that there is a cross-party political balance when you appoint the Commissioners.
Mr President-in-Office, you went on to speak about our relationship with the United States of America.
Let me underline everything you said.
We do not want to be the United Statesâ lackeys, but neither are we her rivals.
We want to be partners with the United States, with equal rights, speaking on an equal footing with our American friends, and on many issues we share common goals.
Anyone who believes that Europe has to be defined by contrast with the United States not only has it wrong in treating the United States, as it were, as an enemy, but would also split Europe itself, because we have different views on how we should structure our relationship with the United States.
Consequently, I can only advise that we consider ourselves partners and equals of the United States.
It is up to us to establish that equality.
Rather than constantly criticising American dominance, we should do our utmost to ensure we, as Europeans, are united, and then we will be on an equal footing with the United States.
This does not mean that we ought not to criticise our American friends at all.
For example, I consider the current situation in Guantanamo Bay unacceptable.
No one on this earth â no terrorist, no one â should be without rights.
Everyone in the world is subject to a system of law.
We should tell our American friends so. Please include it in all documents we exchange with them.
The same holds true for Chechnya.
We are always told: yes, yes, we have talked to the Russian President about Chechnya.
We would like to see it in black and white: a statement that Chechnya will also be dealt with, that we will intervene to uphold human rights and that we also have the courage to address world leaders â or those who consider themselves as such â on such matters.
So my request to you is: give human rights a chance, again by referring to them in documents and agreements.
This applies both to Guantanamo Bay and to Chechnya.
Let us respect one another: the small respecting the large, the large respecting the small, the majority respecting minorities.
Europe can only work if we understand others, and if we respect one another.
There should be no domination, and I thought it would be good to ask, in all modesty, everyone to do their bit.
That is exactly what we need.
Everyone needs to do their bit for a united Europe.
Our group will stand alongside you.
We wish you every success.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Taoiseach, , which according to my poor Gaelic means âa hundred thousand welcomesâ: you are more generous than the Spanish, who say in the plural.
I would like to welcome the arrival of the Irish Presidency, because fate and the timetable have placed you right at the European Unionâs important political crossroads.
It was you who began the process â while I was President of the European Parliament â in Dublin, in March 1990, which led to Maastricht, you played a decisive role as the Presidency in relation to the Stability Pact and now you have an enormous responsibility.
As well as participating in the Conference of Presidents, in December, the Bureau of my group last week visited Dublin and we had the opportunity to hold a full debate with the and the Irish Government; I would like to say, on behalf of my group that we finally have a reliable, experienced and serious interlocutor.
Following what we have just experienced â a Presidency full of political extravagances and boasting in the media â I believe this is a very significant step forward.
We can have faith in you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
I personally went to ask you to support us in the Convention â you are not from my political family â but you supported us in this challenge from the outset.
As well as having experience â since being negotiator of the Single Act and participant in the subsequent reforms of the Treaties â you know what you are talking about and have demonstrated your seriousness.
With regard to the Constitution, I would like to note, firstly, the decisive attitude of the Irish Presidency, a prudent but firm attitude â , as the Latins said, (we must press forward slowly and prudently) â and I hope that you can present us with proposals in March.
I do not want to enter into controversial territory, I believe that Parliamentâs position has also been prudent, firm and serious and I hope that with the Irish Presidency we manage to unravel this extremely important issue.
Because a Constitution is absolutely essential to us if we are to consolidate an enlarged Europe and make it work in a democratic manner.
I have taken good note, Mr President, of the âs comments on the Membersâ Statute, which my group sees as a question of constitutional dignity.
The second important challenge is economic.
The President has talked about an issue which is very important, and in relation to which Ireland offers an example to the current Union and to the enlarged Union, which is the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
In other words, achieving, as we Socialists believe, full employment, gender equality â I would like to welcome the fact that the Irish Government has been the first to appoint a female Ambassador to Coreper, thereby entering into the most sexist realm of the Union, I congratulate it â social cohesion and technological development.
You can also set a good example in terms of solidarity, because we are now going to begin to renegotiate the financial perspectives, because ultimately, if we are going to get married we must also talk about the dowry and the marriage settlements, and that is where we are going to see solidarity.
In this regard, I would like to say, Mr President, that we naturally support the proposals from the Commission which at least maintain the current effort.
We cannot set many more objectives while providing fewer resources and it is not acceptable for one or several governments to tell us that in order to do many more things we must provide much fewer resources.
We must respect the work of the Commission and its responsibility, and I hope that it makes proposals as soon as possible, and that the Irish Presidency can interpret them.
We must also provide a future for the Stability and Growth Pact.
With regard to international policy, I would like to stress two elements: one is the President-in-Office of the Councilâs insistence on the value of human rights at world level and the importance of Kofi Annanâs visit, because it is an affirmation of Europe's attachment to multilateralism.
I believe that the Irish Presidency also has the capacity and experience to take this forward.
Finally, Mr President, an important issue, since we are in an election campaign and my distinguished colleague, Mr Poettering, has raised the issue.
I believe that the important thing, from the point of view of the European Parliament and democracy in Europe, is that the Irish Presidency applies the Simitis-Cox Agreement to the letter, taking the form of an exchange of letters, according to which the Council will have to propose the candidate to the Presidency of the Commission after the European elections.
As far as that we are all in agreement and I hope that the Irish Presidency will comply with it.
With regard to the European elections, the issue is open, nobody has won them and I would like to ask my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the technical group of European conservatives, to explain to me what you have in common with the British Conservatives in relation to Europe.
There are no majorities here.
Majorities, in European democratic systems, when there are no absolute majorities, are created on the basis of programme agreements.
I accept that you advocate a conservative programme, and we advocate a progressive programme, but everything is open and we are all going to win the elections, or at least we will also be winners.
Â Â  Mr President, President-in-Office, at the beginning of the last century, a disgruntled writer from Dublin went to live in Italy.
He wrote a famous novel in Trieste, a city that some years after his death came to mark the southern end of a line which divided our continent for half a century.
This year, under this Irish presidency, that line will finally be erased.
History, as Stephen Daedelus reminded us in James Joyce's , is a nightmare from which we are trying to awake.
The Irish presidency is right to focus on enlargement.
It is an historic moment: the final act of the revolutions of 1989.
It is appropriate that a country which speaks for the transformative power of the European Union should oversee that process.
But we should not be tempted to believe that we can separate enlargement from agreement on the instrument designed to make that step possible.
Integrating the new Member States into the Lisbon process and Schengen cannot hide the fact that without the additional framework of a new constitutional settlement we are simply changing the oil in a Union which needs a new engine.
Liberals in this House welcome the Taoiseach's strong commitment to advancing the work of the IGC.
December's tempers have cooled.
Europe's destiny is in an altogether safer pair of hands.
This time, Europe's leaders must choose to succeed.
My Group also welcomes the presidency's intention to sustain the momentum of enlargement by concluding accession talks with Romania and Bulgaria and by responding to the request from Croatia.
We, too, see this as the moment to achieve an historic settlement with Cyprus.
The presidency also rightly focuses, too, on the Lisbon Agenda in what can only be called its hour of need.
Most of the structural problems identified at Lisbon remain obstacles to wealth creation.
The political will needed to undertake reform and give the eurozone credibility has not yet clearly been summoned.
The Celtic tiger has long stood for the benefits of competitiveness and economic discipline.
Now it is time for you to roar in the Council.
We welcome the commitments on the Framework Directive on Services, published by the Commission yesterday, and on the Financial Services Action Plan.
We welcome the commitment to work with the European Parliament to secure the adoption of the Trans-European Networks proposals.
But your modesty about what you can achieve must not obscure the need to resurrect the Growth and Stability Pact in some form under this presidency.
The presidency's assessment of our agenda abroad is also sound.
We welcome the focus on African issues, on the holocaust of AIDS and poverty and hunger.
We accept the need to work constructively with Russia, although we expect hard words on Chechnya and on Russia's vanishing political pluralism.
We welcome the attempts to rebuild bridges in our transatlantic friendships.
But here the Council's loyalty to European values means that Guantanamo Bay must be on the agenda of the EU-US Summit.
The EU must act together to demand conscionable treatment for all detainees in Camp Delta, including the Europeans who have now been held for two years without charge.
I welcome, Mr President-in-Office, your commitment to review justice and home affairs in the Union.
I hope you will not overlook the worrying Amnesty International report on human rights within some of our own member countries.
My Group welcomes the presidency's political commitment to take the Statute for Members forward.
That commitment must now be carried through into reform by both Parliament and the Council so that the statute can enter into force after the elections.
Mr President-in-Office, your work programme is a worthy one.
If my Group could offer you a slogan for it, it would be 'restoring belief'.
Deliver a deal on the Constitution and see in enlargement and you will have done Europe, and Ireland, proud.
Carry that spirit through to the European elections in June, to a pan-European campaign with a continental consciousness rather than 25 national campaigns, and history will give you rich reward.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, when observers talk about the difficulties that the Irish Presidency is going to face, they all stress the fact that the constitutional process is deadlocked.
I fear that this will mean that we will not see the wood for the trees.
To my mind, what happened at the Brussels summit and its conclusion were only symptoms of a deeper problem: the lack of a common plan, or in any case of a plan with which Europeans can identify.
The challenge that we now have to meet is more ambitious, much more ambitious than seeking a compromise of power between two black sheep in the European Council.
It is to dare to go beyond what is left unsaid, the soothing proposals, the Community hangover, and dare to call a spade a spade and a crisis a crisis.
Being critical is a rare commodity in both the Council and the Commission.
This is why I am convinced that our fellow citizens would appreciate the major change of talking truthfully and responsibly about what is not working properly in the Union and calling for changes.
There are currently numerous examples of such taboos that need to be lifted.
I will just mention three of them that are particularly fundamental.
First of all, there are the crises of the euro and the stability pact, because the two problems are linked.
The creation of the European currency was supposed to stimulate growth, promote employment and strengthen the Union in relation to its main competitors.
