Of course cross-border transmission also plays a major part.
We are continuing to conduct an intensive dialogue with the European Parliament on the important question of how we can protect children and young people from certain products.
(DE) Minister, is there any chance of using this directive to at least get the public sector media in the European Member States to largely stop depicting violence on radio and television?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) First of all, we are not seeking to distinguish between private and public television channels, but to have a general directive for television at European level.
I also assume that a number of television stations have taken it upon themselves to ensure that no one is incited to hatred and the like by their programmes.
(LT) The programmes of our local television broadcasters contain a lot of material from the United States.
It is precisely from this country that we see plenty of violence and aggressive programmes and films, which have a very bad influence on young people and children.
We see events from the life of the United States itself: massacres in schools and universities.
Could we have any influence on limiting the amount of this type of material being imported and broadcast in Europe?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Posselt, the European Council's decision of 15 and 16 December 2005 to give the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the status of a candidate country stands in recognition of the country's reform effort so far.
The European Council stressed that further steps to bring Macedonia closer to the EU will be considered if the conditions and requirements laid down in the Conclusions are satisfied.
The Commission will keep you informed of these developments in its progress reports.
After examining the developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as set out in the Commission's progress reports, at its meeting on 11 and 12 December last year the Council expressed its regret at the slowing of the pace of reform in 2006.
On 14 and 15 December last year, the European Council reiterated that the individual countries' progress along the road to the European Union depends on the efforts each of them makes to satisfy the Copenhagen Criteria and the conditions of the stabilisation and association process.
So far as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, it urged the country to step up the pace of reform in the key areas and to implement the priorities laid down in the European partnership in order to make further progress in the accession process.
The country's government faces great challenges, especially in the areas of police and judicial reform and the fight against corruption.
As I stressed here back in March in answer to a question from Ryszard Czarnecki, the questions that remain open must now be tackled quickly.
The pace of the accession process therefore depends primarily on the efforts and achievements of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia itself.
The Commission's next progress report will shed light on this.
The European Union will continue to actively support the country in making this objective a reality.
(DE) Three brief comments on that excellent reply.
Firstly, I would like to ask you what the position is with regard to the implementation of the Ohrid Agreement, in particular local government reform.
Are you satisfied with the developments in home affairs?
Secondly, what do you think of the future Slovenian Council Presidency's announcement that it will work towards a date?
Thirdly, has there been any easing of tension over the tricky question of the name?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I will begin with the last point, because I know it is very controversial.
It would be best if the two countries concerned could settle the matter between themselves, but they have not yet been able to agree on anything.
Regarding the date, if I have understood you correctly, it was about the Slovenian Presidency.
What I said before shows that while the European Council has sent out a signal by giving the country candidate status, we are however still not conducting accession negotiations, hoping that further progress will be made after this debate.
I do not think it is right to set a date at this point.
If the conditions are satisfied, if the necessary pace of reform is reached, if the results are there, then the European Council is ready to set definite dates so that the next steps can be started.
So far as the Ohrid Agreement is concerned, Mr Posselt, I am unable to give you a precise assessment of the situation at present, but I will gladly send you the answer later.
(DE) Minister, if Macedonia really does join the EU at some point, it could trigger something of a Babylonian confusion of languages, since that country alone has six official languages.
Is the Council really aware of the problem of an impending language explosion?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) At the Thessaloniki summit the European Union unanimously said that, in view of previous events in the countries of the western Balkans, it is necessary to offer those countries the prospect of accession.
That decision was motivated by the desire to bring stability to the region.
All the things you have just raised in connection with the diversity of languages will not have been considered from the outset.
The important thing, however, is that we help to bring stability to the region, and the problem you raise is therefore a subordinate point for the time being.
In any case, the European Union has already solved quite different problems.
(DE) Do you share the view that the preparation and approval of a new basic treaty or constitutional treaty or simply of a new treaty is a prerequisite for the accession of Macedonia, Croatia or other countries of the western Balkans?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The Council has reacted strongly to the Sudanese Government's refusal to issue visas for the United Nations Human Rights Council's assessment mission to Sudan and it deeply regrets the lack of cooperation on the Sudanese Government's part.
The European Union had already made repeated approaches to the Sudanese Foreign Minister and appealed to Sudan to cooperate with this mission.
The Council welcomes the fact that, at its fourth session, the UN Human Rights Council noted the Mission's report and unanimously adopted a resolution on the human rights situation in Darfur, charging a team of special rapporteurs with reviewing all existing recommendations for improving the human rights situation in Darfur and pressing ahead with their implementation.
On 15 March 2007, the Council reaffirmed its support for urgent consideration of further measures against Sudan by the UN Security Council, pointing out that under UN Security Council Resolution 1591 anyone hindering the peace process must be called to account and appropriate measures taken.
The Council also expressed its resolve to consider further measures, especially in the context of the UN, against any party to the conflict who obstructs UN support for the African Union mission in the Darfur region of Sudan, including the carrying out of the agreed hybrid AU-UN operation.
The Darfur conflict has been discussed regularly in talks with both China and Russia, including at political dialogue meetings, for example.
We have consistently taken the view that the Sudanese Government must work towards a political settlement of the conflict and give its unequivocal agreement to the implementation of the full UN support package for the AMIS mission.
deputising for the author. - There is a dreadful sense of impasse over Darfur, with lots of hand-wringing but no progress, and recent events have rather added to that feeling.
In the absence of an agreement on a UN peacekeeping force, is the Council considering, among the further measures it is looking into at the moment, the possibility of an EU-enforced no-fly zone, with the enforcement planes based over the border in Chad?
That has been discussed periodically since 2004.
Does the President-in-Office feel that now is the moment to implement it?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The Council of Foreign Ministers discussed Sudan and Darfur again last Monday in Luxembourg.
As you may know, the United Nations special envoy, Jan Eliasson, took part.
The situation in the region, which was difficult in any case, has not been improved by the fact that, in addition to the existing conflicts between the different parties in Sudan, various tribes are suddenly making war on each other.
At the special envoy's express request, however, the Council has not taken any further measures for the time being.
The special envoy asked that we should again seek by political and diplomatic means to secure agreement for a UN-backed mission, perhaps with a change of attitude on the part of China.
The foreign ministers stated, however, that the European Union is considering further effective measures against Sudan if there are no signs of that in the foreseeable future.
It cannot be put off for ever, we cannot postpone things for weeks and months on end and simply wait.
(LT) Chancellor Merkel, when introducing the Berlin Declaration, mentioned Darfur as a wound shared by all of us, and she said that it was time for the European Union to take unilateral action.
I would like to check again: how long do we have to wait for these decisions?
Are diplomatic negotiations still continuing, even though they have not produced any results so far, and most likely never will?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I have tried to make clear - it was what the Foreign Ministers Council before last wanted - that we want to get a fresh picture and to do that through the United Nations special envoy this time, but also by getting information from the African Union's special envoy.
I readily acknowledge that it really is a sore point, but I must ask you to take this special envoy's request seriously and try to see whether certain movements that have taken place in the last few days might not be conducive to a solution after all, making a joint mission possible.
I do repeat, however, that this is not a project where we will wait week after week without seeing results.
The European Union should start taking appropriate measures if this process, which Mr Eliasson wants and which we also want, fails to start.
(FI) Mr Minister, the European Union has combat forces, with German, Finnish and Dutch troops in reserve these days.
Can you imagine a situation in which combat forces would be used to calm the situation in Darfur?
Mr PflÃŒger, as has already been explained in the answer to question 619/2007, the Council is aware of the extrajudicial executions in the Philippines.
The European Union regularly expresses its deep concern about these occurrences, urging the authorities to tackle the problem quickly and also to allow independent investigations so that the perpetrators can be brought to court and preventive measures taken.
As already stated in the answer to which I referred, the European Union is willing to assist the Philippines in developing its judicial system.
The EU is perfectly clear that what is needed in order to put an end to extrajudicial executions in the Philippines is not just specialist expertise but that political will on the part of the top leadership is also crucial.
The EU will continue to press for such will to be shown.
We hope that the proper investigation and prosecution of these crimes will also have a preventive effect.
In April, the EU Member States and the Commission will be making preparations to send a fact-finding mission to Manila in the near future to assess the need for specialist assistance.
This comes in answer to a request from Foreign Minister Romulo, who has asked for help in implementing the recommendations of the Melo Commission, which was charged with investigating the unexplained killings.
(DE) Is the Council aware of the following extrajudicial executions: Cipriano Ligaspo, murdered on 14 March; Carlito Getrosa, murdered on 11 March; Che Che Gandinao, murdered on 10 March; Felisa Timog Ocampo and Renato 'Atong' Torrecampo Pacaide, murdered on 2 March?
My question is, are sanctions in fact being considered?
You have just said that the Philippines Government has asked for assistance and will be given it.
But the essential part of the problem is that the government is involved.
In view of that, is this the right approach?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) The Council has no evidence that the Sri Lankan Government was connected with this incident.
No conclusions can therefore be drawn regarding the incident's consequences for relations between the EU and the Sri Lankan Government.
Looking at the situation more generally, however, the Council is deeply concerned about developments in Sri Lanka.
The European Union is urging both sides to end the violence immediately and to return to the negotiating table without delay so that a workable solution to the conflict can be found based on constructive proposals.
Despite the obvious difficulties, as one of the co-chairs of the Tokyo Conference of donor countries the European Union is continuing to examine every possible way of supporting the peace process in Sri Lanka.
(DE) You have just said that the Council is deeply concerned, but in that case my question is quite specific: what does the Council intend to do to bring pressure to bear on Sri Lanka to end the military offensive against the Tamil Eelam freedom fighters - which has already claimed many civilian casualties - and force them to return to the negotiating table?
My second question is: is the Council aware that arms from EU Member States are also being used in this conflict?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) On the last point, I know nothing about this, but we will look into it and see whether there is any information available.
On the question of the measures the Council is thinking of taking, I can tell you that the Council is supporting the work of the Monitoring Mission in Sri Lanka and the Norwegian mediator.
We have repeatedly called on the warring parties to observe the 2002 armistice agreement and to respect human rights.
The European Union has also submitted its own draft resolution on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka to the Geneva Human Rights Council.
This draft expresses the EU's concern at the recent escalation of violence in Sri Lanka and calls for an immediate end to the violence and the violations of human rights and basic humanitarian rights it entails.
I hope that will lead to a next step.
We will look again at the question you raise and let you have information on the subject.
(DE) When the present escalation of the conflict in Sri Lanka began, this House debated whether the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) should be placed on the EU terror list.
What is your present view of the LTTE having been placed on the terror list now that the conflict has escalated enormously?
Was it in retrospect the right thing to do?
In particular, was it right at that point in time?
A second question: Norway is playing a very positive role in this conflict, especially in negotiations, and Norway has criticised the EU through diplomatic channels, saying that the EU's role has been rather biased towards the government.
What do you say to that?
The Council plays no direct part in the planning or construction of the pipeline, because the implementation of Community law is the responsibility of the Member States and the Commission's task is to ensure that the Member States apply the law properly.
(LT) Without a doubt, I am not satisfied with that reply.
It does not mean that European Union Member States can do whatever they wish on EU territory.
Russian experts have already established that there is a lot of weaponry [dumped on the seabed], and now they are thinking about changing the route of the gas pipeline.
The Russians think that Gazprom will be allowed to set up armed militia units, which together with Baltic navies will control the whole pipeline and all who sail in the area and use the environment.
The Baltic Sea belongs to all of us, and I do not think that this is a matter for just two countries.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I would again like to make clear that this pipeline is not being planned by a state but by private companies.
These companies have to submit planning applications.
As different Member States are also concerned, the relevant regulations must be complied with.
As I have already said here some time ago, there are different aspects.
You mentioned the munitions that have indeed been found.
The ecosystem and other issues must be taken into account.
However, all of that can only be examined in the light of European law if an application has been made and the relevant procedures have been initiated.
There are no special rights for particular companies: national and European regulations, especially those concerned with environmental protection, must be complied with.
(SV) If a dispute arises and an environmental test is carried out in Swedish waters, is it the European Court of Justice or the Swedish environmental court that decides the case?
Very different information has been forthcoming as to whether the Council has approved the construction of a German-Russian gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea.
Has the Council taken such a decision?
The Council as such is not involved in the initiatives relating to the Leipzig Charter for Sustainable European Cities and the EU territorial agenda.
These initiatives are taken by the Member States on an informal basis.
The Leipzig Charter and the EU territorial agenda are offers by the European ministers for regional and urban development to take better account of urban and territorial matters in the implementation of EU policies, for example in the question of how an integrated regional and urban development policy can contribute to the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives of more sustainable economic growth and strengthening the European social model.
The results of the informal ministers' meeting will therefore be passed on to all European institutions.
These can then examine independently to what extent taking account of urban and territorial matters will be helpful in achieving their political objectives.
(EL) Madam President, I would like to thank the Minister for his response.
The territorial charter, however, is certainly a priority of the German Presidency and holds a significant place in its programme.
Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister to explain to us in greater detail, what the goals are of such a territorial agenda, how it is viewed by the German Presidency and how it is included in its future programme, up to the end of June.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Particular results must first be evaluated, and then they can be passed on to the appropriate institutions, at least where topics have been identified.
The approach was that opportunities for integrated urban or regional development also exist in cross-border areas.
Our presidency has only slightly more than two months left to run.
I expect the President-in-Office will be presenting results at the end of his presidency and making them available to the institutions concerned.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
I should like to thank the President-in-Office and colleagues.
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Rapid Border Intervention Teams (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 as regards that mechanism - C6-0253/2006 -.
Mr President, the Commission strongly welcomes the excellent compromise reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the Rapid Border Intervention Teams Regulation.
As you know, over the last few years the European Union has experienced an increasing need for providing operational assistance to the Member States which, due to their geographical location and the complexity of their external borders, have to shoulder the heaviest burdens in terms of border control.
In response, the European Union created the Frontex Agency in 2004 as a measure for channelling the solidarity between Member States and the Community in terms of operational cooperation.
Moreover, a new External Borders Fund will be used from next year for ensuring financial solidarity, by boosting the capacity of all Member States to deal with the challenges posed by their different external borders.
The establishment of a mechanism for the creation and deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams is a further measure of solidarity.
It is an important step forward in the cooperation between Member States and the Community, by controlling the external borders of the European Union and performing checks on people at these borders.
The Rapid Border Intervention Teams will become a highly trained and specialised reserve of border guards, which will be deployed at short notice, by the Frontex Agency, to a Member State in need of such assistance.
As something new and ground-breaking in this regard, the rapid teams will be enabled to carry out all necessary functions related to the checks on people at external borders, in the same way as checks are performed by the national border guards of the host Member State.
In this context, the Commission would like to make the following oral statement on the International Law of the Sea and international protection obligations.
Each Member State participating in operations coordinated by the Frontex Agency on the high seas remains fully bound by its individual obligation to respect the principle of non-refoulement as enshrined, in particular, in the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees of 28 July 1951 and the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment vis-Ã -vis all people under its jurisdiction.
When an interception or rescue operation is carried out in the territorial waters of a Member State, the Community acquis on asylum is applicable.
This includes the Dublin Regulation.
Consequently, in the absence of any other relevant criteria, the Member State on whose waters the interception or rescue operation is carried out, would be responsible for examining any asylum claims.
These principles remain fully valid in cases of future deployments of Rapid Border Intervention Teams following the adoption of this regulation.
As the Commission underlined in its communication of 30 November 2006 on reinforcing the management of the southern external maritime borders, it is not clear under what circumstances a state may be obliged to assume responsibility for the examination of an asylum claim when the interception or rescue operation takes place on the high seas or in the territorial waters of a third country.
Similarly, it is unclear under what circumstances the Member State hosting an operation coordinated by the Frontex Agency could be considered as ultimately responsible for compliance with this principle.
Evidently, the further development of an integrated system for managing the external maritime borders should be based on a clear common understanding of the Member States' protection obligations.
To this effect, the Commission suggested that Member States should address these issues collectively and pragmatically, either in the context of broader bilateral or regional agreements or through the development of practical guidelines in close cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other relevant stakeholders.
In order to support this process, the Commission will soon publish a study on the Law of the Sea addressing these and other relevant issues.
The publication of the study will be followed by an expert meeting with Member States to identify the practical follow-up, having regard to the limits of the Community's responsibility in this area as well as the oral statement.
Finally, I would like to stress once again that the Commission is very pleased with the good cooperation between the three institutions involved in reaching agreement on this extremely important piece of new Community legislation and would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their excellent contributions to achieving success on this file.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my pleasure by saying straight away that, if the RABIT draft regulation can be put to the vote in this House tomorrow with a view to an agreement at first reading, it is thanks to the fact that our three institutions have cooperated in what I would describe as an exemplary fashion.
It is thanks to the Commission, firstly. Its initial proposal was of a high quality, and throughout the discussion process it has continually shown a great capacity for smoothing things over and for easing the way for compromise.
It is also thanks to the Council, particularly during the Finnish Presidency and now during the German Presidency. It has continually affirmed its desire to succeed and has spared no efforts in order to convince all of the Member States.
It is thanks, in particular, to the most recent presidency of Mrs Monika Schmitt-Vockenhausen.
For my part, on behalf of Parliament, I have been able to rely from the start on the solid support and confidence of the majority of the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and I should like publicly to thank them.
I hope that they find, in this, the expression of my gratitude.
The root of the problem to be dealt with, Mr President, is both simple and urgent.
It consists of organising assistance from the Member States for those of the Member States that have to cope with the sudden arrival of huge numbers of illegal immigrants, who are anxious to cross the Union's external borders.
This problem now affects, as we know - and tragic images constantly remind us of the fact - the countries of the south of the Union.
Yet, no one can rule out the possibility that, in the future, other borders - particularly those to the south-east and to the east - will be under the same sudden, recurring pressure.
The draft regulation that has been submitted to this House confirms four major principles, which I have always vigorously defended on behalf of Parliament.
The first principle: solidarity in the area of external border control is not an option, but an obligation.
It is for this reason that the draft regulation stipulates that the Member States must contribute to the rapid intervention reserve and must make border guards available to Frontex, at its request, unless they themselves are faced with an emergency situation to which they must attend.
The second major principle: when deployed on the territory of another Member State within the rapid intervention teams, border guards posted to the reserve are not auxiliaries or second-rate agents compared with the border guards of the Member State.
Of course - and this goes without saying - members of the teams will receive their instructions from the Member State that is hosting them but, otherwise, they are on an equal footing with the national border guards.
The tasks that they may carry out are the same.
They have the right to wear their own uniform, with the addition of a European badge.
They may carry their service weapons, in accordance with the national law of their own Member State, except in the event of a disagreement between the two Member States concerned.
They may be authorised to consult European and national databases, and their accreditation document, which was provided for in the initial draft, has been stripped of all the cumbersome elements that I feel it contained.
The third major principle - and I say this, in particular, for Mr Catania's benefit - is that respect for fundamental rights applies in all circumstances.
It is for this reason that the draft regulation stipulates: firstly, that the members of the teams, together with the national border guards, must abstain from any discriminatory behaviour; secondly, that they must act in accordance with the Member States' obligations with regard to international protection and non-refoulement; and, thirdly, that the members of the teams must act fully in accordance with the obligations of international maritime law, especially in relation to search and rescue.
That is what the Commissioner has just reaffirmed to us here.
Therefore, Mr Catania, the amendment that you are tabling is unnecessary.
I would even say that it is insulting because it makes the assumption that, when they discover ships that are in distress, border guards, including those from Spain, Italy or Malta now, would not be particularly concerned about saving people.
Lastly, the draft regulation stipulates that the European directives on the protection of personal data must be applied in full.
The fourth principle: while the situation is urgent, it is urgent for everyone.
Given that the issue is one of dealing with emergency situations, the terms of the regulation provide for very short deadlines in which to intervene.
The director of Frontex has a maximum of five working days in which to decide how to intervene.
Once the operational plan has been established, the actual deployment of the rapid intervention teams must take place within those five working days at the latest.
That being the case, it was therefore only right that, in cases of interventions that are justified but where the budgetary resources of Frontex are not adequate to meet their costs, the budgetary authority should make a commitment, in accordance with the provisions of the financial regulation, urgently to find a budgetary solution.
That is the meaning of the amendment that has been added to the text of the draft regulation and that formalises the agreement reached in this regard between the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
So much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the draft on which this House will have to vote tomorrow.
I do not doubt, and I hope, that it will receive your broad support.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I am not going to use up the three minutes that I am allowed because we are dealing with a very well-produced report, employing a working method that is worthy of praise, and I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Deprez.
Secondly, I am also pleased with the great agreement reached between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
I would finally like to express a few considerations.
I would point out - as I did at my party's Bureau last week, in Granada- that competence for monitoring borders and external borders is one that falls to the Member States and only to the Member States.
What is FRONTEX then?
FRONTEX and the RABITs essentially mean coordination, cooperation and collaboration.
The RABITs are additional cooperation and collaboration instruments for preventing the permeability of the Union's external borders from being added to the permeability of the internal borders and between them creating a scene of humanitarian desolation.
Let us remember that, as a result of the practice of crossing the Atlantic using the criminal mechanisms of mafias, the European Union has just put at 10 000 the number of deaths recorded as a result of this inhuman epic journey.
The RABITs, which have been the subject of so much consensus and so much agreement, are an additional instrument for collaboration and cooperation.
That obligatory solidarity is not a contradiction in terms, Mr President.
It is a necessary reality that we have enshrined today in the agreement that I hope will be supported by a large majority in this House tomorrow.
The financial instrument that Mr Deprez has referred to is much more than a statement of intent for dealing with critical situations and mass invasions of a part of our territory.
It offers an immediate response demonstrating solidarity and providing budgetary resources.
I shall end as I began, Mr President, by expressing my pleasure at the achievement of an instrument which shows so much solidarity and is so useful in terms of controlling the Union's borders.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I shall use the mother tongue of our rapporteur in order to congratulate and to thank him for his meticulous work and for the outcome of that work: the excellent report that we are going to adopt tomorrow.
Mr Deprez, without straying into the realm of cheap puns, I believe that, together with the shadow rapporteurs, you have been able to create a veritable rapid intervention team within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which has enabled us to act quickly and to pass at first reading a text that was the subject of a very broad consensus during the vote in committee.
We have also been able to promote our proposals at the Council, thanks to the constructive dialogue that we have established with the German Presidency, which has included this regulation among its priorities and which has proved very receptive to our proposals.
(ES) Ladies and gentlemen, together we have improved the text, which once again demonstrates the maturity of this House when it comes to legislating in such a sensitive field as the fight against illegal immigration.
We must therefore extend the field of codecision to all aspects of immigration policy.
We welcome the fact that the Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA) approved the Regulation last Thursday in Luxembourg and the commitment reached by the three institutions to guarantee adequate funding of operations.
We hope that the teams are operational this summer, even before, as requested by the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini.
I believe that we are moving in the right direction, ladies and gentlemen.
We are moving slowly, but in the right direction.
We have taken a small step towards a common immigration policy.
Our respective governments have understood that immigration is a shared European challenge which requires a global and joint response based on solidarity, mutual trust and shared responsibility.
To this end, the obligatory principle of solidarity on the part of Member States laid down in Article 3 of the Regulation is extremely important.
This instrument is no panacea, but it represents progress in the fight against illegal immigration and people trafficking.
These teams will contribute to increasing solidarity and mutual assistance with a view to being able to monitor Europe's external borders, saving lives - particularly in Atlantic and Mediterranean waters - and properly treating immigrants who try to enter the Union's territory illegally.
Our citizens want the European Union to respond to their concerns.
The RABITs are a concrete response.
Our citizens and the immigrants deserve to see us treat the issue of illegal immigration seriously.
I would therefore call upon the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to show consistency.
You cannot be in Granada criticising the regularisation implemented by the Spanish Government while at the same time, in Luxembourg, two governments led by your political family are announcing imminent regularisations, which we Socialists fully understand and respect, incidentally.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, do not allow yourselves to be led by the Spanish People's Party, which is firing blanks at the Spanish Government.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, on his work.
I believe that this is a very rigorous, very interesting and very well executed piece of work on a genuinely difficult subject.
I think that one might speak in terms of an agreement in several stages.
We can speak in the long term, in the medium term or in the short term.
I think that this is a good report and a good solution for the problems we in the European Union are facing and have had to face before.
The Rapid Border Intervention Teams, under common rules, will be a good instrument for providing the necessary measures to deal with people entering the European Union illegally.
On the other hand, I think that Europe needs a common policy on immigration.
As a member of the European Free Alliance, I do not agree that the Member States should be the owners of the borders.
I consider that, in future, the borders of the European Union should be a common issue.
We have to work together on this issue and to consider a common policy on migration, always in accordance with the main European values and the principles of the European Union.
The European Union has to be more consistent in order to provide the best measures in these cases.
We also need to help the development of the ACP countries and, in particular, our neighbours in the southern Mediterranean.
Finding a solution in this part of the world is a guarantee for a solution to our current problem.
Solving problems in the countries from which people are migrating to the European Union is the main basis for avoiding this sometimes tragic situation.
It is not only the Member States but the whole European Union that should be aware of immigration policy, including regions with constitutional powers, for example the Canary Islands.
The Government of the Canary Islands should have had something to say in the recent crisis in this part of the world.
I would like to remark that today is the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Almansa, when the country of Valencia was defeated and the end of the Catalan nation began.
I think the regions, the stateless nations and all the political bodies in the European Union have something to say on issues of this kind.
As I said, I think that the report is complete, very good and very interesting.
We have some fears, perhaps from a sense of responsibility, including one that the teams' actions might prevent people from seeking protection, thereby denying them the right to asylum under international conventions.
We saw it when we were talking to migrants who had illegally entered the Canary Islands.
It is not easy for these people to ask for asylum when they really want to, because information does not flow appropriately and because of other circumstances.
The Verts/ALE Group's position is that the Rapid Border Intervention Teams form part of the toolbox developed under the Frontex Regulation and are to be used in particular to meet more urgent support requirements at external borders.
So it could be argued that the pros and cons are closely linked to the group's position on the operations of Frontex.
We see the regulation as an instrument for immediate action in this sense.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Deprez for the work he has done, which is enabling us to adopt his report at first reading.
That demonstrates his ability to mediate with the political groups, the Council and the Commission.
I want to thank him even though I maintain all my reservations about this regulation, because I think that in reality its only purpose is to attribute a function to FRONTEX, that useless little agency set up by the Community institutions, which did not perform any function at all until yesterday.
I believe that setting up Rapid Border Intervention Teams is merely a propaganda exercise, because it is quite clear that in reality the EU's illegal immigration crisis is not coming from southern Europe or from the boats that arrive by sea.
That is amply demonstrated by all the available data and statistics.
Even the Commission says that only 14% of the illegal immigrants living in Europe arrive by sea.
I therefore do not understand the need to set up these rapid intervention teams.
The same also applies to the southern European countries - Italy, Spain and also Malta, a country that we ought to help.
Mr Borg certainly realises better than I do that we ought to try and help Malta, probably by amending the Dublin II regulation, and not by calling for rapid intervention teams that will find it difficult to intervene in that sea area and to tell whether they are in Italian or Maltese waters.
I believe, therefore, that we should try to implement a consistent, serious policy on this matter, probably by taking a different approach entirely.
That is why I repeat that the only serious function that these rapid intervention teams can have is to save lives at sea.
Mr Deprez, the question is not whether policemen are good or bad.
It has been amply demonstrated in recent years that disasters at sea are on the increase.
There are statistics that show beyond a shadow of a doubt that thousands and thousands of people have drowned in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
I therefore believe that there is a purpose for rapid intervention teams whose priority it is to rescue all the men and women that are trying to reach Europe.
It would not be superfluous, in my view, to stress that need in the report we are examining, and I therefore call on the House and Mr Deprez to support my amendment, which unequivocally states that one of the primary functions of these teams should be sea rescue.
I think that if we choose this way of thinking we can seriously help to make immigration policy and external border control a joint activity that is useful to the European Union.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the rapid handling of his report, which bodes well for the rapid intervention teams.
Last year, I was fortunate enough to join Mr Deprez and others on a visit to the Frontex agency in Warsaw, and this turned out to be a particularly valuable experience.
The agency was still in its infancy and work was gathering pace, with high expectations of it on the part of the public and politicians, something that can lead to disappointing results.
After all, the Frontex mandate is limited.
For the deployment of rapid intervention teams, the agency relies on the Member States working together.
Although I am concerned about the proposal's implementation on two scores, Commissioner Borg may be able to respond and allay my concern in this connection.
My first concern is about the availability of manpower and equipment.
The Member States that are signed up to Frontex have committed to cooperation, and only in exceptional cases can they back out of that.
I should like to hear from the Commissioner what exceptions the Member States have managed to secure.
Also, has this been described in sufficient detail, so that Frontex can have the people and equipment available within the prescribed time?
My second concern is about coordination in the Member States.
After all, Frontex requires specifically trained people.
Moreover, particularly in the Mediterranean region, sea-worthy equipment is essential.
It strikes me that it is mainly the defence organisation of the Member States that is able to make these people and this equipment available, while justice ministers make pledges at Council level in this area.
Accordingly, in my country, the justice minister has to consult the defence and home affairs ministers about the commitment of persons and equipment.
Each minister is fighting his own corner in this respect.
Can the Commissioner indicate whether this coordination problem also occurs in other Member States and to what extent the defence organisations are affected?
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mr Deprez for the hard work he has put into this report and to offer him my heartiest congratulations on having reached a compromise with the Council in such a short time on such an important and urgent subject.
The waves of illegal immigration such as were seen last summer on the EU's southern borders do not affect only the Member States directly involved, but rather all the Member States in the Union.
In Sicily, as Mr Catania knows only too well, one can see how urgent it is to address and resolve the problem.
In the coming months, as happens every year, illegal immigrants will be landing on Lampedusa and other islands relentlessly, day and night, in terrible weather and in extremely unsafe conditions.
The effective management of our external borders therefore requires realistic prevention policies for internal security and policies to combat illegal entry and people trafficking.
Setting up Rapid Border Intervention Teams is an initial, practical, joint-reaction measure, based on solidarity, respect for human rights and mutual assistance among the Member States, which are called on to take part in them by contributing financial and human resources.
Our national police forces can no longer be left on their own to carry out the massive task of defending our borders and also, more importantly, of receiving and aiding illegal immigrants.
Our citizens cannot go on living with this lack of security and stability and are constantly asking us for concrete measures to combat the organised criminal gangs that run the business of moving people illegally and all too often supply the clandestine work and prostitution market.
In order to meet these requests, I hope that the members of the rapid intervention teams can start work straight away this summer.
At the same time, we must continue our efforts on this front and go on seeking the best solutions to the immigration issue.
The Italian Government's bill is not, in my view, a step in this direction; rather than conducting a serious fight against illegal immigration alongside us, that government has chosen to go ahead with contradictory, improvised policies that are bound to cause serious repercussions throughout the European Union.
Commissioner, since there is a pressing need to ensure continuity between the European Union and its Member States, I urge you to devote the utmost attention to this burning issue, so that our overriding commitment to help the weak can be increasingly combined with our growing need for security.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Deprez most sincerely for his work on this subject and in other areas; as usual, it was outstanding.
This project has taken us a step forward.
Solidarity between Member States is strengthened and responsibility shared.
We cannot allow countries like Spain, Malta or Italy to be left on their own with this problem.
We must also look at the green border, however.
There is large-scale immigration there, too.
For us socialists, however, it is also crucial that all aspects of human rights should be more than just on paper, that there should be no discrimination and that we in Parliament should check how this is translated into practice.
What happens to the people who are sent back?
Will they be handed back to these governments, some of which are corrupt?
We have seen the disaster in Morocco, when the people who were sent back were simply taken out into the Sahara and they would have preferred to let them die of thirst there without any water.
We must also include these matters and give them equal consideration.
We must not see FRONTEX and the Intervention Team as a panacea.
They are an instrument, but not the solution to the problem.
We need a common migration policy, not just a common deportation policy.
We do not need a new defensive wall for Europe, or an iron curtain in the Atlantic or the Mediterranean, what we need to do is to tackle the problem head on.
And that includes pressing on with solving the problems in the countries from which the migrants come.
Let me tell you something.
If climate change gets worse, if the governments in the countries of origin become even more corrupt and remain corrupt, then we will have to expect an even greater influx.
Because we would do no differently, we would also seek our fortune somewhere else instead of dying of hunger or in poverty.
My congratulations again on the report.
I am glad we have done it.
We as Parliament must then also keep an eye on how things progress.
(EL) Mr President, is it really necessary that we use rapid border intervention teams with state-of-the-art equipment, who have the right to make arrests, bear arms, have the right to use their weapons in the name of self-defence, use violence and act like special forces with advanced technological equipment, that is act as a military force, in order to deal with ragged immigrants or save those battling the seas in an attempt to find a better life?
Do you really want us to believe that these forces will be used for these reasons?
We consider that this Regulation and report reveals the true nature of your policy, which is aggressive: you are creating rapid intervention teams for external operations; rapid intervention teams which can be used to deal with any type of crisis, even turn against their own people.
We disagree.
I think that your arguments that these teams will combat the mafia, underestimate common sense.
If the political will exists, all these smugglers will be found and the mafia will be dealt with.
How is it possible that these illegal immigrants can find them when various police agencies fail to do so?
But no such political will exists because the mafia is the one supplying European capital with cheap 'meat', cheap labour, immigrants that is.
If you are really trying to save illegal immigrants, why do you not give more money to create national agencies that will intervene and save the lives of these people?
We do not agree.
We find this anti-democratic, it is moving towards the direction of suppression of the masses, as is your entire policy.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by agreeing with Mr DÃ­az de Mera and Mr Castiglione, both from my group, in their praise for the rapporteur Mr Deprez, who has provided us with a characteristically excellent report.
Mr Deprez made strenuous efforts to reach a compromise between all of the political groups and the Council, with a view to obtaining agreement at first reading.
This is a most welcome initiative at a time when Europe is enduring the most significant migratory crisis in its history.
The massive influx of illegal immigrants to European shores has made it imperative for us to adopt measures as a matter of urgency.
Although the regions most directly affected are those of southern Europe, this problem cannot be viewed as exclusive to those Member States and regions.
Irregular mass immigration and the humanitarian tragedy that it represents have consequences for security and cohesion throughout the European Community.
I applaud the various operational measures relating to the management of our external maritime borders to the south, such as the establishment of an operational control centre to coordinate a patrol network for the Mediterranean coastline and the setting up of a central register of available technical equipment for use in control and monitoring of the external borders, whereby the necessary resources - for example boats, helicopters and aeroplanes - will be supplied for use in joint operations.
I also warmly welcome the creation of rapid border intervention teams, which will offer rapid technical and operational assistance to those Member States that may require it.
This will be a way of enhancing solidarity and mutual assistance between Member States.
This regulation concerns the deployment of rapid border intervention teams in order to provide rapid assistance in the event of a repetition of previous situations, for example in the Canary Islands.
I agree that assistance must be provided for a limited period, in exceptional situations or emergencies, and following a request by the Member State concerned.
Mr President, the European agency Frontex should play a crucial role in coordinating this assistance, which it should do promptly and effectively.
Within five days, a decision is made, and a plan drawn up, specifying the duration, geographical location, the mission to be undertaken, the composition, number and profile of experts that each Member State is to supply to the team.
All of us - in Parliament, the Commission and the Council - have to deliver the necessary human and financial resources at institutional level for the mission to proceed effectively.
(PL) Mr President, thank you very much for your patience.
Just today Polish MEPs from various political groups met the head of the Polish Border Guards who is also the communications officer at our embassy in Belgium.
He informed us in detail about the severity of the problem we are discussing today.
I am a representative of Poland, which after Finland has the European Union's longest external land border.
This makes the issue of effectively managing the external borders through control and protection and by combating illegal emigration and human trafficking a very relevant one to us.
The groups we are discussing today will become all the more necessary as the EU becomes an increasingly attractive economic haven for migrants from several continents, as well as the former Soviet Union.
I agree with Mr Coelho's statements about the vast impending crisis that awaits us.
The only condition for setting up the Rapid Border Intervention Teams is our full agreement with the motion of the Member State whose borders are affected by the problem.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, illegal immigration has come to assume epidemic proportions.
Conservative estimates put the number of illegal immigrants in Europe at about 15 million.
You need only compare the figures for 2005 and 2006 to see that their number has multiplied sixfold.
Smuggling people into the EU has become big business and is part of the phenomenon of organised crime.
In this situation, many Member States are quite simply overburdened.
They cannot be left in the lurch; they need help.
That is where the EU scheme comes in.
I welcome the fact that Frontex has been created, all the more so in view of the imminent establishment of a functioning instrument, in the form of the Rapid Border Intervention Teams, that can provide assistance within a particular area for a limited period of time at the request of Member States, and I also welcome the clear indication that, as Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra emphasised, responsibility for guarding borders will remain in the hands of the Member States.
The RABITs will render short-term assistance - we must be clear about that.
For the medium and long term we need additional measures.
I expect a cooperation agreement to materialise between Frontex and Europol so that the crime of human smuggling can be more effectively combated; I also expect illegal residence to have consequences - we need to think about repatriation aid in this context - and I expect an immediate end to mass legalisation, for that invariably creates a knock-on effect and shifts the problems to other countries.
Moreover, we also need education campaigns as a preventive measure, so that potential migrants can learn how legal immigration works, what the consequences of illegal immigration are and what risks it entails.
We also need stabilisation and aid programmes in migrants' countries of origin.
With these RABITs, we in the European Union are certainly demonstrating that we are on the way towards a security union and that we are reflecting at the same time on how we can solve migration problems, and especially the problem of illegal immigration, in the medium and long term.
Let me close by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent coordination.
Mr President, I first wish to join with my colleagues in thanking Mr Deprez the rapporteur for his excellent work and in particular for completing this report in time for first reading.
I warmly welcome this law because it is a solidarity instrument.
Coming from a southern Member State I welcome it even more, because I appreciate that solidarity does not come easy and it does not come cheap.
This law means that Member States are now binding themselves to assist other countries that face difficulty.
As Mr Deprez said, this solidarity is compulsory and not optional.
This makes it real solidarity.
It is not charity, because charity is voluntary.
This is a binding commitment.
Thanks to this law, countries facing emergency situations on immigration will finally start to feel that they are no longer completely on their own.
Therefore this law is a good step forward.
However, on its own it is not enough to overcome the challenge of illegal immigration.
We must, therefore, avoid raising public expectations that this law will solve everything: it will not.
Therefore we must also do more to strengthen the southern borders of the Union.
Last November the European Commission issued a communication on strengthening the southern maritime borders and I call on the Commission to press on with the initiatives listed in this communication.
Let us not forget that external border control is in the interests of all Member States and not just the countries facing difficulties and once it is in everybody's interest, it must also be everybody's responsibility - a shared responsibility.
Thank you very much, Mr Busuttil. Thank you, too, for your understanding.
I know that you would have liked to have spoken in Maltese this evening, but unfortunately our teams were unavailable, and I would thank you for your flexibility.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have achieved an important objective this evening, because the agreement on Rapid Border Intervention Teams has shown that all the EU institutions have realised that illegal immigration is a serious problem that cannot be faced alone by the regions exposed to massive migratory flows on account of their geographical location.
As we pointed out in the report on islands that was adopted in this Chamber, Europe cannot remain indifferent to the ongoing emergency situation in regions like my own, Sicily, with its peak in Lampedusa, or in the Canaries or Malta, which are unsustainably burdened by the arrival of illegal immigrants.
It cannot remain indifferent to the human tragedy of the makeshift boats that sink in the Mediterranean, or to the organised crime that takes advantage of those people's desperation.
With the opening-up of our internal borders, our external borders have become our common frontier and, therefore, suitable, long-term solutions to the immigration issue can only be found at a European level.
The creation of rapid intervention teams is certainly only a start.
Europe needs to move quickly towards approving a legal immigration policy, since such an important issue cannot be left just in the hands of governments.
The Italian Government has just passed a law that changes and amends previous legislation, but these cannot be seen as permanent solutions that can lead to reception and the building of a better future.
Europe as a whole must do the opposite.
It must draw up a legal immigration policy that can manage all immigration, which, like the wind, cannot be stopped but must be controlled.
(PL) Mr President, Rapid intervention teams have the opportunity of becoming an effective tool for the Member States and FRONTEX, although incidentally this is nothing new for FRONTEX.
We have already been involved in joint operations before.
We need rapid intervention teams, but provided that they are not used as a way of shifting responsibility for patrolling one's own border, which according to the present treaties is the responsibility of the Member States.
It is therefore important that these teams be reserved for real crisis situations falling beyond the scope of previous risk analyses.
Only then will the Member States have the right and the obligation to implement the mechanisms of European solidarity.
I am well aware that the burden of controlling the EU's external borders is distributed unevenly among the Member States.
There are southern states with difficult sea borders, and countries with long land borders.
The teams, together with other elements in an integrated border management system, which I mention here as an important resource for our external borders, will contribute to improved cooperation and coordination of efforts and will help to combat illegal migration and people trafficking.
However, I do expect FRONTEX and RABITS to have consideration for the rights and needs of people crossing the border in good faith.
For this reason we also need to improve coordination as regards border services for this kind of traveller.
As regards RABITS I would like to point out the need for public information explaining the rapid intervention teams, and what the rights and duties of ordinary people are when they encounter these teams in order to avoid misunderstandings and unclear situations.
This will require information campaigns.
Finally, I would like to express my pleasure at the consensus we have found as regards setting up these teams and congratulate Mr Deprez on his excellent report.
Mr President, as I mentioned earlier, the Commission strongly welcomes the compromise reached between the three institutions on this file.
It is an important step in the cooperation between Member States and is an excellent example of solidarity in dealing with border controls.
With regard to the points raised during the debate, in particular by Mr Blokland, let me state that at the Justice and Home Affairs Council last week most Member States had already put technical equipment, etc. at the disposal of Frontex for joint operations.
In addition, Vice-President Frattini invited those Member States which have not already done so to consider making contributions.
On the other point concerning coordination, let me clarify that Frontex will coordinate operations involving the competent authorities of the many Member States concerned.
I should like to conclude by congratulating Mr Deprez the rapporteur on his hard work, and I welcome the agreement reached between the institutions on the Rapid Border Intervention Teams Regulation.
I repeat that it is an excellent example of solidarity and operational cooperation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - Existing external border control surveillance lacks the appropriate and sufficient resources to effectively combat illegal immigration and trafficking of human beings.
This problem does not pertain to one country or one region but to all Member States.
In this context Mr Deprez's report highlights the various shortcomings and addresses on the real issues surrounding the deployment of the Rapid Border Intervention Teams.
Admittedly the creation of this Rapid Intervention Team is a positive step in the right direction and therefore all the appropriate funds should be allocated in order to make this project function in a viable manner.
The effective management of external border control only resolves a small part of this fundamental issue.
Unfortunately I feel the institutions, especially the Council, are not tackling this tragic problem with the necessary commitment and urgency it deserves.
The serious application of the principle of burden-sharing is far from been implemented in a concrete and tangible manner.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, in the eyes of EU law, Member States themselves, including Poland, are responsible for controlling their external borders.
Unfortunately we have to say that the aid currently provided at a European level for responses at the external borders, and the protection of these borders is not enough.
It is an issue that cannot be ignored because controlling the external borders of the European Union is really about combating people trafficking and illegal immigration on the one hand, and on the other averting threats to the internal security of Member States, public order, public health and international relations.
Border controls are therefore not just in the interest of the Member State that has the border, but it is equally important for all Member States that have removed controls on their internal borders.
The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) has already been set up by order of the Council.
We now need to take the next step, which is to create rapid intervention teams that would be sent to the territory of a Member State needing such assistance, but which would not be designed to provide long-term support.
However, coordinating the composition, training and dispatch of such rapid intervention teams to borders should be the mandate of the Agency.
This approach will increase solidarity and mutual assistance among Member States.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, immigration is all too often hailed as a resource, even a vital resource, but that underestimates the terrible effects on those who really have to suffer it.
The ones who leave their peoples and countries are often not the poorest, but qualified young people and also - leaving aside any demagogy - people who are a potential workforce for organised crime in the host countries.
The need to establish common rules on the duties of border guards and rapid intervention teams is justified by the waves of individuals pushing at the Union's borders.
These migratory flows supply the hateful traffic in human beings, in tragic and well-known circumstances, and I hold politicians to be morally complicit in this if they claim that it is right and appropriate or even our duty to receive these people, without taking account of their reasons or of whether they can be received.
Italy has even decided to accept everyone who turns up on its borders, without anyone having to guarantee that they will provide work and hospitality.
In such a situation, I wonder what the measures that have been announced are good for.
In Italy, they will only serve to provide assistance, and they will help the illegal arrival of people who will then go and fill the coffers of the NGOs.
What use is a European agency to manage cooperation on our external borders if the Member States' immigration policies are so different?
It is no use at all, unless it is to spend more taxpayers' money and to play at demagogy, which only results in social unrest and disorder.
Public Finances in the EMU 2006 (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Lauk, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Public Finances in EMU 2006.
I would point out that Mr Schwab is standing in for the rapporteur.
deputy rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, at this late hour, I am pleased that we are speaking about the economic and monetary union of the EU.
The European Parliament, in this report presented on its own initiative, expresses itself for the first time on the revised version of the Stability and Growth Pact, adopted by the Heads of State or Government in March 2005.
The revision concerned both the preventive and the remedial elements of the Pact.
The aim of the Pact was and remains the avoidance of an excessive deficit and the achievement in the medium and long term of a balanced budget and sound public finances.
The present report is an appraisal based on one year. The reference period, in other words, is very short - too short, in fact; moreover, it covers the year 2006, a year characterised by very favourable economic trends.
These trends had a beneficial impact on the fiscal policies of the Member States.
It goes without saying that an assessment based entirely on this brief period cannot be the last word.
The real endurance test for the revised Pact awaits us in the coming years.
The report is an appraisal of the current situation.
The rapporteur, Kurt Joachim Lauk, who unfortunately cannot be with us this evening, has deliberately avoided naming the various Member States and assessing their individual levels of performance.
The point of this report was not to award exam marks; the rapporteur saw no value in that approach.
What the report can usefully do is to make a general assessment of achievements to date.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has dealt in great depth with this report, and our exchanges were highly constructive and fruitful.
On behalf of Mr Lauk, may I offer a special word of thanks to Mr Rosati, shadow rapporteur for the Socialists, and to his Liberal counterpart, Mrs in 't Veld, for their close and constructive cooperation.
The report was adopted by an overwhelming majority in committee.
I only intend to deal briefly with the main points.
The statistical surveys show that the spread in deficit and growth levels is too wide as well as demonstrating a correlation between high deficits and low growth rates.
The figures for 2006 show that the 21 Member States with low deficits or even slight surpluses also had high growth rates.
This substantiates the view that reducing deficits stimulates activity and improves economic output, thereby cutting unemployment.
Against this backdrop, the report highlighted three key points.
Firstly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs argues strenuously in this report that the economic good times should be used to put public budgets on a sound structural footing.
The Member States must take advantage of the economic upturn, and particularly of increases in tax revenue, to reduce their public debts.
We must keep reminding ourselves that a stimulation of growth leads to higher demand and higher employment levels.
On a critical note, it must be said that the Member States are not making sufficient use of the favourable cyclical climate to consolidate their budgets.
Secondly, we call on the Member States to declare new public debt unconstitutional or unlawful by 2015, as has already been done by certain states and regions in the European Union.
The amendment to paragraph 20 tabled by the rapporteur, Kurt Joachim Lauk, is designed to clarify the scope of this call.
It states that what is being proposed is a binding obligation on the Member States within the euro zone alone, not on all 27 Member States of the European Union.
This seems logical, and may I ask you on behalf of the rapporteur to approve this amendment, tabled on behalf of the PPE_DE Group.
Thirdly, the report calls for the Member States' debts and deficits to be calculated in such a way as to make the figures comparable.
This is an important point, because a common basis for assessing the actual level of debt is essential in the context of increasing convergence within the framework of European economic and monetary union.
Allow me, in these last twenty seconds, to make two final remarks.
By and large, the revised Stability and Growth Pact worked well in 2006.
It remains a rule-based framework.
Since it was revised, all deficits equivalent to more than 3% of GDP have been regarded as excessive.
Nevertheless, the slow pace at which the level of public debt is being reduced in all Member States is a source of concern.
In the short term, then, the Stability and Growth Pact has worked.
Whether it will work in the long term remains to be seen.
The real test of its resilience will come in the next few years.
We expect the Member States to do whatever it takes to make the Pact succeed.
Mr President, the Commission warmly welcomes Mr Lauk's report and is grateful for the high-quality work of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
With a strong economic recovery currently under way in Europe and in the euro area, Member States have an outstanding opportunity to improve their public finances and to prepare for future challenges, such as the ageing population.
In this context, Mr Lauk's report is a very timely one.
The Commission clearly agrees with the report's statement that the revised Stability and Growth Pact is so far working as it should.
In particular, many Member States have made considerable efforts to meet their obligations under the Pact.
Since the reform of the Pact, both the corrective and preventative arms have been fully applied in accordance with the reform's provisions.
In addition, it is clear that there has been no leniency in the enforcement of the reformed Pact.
Last year, a significant improvement in the general government deficit in the euro area, and in the individual Member States, was accomplished.
For the euro area, the improvement was 0.9%, in nominal terms, and hence also appears likely to be higher in structural terms than the 0.3% expected by the Commission last autumn.
The overall economic prospects for 2007 are equally encouraging.
The ongoing presence of cyclically favourable conditions in the euro area calls for further fiscal consolidation efforts in 2007 and beyond.
Adjustment towards the medium-term budgetary objectives should be stepped up and pro-cyclical budgetary policies ought to be avoided.
Euro-area Finance Ministers confirmed last week their commitment to make full use of current economic growth and better-than-expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies, as well as to use unexpected extra revenues for deficit and debt reduction.
The Commission also shares Parliament's concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of public finances and is putting increased emphasis on its assessment.
In this respect, a new report on the long-term sustainability of public finances in the European Union was issued by the Commission in October 2006.
That report is based on EU common ageing-related expenditure projections.
It confirms the importance of addressing the sustainability challenge with a combination of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.
The Commission has continued its work on incorporating sustainability considerations in setting the medium-term budgetary objectives.
Indeed, the improvement of fiscal balances in the medium term contributes to meeting the long-term sustainability implications.
Another key development is the emphasis on improving the quality of public spending, in line with the Lisbon Strategy.
That policy guideline is indeed part of the integrated guidelines adopted by the European Council in March this year.
The Commission is also grateful for the report's recognition of the efforts made to improve statistical governance.
The Commission recently reported to Parliament and to the Council on the quality of the data submitted by Member States.
Finally, while the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact has delivered the expected results, the picture is more mixed regarding the preventative arm.
National fiscal rules and institutions can play an important role in this respect.
Progress was made last year in this field, and the Commission is currently working on further improving the effectiveness of the Pact's preventative arm.
In this context, I fully appreciate Parliament's support for this approach.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schwab's defence of Mr Lauk's report was so brilliant and so accurate that I am going to continue broadly in the same vein as him.
I share Mr Schwab's concern with regard to the progress of public debt.
We grew much more last year than in previous years, we have come closer to our growth potential, but public debt remains below the limits that we ourselves set in the Treaty of Maastricht.
According to all of the indicators, we will have good growth next year, but we will grow less than last year, and that means that public debt will continue to cause concern.
I would once again agree with the rapporteur and the Commissioner in saying that this concern is all the more urgent if we take account of the projections on the development of the population, what is known as the ageing of the population, which may be one of the great challenges of the century we have just begun.
Life expectancy is increasing, birth rates are still extremely low, and that means that the working-age population will be smaller and that, therefore, sooner or later, the labour market will contract and, as a result, we will have far more beneficiaries of the system and far fewer people contributing to the social security coffers.
Neither I nor Mr Schwab, who is a Christian Democrat like me, believe that the viability of the social protection system can be called into question.
We need to seek foundations to strengthen it, which make it possible for us to fulfil our social obligations.
There are certain recommendations in Mr Lauk's report that I would like to stress, and I shall add a few of my own.
I agree that we should establish comparable bases for the budgets so that we can make comparisons homogeneous, but I would like us to borrow an accounting technique from the private sector, a form of budget forecasting, in order to take account of the obligations of which we are aware.
It seems to me to be obvious that we should take advantage of good times to reduce public debt further, but we are not doing so, or we are not doing so sufficiently.
Thirdly, I believe that we must rethink our entire system of public spending and revenue in order to make our economies more productive, so that we have more resources, amongst other things in order to meet social welfare spending needs.
I believe that we should stop looking at the retirement age as something that represents an obligation and think in terms of a right that opens up the possibility of retiring and orient public finances, since we are talking about public finances, in a way that encourages people to remain in work for longer.
Finally, I believe that we should consider replacing social security contributions, as a fundamental core - practically the only one - of social protection systems, with a system of taxes, essentially value-added tax, which the presidential candidate Sarkozy has brilliantly described as 'social VAT' in the debate that is taking place in that country.
I would like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, who is not here today, the person representing him and the Commissioner on having taken up the majority of our positions.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, healthy public finances are the mainstay of sustainable economic development.
I am pleased to see that in the past year there has been a significant improvement in the European Union in this regard.
However, the current positive economic situation is an opportunity to reduce debts and deficits even further.
That is why in this year's report by Mr Lauk, the European Parliament encourages Member States to make use of the favourable market situation to adjust their public finances as necessary and to speed up structural reforms such as labour market and service sector reforms, or reducing red tape for business.
I congratulate Mr Lauk on his excellent report and also thank him for his cooperation.
There are four matters to which I would like to draw your attention.
Firstly, in point 26, this year's report encourages the European Commission to explore the advantages of establishing independent national bodies in charge of determining the annual level of deficit consistently with the medium-term objective of a balanced budget.
However, through the intercession of Mr Borg, I appeal to Commissioner Alumnia to investigate whether fiscal policy councils, independent of political pressure, would be an effective instrument in fighting for a lower deficit.
This relates in particular to the better use of periods of economic boom to improve the situation in public finances.
I believe that on this matter I agree with my colleagues who have just taken the floor.
As numerous studies have shown, governments have a tendency to excessive deficits, and only implement reforms when there is a crisis.
Secondly, I should like to point out that we cannot agree with point 20, rendering a new public debt as unconstitutional.
Every government has the right to act within the framework set out by the Maastricht Treaty, which allows a public debt level of up to sixty percent.
Obviously any debt which exceeds this level can be deemed unconstitutional, which is why I would support the amendment put forward by the ALDE Group, to define the limit in this way.
Thirdly, the report stresses that the revised Stability and Growth Pact is a key instrument for maintaining budgetary discipline in the Member States.
I agree with the rapporteur that reforming the pact increased both its flexibility and its effectiveness.
For this reason we appeal to the Commission to exercise close control of the way Member States observe the Pact.
Fourthly and finally, this House recommends a study on the feasibility of introducing a uniform budgetary procedure for all Member States.
Such a procedure would incorporate both a uniform calendar for budgetary procedures and uniform assumptions regarding basic macroeconomic parameters, to be assessed in a standard way across the European Union.
In my view these changes would not only make it possible to strengthen budgetary discipline in the Member States, but would also improve the coordination of fiscal policy at EU level.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Lauk's report is an accurate description of the current situation, and is undoubtedly a lesson for the countries that have not yet joined the EMU.
Mr Lauk rightly underlined the main threats to the European Union, which are persistently high budget deficits and uncontrolled growth in budgetary expenditure because of the ageing populations in the EU.
It also says that increasing growth rates will make it possible to avoid disaster.
However, the report fails to answer the fundamental question of how this growth is to be achieved when the economies of the Member States are less competitive than world leaders, and there is no active policy to encourage families in any EU country.
Mr Lauk's report clearly shows that the EMU, which is in effect a private members' club for the EU, lacks any prescription as to how the impending threat could be avoided.
I have given two examples of how to avoid the main challenge facing the EU countries.
In EU debates, for example, delocalisation is not regarded as an opportunity, but a threat to jobs in countries where production costs are higher than in countries where they are lower.
These debates very frequently mention the 'demographic challenges', as if nobody realises that they are the result of a dramatic fall in the birth rate.
A great deal is said about avoiding pregnancy, the right to abortion, and numerous debates have been held on homophobia - today we have just had the third such debate in two years.
But what I would like to know is where is the debate on an active policy of encouraging childbirth in the EU?
Only by increasing the birth rate can we avoid the deterioration of the mysterious 'demographic challenge'.
The representatives of the Member States may debate on the maturity or otherwise of other countries, but for the countries that have adopted the euro, this is undoubtedly an important lesson.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our opinion, this report takes us in quite the wrong direction.
It squanders the opportunity to support an urgently essential change of course.
It levels not a word of criticism at the policy of the European Central Bank, which is geared exclusively to price stability and thereby curbs and strangles the growth potential of the EU.
The report merely recommends to the authors of the Member States' budgetary policies that they make spending cuts in order to lower their deficits.
Not a word does it say about the ruinous tax competition in the European Union that has been further fuelled by more cuts in business taxes.
In Germany we are currently experiencing another round in these dumping stakes.
It is perfectly obvious that public finances in the Member States would be far healthier if people of wealth and property, and above all the multinational corporations with their huge profits, were finally required to pay their fair share instead of receiving more and more tax breaks.
There is no shortage, on the other hand, of proposals in the report for a neo-liberal approach to regulatory policy.
For example, it calls for a restructuring of public expenditure with the aid of new public-private partnerships, even in the education sector.
Come hell or high water, another key area of our services of public interest is to be sacrificed to the profit motive.
The report calls on Member States to declare new public debt unconstitutional or unlawful by 2015; this, too, is downright foolhardy.
If such a ban were enforced, it would strangle any attempt to pursue a budgetary policy.
This report represents a wasted opportunity to support a European policy for development based on social justice and solidarity.
For this reason, my group will be voting against it.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the rapporteur accepts that government finances in several euro zone countries are still not in good shape.
Sovereign debts in Italy and Greece have not fallen significantly, and although deficits have been falling, this is a result of some higher economic growth helped by global recovery.
It is not evidence that the Stability Pact is working.
However, this week's news from Spain has shown that weak government finances are not the only threat to the functioning of the euro.
Spain has an awful trade deficit of 9.5% of GDP, and its construction asset price boom, which has driven domestic demand, is now definitely over.
The boom was driven by euro interest rates which had been far too low but are now too high.
Spain can now look forward to serious economic difficulties, with rising unemployment and deteriorating government finances.
The normal solution to this dilemma would be for Spain to lower its interest rates and devalue, but neither of these options is available as it shares the single currency.
There are therefore three possible outcomes.
The first: to forestall a crisis, the European Central Bank reduces the euro interest rate.
Germany would not like this, as it would lead to rising inflation; it would also mean the European Central Bank losing its hard-won reputation for holding down inflation expectations.
The second possible outcome is that Spain leaves the euro zone and re-establishes its own currency, enabling it to devalue and have suitably low interest rates.
Yes, we have come to the point when this may no longer be unthinkable.
It would lead to serious problems of private and public sector debt default that would spill over across the whole euro zone.
Other countries would not want this, which makes the third possible outcome maybe the most likely, and that is large-scale bailout by other countries, despite Maastricht rules against this, and this would be accompanied by centralisation of control over Spanish public finances.
I do not know which of these outcomes will take place, but it is time we faced up to the circumstances: Spain is a large country and the European Union would not find it easy to stand idle while it suffers in recession.
(HU) I would like personally to congratulate Mr Lauk for the excellent report, which takes a clear position regarding the lack of sustainability in public finances within the euro zone.
For my part, I consider it important to have similar analyses not only of deficits in public finances but also, for instance, of the performance of Member States as regards compliance with the criteria on inflation.
Moreover, there is room here, too, for implementing an excessive procedure.
I would like to stress five points.
First: it is impossible to analyse the annual and cumulative deficits in static fashion, independently of economic growth, since the most important task of the new Member States striving to join the euro zone is to catch up to the others.
Stimulating this is the aim of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, and as a result, higher growth can temporarily be accompanied by an annual deficit in excess of 3%.
Examples of this are the 2005 performance of the Czech Republic and the 2006 performance of Slovakia.
If the cumulative debt can be reduced, this may be considered the sign of a healthy trend.
Second: we must be especially careful that individual Member States do not attempt to conceal one-off privatised or PPP constructions and count these in the reduction of the deficit.
This practice and its danger have been clearly outlined by the rapporteur.
For those Member States that do so encourage undertakings with economically dubious results and reduce transparency.
With regard to this matter, the instruments available to the European Commission for detecting such tricks must be strengthened.
Let us see how each Member really stands; assessment considerations should only come into the picture in the event of excessive deficit procedures.
This is important not only for the stability of the euro zone, but also because deficits that are identified only afterwards, or that have been covered up, reduce the credibility of EU institutions in the Member State concerned.
This is what happened most recently in Hungary, where, with the Commission looking on, a Member State that had been performing well ended up on the brink of national bankruptcy.
This question - the political role of the Commission - should be the subject of a separate debate.
Third: in my view, the fact that the criteria for entering the euro zone are higher than those that apply to the behaviour of its existing members is a political double standard, and therefore must be changed.
This practice has never been sanctioned, yet refusing a country entry into the euro zone is itself clearly a sanction.
One could point to the French, German or Italian performance by way of an example, for in fact not a hair on anyone's head was harmed as a result, nor did even a single euro have to be paid by way of a deposit.
Fourth: from the perspective of the stability of the euro zone, I am in favour of building into national legislation a ban on further indebtedness.
Although every Member State has to resolve this problem for itself, and the situation of each is different, a minimum requirement of those in the euro area ought to be a positive primary balance.
Fifth: the main goal is to achieve the Lisbon Strategy and to improve fiscal policy, for instance with an appropriate response to the challenges presented by our aging population.
In this regard, the most important indicator is the rate of employment, which is more revealing, and gives a better measure of the sustainability of public finances, than the unemployment rate.
Therefore we should ask for this figure more frequently from the Member States that are at risk.
In addition, reducing the tax burden is also an important objective, since a good number of Member States boasts a redistribution rate in excess of 50%, while their traditions do not suggest the Scandinavian model.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like simply to say to the previous speaker that this report clearly does not relate to the issue of enlargement of the euro zone but indeed to the state of public finances within the European Union.
As such, I should like to warn this House against a temptation introduced by the rapporteur and unfortunately validated by our committee, which is to totally throw out of kilter the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact in the form in which it has been carried out, for the report proposes nothing less than for us to regard the public deficit as unconstitutional.
I hope that this House will have the wisdom to censure or put right this assessment, which I feel is completely at odds with the optimal use of public finances, which must obviously contribute to financial stability and make it possible for future generations not to have to fund our debt.
However, I also feel that, if we want to be consistent with our strategy - which requires long-term investment - the idea of regarding any public deficit as unconstitutional is a narrow-minded way of thinking, to say the least.
I should also like to emphasise that the contribution of this report to the greater coordination of economic policies and the dynamic vision of Mr Juncker and of Commissioner Almunia will enable us to progress slowly - too slowly, but safely, I hope - on the path to coordinating budgetary timetables and to taking better account of consistent macroeconomic data for the euro zone as a whole.
I have great hopes that what has just taken place at the Eurogroup, namely a dynamic discussion before each Member State launches into the definition of its own budgetary strategies, will become the rule, at the very least within the euro zone.
Allow me, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to state that, if this were to become the rule, it would obviously be important for the parliamentary dimension of such an anticipation of national budgetary strategies to be strengthened, and that would depend on constructive cooperation being established or enhanced between the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
(PL) Mr President, the rapporteur deserves our thanks for raising such an important issue and drawing attention to the challenge Member States face in the form of their ageing populations.
These words of thanks go to the rapporteur for his diagnosis and his prognosis for the disease.
However, what does arouse total opposition is the suggested cure, which is to restrict the budget deficits of the Member States, and to standardise their financial policies.
It is paradoxical that the cure is suggested by a Member representing Germany, a country that has not kept within the budget deficit limits, and which is increasing taxation, such as VAT.
The rapporteur's proposed cure arouses disagreement on many points.
Because of the time restrictions, I will only mention the two I regard as being the most important.
Firstly, only an active strategy of supporting business, reducing red tape and a radical increase in infrastructure investments, abandoning the costly policy of farming subsidies and re-allocating the money to research and development and regional development can solve the dilemma of funding pensions.
Secondly, a uniform budget and tax policy is an attempt to strait-jacket the finances of the new Member States, ignoring their specific development needs, and thereby preventing them from eliminating any development gaps.
We therefore disagree with the rapporteur's findings and take the opposite position.
The European Union needs greater freedom of budgetary and fiscal policy for its members, and only this would make it possible to eliminate the dilemma of a poor society.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report and the debate show clearly that the Stability and Growth Pact has been a success.
It is a success because this type of public debate about government finances would never have been conducted in either the Member States or the European framework if there were no Stability and Growth Pact.
It is a success because it creates clarity and certainty and defines the same objectives for everyone.
It is a success because it establishes a regulatory structure for national budgetary policies.
The Stability and Growth Pact is the European political complement to the single currency, and the single currency is our most important and successful response to globalisation.
The success of the Stability and Growth Pact is also reflected in the percentage decrease in total indebtedness and in the annual amount of new debt.
We are still far from the finishing line, however, and we now have an opportunity to speed up the process.
The economic climate provides a tailwind that can help us to remove structural defects, to step up the liberalisation drive and to rise boldly to the challenges posed by demographic trends.
Incurring debt to service debt rather than to invest in the future saddles the young people of our nations with a heavy burden.
Incurring debt to service debt means selling our future down the river.
We need the annual surplus to reduce the government deficit in every Member State and to increase our scope for future action.
May the report give us fresh impetus for the pursuit of these goals.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having sustainable public finances in the countries of the Union is of vital importance not as an aim in itself, but as a means to implement the European social model, which is characterised by research, investment, innovation and competitiveness, social cohesion, and environmental and energy sustainability.
The new, revised Stability and Growth Pact should not be seen as the only instrument for coordinating economic policies in the European Union, but it must be used in conjunction with the integrated growth and employment guidelines and with the goal of political and economic coordination of the euro zone.
The more the text we approve results in uniform procedures, common shared parameters and a joint debate on budget projections, the more significant it will be.
That does not mean, however, that we want a purely accountancy-based approach.
Ensuring that the deficit and public debt are reduced will require the implementation of strict measures, but proactive measures aiming at sustainable economic and social development are also needed.
I too should like to point out the fact that calling for the Member States to declare an excessive deficit as being nationally unconstitutional is highly debatable, not least from the legal standpoint of the formulation of relations of subsidiarity between the Union and the Member States.
To conclude, I think it is important to emphasise what role we want to play, that is to say, to lay the foundations for a sustainable European public finance system aimed at growth.
(PL) Mr President, in my contribution to the debate on the report on public finances in the EMU countries for 2006, I would like to make a few observations.
Firstly, while it is true that the public finances of the majority of EU countries improved significantly in 2006, I have serious doubts as to whether this is a result of the reform of the Stability and Development Pact as the Commission makes out. In my view it is more likely the result of a good economic climate.
Secondly, despite these improvements I do not regard the public finance situation in individual Member States as satisfactory.
In spite of the good economic climate, only three of the countries in the euro zone returned budget surpluses.
Over half of the countries in the zone have a public deficit in excess of 60% of GDP.
Thirdly, I should point out that the state of public finances in the new Member States is better than in the old members, for example, the average public debt in the euro zone was over 63% in the old fifteen, while it does not exceed the 60% threshold in the new twelve.
And fourthly, I would like to state that despite the revision of the Pact, the Commission's favouritism towards the largest Member States has not changed.
It continues to tolerate significant deficits, and even public debt among these countries, which contrasts with its strict attitude to the smaller Member States, and in particular the newly accepted members.
Mr President, on behalf of Commissioner Almunia, I would like to thank you for this very constructive debate.
He sends his apologies for not being here today owing to other unavoidable work engagements.
As mentioned by Members, the strong economic recovery currently under way in Europe and in the euro area presents Member States with an opportunity to improve public finances to prepare for future challenges such as the ageing population.
As a result of this, the Commission published its report on the long-term sustainability of public finances in October 2006 and emphasises the importance of addressing the sustainability challenge in the context of ageing-related expenditure.
The Commission considers the idea of setting a uniform calendar for budgetary procedures across the EU an interesting one.
We need, however, to be prudent, since it would need the support of the Member States.
Furthermore, its practical implementation would be somewhat complicated.
Having said that, last Friday the Ecofin informal meeting dealt with the medium-term review of stability objectives ahead of the Member States' preparation of national budgets.
This is an important step towards a more consistent and coordinated way of establishing national budgets.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote on this item will take place tomorrow, at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - The worsening budget deficit in some of the new Member States calls for determined and sustained action to implement, through adjusted convergence programmes, a viable fiscal consolidation strategy.
Nevertheless, arbitrariness in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is likely to reduce incentives for fiscal adjustment in these Member States.
This report on Public Finances in EMU 2006 is therefore an opportunity to raise concerns about too rigid an approach when it comes to deal with the management of excessive public deficits.
To avoid the regular infringements by Member States facing difficulties in balancing their public finances, the SGP should remain an incentive to induce fiscal adjustment in EU members and thus the revision should avoid the emergence of an increased arbitrariness in the implementation of the SGP.
Of course, fiscal discipline is a key element in the convergence of the income levels of new Member States with the EU-15.
However, increased implementation transparency avoiding rigid and arbitrary procedures, as well as better comparability and reliability of data are necessary not only to facilitate new Member States' entry into the single currency, but also for the prospect of genuinely enhancing growth and competitiveness in these countries.
Strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement: Strengthening European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers.
Mr President, honourable Members, keeping workers informed and consulting with them is a significant element of the European Social Model's response to the challenges posed by globalisation, economic competition and technological change.
Included in that response is change management, the anticipation of change and social dialogue.
I do not have to remind the House of the importance the Commission attaches to European Works Councils.
They enable us to reduce the imbalance arising from inadequate representation, in other words due to the fact that a growing number of decisions are taken at supranational level, whereas the law on informing employees and problem resolution is implemented mainly at national level.
They provide support for the social partners in each country and facilitate general understanding of the strategic problems of businesses and the search for solutions.
In particular they allow for the anticipation and management of change.
In the era of globalisation, Europe must address a number of economic and social problems.
We are well aware that business restructuring is something feared not only by the employees affected but also by other citizens.
We also know that when it comes to addressing this phenomenon there is only one possible approach, and that is to be decisive, proactive and dynamic.
The EU must contribute towards preparing for the changes brought about by restructuring and towards managing them in a responsible way - whether by means of the structural funds, in particular the European Social Fund or through political dialogue in the context of the restructuring forums introduced by the Commission - and towards the implementation of the Community's regulatory framework for the information and consultation of workers.
The recent situation in the VW car works demonstrated in particular the need to inform and consult with workers in the decision-making process at the earliest opportunity, so that they are prepared for restructuring and so that this is carried out in everyone's best interests.
European Works Councils must be capable of carrying out this function in the context of supranational operations.
How to achieve this goal?
First and foremost, is essential to ensure compliance with Community legislation when it comes to informing and consulting with employees.
I would emphasise, though, that the task of upholding Community legislation falls primarily to the Member States.
Questions should also be asked about the review of the Directive on European Works Councils.
I am well aware of how sensitive this issue is.
As you know, the Commission initiated the process of reviewing the Directive on European Works Councils in 2004.
In the context of the 2005 communication on restructuring and employment the Commission encouraged the European social partners to enter negotiations on this issue.
The social partners have incorporated support and evaluation of the joint texts relating to European Works Councils and restructuring into their working programmes for 2006 to 2008.
We await the results of this work with great interest.
I know that the social partners have different approaches to the issue of European Works Councils.
Everyone agrees that there is an increasing need for social dialogue at a national level, and many are aware that the work of the European Works Councils is often overlooked or underestimated.
The question is whether a review of the European legal framework will improve the way they function or whether it would be enough to step up the exchange of tried and tested approaches between the social partners.
We welcome all proposals contributing to the development of the legal framework.
It appears that this development will prove useful in guaranteeing greater cohesion and effectiveness when it comes to informing and consulting with workers, reducing legal uncertainty in cases involving major changes to the size of businesses, and clarifying the extent of the process of informing and consulting with employees at European and national level and the role it has to play.
It is clear that the Commission's initiative takes account of actions initiated by the social partners with a view to supporting the use of proven approaches.
It also takes account of the requirements of the Economic and Social Committee.
The Commission will support the search for solutions arising from the partnership and linking up the economic, social and environmental aspects.
This approach is also backed in the 2005 Commission communication on restructuring and employment and the 2006 communication on corporate responsibility.
The Commission awaits with interest Parliament's resolution on the issue, which will play an important role regarding the Commission's next steps.
The Commission is ready to discuss the issue of informing and consulting with workers with Parliament.
Thank you.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin with a special word of thanks to Commissioner Å pidla for his remarks on the subject of information and consultation of workers.
We all know how much importance attaches to workers' participatory rights as a source of good industrial relations and as the basis of a contented and motivated workforce.
That is why these rights are also, and indeed particularly, in the interests of companies and employers.
We in Europe can be proud of our tradition of worker participation.
These rights feature prominently among our economic success factors.
Although consultation rights vary between Member States of the EU - in the country I come from, for instance, worker participation extends to a right of codetermination in the realm of business management - information and consultation rights are undoubtedly part of what we call the European social model.
The European Works Council Directive of 1994 is acknowledged as the pinnacle of Community legislation in this field.
By common accord, it has proved its worth too; one token of its necessity was the fact that some companies with operations in several countries had voluntarily established works councils even before the Directive entered into force.
I also believe that now, in 2007, the time has come to revise the Directive.
The 1994 Directive had actually designated 1999 as the revision date.
There have been many changes since the Directive was enacted.
Corporate economic structures have changed, and globalisation has made further advances, but the expectations of employees and those who represent their interests have grown too.
As representatives of the people in Europe, we shall gladly play our part in adapting the rules to the changes in the world of business and employment, for we all know that the only successful employers of the future will be those who act responsibly and with due regard to the rights and welfare of their employees, while well-informed employees who are involved in corporate decision-making processes will give of their best and be committed to the success of their company.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Airbus, Alcatel, Lucent and Delphi Systems are just the latest in a never-ending stream of instances of major restructuring that have led delegations of workers to come to us complaining of breaches of EU information and consultation laws, not just the Works Council Directive, but others too: directives on collective redundancies and transfers dating from the 1970s, and the Directive establishing a General Framework for Information and Consultation of Workers.
We have quite a body of information on consultation laws, but the inconsistencies and contradictions between them and the loopholes in them mean that they are often avoided altogether.
There is often no attempt at meaningful information or consultation in good time in avoiding or mitigating job losses.
We urgently need a clear definition of the concepts of information and consultation in EU law.
We have different definitions in several different directives.
The Works Council Directive does not define either notion clearly, while the later directives on a company statute and the general framework have different definitions.
This is an open door to abuse and avoidance.
The need for a revision to the Works Council Directive is now glaringly obvious: it was due for revision eight years ago.
The deficiencies and loopholes are well known: failure to provide timely information and consultation, to fully recognise the role of trade unions, to provide expert support, the inadequacy of sanctions, the misuse of confidentiality rules to withhold information and so on.
These deficiencies must now be addressed to give workers the effective tools they need.
I know there is a view that a revision should not be launched because we might end up with a weaker, not a stronger, instrument.
The view of my group is that the avoidance and abuse of this legislation is now of such scale and breadth that we have nothing to lose in insisting on a revision.
I urge the Commissioner to bring that provision forward as a matter of urgency.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) At a time when we are celebrating the 33rd anniversary of the April Revolution in my country, Portugal, it is with particular pleasure that I am here in this Chamber talking about strengthening the legislation on the information and consultation of workers.
As we all know, the directives on the information and consultation of workers and the European Works Councils lay down that information should be made available regarding the development of economic and social aspects of the company and regarding decisions that cause substantial change as regards the organisation of work and work contracts.
Experience has shown, however, that this is not enough and does not address the increasingly serious problems of company restructuring and relocations, which have serious economic and social repercussions.
Workers from various companies continue to report such problems in the hi-tech industry, in the cases of Alcatel-Lucent, Delphi and Yasak, footwear, for example Rodhe, the car industry and the textiles sector.
Community legislation therefore needs to go much further.
Workers' organisations must be kept fully informed and must play a central role throughout the process, in the European Works Councils, including the right of veto.
Flexi-insecurity, the liberalisation of redundancies and the unacceptable attack on the rights gained by the workers down the years must not be allowed to flourish.
I hope that you will be able to answer the questions you face, Commissioner.
If it means celebrating the Carnation Revolution, I am sure, Mrs Figueiredo, that he will reply to you.
(NL) Mr President, I shall try to make my statement in one minute; it mainly has to do with the financial markets and what is happening there at the moment in the area of private equity and hedge funds which, via shareholders' rights, are gaining influence in businesses.
It is very disappointing, in my view, that the present Commission has failed to table any proposals on employees' rights, particularly in those large transnational businesses, while everything possible is being done to improve shareholders' rights.
We adopted a report on this very subject in February last.
There is clearly an enormous imbalance between what is being done for shareholders in order to gain more influence in businesses - which they can do purely from their financial perspective - while no consideration is being given to the repercussions on employment, on the quality of work or on employees' rights.
As I see it, the balance should be restored in that area at the earliest opportunity, and it may be advisable to revisit the fifth Company Law Directive and to ensure that, when monitoring businesses, a better balance is struck between the interests of shareholders and those of employees.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, recent events in the European Union have shown that information and consultation within the framework of the European Works Council function only in a highly inadequate manner.
We are now at the stage where worker representation bodies in different countries - France, Germany and so on - are being played off one against the other, yet this is not some sort of international sports match.
Consultation and information within the framework of the committee of the European Works Council simply no longer exist.
For that reason there is a need for a change in this regard.
I would point out that the first revision was supposed to have taken place back in 1999.
The subject was brought up again in 2004 and now we are at the stage where we are recognising the need for revision.
I am very pleased that it was Mrs Stauner of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who prepared this subject for us, as it was former German Chancellor Kohl who, when the European Works Council Directive came into the world, was first in line in the delivery room.
At that time, though, our industries were still in a quite different condition to the one they are in today; there have been a lot of changes.
Business organisations have got smaller, methods of communication have changed.
There is much in this sector that has to be changed.
All I can do is call on us to seize the opportunity currently before us to undertake this revision.
Let us bring the European Works Council up to date!
Let us update the regulations and bring them into line with reality!
It is tremendously important, from the point of view of democratic politics, for this to work within companies, because if it does not work there is an enormous potential for conflict, and that is what has to be prevented.
All I can do, then, Commissioner, is to entreat you to get this under way quickly and to push the Council as necessary in order to make this happen.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 13 years after the adoption of the European Works Councils Directive, much remains to be done if this legislation is fully to achieve its objectives.
Over the last few months, many companies have carried out major restructuring projects, without consultation and regardless of this directive and of other European laws and without any of these companies having ever been punished.
The crises that Airbus is going through now, that Alcatel and Volkswagen went through in the past and that Peugeot will perhaps go through in the future, are harsh examples of just what is lacking in European social dialogue.
In the case of Airbus, the trade unionists and workers that we met in Parliament or in our respective countries rightly deplored the absence of any prior consultation or true cooperation with regard to the Power 8 restructuring plan.
Although we know that managerial errors are at the root of the current difficulties being experienced by Airbus and, at the same time, that it is the skills of its employees that have made it a success, the employees are the last to be informed but the first to be affected - and the most tragically affected - by this plan.
As for the managers, they are shielded, because they are covered by the millions of euros of their gilded parachute.
We can no longer tolerate a situation in which employees learn through the press that they are being made redundant.
We need to act urgently if we are to ensure greater transparency.
For several years now, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have been calling for these texts to be revised in a bid to ensure that information and consultation of workers early on, at regular intervals and at all levels of decision making will enable them genuinely to make their presence felt in the decision-making process.
Thus, employee representatives ought to be able to sit on the management board of companies.
This is a crucial element when it comes to workers being informed about, and monitoring, strategic decisions.
This is what would make it possible, too, to ensure that these restructuring measures were really crucial to the business and not just linked to managerial errors or to the quest for immediate profit.
We also think it crucial to ensure that companies within the Union assume their social and financial responsibilities and act in accordance with a method of governance that is responsible and fair towards all of the parties involved - workers, trade unions, local and regional authorities and communities in the area in which they are based.
The Commission must make a commitment to induce companies to act responsibly, including by considering legislation on their social responsibility.
It seems to me that, in a globalised setting and in an ever-changing economic situation, it is our duty today, as it was 13 years ago, to ensure that the existing directives are applied in full, including by means of sanctions against irresponsible companies but, even more so, to ensure that the existing directives are revised so that they go further with regard to information and consultation of workers, and to works councils.
By doing so, we will make it clear that we are strongly attached to a socially responsible Europe.
(ES) I would like to thank the Commissioner for his fine words, although we would like more details on the timetable and the measures to increase the transparency and good governance of companies.
The participation of workers is required if we are to maintain the competitiveness and quality of European industry in flagship projects such as Airbus and others that are less well-known, but crucial if we are to turn Europe into the competitive economy that we want to see.
Delphi is a painful wound in my country in this regard.
It is not right to attribute the problems we are experiencing exclusively to globalisation, since if we look carefully, we will see that the books of both Airbus and Boeing are full of orders, and therefore more workers are needed rather than fewer, both here in Europe and in other places.
I would like to call upon the Commission, in addition to the worker participation that we are demanding, now to consider new measures to ensure transparency in the activities and decisions of executives who, with their armour-plated contracts and exorbitant salaries, allow negligence, lack of transparency and criminal errors to take place for which the European Community does not currently have a sufficient instrument.
Commissioner, does the Commission intend to create instruments to restrict this irresponsible power within the context of the so-called social responsibility of companies and their codes of conduct, which so far are not obligatory?
Could measures be implemented to oblige executives to manage in a more transparent way, firstly for the sake of the workers and also for the sake of society?
If we are talking about good European governance in companies, we cannot continue to resign ourselves to this situation.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that something bad must always happen before the Commission advances an opinion on a subject as important as strengthening the rights of workers in the area of information and consultation.
Airbus's Power8 restructuring programme and the consequent threat of job losses and sales of factories shook European Airbus employees to the core.
In the discussion with the works councils of the areas affected, Varel and Nordenham, and at a meeting of trade union representatives from all over Europe that took place in Brussels recently, the workers pointed out time and again the inadequate supply of information to and consultation with Airbus employees.
For this reason, the rights of European works councils must, first of all, at long last be fully implemented and then extended and given greater depth.
It is indefensible for workers not to be provided with comprehensive information and consultation if their companies are being restructured or if there are possible job losses.
This indefensible situation can be remedied only by finally getting the long-overdue revision of the European Works Council Directive under way.
So far, I have not heard of a single company anywhere in Europe that has got into difficulties because of its works council.
On the contrary, in fact, consultation and providing early information to workers could definitely have saved large numbers of companies and jobs in Europe and fixed management mistakes.
After 13 years it is time for this legislation to be fully brought to bear in order to ensure social peace in Europe.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, it is true, thirteen years ago now, on reading the texts, it was pointed out that, in our primary law, we had to incorporate social dialogue as the European social model's distinguishing mark.
That was why the Directive was drawn up.
It was pointed out thirteen years ago that the internal market had a transnational dimension and that that could lead to problems amongst workers in companies of a transnational nature, since they should take decisions in consultation with everybody without prejudicing a few or prejudicing everybody.
Given what we have seen in Delphi, in Renault and in Airbus, we are now much more acutely aware of the need to improve these mechanisms.
Europe is in danger of appearing to lack legitimacy amongst the workers, because they are seeing two very dangerous things simultaneously, Commissioner.
Firstly, they see that we do not have any instruments, but at the same time they hear us in Europe saying that we are with them, that we are not going to abandon them in the face of globalisation and restructuring.
The revision of the Directive, therefore, though not sufficient, is nevertheless necessary, because it is an instrument that is showing itself to be neither used nor useful in dealing with the extremely serious problems that we are seeing on the ground and which are turning a very significant proportion of the European population against each other and against Brussels.
This is urgent, Commissioner.
We must continue to move forward.
We shall support you fully if you tackle such a difficult and risky situation.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, uncertainty is always a bad thing, especially when it relates to the future of jobs.
The sword of Damocles that being laid off represents has been hanging over the heads of thousands of Airbus employees since January.
That is an intolerable situation.
It is no way to treat human beings.
In my constituency there was talk, with the advent of Power8, first of 1 200 job losses, then of 700, then of job losses solely amongst temporary workers and now we hear that Airbus actually wants to start hiring again!
All of this cannot fail to make one dizzy.
The approach taken by the top management at EADS is, as we all know, no longer an isolated incident.
We have heard this a number of times today.
The fact that something like this occurs despite the European Works Council Directive is simply scandalous and makes it glaringly evident that action is needed.
For that reason, there is an urgent need to introduce specific measures to provide a stronger reminder to employers of their obligations in terms of informing and consulting with their employees.
We must ensure, above all, that sanctions against contravention of the directive are rigorously enforced right across the EU and also that employees and their representatives are represented on the supervisory boards.
Commissioner Å pidla, I genuinely expect the Commission finally to get on with the long overdue task of updating this directive, for, as is well known, the EU's competitiveness and productivity stand and fall by good, safe jobs.
Mr President, honourable Members, firstly, a number of cases were mentioned in which the directive on information and consultation of workers was not applied appropriately.
This did indeed happen, the Commission took action in each case and in some cases there was a clear improvement in the situation.
I should like to emphasise, however, that the directive is not as weak as would appear from some of the opinions expressed.
How it is applied is ultimately a matter of national discretion.
I should like to point out that a number of companies have been brought before the French and Belgian courts recently for not upholding the directive and that in some cases, for example British Airways, the restructuring process has been put on hold until the law on consultation and information has been implemented in full.
There are therefore possibilities for a relatively effective approach, which is something that in my opinion we should bear in mind.
The second question mentioned was that of the prospective review of the directive.
I would point out that the Commission has launched a review of this directive and that our aim is in any event to contribute to a solution leading to stable, effective social dialogue and consultation and the right to consultation with workers and for them to be informed.
This is the Commission's goal and I am sure that we will achieve it during this legislative period.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote on the motions for resolutions tabled at the end of the debate will take place during the next part-session, in Brussels, on Thursday 10 May.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - The reason for this statement and next month's resolution is the appalling situation regarding Airbus in Europe.
A combination of mismanagement, unfair competition and poor judgement has threatened the success of this most vital of European industries.
I find it inconceivable that the US with Boeing should totally dominate the world market for medium- and larger-scale aircraft.
Boeing has its civilian sales and R[amp]D underpinned by military contracts and military R[amp]D: a sad indictment of Europe's lack of a common defence and security policy.
Nevertheless, the key problem here is that despite massive EU and national governments loans to Airbus, it was run like some kind of Edwardian corner shop with minimum consultation with the workforce.
Workers possess one of the most important resources for any industrial enterprise - craft knowledge and experience.
It may well be that by focusing on that, management could have avoided some of its worst mistakes.
Now a minimum of 10 000 families face the prospect of suffering job losses.
If this company in the vanguard of European industry pays so little attention to its most important asset, its workforce, it can only be time for the Commission to strengthen and reinforce legislation that is clearly not strong enough.
Directives concerning the protection of health and safety of workers: simplifying and rationalising practical implementation reports (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 89/391/EEC, its individual Directives and Council Directives 83/477/EEC, 91/383/EEC, 92/29/EEC and 94/33/EC with a view to simplifying and rationalising the reports on practical implementation - C6-0242/2006 -.
Member of the Commission. (CS) Madam President, Mrs Figueiredo, honourable Members, I should first like to thank Parliament and the Council for their efforts in reaching agreement so quickly on this proposal.
I also welcome the Figueiredo report, which kick-started the constructive dialogue chaired by the Council, where the foundations were laid for the adoption of the proposed directive at first reading.
The Commission's proposed directive forms part of the process of simplifying the legal environment.
The purpose of this proposal is to simplify and rationalise the responsibilities of the Member States and the Commission as regards reports on the implementation of directives relating to worker health and safety, without backsliding on the principle of protection.
This is a fundamental condition.
The new text harmonises the timeframes for delivering national reports that will be published once every five years, and this obligation is extended to all existing directives.
The plan is for only one report, including a general section dealing with the general principles of the framework directive, supplemented by special chapters on aspects relating to the individual directives.
This will allow for a general overview of practical implementation.
The simplification will apply to the national bodies, which will draw up only one report every five years, the Commission, which will draw up only one national report per Member State instead of the current 500 reports, and the social partners, which will also contribute one report every five years.
The Commission, in close cooperation with the consultative committee on health and safety at work, will set up a body charged with helping the Member States to draw up coherent reports.
The Commission is ready to adopt the amendments for which you voted.
I will strengthen the role of the tripartite advisory committee on health and safety at work in defining the structure of the reports, in clearly establishing the content of the reports and in setting deadlines for the Member States and the Commission to draw up the reports.
Thank you.
rapporteur. (PT) Issues of workers' health and working conditions, the organisation of health, hygiene and safety services in the workplace and the list of occupational diseases were first debated in Community circles in 1989 with the publication of Framework Directive 89/391.
Since then, other directives have been adopted covering workers' health, the organisation of occupational health services, working conditions, young workers, temporary workers, and those manning ships, thereby fulfilling the International Labour Organisation Conventions.
Almost all of these and other directives stipulate that the Member States should submit a report to the Commission on their practical implementation and the points of view of the social partners.
The truth is that some Member States have not done so.
With the proposal before us, it is hoped that greater attention will be paid to the effective implementation of the directives concerned and to working conditions.
It is an attempt to reduce the millions of accidents at work per year and thousands of deaths and injuries leading to permanent incapacity across the EU.
As I have said, the drafting of practical implementation reports by the Member States, is laid down in several different directives, but required at different intervals, some every four years, some every five, and others without any specific timeframe.
Now, as the Commissioner has just told us, the Commission is proposing that one single report be drawn up every five years.
In order that the proposal for one report every five years meets the needs of safeguarding health and safety at work, the specific aspects of each directive must not in any way be watered down or underplayed, and this is something that this report seeks to address.
We have accordingly tabled a number of proposals, of which I should like to highlight those that refer to the structure of the report itself, which should include a specific questionnaire.
The report should accordingly include a general section dealing with the common principles and aspects applicable to all the directives and other specific chapters regarding the implementation of each of the particular characteristics of each directive, with the inclusion of specific indicators, when available.
The five-yearly report will provide a practical assessment of the various directives and, where appropriate and available, separate data by gender on equality between men and women.
It will also include relevant information on the prevention measures taken by the Member States in order to make a suitable assessment of how the legislation is working in practice.
We strongly believe that there needs to be a policy of genuinely improving the practices of the various Member States.
The Commission must also, as a matter of urgency, submit a more thorough report on the current situation in the Member States in the various areas of workers' safety and health in the workplace.
Lastly, I should like to highlight the close cooperation that was possible with the MEPs from the different political groups in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, with the Executive Committee and with the Council.
This cooperation will certainly enable us to obtain agreement at first reading.
I thank you all for the work that has been done.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SL) First of all, I would like to express satisfaction with this report on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, because it constitutes one of the first steps towards a significant relaxation of the burden imposed on Member States with regard to various administrative tasks.
At the same time, this directive will contribute to the simplification and clarification of the work of the Commission.
In the PPE-DE Group we are very pleased to note that the agreement with the rapporteur has worked and that we have been able to secure such a broad consensus within our committee.
If I remember rightly, we adopted this report with only one vote against.
In terms of its contents, the report sends yet another clear message to the European public that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are taking decisions to rationalise procedures and to improve communication between the Member States and EU institutions so that everyone can reap the benefits of such action.
This directive and the single report will in no respect lead to any watering down of standards relating to health and safety at work.
My political group considers this report in its entirety, that is the directive, as an important step forward, but, of course, we would like to see similar initiatives being taken in other fields and by other commissioners.
Let me mention just one example: in the field of terrorism, for instance, the European Parliament has adopted around 60 different documents, directives, regulations etc.
Things are quite hard to fathom out, for instance the Schengen Treaty, the single market and a host of other examples.
In a nutshell, this report is a fine example of how we can secure broad consensus within political groups about regulating our common concerns in the future.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Å pidla for his participation.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for her work.
She worked closely with the shadow rapporteur and produced a sound draft report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
The Commission proposal aims towards systematisation and a uniform model for the directives on worker protection.
In a single implementation report to be submitted every five years and for which we have been waiting quite a long time already, the Member States are to report to the Commission on the practical application of the directives in question.
This plan will certainly provide the single-state authorities - which is the truth of the matter - with a better overview.
Comprehensive and effective worker protection is a basic prerequisite for ensuring and maintaining the health of workers.
4 500 employees die in the EU every year as a result of accidents in the workplace, while over 4 million people are affected by accidents at work each year.
A summary report of this nature can provide us with important information with regard to what preventive measures we need to implement and make a contribution to improving the quality of worker protection in the EU.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the report on simplifying and rationalising reports and the practical implementation of directives is extremely important for employment policy.
The emerging common jobs market requires constant health and safety monitoring for our citizens in EU countries.
Different conditions in individual countries require constant monitoring to ensure that the directives are adhered to, and five-yearly analyses of their suitability, effectiveness, transparency, costs and effects are needed.
These analyses, based on clear and transparent guidelines, should help to improve the legal situation and common policy as regards health and safety.
There is also a need to continuously monitor health and safety directives, and the effect of these directives on the health and safety strategy within the Member States.
In this regard, the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions have an important role to play.
I thank Mrs Ilda Figueiredo for her report.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, the modern working world has brought with it new phenomena, ranging from the growth of psychiatric problems, via the taking of more and more sick leave and increasing burn-out to new forms of aggression such as workplace bullying.
It almost seems to be good form in the working environment to put workers under permanent time pressure and to impose on them unplanned extra burdens and tight deadlines.
Anyone who succumbs to the long-term negative impact of this on their health has to explain themselves in interviews when they return to work after a period of sick leave, the idea being that illness is a result of personal misconduct.
Older workers are being pushed off into early retirement en masse, and younger ones labelled as unproductive.
Initiatives such as Move Europe which relate to workplace health management are, of course, to be welcomed.
However, such health promotion programmes are often run in companies that are organised in such a way that illness is simply not permitted.
It is pressure within companies, in combination with the fear of losing their jobs, that ensures that employees struggle into work against the advice of their doctors.
Moreover, short-term contracted activities and part-time work bring with them the constant fear of not having a job and financial worries which are then reflected in psychological problems.
Absenteeism and unfitness for work, however, not only generate high costs within the companies concerned, but also burden public health budgets.
Against this backdrop we should not be surprised about the rising numbers of those suffering from eating disorders, obesity and mental illness, nor about falling birth rates.
As long as work means permanent stress and children represent a poverty trap, the demographic change that is resulting in a lack of children and an overaging of the population will continue.
With this in mind, we must ensure more job security.
It must be possible for a sole breadwinner to feed a family and it must be possible for a woman to decide to have children without that meaning impoverishment.
Those who are sick must be allowed to get better.
If we could achieve that then we would surely have taken a big step forwards on the road to meeting the Lisbon objectives.
(EL) Mr President, with regard to all the previous directives we are given the impression that we exerted insufficient control, which did not help with their comprehensive implementation.
Even the directive's explicit provision regarding the submission of reports by Member States on their state legislative provisions, which includes opinions of social partners, has not helped solve the problem, to date.
Therefore, I too applaud your proposal Commissioner, considering that it complies with the goals of other European Union policies, especially with regard to the improvement of the regulatory framework on increasing corporate competitiveness.
The present proposal has added value, considering that it allows - through a single report every five years - for a better evaluation of the consequences and community provisions in the fields of health and safety at work as well as hygiene services; the need for a reduction in accidents at work is urgent and work-related diseases must be combated in order for workers, corporations and society in general, to benefit.
I congratulate the rapporteur because she cooperated with the political groups, reached a consensus within the Council and managed to include in the recitals one of my amendments referring to the utilisation of the work of both the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (Bilbao) and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Dublin), in the context of the results from the evaluation of national policies on health and safety at work.
It is important that the European Commission takes into consideration the findings of the two aforementioned institutions, in order to draft the basic questionnaire for the Member States, which will substitute the multiple reports.
The question is whether a reduction in quantity can bring about an improvement in quality.
We certainly hope so.
Honourable Members, I should like, once again, to thank you for the work you have done on this proposal.
I am sure that the vote will pave the way for us to agree on the proposal, which will lead to a substantial simplification of the administrative process, a reduction in unnecessary, bureaucratic obstacles and most importantly to a more effective implementation of the directive on health and safety at work.
I should like, if I may, to make one further remark, because some speeches did not directly relate solely to the subject of this directive, but to health and safety at work in general.
Obviously, the figure of 4 500 fatal accidents per year seems relatively low in comparison to the 250 million workers, but we are talking about 4 500 human lives.
From this perspective, the figure is excessively high and it is up to us to do all we can to bring that figure down.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

Closure of sitting
(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)
Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 10.00 a.m.)
Mr President, I do not wish to hold up the proceedings, but I and others tabled a text for a written declaration concerning the fact that the Bureau of this Parliament had reversed its decision to introduce a total ban on smoking in the European Parliament.
I have received communications from the services and now from the President stating that a written declaration on an internal matter of the Parliament is not within the rules.
However, if you look at the Rules of Procedure it is very clear that a written declaration may concern any matter within the field of responsibilities of the European Union, which clearly this is.
Could I therefore ask through you that the President refer the matter of interpreting the rules on this point to the committee that is responsible for interpreting the rules, namely the Committee on Constitutional Affairs?
Yes, we will proceed like that, Mr Corbett.
Any recommendation you make concerning the Rules should be listened to very carefully!
Therefore, we will proceed as you say.

Relations between EU and Switzerland (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on relations between the European Union and Switzerland.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, I am going to read the Commission statement on relations between the European Union and Switzerland, and although you and I speak the same language, I shall do so in English.
Mr President, the Commission is pleased that this item has been put on the agenda because it is now more than two years since we last discussed Switzerland.
It was in 2004, on the occasion of the conclusion of the 10 new bilateral agreements.
Let me start, therefore, with a general remark.
The bilateral and multilateral relations that link the EU and Switzerland are very good.
Switzerland is a highly valued partner for the EU in many areas.
Our bilateral relations are based on a solid foundation of around 20 important and over 100 smaller sector-specific agreements.
These agreements range from free trade in goods and the free movement of persons to Swiss participation in our research and Schengen cooperation.
Any existing differences should not have an inordinate impact on our relations.
In February, the Commission adopted a state aid decision on Swiss cantonal tax favours for certain types of companies, in particular holding companies.
This decision has received much media attention in Switzerland and has been dramatised, by some, into a major conflict.
Legally, the Commission has no doubts that the cantonal tax schemes qualify as subsidies, because these tax regimes offer unfair tax advantages to companies established in Switzerland for profits generated in the European Union.
Income generated in Switzerland is taxed higher than profits made in the EU.
This unequal treatment is at the heart of the state aid problem.
The rules in question are liable to distort competition and may affect trade between Switzerland and the EU.
All criteria of Article 23 of the agreement of 1972, the provision which declares such state aid incompatible with the proper functioning of the agreement, are therefore fulfilled.
Politically, too, it seems hard to accept that a neighbouring country that enjoys privileged access to our internal market and takes part in a large number of our programmes and other activities should grant such tax favours.
The benefiting companies are often set up with the sole aim of avoiding the taxation of profits in our Member States.
I would like to point out that tax schemes of this kind or similar are not allowed inside the EU, pursuant to the state aid rules set out in the EC Treaty.
In the past, the Commission has adopted decisions against them.
We are not against tax competition, which also takes place among the Member States, but it must be fair.
The Commission wants to find a mutually acceptable solution.
Therefore, we also asked the Council in February for a mandate to start negotiations with Switzerland on this topic.
Member States support the Commission in this respect, and such a mandate is currently being prepared in the Council.
I am also counting very much on Parliament's support in this matter.
We proceed from the belief that we will find a solution for this problem, just as we have always found solutions for problems in our relations with Switzerland in the past.
On a different matter of importance, I would like to express the Commission's expectation that Switzerland will, hopefully, soon be ready to negotiate the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons.
If Switzerland were to exclude the citizens of two Member States from this very important agreement, it would be unacceptable for legal, institutional and political reasons.
Bulgaria and Romania should also receive a financial contribution from Switzerland for the reduction of economic and social disparities, on the same terms as the other 10 new Member States.
In view of the Swiss position on EU accession and the European Economic Area, there is currently no alternative to further strengthening of bilateral relations.
With that in mind, the Commission is prepared to look into the Swiss proposal for the negotiation of a general framework agreement, provided that it brings an added value to our relations, for instance with regard to the updating of existing agreements in line with the evolving Community acquis.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the statements made today by Commissioner Almunia.
I believe that these statements also largely meet with the consent of my group.
The relationship between the European Union and Switzerland has been a special one since time immemorial.
Commissioner Almunia touched on the various agreements.
In this respect, our partnership with Switzerland is characterised by particularly close cooperation but which has not, as yet, ended up with Switzerland becoming a member of the European Union.
Nevertheless, Switzerland is an extremely important trading partner as well as being a friend and neighbour.
I find this particularly congenial since my electoral district directly borders Switzerland.
I would therefore like to appeal to all sides not to jeopardise these good neighbourly relations by means of stubbornness or excessive demands placed on one side or the other.
The tax dispute has already been touched on.
The topic of Switzerland would certainly also be cause for a comprehensive discussion here in Parliament.
Today, however, as has been described by Commissioner Almunia, we are obviously concerned with the subject of fiscal practices.
On this theme, I would like to say that, unlike our colleagues from Great Britain, for instance, and representations to the contrary coming out of Switzerland, we are of the opinion that this issue does not involve intervention in a country's right to levy taxes, but is more an issue of whether enterprises which belong to the European single market, and which may enjoy the advantages afforded by this single market, are receiving unjustified subsidies.
We are talking about the principle of equal treatment and the abolition of hidden subsidies.
In this respect, the approach adopted by the Commission, that the Swiss have to apply some finishing touches here, is the correct one, even if it may have been more prudent to begin with negotiations instead of a procedure.
The statement that it is a matter for the canton is neither applicable nor effective in my opinion because what we are talking about are hidden subsidies which must be abolished.
For its part, the EU must clarify the fact that while it naturally respects Switzerland's sovereignty on tax matters, the EU's basic principles, which Swiss enterprises also benefit from, must apply to all enterprises within the internal market.
Finally, I would like to point out that we must find a solution to this problem in the interests of European enterprises, as well as its citizens, to which both parties have contributed.
That is why I am calling on both the Commission and our Swiss neighbours.
Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome your statement, because you have taken note of what we have been saying for some time now, namely that the practice that is being developed in certain Swiss cantons - without mentioning the main ones of Zug, Vaud and Schwyz - constitutes a violation of the 1972 agreement on forms of State aid that contradict the rules of fair competition and that affect the nature of trade between the European Union and Switzerland.
The fact is that Switzerland, as a friend of the European Union, benefits from the same conditions of access to the EU internal market as any Member State.
You cannot have your cake and eat it, meaning, in this case, that you cannot have both the internal market and exceptions for certain Swiss cantons.
It is not a question here of referring to this or that media figure among natural persons, but indeed of referring to substantial sums that are at stake due to the practices being developed by certain legal persons.
Therefore, once a problem has been identified between friends, it should be dealt with.
