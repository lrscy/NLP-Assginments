Finally, with regard to the One-China policy, I agree that that must be the objective and that it provides a good framework for negotiating relations between China and Taiwan, but it must be between democratic entities.
If that is not the case, of course, the One-China policy may have negative consequences.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is going to vote against this report because, if its intention is to exert an influence in such a sensitive area as human rights, the direction it takes is a mistake.
This mistake is made explicit in its pointÂ 75, which proposes that the European Union and the Member States be urged to establish a policy based on a consensus with the United States with a view to establishing a strategic relationship with China.
I would put the question: in what areas can a consensus be established with the United States?
The death penalty?
Respect for international law?
The demilitarisation of security?
Climate change?
In other words, are we going to go hand in hand with the United States in establishing that consensual relationship â the European Union and the United States â so that we can tell the Chinese what to do in those areas?
I believe that that would be a terrible mistake and moves in completely the wrong direction.
Furthermore, the report also proposes telling the Chinese â the Chinese Government, the Chinese authorities â what policy they must implement in their region, with which countries â with North Korea, with Iran â and on the basis of what principles.
As if the Peopleâs Republic of China can be told what to do and as if they will accept being told what to do.
As if the Peopleâs Republic of China could tell the European Union what kind of relations and what kind of policy we should implement here.
That cannot be taken seriously.
We must bear in mind which country we are talking about.
We are talking about a country with 1.2Â billion inhabitants, of 9.5Â million square kilometres, and one which in 1910 was still a feudal society.
Unless we consider this report within the correct context, we will be lashing out in the dark.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I also believe that this report oozes purely economic interests.
Nothing more. The rest is nothing but fine words.
Our group is therefore going to vote against this report tomorrow, because I believe that it moves in the wrong direction.
When trying to influence the Peopleâs Republic of China, we must do so on the basis of a clearly autonomous European Union, not on the basis of a link between the European Union and the United States.
Â Â  . Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment on relations between the European Union and China as seen through the prism of relations between China and Taiwan and that of democracy.
It is no secret that China refuses to engage in direct dialogue with the democratically elected government of Taiwan.
The European Union therefore ought to urge China to maintain an atmosphere of mutual trust with Taiwan, and to employ peaceful means in developing relations to achieve stability throughout the region.
Chinaâs actions in restricting Taiwanâs participation in international processes cannot be endorsed.
China must respect the fundamental human rights and freedom to make political choices of Taiwanâs 23Â million inhabitants.
We should condemn the fact that the Chinese law legitimising the possible occupation of Taiwan hangs over Taiwan like a sword of Damocles.
Ladies and gentlemen, in my view, in the concept of âone Chinaâ the idea of peaceful reunification should be replaced with something that is more applicable â a peaceful solution.
The deployment of approximately 800 guided and other types of missile on Chinaâs southern coast, opposite the Taiwan Strait, must be significantly reduced.
This is threatening and stressful for the inhabitants of Taiwan. It results in the need for counter-measures to build up arms in Taiwan, taking significant resources away from the needs of the economy and society.
The European Unionâs arms embargo ought to be maintained.
To lift it would be misinterpreted as encouragement for further increases in Chinaâs military might. That might seriously affect stability in the Asian region and lead to the escalation of expenditure on weapons.
A lifting of the arms embargo would not foster the desired democratisation of China.
The impetus for the one-party regime to end the significant human rights violations that we have seen for so long would disappear.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we must congratulate the people of China on the progress they have made since the death of the tyrant Mao Zedong 30 years ago.
Maoâs legacy of murder, oppression, suffering, misery, starvation and death is in a league of its own.
He brought China to its knees.
His instrument for enforcing this tyranny was, of course, the Chinese Communist Party, which still governs China.
The recognition by Maoâs successor Deng Xiao Ping and his successors of some capitalist and free market realities has enabled China to progress economically to the point it has reached today.
However, at the heart of the Chinese economic phenomenon lies an unresolved contradiction: Chinaâs new-found prosperity is based on capitalist principles applied by the Chinese Communist Party, which is the only political party in China.
We have the curious spectacle of a communist party that no longer believes in communism applying capitalist ideas that it is not supposed to believe in.
Its only real belief is in ensuring its own survival, and the European Union should not assist it in that aim by lending the kind of support that we have already seen.
Progress in China will inevitably be limited to the economic sphere for as long as the Chinese Communist Party retains power.
Progress will not extend to freedom of association, freedom of speech and democracy.
The Chinese people are at long last beginning to reap some of the material benefits of the capitalist system.
But when are they going to reap the benefits of the Western democratic system?
Mr Belderâs report rightly calls for political pluralism, an independent judiciary and for the EU not to lift its arms embargo until China properly addresses the situation regarding human rights and civil and political freedoms.
Mr Belder calls for a consistent and coherent policy towards China.
Such a coherent policy should promote the interests of the Chinese people, but not the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.
Therefore, we should not lift the arms embargo and we should continue to recognise Taiwan as an independent democratic State.
Unfortunately, I have to say that this report should be rejected because it advocates the further development of an EU strategy regarding relations with China.
That would be bad for the Chinese people.
It would also restrict the political and economic decisions of the United Kingdom and would dilute its influence and priorities.
In the long run, that would also be bad for the Chinese people.
Â Â  â Mr President, the fact that we are discussing EU-China relations illustrates their importance.
The individual speakers, the report itself, as well as all those taking the floor here have stressed how important relations with China are to the future of the European Union.
However, we also agree that these relations are fundamentally different.
Our approach has to be different, in discussions on this issue, from our relations with another large country of the region such as India.
When discussing China, we should always bear in mind the foundations on which this House, and the entire European Union, are built.
Therefore, our priority is to promote, foster and create conditions allowing people to live in democratic conditions, without fear of repression and without acts which are part of the daily life in China.
In debating this report, which is, on the whole, correct â and I hope that all amendments, and all elements relating to human and citizensâ rights will be adopted by this House â we should remember that repression of religious communities â and that includes all, from the Catholic Church to religious movements such as Falun Gong, which are being oppressed in a quite shocking manner â as well as repression of fundamental human rights is not a thing of the past in China, and continue on a daily basis.
Forced sterilisation and forced abortions continue to be practiced.
The repression of national groups, as is the case in Tibet at the moment, is also still not a thing of the past.
We need to draw attention to all of this in our report, as it is extremely important that both the European Parliament and the whole European Union do not simply focus on economic statistics and on trade in their relations with China, but that they also focus on the ideals that the European Union does and should promote.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, our group is genuinely committed to developing the strategic partnership between the EU and China, but these relations must be based upon complete openness, credibility and responsibility.
We must not sacrifice our convictions for the sake of economic or political considerations; rather, we must use plain language when speaking with our Chinese partners.
I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for the clear words which you have spoken in your opening speech, and I encourage you to make the same speech at the summit in Helsinki.
If we are open and honest with each other, then we have a good chance of further developing the strategic partnership in a sensible way.
Please allow me to make three further points.
Like the Commission, we must continue to demand from the government of the Peopleâs Republic of China that it implements the basic principles of fair world trade, now that it has joined the WTO.
They cannot get away with the excuse that central government does not know what is happening in every province.
The protection of intellectual property must be enforced, and if the Chinese Government can enforce its political convictions in every prison, then it must also be able to implement the protection of intellectual property on every factory floor.
Secondly, we call upon the National Peopleâs Congress to finally ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
They have signed it, but they are postponing the ratification.
They return to this point in the discussions which we are always glad to have with them and they say that it is so difficult and that they have to prepare themselves first.
No: they have signed, so they should ratify, and they should implement human rights.
Implementation means, in practice: freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech.
This must be guaranteed. There must also be cultural autonomy for Tibet.
I do not think that MrÂ Ford has understood things quite rightly: China must make the first move in changing the way it relates to its neighbours. It must also change its relations with its neighbours Japan and Taiwan.
Indeed, as far as Taiwan is concerned, of course all of us in the House would like there to be a political dialogue between Peking and Taipei, but this must not occur in the form of threats.
It is therefore completely nonsensical of the Socialists to have called â as they did recently â for the lifting of the arms embargo.
You should instead get back to showing solidarity with the democrats in this House.
As long as there are human rights violations in China, there should be no lifting of the embargo.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the work done by the Commission on China so far and the input of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner tonight.
If the report were as balanced as your contribution tonight, Commissioner, I would wholeheartedly support it.
However, throughout our discussions in the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have argued that the report was weak in the EU-China cooperation and foreign policy sections.
For no reason that I can understand, the report does not take a position on the One-China policy or Chinaâs role in the Security Council, and it does not take a balanced view on the Taiwan issue, the six-party talks, EU-China cooperation and global security issues.
The report singles out only one of the major partners for cooperation in dealing with China.
Why?
I, like the vast majority of people in Europe, believe that we should work together in cooperation with all our major partners, rather than with only one.
There are also factual errors in Mr Belderâs report, which is supported by the PPE-DE Group and other groups.
I shall refer to just one example: in paragraph 24, Parliament invites the Commission to initiate a structured dialogue with its Chinese counterpart in the fields of employment and social affairs.
Well, Mr Belder and colleagues from the PPE-DE and ALDE groups, either your homework has not been done properly, or we must congratulate the magical powers of the Commission, because two years ago it must have eaten some Chinese fortune cookie which said that in September 2006 Parliament would make such a call to initiate a structured dialogue.
The truth is that the Commission has been having structured dialogue on these issues and many other issues for years now.
Our groupâs suggestion, which was rejected, was to get the Commission to give us regular updates on the different sectoral dialogues, which now cover a wide range of areas from space technology to enterprise regulation, from environmental issues to education and the information society.
Commissioner, the PSE Group would warmly welcome it if you were to give us those regular updates as regards your work in building structured dialogues with China.
My idea was that this report should be Parliamentâs contribution to EU-China relations based on pragmatism, facts and respect for each otherâs sensitivities, and aiming for the progressive deepening of the relationship between the two sides, which is rapidly maturing into a comprehensive strategic partnership.
In fact, Europe is engaged with China in cultural, economic and strategic terms.
Correct me if I am wrong, but the big question is whether China will respond wholeheartedly in trying to understand and accept European values.
Is there any way to find answers to these questions other than through constructive dialogue?
My idea was that this report could contribute to a process in which both sides could understand one another better.
This would be for our mutual benefit.
Unfortunately, the report as it stands makes no such contribution.
It greatly weakens Parliamentâs position and influence in achieving our common goals, especially now with a view to the forthcoming summit.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, MrÂ Belder, as chairman of Parliamentâs delegation for China, I am left with rather mixed feelings about this report.
The rapporteur has worked very hard, and the report contains many valid points made or repeated by this House, but what is missing, in my opinion, is an assessment, a critical and constructive assessment of what the Commission is already doing in China at the moment.
How critical are we about some of the things the Commission is doing over there?
After all, it boasts a very extensive delegation over there, second only â or so I believe â to that for relations with the United States.
Where are we offering the Commission encouragement?
For example, is there sufficient cooperation between China and the Commission in the area of regional policy, the development of Chinaâs disadvantaged regions?
We could teach them a thing or two in this respect.
Are we working together sufficiently and could we not, for example, ask the Chinese Government to be a little more receptive to this?
Those are the kinds of things that are missing.
There is insufficient scrutiny or critical and/or constructive analysis of the activities the Commission is engaged in.
What suggestions are we putting forward for the Helsinki summit?
My mixed feelings stem from the fact that those are not reflected anywhere.
I am pleased that you are facing the problems head-on.
Since Members have already pointed them out, I will not dwell on the issues of human rights, trade union rights, the free expression of opinion and so on.
I am not that enthralled by the way you are asking for EU-US consensus on China policy.
That would make me very unhappy.
In fact, we in our group have tabled amendments on this very subject, because there are differences between us, the European Union, and the United States, as to how to approach China.
There are also different interests in play.
We should not ask for consensus with the United States after all, for I think that would restrict us enormously in our policy.
Moreover, China is not just any old country.
We can pretend that the Chinese only need us, but we should not labour under any misconceptions: we need the Chinese as well, both economically and strategically.
Let there be no mistake about that, Commissioner.
I assume that the one-China policy is a cornerstone of the stability which we would like to see across the whole of Asia, and that it is also a cornerstone and an elementary component in the EUâs policy in respect of China.
I cannot find any extensive detail about this in this report.
We are assuming all kinds of things, but we as Parliament should also confirm the one-China policy, because it is important for the sake of stability.
China needs us where the environment is concerned, for example.
I think that that country could take on board a huge number of suggestions from us, including in the area of energy.
As far as conditions for partnership are concerned, it has to be said that every day, some minister or other, commissioner of a region or a country, sets off for China in order to discuss this strategic partnership over there.
We should therefore stop pretending that it does not exist and that we can simply prescribe whatever conditions we please.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this report not only because of its strong emphasis on the need for respect for human rights in China, but also because it echoes a key finding from my own report on EU economic relations with China, namely that the challenges posed by Chinese competition are not limited to individual sectors like textiles or footwear, but are in fact systemic in nature and require a much more comprehensive approach.
The Commission response to date has been to say that Europe simply has to move up the value-added chain; we simply have to diversify into higher-skilled, more specialised work.
However, it is rather complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech solutions, while China simply does the manufacturing.
Chinese graduates are rightly, and to their credit, moving up the value-added chain and very soon we may need to face the possibility that there will be very little that Europe can produce which China cannot produce more efficiently.
The old colonialist assumption that the EU and the industrialised countries will keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries, while developing countries focus on lower-skilled sectors, is now open to huge debate.
Our response to the challenges posed by China needs to include a thorough-going reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory until now.
Not for our own sake, necessarily, but certainly for the sake of many workers in developing countries, because the reality is that Chinaâs deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world, pushing global suppliers to reduce their workersâ rights and conditions in their bid to remain competitive at all costs, and forcing ILO conventions on freedom of association and bargaining on China is certainly part of the solution.
However, I would also ask the Commission to look much more closely at some of its assumptions about the winners and losers from the globalisation process.
Â Â  â I should like to thank the rapporteur for his comprehensive report and even though I do not fully agree with many of the themes of the report, I welcome it as a contribution to the debate.
Clearly, the rapporteur was aiming for the broadest and most detailed overview of EU-China relations, yet I believe that there are two areas on which we need to focus particular attention in the future.
The rapporteur stresses on a number of occasions in the report that the growing importance of the Peopleâs Republic of China in world politics, together with its growing importance as a global economic superpower, bring greater international responsibilities.
Against this backdrop, I should like to highlight two issues that strike me as highly important.
Firstly, there are issues relating to environmental protection.
Representatives from the Peopleâs Republic of China are aware of this important issue, but are held back by the costs associated with more environmentally-friendly forms of production and consumption.
I believe that the EU should be much more proactive on this issue than it has been so far.
Perhaps protecting the environment and green technology could be future areas in which EU businesses can invest in China.
The second issue which is mentioned in the report, and which I feel should become a major topic of negotiation with representatives from the People's Republic of China â but also an area in which Europe should share experiences â is that of health protection in the work place, social support, social dialogue, the prevention of child labour and ensuring basic rights for workers.
Let us lend a helping hand and contribute towards finding solutions to these complex problems that will above all lead to raising the standards of those who are most directly involved in the Chinese miracle.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that, in recent years, the European Union has become Chinaâs second most important trading partner.
It is therefore becoming crucial to clarify the relations that exist between our continent and China, so as to do the best possible job of tackling future global challenges, even though I believe that there are still too many critical points to be highlighted.
Despite being part of the WTO, China has often shown that it does not observe the rules shared by its other trading partners.
As we have denounced all too often up to now, China is placing goods on the European markets that are counterfeit or that do not comply with EU legislation, with quality and safety standards.
China does not adequately comply with the TRIPS agreements on the protection of intellectual property rights and inventions and does not help its foreign partners to access its markets.
The trade agreements on footwear, textiles and clothing must also be reviewed with the utmost urgency, as unacceptable imbalances still exist.
What are even more worrying are the problems relating to human rights and, more specifically, the rights of women and children; the absence in many cases of minimum health and safety standards in the workplace; and even the existence of labour camps.
These are unfortunately all prominent issues, but it is time to identify the solutions and, above all, the specific means for more incisively tackling the unfair competition and the social and environmental dumping practised by China.
To conclude, it is worth hoping that the Finnish Presidency can finally take upon itself the role of champion of the real interests of European citizens, consumers and producers, and that includes during the forthcoming EU-China summit being held in a few daysâ time.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am appalled at what has happened in this House today.
Clearly, for some Members, the interests of international communism take precedence over European values!
Mr President, it is a good thing that the European Parliament is debating the issue of EU â China relations.
China is the second largest world power in the world and is neither a democracy nor has a market economy.
By 2010, China wants to create the worldâs most powerful economic block, together with the ASEAN countries.
Even today, China is its largest factory.
Since enlargement, the EU has become Chinaâs largest trading partner, which is why relations with China are so important to us.
We should, however, remember that a purely economic approach to our relations will not reveal to us the true face of the Chinese dragon.
Politically, China continues to be a threat to the world.
Utopian socialism continues to flourish there.
There are political prisoners in its jails, there is no freedom of speech and there is censorship.
The communist party continues to be the only true path.
Torture is widely used in China, as is religious discrimination.
On the other hand, China is the worldâs third largest importer of crude oil.
Economic interests have brought China closer to countries with problems such as Iran, Sudan or Venezuela.
Competition for raw materials will put increased pressure on our relations with China in the future.
Chinaâs energy policy has led the country to make bilateral agreements that undermine all efforts to stabilise the price of oil.
The increase in Chinaâs military spending, particularly in the light of its provocative announcements of the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan, also provides grounds for concern.
China regularly stages military manoeuvres that simulate an attack on Taiwan.
The EU must take a decisive stance on this.
Only a fully independent Taiwan is a guarantee of peace in the Far East.
I repeat: only a fully independent Taiwan is a guarantee of peace in the Far East.
The Belder report, which we are now debating, provides an objective view of EU-China relations.
Let us hope that it will be the start of a more critical approach by the EU to the issue of China in the world.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when huge business or financial interests are at stake, lobbying in support of those interests very often takes place or threatens to take place, and that includes within politics and within Parliament (not just this evening in actual fact, but we have perhaps witnessed this type of game played out this evening).
We endorse the Belder report because we believe that Europe should not be afraid to ask China, as the giant and the economic power that it is, for satisfactory answers on the various topics mentioned.
I should therefore like it if, when the protection of human rights is spoken of, including by the Commission, it were not done in the same way as when all of the countriesâ old European Affairs offices used to insert clauses as a mere formality, things that had to be said: we must now talk about Tibet, both in order to create a good impression and to show that we take an interest.
Having heard here the words of such a high spiritual authority as the Dalai Lama, which moved us all, I feel â and I am expressing myself freely here â that our responses to the Tibetan tragedy, which is the tragedy of a holocaust and of the cultural genocide of a nation, are very weak and fundamentally ineffective.
As regards the economic and monetary field, I go beyond the Belder report and I would criticise it in the sense that, as far as the monetary field is concerned, it is time we called for a rather swift, though gradual, revaluation of the yuan renmimbi, if we want to protect our economies from the Chinese offensive.
How is it possible, then, that, while knowing that 70% of the counterfeit goods that circulate in our countries come from China, we still have to address issues such as those concerning the running of Chinese courts, the responses, the fact that there is a court here that finds in our favour and to which one can turn; in short, how is it possible that we have to call on China to completely overhaul its system so as to meet the requirements of democracy and development, and so on?
Finally, I would like to mention the issue of religious freedom, which is a fundamental issue: Christians, Catholics, Protestants, but also, as we have seen before our Parliament, members of the Falun Gong; in other words, human beings who believe in their ideas, in their philosophy and who are treated like criminals, tortured, incarcerated and probably also have parts of their bodies removed.
The traffic in organs that is practised by a country with which we continue to trade is a disgrace!
Â Â  Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Belder, for his work in considering the raft of amendments linked to this report.
It has not been an easy job to construct an EU-China report, because there are a multitude of factors that have needed to be considered.
The final result needs to be a balanced one that reflects the developing, positive relationship between two huge economic blocs while not shying away from the real and difficult concerns that exist on issues of human rights and the promotion of democracy; issues which we in Parliament claim to be serious about.
I am strongly in favour of continuing to develop a closer relationship with China.
The EU is Chinaâs largest trading partner, after all, and it is our second-largest trading partner.
Massive economic opportunities exist for both parties to grow and take advantage of new markets.
Therefore, anyone who advocates the isolation of China as a foreign policy strategy, for whatever reason, is being unrealistic.
That being said, however, we must be firm and consistent in our efforts to ensure that with the developing trade relationship must also come democratic development and an increased respect for human rights.
The two must go hand-in-hand.
That is why, as a human rights spokesperson, I am so glad to see such a strong emphasis on human rights concerns in this report.
I was relieved to hear Mrs De Keyser clarify that the PSE Groupâs objections are not based on concerns over the references to human rights issues; but that was until I heard what Mr Ford had to say.
The report is certainly not dominated by human rights concerns, but it does ask the hard questions, and rightly so, if we are to be taken seriously by China in relation to human rights issues, such as the need to guarantee genuine religious freedom; the concern at reports of widespread torture in Chinese prisons and reports of inhumane, degrading treatment and internment without trial; the laogai system of detention centres and labour camps; forced compliance with family planning policy; censorship of the internet and recent reports of sourcing human organs from prisoners.
I was delighted to hear the Commissioner make a very strong statement in relation to that issue.
In fact, I would congratulate her on her very balanced presentation this evening.
These are serious concerns that demand our attention as we proceed to develop the closer relationship with China that we all accept is inevitable and desirable.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, according to the official statistics of the Chinese national statistics office, the rate of growth of the Chinese economy for the whole of 2005 has been revised from 9.9% to 10.2%, due to faster growth in industrial activity and the services sector.
At the same time, the Central Bank has decided to increase the lower limit on deposits in foreign currency from 3% to 4%, with the ulterior motive of limiting the supply of dollars, given that the country has exchange reserves of EUR 941Â billion.
Chinese products, due to their low cost and exchange parity have a comparative export advantage.
China is the biggest consumer of electricity in the world and the third biggest oil importer, which makes it the regulator of energy policy and of economic development at international and regional level.
It is a development scenario which is an unobtainable dream for Europe and the United States.
However, the European Union must not under any circumstances deal with the emergence of China in global trade and the economy as a threat, but as an important new market which offers new possibilities and important opportunities for the economic development and strengthening of the European market itself.
It suffices if this is demonstrated and sought in agreements and with specific policies.
I think you will find the European Parliament agrees with your reference to the policies and tactics of the European Union and I would like, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to welcome this political move by the Commission.
We need to put at the centre of a cooperation agreement with China the further opening up of the Chinese economy to European companies, something which requires legislative and administrative regulations.
Recent announcements by the Chinese Government about increases in the capital which investors are allowed to hold in domestic companies and the anti-monopoly bill are particularly positive steps in this direction.
Commissioner, our future strategy should not be based on a colonial attitude or 'trade war' practices, but should protect the interests of European citizens, companies and workers by promoting cooperation and dialogue with the Chinese authorities.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate MrÂ Belder; it would have been a real shame if the very strange request for a referral back to committee had been upheld, as we have an opportunity to give our verdict only a few days away from the summit.
In my view, the request is slightly biased by the idea that a distinction can be made between the debate on human rights and the debate on the necessary report on China; in reality, we are talking about the same thing: enforcing international law and the international regulations on dumping and on free competition is the same as seeking to enforce the international charters on human rights and on the individual right to freedom and democracy, particularly for peoples such as the Tibetans, but also for the Yugur, who are often forgotten.
While we are on the subject, we must concentrate, as I would say to the Commissioner (and as I would like to say to the Council, too, but unfortunately it is not present) â the President has the light behind him, so he might be taking part in a Chinese shadow puppet show â on three issues that require our attention, starting with Internet freedom.
This is undoubtedly a Chinese problem, but it is also true that the technology for oppressing Chinese citizens via the Internet comes from the United States and Europe.
Secondly: Europol.
It seems that Europolâs management board would even like to begin talks with a view to concluding a cooperation agreement with the Chinese.
It really seems the height of contradiction to me that we should cooperate with the Chinese police.
The third issue, which is also a campaign led by the transnational radical party, concerns the death penalty: the task is ours too; at the forthcoming sitting of the UN General Assembly, we, as the European Union, must raise the issue of establishing a universal moratorium on capital punishment.
It is all very well saying these things to China, but we ourselves, as Europe, must try to deal with them.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the late reaction of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has quite astonished me, since there was plenty of time in the long process leading up to the resolution for it to express its opinion.
I too received the letter from the Chinese representatives, to which perhaps this reaction is attributable, for it does indeed contain some astounding so-called refutations of the claims made in the resolution.
Among other things, the Dalai Lama is once again called a separatist, even though he has repeatedly stated in public that he does not question the One China policy.
Moreover, the Falun Gong was described as an âevil groupâ, a choice of words in which we no longer have much confidence.
We must ask these questions when we talk with China, for failure to do so will not gain us more market share, but rather lose us the respect of our partners.
A good partnership is based on frank discussion and on each partner being able to say what they do not approve of about each other.
This is a partnership between equals, and this requires that we ask these human rights questions frankly and clearly.
Â Â  âMr President, in a rapidly globalising world economy, it is absolutely essential for Europe to promote cooperation with emerging economic powers such as China or India.
However, such cooperation should bring benefits to both parties.
Unfortunately, as far as relations between China and the EU are concerned, this healthy principle has been skewed, to the detriment of Europe.
The reasons are as follows.
Firstly, Chinese manufacturers do not include social welfare contributions, the costs of environmental protection, etc. in their manufacturing costs. This allows Chinese producers to offer products at much lower prices.
Secondly, in China, the manufacture of a variety of goods, including metal products, enjoys various forms of state support which constitute prohibited state subsidies under European Union regulations.
Exporting these products to the European market therefore constitutes unfair competition with European manufacturers.
Thirdly, the Chinese currency is significantly over-valued compared to the dollar or the euro.
Artificially maintaining the exchange rate at the current level significantly increases the effectiveness of Chinese exports, whilst hampering imports on to the Chinese market.
Fourthly, the Chinese authorities are doing practically nothing to restrict large-scale piracy of branded products by Chinese manufacturers.
Suffice it to say that as many as 70% of all pirated products on the European market originate in China.
In such circumstances, the European Commission must do everything in its power to minimise unfair competition from China.
It should step up the following activities in particular:
Firstly, the Commission must increase pressure on China, both through the WTO and directly, to eliminate unfair competition, and in particular the unfair competition resulting from an assisted exchange rate policy.
Secondly, the Commission must adopt a joint anti-dumping policy towards China as soon as possible.
It particularly needs to introduce high anti-dumping customs tariffs in the sectors most susceptible to unfair competition, especially the textile, shoe-making and metal sectors as well as the farming sector.
Finally, the European Commission must offer a comprehensive aid package to those sectors of the European economy that have, to date, suffered from unfair Chinese competition.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased there is room for a brief comment.
I should like to address a few observations to my fellow Members.
First of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for her response to the content of my report.
Her commitment is evident.
I am not at all opposed to the Peopleâs Republic of China and even less so to the Chinese.
I intend to carry on doing what I have always done, namely listening carefully to the Chinese discussions.
You were talking about a developing country.
There are some heated debates at the moment, with one country boasting various economies, while seeking to work towards one harmonious society.
Chinese experts who are involved in this say they need social values.
Well, it appears to me that it would be excellent if we were to take a cautious, yet committed approach to the discussion, for the benefit of both the partnership and internal stability.
We would then be part of the thinking process, not from the outside, but from the inside, for the benefit of the wellbeing of the Chinese people as well as for the partnership.
I am, then, greatly indebted to you for your approach, and I hope that you will be able to put it across at the summit.
I have again noticed that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has still have not replied to my question about the Ankang system, while claiming to be champions of human rights.
MrsÂ Dobolyi, you have failed to respond to an emphatic question that I have put to you three times now.
If there are factual mistakes, as MrsÂ Ford suggested, then I would like to see those put right in an amendment.
Some things have been added to the text thanks to the recommendation by MrÂ Hoppenstedt.
I have tabled an amendment to have this deleted.
Be fair in your ...
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak after the rapporteurâs concluding remark.
I believe that the debate we are having today is an important one, because China â and this not just a throwaway remark â is a great country with a great culture, one which can play an important role in the future if everything happens as it is expected to.
Even so, the rules must be observed.
We want this constructive strategic relationship and partnership with China.
However, if a country wishes to join the WTO, then it must respect intellectual property, it must address the rules on dumping, it must ask what the labour of prisoners in prison camps means, what competition on an equal footing means, it must cooperate in Doha, it must maintain an appropriate currency policy, and it can achieve a trade surplus through its own achievement, but not by ignoring the rules.
It is also important that such a country plays a part in solving political crises, as China is indeed doing to a certain extent in connection with Iran, however at the same time it is buying energy everywhere, for example in Darfur.
The question arises: is this how the responsibility of a future superpower is to be envisaged?
It is vital that this responsibility should be linked to human rights.
China has experienced intensive economic development, but it must produce evidence of the large-scale liberalisation not only of the economy, but also of the political system.
If it does not do so, then there could be a big rupture which might undermine its economic development.
So far China has offered no such evidence.
I will defend the One China policy, but only if it is based on the free decision of all interested parties, and this cannot be achieved through violence.
Last yearâs Chinese legislation on the subject is unacceptable, and, for as long as it remains so and threats continue to be made, then the arms embargo cannot be lifted.
We want relations with this great country, with China, but I think that in doing so we must also respect the common rules of international humanitarian law, and that this is the only basis for stable progress.
Â Â  â I should like, if I may, to concentrate in the short time allotted to me on one aspect of economic relations between the EU and China.
Statistics show that mutual trade is growing sharply and flourishing.
Indeed, the last 25 years has seen a 40-fold increase.
The EU has become Chinaâs biggest partner and, on the other side of that coin, China has become the Unionâs second biggest partner.
Nevertheless, alongside these positive developments, one cannot fail to notice a great many negative developments that are blocking further expansion of significant trade, including, first and foremost, the piracy and counterfeiting of European products and trade marks by Chinese manufacturers.
It is no secret that more than two thirds of fake goods intercepted on the European market come from China.
I should therefore like to call on the Commission and the Council to address this problem at the forthcoming summit in Helsinki.
China should be called upon to make substantial improvements in the protection of intellectual property rights and international inventions, to strengthen current legislation on the protection of intellectual property rights and of course to reinforce the activities of the countryâs civil courts in solving cases of industrial piracy.
The rules of the World Trade Organisation, to which China is a signatory, are after all binding in this area.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China is one of the rising powers of the twenty-first century.
Economically and politically, the Peopleâs Republic has become an important player.
Of course, the differences between our political systems mean that there are limits to cooperation, but, nevertheless, the EU must view good relations as a central priority for this partnership, and I think, Commissioner, that - as MrÂ Coveney has already said - you have, today, struck this balance extraordinarily well.
One example of positive cooperation is in foreign policy.
We want China to assume a greater responsibility in matters of foreign policy; a China that is credible and reliable in terms of foreign policy could make a substantial contribution to international stability.
We are having a dialogue with China on human rights and civil rights, and on the right of nonÂ governmental organisations and political foundations to go about their business freely.
I therefore welcome emphatically this Houseâs call for the reopening of the office of the German liberal Friedrich Naumann Foundation in Peking, which was forced to close in 1996.
It is important that the Foundation should resume its work of promoting democracy and development, and this must be implemented.
It would be an important contribution to the development of the strategic partnership.
Let me conclude by responding quite briefly to what has been said today: should we have a dialogue with the USA about China?
I think we should.
We are witnessing a power shift within the international system.
We can see it happening before our very eyes, and I believe that it is the responsibility of the great democracies in Europe and North America to consult with each other about such a change in the international system.
It is better, it is most important for us to talk about it with each other.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to offer my greetings to the Presidency, to you, Commissioner, and â in its absence â to the Presidency of the Council.
The excitement about this China report shows us that in our own House there are double standards of morality. This is improper for a debate on politics and human rights.
The EU is known around the world as a champion of human rights, at the same time it is Chinaâs most important trading partner.
It is on this basis that we need to act.
We all know about the serious violations of human rights in Tibet and in China, and that, time and time again, our Parliament calls upon China to respect those human rights.
I am addressing MrÂ Brok when I say that this clear demand must be reinforced by the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Tibet.
An amendment to this effect has been tabled by my group and by Members from other groups, and I would ask for it to be supported.
The EU makes respect for human rights into a condition of cooperation with all countries, without exception.
Moreover, I reject the Chinese Embassyâs shameless to us on the subject of Tibet.
Â Â  Mr President, China is the EUâs second-largest trading partner after the USA and, in economic terms, cannot be ignored.
Nevertheless, it remains a one-party communist dictatorship, sharing little in the way of common values with the EU, unlike India, which shares the Westâs respect for democracy and human rights.
One rare example of common interest is in the fight against international Islamist terrorism, as China has problems with its own Uighur Muslim minorities.
Regrettably, however, in its quest for international support and, in particular, energy security, China has recently courted terrorist-sponsoring Iran, and along with Russia refused to impose UN sanctions for Iranâs continuing uranium enrichment programme.
Similarly, on the principle of non-interference, China has good relations with maverick regimes ranging from Venezuela to Zimbabwe.
EU criticism of human rights in China is a good thing in itself.
China has an appalling record of inappropriate and wide-scale use of the death penalty, persecution of religious and other minorities, such as unregistered Christian groups, Falun Gong practitioners, Tibetans, etc. However, its inhumane treatment of forced labour prisoners, including allegations of organ trafficking from those executed, poor standards of animal welfare and ignoring of ILO standards, also mean that it has an unfair competitive cost advantage in its exports, which will give rise to legitimate calls for more protectionism, when we should all be striving instead for global free trade.
China is also obstructing full democracy in Hong Kong, dear to my heart as a British MEP.
In its recent anti-secession laws, China has also shown a belligerent attitude towards democratic Taiwan, which serves as a model to completely rebut those who say that China is too big and Chinese people too culturally different from the West to have democracy and high standards of human rights.
Therefore, we must maintain the arms embargo imposed by the EU.
We cannot ignore China with its annual 11% growth rates, but we must also not shy away from criticising this very great country when it is appropriate.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say, firstly, that we clearly all agree on the strategic importance of relations with China and I believe that we all share the concern about the situation in terms of human rights and public freedoms.
There are no disagreements over the need to demand that China make rapid and clear progress on these issues.
This is not a competition to see who cares most about human rights, because I truly believe that this House is united in that respect.
We must also acknowledge, however, that China has to deal with enormous challenges, political, social, economic and environmental challenges; it must deal with the consequences of its rapid growth and at the same time it must respond to the growing expectations of its citizens in the field of freedoms, naturally, and of education, health and many other fields.
We cooperate with China in many of these fields, with European Union human and material resources, in order to contribute to Chinaâs progress and, when problems arise, as in the case of certain commercial issues involving the textile and footwear sectors, we demand reciprocity, but at the same time we remain firm and employ dialogue in order to resolve those problems, because it is also in our interest, of course, to access that market and for our products to be respected under reciprocal conditions.
Nevertheless, I frankly wonder whether this report is going to help us to strengthen relations, whether it is the right way for us to have more influence on these processes of transformation, whether it helps us to be united in order to exert greater influence, or whether it divides us, and whether it strengthens us so that we can play an active role in the process of change in China, or whether it weakens us.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking about EU-China relations, I would like to emphasise the economic ties that are closely associated to the political and human rights aspects emphasised in the report.
China is becoming one of the most important foreign trade partners of the EU; therefore, the development of cooperation between the EU Member States and China is of great importance, especially in economic and trade relations.
In the meantime, economic relations between the EU and China are facing some problems.
China is still not a free but rather a mixed market and planned economy.
The Communist Party governing the country and controlling national funds is able to interfere in the economy, while state institutions are trying to maintain their influence via bureaucratic procedures and administrative requirements, thus impeding access of EU investments and goods to this market as well as their effect upon the market.
After China joined the WTO, Chinese products flooded the EU market.
The balance of trade of EU Member States with China is becoming increasingly unfavourable to the EU.
Chinese goods are displacing local ones, but China is not willing to open its markets.
Considering the EU-China strategic partnership that began in 2003, we must pursue China's contribution to make conditions beneficial to foreign trade, improve legal protection for foreign investments and open markets for EU goods and investments.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in the first draft of the EU-China report, the name Tibet does not even appear.
I am very grateful to the Committee on Foreign Affairs for having supported the amendments proposed by myself and my colleagues in the Tibet intergroup.
The report describes the foundations and the future orientation of our relations with China and it has an important signalling effect.
Human rights are not a minor issue, but the starting point of our political activity.
They are by no means the expression of so-called typical Western thinking.
This is not about empty words which sound pleasant and are not binding; it is about practical respect for fundamental rights.
In paragraphÂ 37, MrÂ Belder has found a decent compromise and included my amendments.
We condemn the severe human rights violations in Tibet, the oppression of religious freedom, arbitrary arrests or torture.
We repudiate the so-called âpatriotic education campaignâ, which involves monks and nuns being forced to make statements denouncing the Dalai Lama as a âdangerous separatistâ and proclaiming Tibet to be a part of China.
We call upon China to grant unimpeded access to the abducted Panchen Lama, the second highest spiritual authority after the Dalai Lama.
We expressly support the negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of His Holiness, also regarding genuine autonomy for Tibet.
In paragraphÂ 82 we demand the abolition of the death penalty and increased protection for minorities.
I hope that this House will approve both of these amendments tomorrow.
They are so important for a people that has been robbed of its identity by stealth.
I recall the Dalai Lamaâs visit to Brussels on the 31Â May.
He met MEPs as well as several Commissioners and the President-in-Office of the Council, Wolfgang SchÃŒssel.
We hope that an increasing number of people in positions of authority in China succeed in freeing themselves from their ideological ballast.
Â Â  â There is no such thing as a perfect report.
The Belder report bears out this view, but it does contain some important, relevant points.
Firstly, it goes into great detail about the human rights situation and the political, economic, social, labour and environmental problems in China, which are particularly prevalent among minorities such as the Tibetans and the Uighur.
Amnesty International has just forwarded a document to the Finnish Presidency as regards the EU-China summit, in which it describes the human rights situation in the country, concluding that the little progress that has been achieved is unsatisfactory.
Forced labour camps, Internet controls, the death penalty and curbs on religious freedoms form part of this sad reality.
Secondly, the Belder report highlights the importance of China taking seriously its responsibilities as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
In the EU, we do not accept Beijingâs occasionally threatening stance towards Taiwan.
Ultimately, China knows that it can achieve what it wants through peaceful means, as in the examples of Hong Kong and Macau, not least as regards its relations with African countries.
Beijing has not shown that it is committed to sustainable development, democratisation and peace.
Far from it in fact; China is one of the main arms exporters to Sudan, a country in which the regime is preparing for yet another bloody onslaught in Darfur.
China also imports oil from Sudan.
Lastly, and most importantly, this report reminds us of the Tiananmen massacre and the importance of maintaining an arms embargo against a regime that refuses to face its own past.
It is a country in which people continue to be detained and to disappear, their families kept in the dark.
We are not naÃ¯ve.
We are well aware that European countries, along with the United States and others, continue to sell military technology, or technology for military use, to China, in spite of the arms embargo.
Clear evidence of the symbolic political importance of this embargo is Beijingâs eagerness to see it lifted at all costs.
I support the maximum amount of interaction between the EU and Beijing at all levels and in all fields, for example, the economic, political, trade and cultural fields.
Yet I also support a language of truth.
China deserves nothing less, and therefore the embargo is a useful tool to have in place until China faces up to what happened on those fateful days in June 1989 and until it stops exporting arms to, and supporting, regimes that massacre and oppress their people, as in the cases of Sudan and Myanmar.
It is vital that the EU maintain this embargo, especially as the EU has yet to make its Code of Conduct legally binding.
We owe it to the EU, to our values, and to the thousands of Chinese citizens who are now living better, economically speaking, but who are ever more fearful about freedom and democracy.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, China is now at the heart of the world economy, which is why, through its new trade strategy, the European Union must construct a balanced partnership with China.
With regard to the latest trade disputes, the European Union must not fail to ensure that intellectual property rules are respected and permit easier access to the Chinese market.
If Chinaâs emergence as an economic superpower creates obstacles, it also makes new prospects available to the European Union, on condition however that international trade regulations are respected.
It is not so much a question of avoiding putting protectionist measures in place as of making China aware that, as a full member of the WTO, it has a duty to respect the rules of a fair and balanced world market.
That being the case, the implementation of anti-dumping or safeguard measures â which are legal instruments for protecting trade â is merely the outward effect of trade imbalances and no obstacle at all to our taking up the challenge of fairer globalisation.
In adopting its new strategy on China, the European Union will have to protect itself against accusations, and possible indications, of engaging in unfair competition and facilitate European manufacturersâ and exportersâ access to the Chinese market.
Parallel with this, and in order to abide by a partnership based on balanced exchanges, Europe will have to take up the challenge of competitiveness, technological progress and innovation.
Let us ensure, Commissioner, that China has as much need of us as we have of China.
Â Â  â Mr President, China is a strategic partner for the EU and Europe acknowledges Chinaâs status as a rising power on the international stage.
In recent years, relations between China and Europe have improved in many fields, particularly in trade, as well as in the field of technical and scientific cooperation.
The most important example of strategic partnership is perhaps cooperation on Galileo, the European satellite navigation programme.
The EU is Chinaâs most significant partner and investor, while China is the EUâs second largest trading partner.
As a rising economic power and permanent member of the UN Security Council and a member of the WTO, China bears increasing responsibility for international security and global peace.
It is from this point of view that I would like to draw attention to the information sent by Amnesty International to the Finnish presidency in relation to the EU-China summit to be held on 9Â September this year.
Amnesty International has drawn attention to violations of human rights in China.
Their information raises the question of the use of capital punishment in China, âre-educationâ through forced labour, arbitrary arrest and detention, the use of torture and persecution against human rights activists and lack of media freedom in that country.
Amnesty International has also raised the issue of the sale of arms by China to Sudan as an example of a foreign policy that ignores fundamental human rights in the modern world.
The European Union must combine its strategic partnership with China with work to persuade the Chinese authorities to expand political and personal freedoms in the Chinese system and to truly observe the constitution and international treaties to which China is a signatory.
Â Â  Mr President, when engaged in a partnership with a dictatorship, the crucial issue is to create a credible balance between economic and strategic interests on the one hand, and democratic values on the other.
This report expresses serious concern over the latter, and rightly so.
Indeed, we must face the reality that increased economic relations have not resulted in any real progress in the field of the rule of law.
Also, experience shows that merely expressing concern over human rights has no impact on dictatorships.
Therefore, our message for the EU-China summit should be that there will be no automatic progress in economic relations without real progress in the rule of law.
The EU, as Chinaâs largest trading partner, has the leverage to force Chinaâs leaders to start implementing genuine democratic reforms.
I have a few comments.
The economic relations themselves need to be balanced.
In China there is wholesale counterfeiting of EU brands, competition is distorted and intellectual property rights ignored.
EU Members States are, in all probability, importing large quantities of goods produced by prisoners in laogai torture camps.
That is a moral outrage.
Secondly, there is Tibet.
The EU must make it one of its priorities to insist that China grants Tibet cultural and religious autonomy, and also opens a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.
Tibet is rated by Freedom House as being, along with Chechnya, one of the worldâs two worst-off territories.
The EU should stress the seriousness it attaches to this by appointing an EU special representative for Tibetan affairs.
Thirdly, there is Taiwan.
Taiwan-China policy should fully respect the democratic choices of the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan.
We should also insist that Beijing allow Taiwan to enter into practical cooperation with the World Health Organisation and other international bodies.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is the region in the world with the greatest buying power, and that speaks for itself.
We are an attractive market for Chinese manufacturers, and we are a good source of income for Chinese workers.
We are in a win-win situation.
Thanks to affordable purchases and a wage situation different to our own, our consumers can buy affordable products, and meanwhile in China they have financial reserves totalling hundreds of billions enabling them to buy products from us as well.
I am thus talking about opening our markets to each other, reducing quotas, lowering customs duties, which will lead to a win-win situation on both sides.
As the speaker on questions of energy for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the issue of energy and the issue of Kyoto are matters of particular importance to me.
China plays a very important role in the field of coal: 75% of its energy is produced from coal and, MrÂ Brok, only 1% from nuclear energy.
We must therefore face up to reality: 75% of the Chinese require a great deal of technology in order to get onto a level footing with Kyoto and with the general implementation.
Here there are great opportunities for both sides, just as there are in the use of water power.
In this field China has enormous potential: worldwide, it has the largest share of water power.
Here there are still many resources that can be developed in the future.
The consumption of crude oil, too, which at the moment amounts to around 5.5% of world consumption, will rapidly increase in the future.
At present, China accounts for 40% of the additional worldwide demand for oil.
We can see that energy is a central challenge, and I would ask the Commissioner to properly address this issue at the summit.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to make a few brief comments.
Firstly, I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee and the rapporteur, and, secondly, the Commissioner for her presence in the plenary here this afternoon and this evening, while others were absent because they were busy waiting for a flying visit from the Iranian mediators and therefore do not have time for this House.
Thirdly, we refused to appoint a Special Representative in the Committee because a Special Representative is impossible to control.
Such Representatives are expensive, and there is already in any case an inflated number of Special Representatives, whom no one is able to inspect.
For this reason, it is important in my view that we find solutions that can work within the framework of the Commission.
I am in favour of supporting Tibet and supporting its cultural identity, but we should not undermine the Commission, which has the powers to deal with human rights.
The Special Representative would set himself up in the Council, where, because of the legal situation, this House would be unable to intervene.
We therefore agree with what you have to say in terms of content, but we think that your methods are incorrect.
Â Â  . Mr President, this debate was very timely and it has provided me with food for thought for the EU-China summit in Helsinki.
I should like to add that the vast majority of subjects raised tonight will also feature clearly on the summit agenda and I will report back to you on that.
Let me make a general point on the relationship between trade and human rights, which is a central theme of this report.
I am not sure whether specific linkages are desirable or feasible, but I would argue that this is an inevitable connection, insofar as Chinaâs opening is strongly predicated on its WTO accession, which, apart from frequently raised important issues like intellectual property rights, involves also an overhaul of the Chinese legal system, with an emphasis on the rule of law.
It must be said that real progress has been made.
That is fundamental in moving forward in of the human rights questions raised today and it is even happening almost by stealth.
Let me come back to some specific points that have been raised tonight.
Firstly, on Tibet, we share the concerns expressed by the European Parliament regarding the human rights situation in Tibet and in particular the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.
We have regularly addressed the issue of Tibet in the framework of the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights, as well as at the highest political level, including summits.
As part of this overall policy vis-Ã -vis Tibet, for many years we have been asking for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, as that is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question.
We have therefore taken note of the talks between the envoys of the Dalai Lama and the representatives of China.
Let me also say a word on Taiwan.
We have been consistent throughout in urging the two sides to resolve their issues through a peaceful dialogue.
In this regard we have also noted some recent positive developments in the cross-strait situation.
We have to recognise that there are new Chinese efforts to restart discussions with Chinese and Taiwanese opposition politicians.
Flights across the Straits have resumed, but an inclusive dialogue with all parties in Taiwan is also needed.
This is important.
Let me also make a point concerning our bilateral relationship and the relationship with the United States of America.
As Mr Lambsdorff said, it is important to talk about China to the US about common concerns, for example on open markets and human rights, because we can achieve more together vis-Ã -vis China.
However, it is also clear that a strategic dialogue with the US, which we have at official level, does not mean that we have to agree right across the board.
On the long-standing issue of the arms embargo, it is true that we are willing to continue working towards a possible lifting of the embargo, on the basis of our joint statement of 2004, the EU-China Summit and the subsequent European Council conclusions.
However, at the same time, we have left China with no doubt as to the importance of progress on human rights in order to create a more positive atmosphere for lifting the embargo.
We have also made clear our commitment to ensure that lifting the embargo would not lead to any substantive change in the strategic balance in the Asian region and that the national security of friendly and allied countries would be fully taken into account.
So, again, this is one of those issues that is very important.
On the very specific and important issue of shoes, let me say that on 30Â August 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal to impose anti-dumping duties on certain leather shoes from China and Vietnam.
Reflecting the finding that dumping exists and EU producers are suffering harm, we have proposed a duty of 16.5% for China and 10% for Vietnam for certain leather shoes.
This proposal now passes to the Member States, which have one month in which to consider it for adoption.
That is the situation at present.
On the sectoral dialogues, my services produce regular updates and these are on our websites.
A further update will be available shortly.
I should like to close with two general statements.
Again, as I said at the start, we are committed to human rights, social and economic rights, which include in particular freedom of expression, religion, association and protection of the rights of minorities.
I should also like to say that the death penalty is one of those questions continually being addressed.
I should also like to re-emphasise what I said before about the Falun Gong.
Finally, in response to Mr Brok, and as I said at the beginning, we need China to become a responsible member of the international community, but more than just a stakeholder: it needs to be a positive and an active contributing partner.
It is a very important member of the international community, being a permanent member of the Security Council.
All of that will feature prominently in our communication, which will be available in the autumn.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Carmen Fraga EstÃ©vez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on launching a debate on a Community approach towards eco-labelling schemes for fisheries products (2005/2189(INI)) (A6-0219/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, as rapporteur for this report, the first thing I would like to stress is the unquestionable role that a credible label or certification can play, among other measures that can be taken, in our efforts to guarantee sustainable fishing.
Nevertheless, the issue has been on the table in the European Commission since the 1990s and so far nobody has decided to deal with it.
In the meantime, in a market that is becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, private promoters of eco-labels for fishery products are feathering their nests, causing complete confusion amongst consumers, at best, and more than likely discrediting the system in general, since when a premium can be added to a product by saying that it is ecological, without the need to prove it, then fraud is a likely outcome.
I am one of the people who have often reminded the Commission that it should deal with this issue as soon as possible.
Hence the disappointment that some of us felt when the Commission finally published this communication: a document almost without content, lacking in analysis, which makes no commitment whatsoever and which does not provide any criteria or guidelines to follow.
It clearly did not require more than ten years to achieve this result and the Commission is clearly totally overwhelmed by the reality of the attractive market in eco-labelling and the many private interests that sustain it, some of which are laudable and some of which are not.
In that regard, I would like to mention that, when he appeared before the Committee on Fisheries on leaving office, the former Commissioner MrÂ Fischler confessed that something he had been unable to tackle by the end of his term-in-office had been rules on eco-labelling and that that â and I quote â was âdue to pressure from many quartersâ.
To this we can add the fact that reliably establishing the criteria for defining a sustainable fisheries product is undoubtedly a much more complex task than it may at first appear.
We must get to work though, because other interested parties are doing it for us and many of them only have their own interests in mind.
The Commission is not alone in this task either, because it already has the guidelines issued by the FAO, and debates in many international fora, including the World Trade Organisation.
Governments, NGOs, private companies and fishermen have also expressed their opinions.
By means of this report, with the invaluable and varied contributions of many colleagues, including those of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the European Parliament is also offering its contribution to the definition of guidelines that will enable consumers, politicians and the fisheries sector to become more involved in the sustainability of fisheries resources.
We believe that, in a global sense, a Community system of labelling must be consistent with the existing guidelines of international bodies, that it must not lead to any kind of discrimination, nor create obstacles to trade, particularly that of the least-developed countries, and that it must act as a weapon for combating illegal fishing by denying it access to the markets.
With regard to its internal functioning, the Committee on Fisheries believes that, regardless of whether there are one or several labels, always of a voluntary nature, the system must be a single system and must be promoted by the European Union, which must establish its operating rules and guarantee the independence of the accreditation and certification bodies, as well as the transparency and accuracy of the information at all stages in the chain of custody, from the fishing vessel to the final consumer.
We also call upon the Commission to present, within six months, a communication on the minimum requirements and guidelines for a Community scheme for labelling fisheries products.
I would also like the Commission, finally, to clarify whether it is in favour of calling it an eco-label, or whether it is opting for another name and why, and we would urge it to take account of the considerations addressed to it by this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez and the Committee on Fisheries and to Mrs Ries and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for a constructive report on a Community approach to eco-labelling for fisheries products.
I am pleased at the high degree of interest they have shown in the Commissionâs communication.
In fact, the report is a fitting and valuable contribution to the debate on eco-labelling.
It contains many elements and ideas that are helpful to strengthen further the debate.
The Commission indeed attaches great importance to the development of a consistent policy on eco-labelling and to a consistent integration of environmental concerns into the Common Fisheries Policy.
Together with other actions proposed by the Commission, such as the implementation of sustainability which leads to sustainable yields, or the promotion of more environment-friendly fishing methods, I see eco-labelling as a complementary tool for a more environment-friendly fisheries policy.
At the same time it satisfies the interests of both consumers and the industry.
I would like to thank Mr Morillon for his description of eco-labelling as a positive sanction supporting sustainable behaviour.
Eco-labelling is a relatively new approach in the context of sustainable fisheries management.
It is based on a voluntary and participative approach, through which fishermen will in future, within the limits of the standards set by legislation, define requirements and implement them.
Such a voluntary approach has been adopted in other fields, particularly in that of food safety with the enforcing of the HACCP system, and has proved highly successful.
I thank you for lending your support to that approach.
I am happy to see that the Commission and Parliament share the same views on the overall objectives of eco-labelling schemes, on the principles and features that credible schemes should contain, and on the need to address properly a complex and currently rather anarchic reality.
Traceability, transparency, a sound scientific basis, and third-party certification are essential.
I see these as the prerequisites that will help us make the most of eco-labelling schemes and that will contribute to the sustainability of fisheries.
In the Commission we opted for launching a debate on the right approach rather than proposing operational provisions at too early a stage.
I understand that many of you feel that the Commission should have been more assertive. However, I am convinced that it was wise to proceed as we did.
Due to the originality of the approach, the ambitious objective we have and the controversy that issues like these invariably raise, it would have been premature to bring forward an operational proposal as early as June last year.
I assure you that our choice to launch a debate first has proven to be successful.
It has facilitated and accelerated the exchange of views and relevant experience between all sides concerned. As a result we now have a sound and almost complete picture of the situation, on which we can base further Community action.
The active participation of the Community in the FAO debate has given us an early advantage, and by launching the debate and participating in fruitful exchanges of views we have strengthened our leading position in this matter.
The definition of the notion of sustainability is at the heart of the debate.
Many of the parties involved have inquired about relevant criteria. To follow up on this, DG Fisheries has set up a group of independent experts to work on that very issue.
The expert group is on the point of concluding its work.
Based on that work the Commission will draft guidelines for the setting-up of eco-labelling schemes and will propose a list of minimum requirements against which private eco-labelling schemes could be assessed.
I have taken note of the resolutionâs request for a communication to be addressed to the Council and to Parliament within the next six months.
I have no difficulty in reverting to Parliament.
However, at this point in time, the shape and form of the Commissionâs proposals have still to be determined.
Looking at the broader picture, I believe it would be more appropriate to come back to Parliament once the whole consultation exercise has been concluded. That would allow us to carry out a thorough assessment of the following discussions and consultations: a second shareholder consultation, to be held before the end of this year, which would be an opportunity to gather views on the future guidelines; further discussions in the Council in the months to come, which will conclude the current discussion phase; and, additionally, the report from the expert group, which will form the basis for the preparation of operational provisions that could be tabled during the course of next year.
All this will give us a further opportunity to discuss the future Community approach towards eco-labelling on a consolidated and even more informed basis.
That whole process should lead to the adoption of specific and concrete decisions.
With regard to Amendments 1 and 2, the Commission believes that eco-labelling is a tool that will contribute to a more sustainable exploitation of fish stocks and improve the effectiveness of the Common Fisheries Policy.
With regard to Amendment 3, it reiterates some of the advantages of adopting the third option for establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes, as mentioned in the Commission communication.
I thank you for this report and the wider debate generated on eco-labelling.
I am confident that at the end of this process we can put into operation a proper basis for eco-labelling schemes that should have far-reaching and positive effects.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, MrsÂ Fraga, on the quality of her finely nuanced report which successfully reflects the complexity of what is at stake.
The overall objective is to encourage the sector to adopt fishing methods more in keeping with the objectives of sustainable economic, social and environmental development.
Indeed, there is no denying the facts: the overexploitation of fisheries resources affects 25% of species and, in the case of a number of these, in a particularly worrying way.
Where cod alone is concerned, stocks are down to a third of the minimum volume recommended by scientific experts if this species is not to become extinct.
These are the terms in which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has emphasised its priorities in the opinion it has drafted.
We have our doubts about the option favoured by the Commission in this debate, namely that of establishing minimum demands â as referred to by the Commissioner â regarding these eco-labelling schemes.
Our own choice is meant to be more ambitious: single, centralised labelling according to essential criteria whereby the scheme is transparent, optional in character, accessible and credible â a point emphasised by the rapporteur.
Admittedly, the success of this initiative depends on the actors in the sector being properly consulted. In the end, it basically depends, however, on consumer choice.
In this connection, it is instructive to visit, as I myself have done, the fish counter of a supermarket and read the injunctions to âprotect the seaâ, âsupport sustainable fishingâ, âfish ecologicallyâ and so on. There is a host of confusing messages.
With this proliferation of labels, the risk we run is that of missing our target.
Consumers will feel neither involved nor encouraged to make the more informed choices we should like them to make, and we shall not have succeeded in achieving our objective, that is to say of creating a virtuous circle.
I therefore share MrsÂ Fragaâs conclusions and hope that the Commission will, in the end, take a serious and analytical look at the options proposed and will take account of our recommendations in the next stages of this process.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what does sustainable fishing mean?
How do the various labels that currently exist succeed in protecting fishing and in enabling us to say that fishing is sustainable?
The report states that the European Union must address the issue of curbing the proliferation of different eco-labels and guarantee the establishment of a Community system that is based on the same principles and on the same basic requirements.
We support that decision, but it must be stressed first and foremost that the implementation of an eco-labelling system will have a strong impact on production in the entire sector: we must begin by starting and developing a debate with operators in the sector so as to carefully assess the consequences for the sector that will result from the decisions adopted for this certification system.
Secondly, we must bear in mind the specific characteristics and features of the coastal areas in which the system will be applied: in other words, the standards and rules will have to be adapted to the reality of the local ecological, environmental and socio-economic system.
Thirdly, the application of the label must be backed up by socio-economic activity-based initiatives aimed at encouraging operators in the sector to join the voluntary system and by information campaigns aimed at consumers.
Finally, we must pay attention to the fact that the implementation of an eco-label for fishery products must be thoroughly integrated with the recognised quality systems in force so as to prevent any overlapping or discrepancies between laws, so as not to cause confusion among consumers and so as to create synergies among the systems, thus enabling resources to be saved.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to congratulate MrsÂ Fraga on the interesting report we are debating today in this House.
In-depth study of consumersâ preferences and attitudes is a fundamental need for any industry, and that clearly includes the fisheries products industry.
The change in living habits and the introduction of new technologies have led to an evolution amongst European consumers, who are increasingly concerned about their health and also the protection of the environment.
One of the best methods for providing information is labelling, which must therefore be clear and comprehensible and contain accurate information.
I am therefore delighted that the Commission is at last dealing with this debate on systems of labelling for fisheries products with a view to defining the European Unionâs approach to this issue.
The truth is that the increasing importance that consumers attach to sustainable development has led to a disconcerting range of private labels, without any kind of control, which may undermine their initial purpose, that is, as guarantees of a catching and processing system that respects the environment.
If, furthermore, it provides additional information on the sustainability of the product, the independence of the control and certification body must be guaranteed, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out.
In this regard, I agree with the words of the Spanish Director-General for Fisheries Structures and Markets, Alberto LÃ³pez, who pointed to the need to prevent the trivialisation of eco-labelling.
In fact, if the labels do not conform to standardised, accredited parameters, all we will achieve will be labels that are all at that level; harmonisation will take place, but for purely commercial reasons, rather than with a view to tackling the real issue.
In this regard, I can only applaud the FAOâs initiative to audit all eco-labels in order to identify those which have technical and scientific support and seek consistency and harmonisation.
We in the Committee on Fisheries share the Commissionâs objectives, such as sustainability and the need for European action in this field.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez on a very thoughtful report.
It identifies the crucial issues and contributes considerably to the debate concerning them.
Of the amendments, we support only Amendment 2, taking the view that Amendments 1 and 3 are covered sufficiently by the existing text.
Clearly, whatever system we develop must be voluntary, in the sense that companies should be able to choose whether or not to become involved.
It must also respect the need for other types of labelling, such as those concerning quality.
That said, the report rightly draws attention to the difficulties of doing no more than establishing minimum criteria for voluntary schemes.
FAO standards mean that there must be a dimension of public ownership. This requires some form of independent monitoring at the very least.
For these reasons, we believe that a single Community labelling scheme merits fuller exploration.
There are clearly potential advantages and disadvantages, but it should be possible to devise something which recognises different fisheries and products, but is neither cumbersome nor bureaucratic.
Whatever the eventual choice, speaking personally as a consumer rather than a legislator, I would make one plea for the use of some clearly identifiable common symbol, comparable to the CE mark currently employed, where we have harmonised rules concerning the health and safety of products.
We hope that Parliament will give overwhelming endorsement to the report and we look to speedy progress towards an appropriate outcome.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you, MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vez, for your constructive and well-balanced report.
We have an election in Sweden.
One of the election issues is the lack of cod.
Voters ask me: âHow am I to be ethical in eating fish?â
Only this week, I have given them six pages of recommendations on precisely that subject.
We need labelling that is easily understandable so that we can go home with a clear conscience and eat good fish.
Those who buy eco-labelled fish also want to know that the stock is not threatened.
If the last cod is eaten, having been caught with very good equipment, in the correct way and under the right circumstances, it is still the last cod.
Such a situation is emphatically not sustainable ecologically.
I therefore think that AmendmentÂ 2 is important, emphasising as it does that threatened species, precisely by virtue of being threatened, simply cannot be fished in an ecologically responsible way.
I wish to emphasise two aspects of MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vezâ report.
Independent control, as mentioned in paragraphÂ 6, is very important in conferring credibility.
Moreover, it is very important that we in some way facilitate clear labelling for small-scale fisheries. Clear labelling may constitute a competitive advantage for small-scale fisheries.
We must therefore ensure that it can be exploited and puts small-scale fisheries in a fair competitive position.
Â Â  . â I too would like to thank MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vez for her report.
The first issue raised by this report is whether there really is a need for eco-labelling for fisheries products, and whether this can actually help add value to the product and in turn bring benefits to the consumer.
As the rapporteur points out, according to Regulation (EC) 2371/2002, all fisheries activities carried out in the EU should by definition be sustainable, since they should conform to Community standards.
It therefore follows that all fisheries products caught on the basis of those standards will have eco-labelling.
Nevertheless, any eco-labelling of fisheries products caught on the basis of criteria other than those laid down in existing legislation concerning the fishing catch may lead to discrimination between producers.
We therefore feel that eco-labelling would be a positive step.
Eco-labelling also takes place in farming, aquaculture and processed foods, enabling issues relating to the environment and food safety to be properly addressed.
Eco-labelling would also work in relation to all imported products, which would have to comply with the Community regulation on fisheries products.
A further issue is whether a Community-level label of this nature would bring benefits over the variety of existing labels on the market, as highlighted by previous speakers, given that these labels can be misleading to consumers and are often simply the result of a marketing strategy by companies, without any public certification.
In this regard, we believe that a Community-level label would be complex, bureaucratic and excessively restrictive for organisations in the fisheries sector and for the Member States.
What is needed is to set up a public certification framework with the direct involvement of the authorities in the Member States.
This is the right way forward for defining the rules on this issue, in which there is a legal vacuum.
As regards the issue of the added value that may accrue from this kind of labelling, we believe that there is a need to ensure its distribution in the value chain in order that producersâ efforts and investments might be rewarded without consumers being penalised.
Â Â  Mr President, the principle of eco-labelling is sound.
The danger is that when the EU bureaucracy and red tape get to work, the system that emerges could be unwieldy, excessively burdensome and very expensive.
The fisheries sector already suffers enough from EU stipulations and restrictions.
The most that the EU should do is to set minimum requirements to be met by voluntary eco-labelling schemes.
Thus I would have to part company from those who support a single Community scheme with what is termed âambitious criteriaâ, but which to the industry might seem more like excessive regulation.
Fundamentally, we are looking for good traceability and proof of sustainable practices. These can be secured by setting sensible and manageable minimum standards.
We do not need another array of regulation or army of inspectors.
We need sometimes to temper Utopian environmental demands with business reality.
Whatever the eventual outcome, I hope that will be a hallmark of the scheme.
Nonetheless I congratulate the rapporteur on her thoughtful report.
Tonight I also take some pleasure in commiserating with our rapporteur.
I refer of course to the fact that tonight my small country of Northern Ireland famously defeated the mighty football team of Spain at Windsor Park in Belfast.
That is something that does not happen very often, but when it happens it is worthy of note!
It comes on a good day: a day when Northern Ireland football supporters won the coveted Brussels International Supporters Award for 2006, which is sponsored and supported by the EU.
I shall end on that happy note.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vez on her outstanding report and to say that in view of the growing interest in safe, high-quality food products, the need to preserve marine ecosystems and the recent upsurge in products with what is known as eco-labelling, a Community approach to eco-labelling is urgently needed.
A number of new, high-quality eco-labelling schemes have appeared around the world, including one in my country, POPA (the Azores Fisheries Observation Programme), which certifies the tuna catch in the Azores Autonomous Region.
The problem is that not all environmental certification programmes prioritise the protection of the biological heritage of our oceans.
Instead, there is a range of economic interests often hidden behind this kind of labelling, and this is why, in order to protect the environment and the consumer, we must proceed with great care and assume our responsibilities as political decision makers.
Among the different proposals put forward by the Commission in this communication, the one that can best serve the interests at hand is that of establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes.
In this way, on the basis of these pre-established minimum requirements, eco-labelling schemes can develop freely, on a flexible, voluntary basis, via public or private initiatives, yet within a generic regulatory framework.
As a public entity, the EU must define these minimum requirements because only then will it be possible to protect the general interest and the prerogatives enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy.
Lastly, I should also like to point out that this is work that we have to do, both in the context of the Union and in the framework of trade relations outside the Union, in order to guarantee transparency, credibility and fairness, not least because eco-labelling is set to become a further means of distinguishing between products with repercussions for competitiveness.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her exceptional work and to say that we all know that the various food crises that have come to the public's attention over recent years have created a feeling of insecurity among consumers, with the result that a strong trend towards the demand for high quality products and more frequent quality certification is developing on the market.
Eco-certification and labelling lie at the centre of the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.
Promoting and applying eco-labelling systems strengthens environmental awareness among consumers, thereby encouraging environmental responsibility among producers, by making them more aware of the environmental repercussions of fisheries and aquaculture.
What is needed today is to safeguard the development of a uniform labelling system by informing and working with all the agencies involved, a system based on identical basic principles and preconditions, in accordance with the guidelines of the UN Food and Agriculture Office and the guidelines issued by the International Organisation for Standardisation.
I should also like to point out that public health and the viability of fisheries should not be exhausted merely within a labelling system.
They should be the subject of a constant quest to formulate the sustainable fisheries policy which is our basic objective.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to warmly congratulate MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vez on her report on the Commissionâs communication and also MrsÂ Ries, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
I am pleased to see â and this also demonstrates that the Committee on Fisheries can deal with topics in an adult manner â that there is a certain level of harmonisation with regard to the way in which an eco-label can be introduced into the fisheries sector.
One would be tempted to say that in the fisheries sector, every free fish that is caught at sea or in inland waterways deserves an eco-label: it was, after all, raised in a sound, natural living environment, but that is probably not the intention and we will therefore need to look at what can be done at international level, including outside Europe, on the basis of criteria issued by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
In that sense, I have to say that I agree with the report by MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vez.
If you opt for a European eco-label, you have to do it properly.
That means that the fish that falls within its scope must meet all the rules with regard to the enforcement of the quota.
The rules of environmental legislation must also be met, which also requires the necessary efforts from the Member States, but it could be a good guarantee.
If you do not do it that way, then it is better to get the industry to deal with it and ensure that a good label is introduced in response to consumer demand.
I, however, would opt for the rapporteurâs line, with clear-cut conditions, also for the Commission, so that the eco-label meets the European quota regulations and everything that is connected to this.
In that way, the Commission facilitates and industry submits the applications, which appears to be the right way of going about things.
I should like to add a brief comment about small-scale coastal fishing, something to which, I think it good to devote attention.
I myself come from an area where small shrimps are caught.
An eco-label has now been introduced in that sector as well, which I welcome, certainly if that also emphatically involves sustainable fishing, as well as a number of other things.
In that sense, I am pleased with this report and pleased that this House, by means of MrsÂ Fraga EstÃ©vezâÂ report, can make a positive step towards sound qualified European eco-labelling.
Â Â  â I should also like to congratulate both our rapporteur from the Committee on Fisheries and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
I have found this debate extremely interesting and I feel that the rapporteur is quite right to highlight the lack of tightness in the definition of the options presented to us by the Commission.
What I find absolutely central to the issue is what is referred to in pointÂ 8 of our resolution, which is also found in the opinion of the Committee on the Environment; namely that the labelling will only be properly effective if it is uniform and easily comprehensible to the consumer.
This is incompatible with a system in which the Commission has a secondary role and in which publicity concerns carry greater weight than a series of tight, objective criteria.
From this point of view, therefore, I feel that we must adopt a strong, centralised position, as highlighted by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment.
We must not backslide on this position, because otherwise we run the risk of wasting our efforts and losing the initiative completely.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vez, on her usual excellent work.
I also wish to congratulate the Commission on starting a dialogue on eco-labelling.
Eco-labelling on fisheries products states that they were produced in accordance with a specific series of environmental rules and that their method of production does not have adverse repercussions on the environment.
It is very important that we ensure that eco-labelling is reliable.
This will protect both fish stocks and consumers.
An effort must be made to inform consumers, who must support it, be informed and understand that, in buying eco-labelled products, they can be sure that they are buying healthy and safe food and that they are protecting the environment.
We will all win from these efforts: consumers will win because they will be supplied with safe and healthy products, undertakings will win because they will increase their competitiveness and the environment will win because its resources will be exploited ecologically.
To close, I wish to recapitulate: firstly, labelling must be voluntary; secondly, labelling must be dominated by a spirit of transparency, so that no one doubts its reliability; thirdly, labelling must be by an independent authority and fourthly, this effort requires â and I emphasise this even though it is self-evident â fishermen to be present at the talks.
Woe betide if we ignore them.
We need to sit down at the same table, we need to consult them and they need to understand that the effort being made is in their interest.
Fifthly and lastly, this effort and the principles laid down and adopted by the European Union must be combined with similar action on a global scale and all the states must adopt these principles, because it makes no sense if the European Union alone is protecting the environment.
Â Â  â Mr President, the rapporteurâs of the environmental debate sums up our current experience, and particularly that of the FAO.
It stresses the basic function of labelling and its importance in improving the quality of fish products and giving the fishing sector a proper social structure.
I can state with satisfaction that the new Member States from the Baltic region agree with the aims of the Commissionâs communiquÃ©.
However, their position expressed a preference for certain aspects of the problem of labelling.
Four issues are of particular importance in this case.
Firstly, the Baltic states decidedly support the idea of establishing minimum requirements for eco-labelling programmes, in line with the expectations of the parties involved, namely the fishermen, processors and consumers.
These programmes should be based on voluntary participation.
Secondly, the principle of voluntary participation must mean, in practice, the rejection of all economic discrimination or trade barriers.
Thirdly, a major element of these guarantees must be to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises and firms from less developed countries have equal access to the system.
Fourthly, there is also concern in Baltic states about the limitations related to the control and supervision of fishing in open waters, which has been occurring for years and has been difficult to eliminate.
At the moment, it is easier to see a difference in terms of environmental consequences in the aquaculture sector, where labelling is far easier to introduce.
Finally, I would like to say that I agree with MrsÂ Fragaâs âtool in the boxâ message, which is an inspiration for the European Union, and provides us with a real opportunity to show the world how to look for ways of implementing long-awaited schemes in the field of eco- labelling.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur.
As usual, she has produced an excellent report; we expect nothing else from her.
Labelling is the âinâ word at present, and if we must have it, let us keep it simple and clear.
It should not be a further burden on the industry.
I would also plead for input from those who have to implement this labelling to make sure that it is clear and transparent, that it is of good design and can easily be seen and understood.
Mr Maat was right when he said that the Commission must make a good job of it.
I fully support what he says.
This must not be used as a stick to beat the industry.
I am concerned that it could be used by some of the scientists and others as an opportunity to curb TACs and quotas when there is disagreement between fishermen and the scientists.
I do not believe we need or require a âone size fits allâ policy.
If we go down that road, we will create a hornetsâ nest.
Not everywhere has the same problems and I am deeply conscious of the need, where necessary, to ensure that regional differences are respected.
I listened to the Commissioner with interest.
He said he would come back to Parliament when the Commission had taken a decision.
Might it not be better to consult Parliament along the way, rather than come back and tell us what you have decided, Commissioner?
You talked about a âtool in your boxâ.
This must not become another tool in your box thanks to which you can place bureaucratic control on the industry.
I am not totally convinced that the consumer is really demanding this.
Finally, can I say to Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez and to you, Mr President, there is great joy in Belfast tonight: we beat the Spanish football team 3-2.
Northern Ireland is a very small place of one and a half million people, and we have had many problems over the years.
It seems that at football we can beat the English, we can beat the Germans and we can beat the Spanish, but last Saturday there were lots of tears in Belfast when Iceland beat us 3-0.
So it is a source of great joy tonight that we have beaten Spain.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Nicholson.
I cannot say you deliver good news for us, but congratulations to you anyway.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vez, and everyone who has spoken tonight.
Although not in agreement on all aspects, the Commission and Parliament are on the same wavelength as regards moving towards adopting decisions based on tariff assessments and broad consultations.
I would underline to the last speaker, MrÂ Nicholson, that the debate tonight fully reflects the way the Commission wanted to involve Parliament before entering the legislative phase of what needs to be done on eco-labelling.
Obviously, when it comes to that legislative phase, the involvement of Parliament will be a top priority prior to finalisation of the whole process relating to the eco-labelling scheme.
Let me refer to some specific points that were raised during the debate.
Most of the existing schemes are in effect relatively consistent and are not misleading.
The Commissionâs preferred option for establishing minimum criteria for eco-labelling schemes will, however, bring order to the system, where necessary, and increase consumer confidence.
We will also be ensuring better quality products and providing for transparency and the traceability of products on the market.
On the point raised by various speakers on the preference for a single eco-labelling scheme, it is still early to take a definitive and final decision.
The Commission has, however, indicated its preferred option and I should underline that the Economic and Social Committee, the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Agriculture, and most industry and stakeholdersâ representatives support that option.
However, although a preference for Option 3 the Commissionâs preferred option which is to say the setting of minimum criteria, seems to be emerging, no agreement has yet been reached between Member States at Council level.
That is why I underline the fact that it is still too early to take a firm and definitive stand on how to proceed.
However, this debate has certainly helped to better inform us on Parliamentâs position and on that of its various Members.
On the issue of the harvesting of fisheries resources in a sustainable way, I wish to refer to the Commissionâs communication, which underlines that the aim of the policy on eco-labelling for fish and fisheries products is based on the concept of sustainable fishing.
The communications spells out that eco-labelling schemes, if based on clearly-defined criteria and appropriate indicators, can assist in both monitoring the progress made on sustainability in fishing and in raising public awareness on sustainability issues.
It goes on to make reference to sustainable exploitation with regard to Article 3(e) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.
Regarding the other points raised, I agree with the comments on the importance of independent accreditation and certification.
Guarantees in this area are provided by ISO standards and procedures.
However, the Commission has no direct competence to enforce those norms.
I also agree with the comments made to the effect that eco-labelling needs to be clear and clearly understandable so that it is easily understood by consumers.
Moreover, eco-labels offer the possibility of helping to combat IUU fishing and of promoting proof with regard to sustainable fishing practices.
By virtue of the whole exercise undertaken, we will be increasing awareness among the general public.
FAO criteria will be taken into account when it comes to laying the basis of eco-labelling schemes.
Moreover, the schemes must not be cumbersome to SMEs, or so complex that they cannot be effectively implemented by stakeholders.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the recommendation by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the accession of the European Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law (COM(2005)0639 7591/2006 C6-0138/2006 2005/0251(AVC)) (A6-0250/2006), and
- the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the Commission on the involvement of the European Parliament in the work of the Hague Conference following the accession of the Community (O-0076/2006 B6-0324/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, we all know that Europeâs citizens are on the move.
We have overtly encouraged this within our own borders through the principle of free movement.
However, our citizens are also mobile throughout the world and they can end up in all sorts of improbable situations and scrapes that involve them dealing with civil law in the courts.
Such is the nature of modern life.
So far as it is feasible we want to be able to offer them some sort of certainty at these moments of personal crisis.
For more than 100 years, The Hague Conference on Private International Law has worked tirelessly and with an ever-growing number of countries across the globe to put together numerous international conventions on civil law subjects: sale of goods, testamentary dispositions, child abduction, maintenance obligations and road-traffic accidents.
They have striven to provide a coherent legal framework in an increasingly mobile world.
When I was a practising lawyer, I often had recourse to Hague conventions to assist clients caught up in troubles with a cross-border dimension.
Those clients had reasons to be thankful for the existence of this rather unknown organisation.
Over the last years as a parliamentarian, I have had the privilege, on behalf of this House, to attend many of The Hague meetings, to get to know the people behind this apparently rather technical and distant exercise, to see the officials and national experts at their work, drafting and negotiating very complex and technical agreements to assist our citizens.
It is difficult work, taking account of an ever-increasing number of legal traditions and cultural values.
Whilst it may seem to be technical work, there are very big political choices underlying many of these apparently dry legal issues.
This work should increasingly see the light of day and I hope that our involvement will assist that process.
Up until now, the Community has been represented by all its individual Member States and, from my limited observations, that also brings a richness and strength to the work of the conference because of the diversity of our own legal traditions and our own comparative legal experience.
However, it is also clear that, given the new Community competence post-Amsterdam, there is every reason why the Community should operate as a Community within the conference.
In every practical sense it already does this through joint coordination meetings and, in any event, the conference works by consensus.
Therefore, I have absolutely no problem in recommending to colleagues that this House should give its assent to the accession of the Community to The Hague Conference.
It is a good thing, a positive and timely development.
However, there is a caveat; it is contained at the end of the explanatory statement to my report and set out in more detail in our chairmanâs motion for a resolution.
In passing this competence to the Community, Parliament is in some measure possibly detracting from its own hard-won legislative powers.
I say âpossibly detractingâ, because tonight we look to the Commissioner for reassurance that Parliament will continue to be fully involved in the future work when new conventions are negotiated and new or old ones ratified by the Community.
We have to find new working methods that fully respect Parliamentâs position as co-legislator with the Council.
Much as I have enjoyed over the last years attending Hague Conference meetings as a sort of ad hoc representative of this House, we now need something much more formal and transparent that reflects the new role of our institutions in this process.
I hinted earlier that the conventions negotiated at The Hague deserve much more attention.
They deserve that attention because they not only achieve positive outcomes for our citizens but also, increasingly, involve making political choices and balancing interests.
This is work that cries out for more parliamentary involvement and I know that this is something The Hague Conference would also welcome.
There have been initial discussions about some kind of parliamentary forum.
This is something we should pursue.
However, this should not be seen as in any way excusing the need for this House to be fully involved in the Communityâs legislative process in relation to the work of the Conference.
This would be by way of an additional activity that is within our powers to undertake.
I hope colleagues will agree that we should be initiators in this regard, perhaps hosting a first meeting.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank MrsÂ Wallis for her report and MrÂ Gargani for the question he submitted this evening.
The two topics are obviously linked, and I can confirm that I also very much welcome the recommendation contained within MrsÂ Wallisâs report, that the European Parliament consent to the accession of the Community to the Hague Conference.
I also agree with what is said in MrsÂ Wallisâs introduction on the importance of the Hague Conference and of the work done over the past few years.
It is quite clear, however, that acceding to the Hague Conference will enable the Community to obtain a status that effectively corresponds to its new role as a leading player on the international stage, thus as an actor that needs to play a practical and formal part in the activities of the Hague Conference.
Acceding may mean more coherence â I could say more consistency â between the rules existing within the Community, within the European Union, and the international instruments in preparation.
This need for more coherence justifies and warrants the Communityâs formal accession to the Hague Conference.
As all Members are aware, once the European Parliament has given its consent, the Community can formally accede to the Hague Conference as soon as two-thirds of the States signatory to the Conference have endorsed the amendments to the statute.
I feel in a position to say to you that this particularly large majority will be reached by the end of this year, thus fairly soon.
Some Member States have still not voiced their opinion, but I am confident that consent will be given by December of this year.
Both MrsÂ Wallis and MrÂ Gargani highlight the problem of what Parliamentâs role will be once the Community has formally acceded to the Hague Conference.
I can tell you that I am personally and institutionally committed to ensuring that there is full cooperation with Parliament, including after the Communityâs accession to the Hague Conference.
We all know that the framework agreement concerning relations between the Commission and the European Parliament has been amended recently: the agreement clearly permits the involvement, including at a formal level, of Parliament in the negotiation of international agreements in areas of Community competence, and this certainly comes under Community competence.
I can assure MrsÂ Wallis and all Members both that Parliament will be kept fully and constantly informed about the negotiating activities and that it will be involved in the delegations, in the negotiating activities.
As MrsÂ Wallis is well aware, I fully agree on this aspect; as far as the delegations are concerned, it is certainly possible to imagine MEPs being included in the formal delegation.
Finally, I can confirm this possibility straight away and, when the Community has formally acceded to the Hague Conference, it will become a reality.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, fellow Members, the accession of the Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law is certainly a good thing.
The Community will thus be able to take an active part in defining the Conferenceâs priorities and ensure that these fit in well with the Commissionâs work programme.
There should, however, be no delay in providing for support measures so that the civil judicial area is not weakened but retains its familiar characteristics: enhanced political solidarity within the framework of a community of values, the principle of the mutual recognition of legal decisions and the construction of an integrated internal market.
The support measures might include definition by the Council and Parliament of the mandate in matters relating to codecision, production of a legal and economic impact study at the beginning of negotiations and systematic reflection on the appropriateness of inserting disconnection clauses into the draft conventions.
Like our rapporteur, whom I congratulate, I consider it necessary for Parliament to be consulted when it comes to the draft conventions and to defining the priorities of the Conferenceâs work programme.
Moreover, the principle must not be that the Community adhere systematically to all the existing conventions.
Such adherence to existing conventions needs to be subject to case-by-case examinations by the Council and the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, after Commissioner Frattiniâs speech, I have the impression that we have achieved the objective that we had set ourselves with this exercise, despite it being so late.
In short, the Commissioner has told us that this possibility for Parliament to participate in the procedure for adopting agreements within the Hague Conference is laid down in the institutional framework agreement and that the European Parliament could therefore formally take part in these negotiations.
In particular, he has indicated that it is possible for Members of the European Parliament to be included in the formal delegation.
I believe that we must begin by acknowledging the generosity of the Commissionerâs words, since there is no legal obligation.
Furthermore, I would like to express my agreement with what previous speakers have said, that judicial cooperation in civil matters is now a European Union competence, pursuant to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that, furthermore, we have the Hague Programme for implementing that cooperation.
This field is not therefore peripheral to the very essence of the European Union, but rather it is central to it.
That means that the three institutions will have to work on this issue, and cooperation is therefore highly appropriate.
In the motion for a resolution presented by MrÂ Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, there is another very interesting proposal, and that is that it is not just a matter of the European Parliament cooperating with the Commission in the negotiations at the Hague Conference, but also of setting up a kind of parliamentary forum â a job that this Parliament could do â which would bring us together with members of national parliaments.
European Union law in the private field is still largely national law and therefore the creation of that parliamentary forum would enable us to harmonise positions.
The great problem with private international law, as we all know, and with private law in general, is that it involves national laws that come from differing traditions.
At a time when we are thinking about harmonising, codifying and unifying private law, however, the creation of that parliamentary forum, perhaps with this specific aim for now, would be a good way to begin to send out the message that the European institutions are not disconnected from national legal traditions.
Those of us who have worked in this field have seen the enormous difficulties hindering any progress in the field of private law, given the differences between national traditions, but this proposal, which is aimed more at Parliament than at the Commission, would be very positive, because it would enable us to harmonise positions with the national parliaments and take those harmonised positions to the Conference, through our participation in it.
Â Â  Mr President, what we are debating today is truly a sign of the European Unionâs maturity.
Not so many years ago, when I met with other people teaching private international law in different universities, mixing up private international law or private law with European Union law was a heresy, because the European Union simply dealt, at most, with fishing, international trade and competition, but did not really deal with private law issues.
Today, the European Union is very much involved in private law, because today, although we still have much to do, the European Union deals with the private consequences â private law â of European citizenship, its direct impact on peopleâs private domain and the consequences of freedom of establishment and movement on private law for persons and companies.
All of that is what led this field to be introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam, allowing a situation to evolve that has given the European Union â the European Community, to be precise â these competences, which have made it possible to draw up a large amount of legislation or to turn instruments into European legislation that were not previously part of it, though they did to a certain extent fall within the Community sphere, such as the Brussels Convention and others.
Within this context, therefore, the accession of the European Union â the Community, strictly speaking â to the Hague Conference is a very important step and, I would insist, demonstrates the maturity of the European Union; it demonstrates that we still have a long way to go, including, amongst other things, in how these rules should be drawn up: third pillar, first pillar, etc. This is not the time to discuss it, but it is something that will improve the quality of our legislation and will undoubtedly enable the European Union to bring its own priorities to the Hague Conference.
Despite the fact it is midnight and there are very few people in the Chamber, this is therefore a true indication and measure of the European Unionâs maturity in areas that affect the citizens very directly.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, regarding the motion for a Council decision on the accession of the European Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law, I should like to point out that this is an absolutely essential step, as the Community would acquire under the Amsterdam Treaty the authority to adopt measures for judicial cooperation in civil cases with a cross-border dimension, where such measures are conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market.
Many of the steps that the Community has adopted, or is preparing to adopt, by means of that authority coincide with the activities of the Hague Conference.
Given that the adoption of the above-mentioned internal instruments has led to a transfer of external authority from the Member States to the Community in the areas regulated by these instruments, it is essential for the Community to become a full member of the Hague Conference.
I believe that the continual strengthening legal certainty for our citizens is also undoubtedly an issue here.
Â Â  âMr President, since the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty, the competences of the European Union have included measures concerning judicial cooperation in cross-border civil matters necessary for the proper operation of the internal market.
It is a fact that, to date, a series of legal instruments has been adopted in this area, with others in the pipeline.
Full membership of the Hague Conference on International Private Law will also give the EU negotiating powers in the Hague Convention in areas within its competence.
This will make it easier to harmonise EU regulations with subsequent international instruments, whilst the Community will become subject to the rights and duties arising from such conventions.
Furthermore, acquiring full membership constitutes an important step towards deeper European integration, by placing the EU in a new international role in the field of judicial collaboration in civil matters.
I am pleased to note that amendments have been made to the Statutes of the Conference to allow the Community, which is to be accepted as a full member very soon, to join.
I would like to stress that I myself was pleased to hear Commissioner Frattiniâs words, because from the perspective of the European Parliament, which has played an active role in the Community legislative process, and in particular from the perspective of the Legal Commission, which is responsible for the issue of private law, we must pay special attention to the procedural frameworks that define the methods and the rules for future cooperation of Parliament in matters pertaining to the Hague Conference, and for consultation on convention projects.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statement on the use of passenger personal data
and
- the report by Sophia in 't Veld on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs concerning the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council in respect of the negotiations for an agreement with the United States of America on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to prevent and combat terrorism and transnational crime, including organised crime (2006/2193(INI)) (A6-0252/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, as you know, the European Court has stated that the Council and the Commission decision on the transfer of PNR data to the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection serves the purpose of protection of public security and concerns public activities in the area of criminal law.
Therefore, these activities are excluded from the scope of the European Data Protection Directive and ArticleÂ 95 of the European Treaty, even when the data being processed was originally for the supply of commercial services.
The situation in general concerning legal bases underlines the need for a single system of legal bases for justice, liberty and security issues.
This is what I call the âCommunitarisationâ of the so-called Third Pillar; therefore, I called upon the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs to ensure a clear legal framework for justice, freedom and security by favouring the use of the so-called clause, Article 42.
I know that the European Parliament shares the Commissionâs point of view on this very important matter, which I will raise again during the informal Council in Tampere in a few daysâ time.
I believe that this new agreement under negotiation with the United States should have the same content and include the same level of safeguards regarding legal certainty for air carriers, respect for human rights, notably the right to privacy, and the purposes for which the PNR data may be used.
In addition, it could integrate the current undertakings, as requested in the draft recommendation attached to the annulled Commission decision, and which the United States currently implements.
As you know, these undertakings provide for rules and procedures, which effectively restrict the use of PNR data by the United States authorities.
In order not to endanger public security, all efforts should be made to ensure that this agreement replaces the current one at the time when it expires, by 30Â September at the latest.
The Commission is doing its utmost to start negotiations with the United States as soon as possible.
In accordance with the procedure laid down in ArticleÂ 24 of the EU Treaty, negotiations are led by the Council Presidency, assisted by the Commission.
The negotiations should start tomorrow in Brussels.
A draft text has been transmitted to the United States authorities by the Presidency, which, as I said, is leading the negotiations.
I am aware of your request to the Presidency to make the text of the draft agreement available to you.
I am personally in favour and I can assure you that for its part the Commission intends to fulfil its obligations under the Framework Agreement between our two institutions and therefore I will keep Parliament informed throughout the negotiations.
It is indeed my intention to report to Parliament regularly on this issue and, as you probably know, I shall be participating in a meeting of the LIBE Committee next week, on 12Â September.
Finally, I want to recall that, should no new agreement be in place on 1Â October, air carriers flying from Europe to the United States risk legal complaints from citizens based on divergent national legislation on the transfer of PNR data to the United States.
For that reason, it is extremely important to ensure legal certainty through an agreement concluded at European level as of 1Â October, whilst continuing to ensure a high level of security and at the same time privacy protection for our citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, today we are discussing the PNR Agreement with the United States.
However, we are all fully aware of the fact that this issue can only be debated in a wider context, particularly in the light of the information received last night to the effect that President Bush has finally admitted that secret CIA detention camps actually exist.
We should look at this issue in the wider context of the methods used to combat terrorism â the methods that we in Europe want to use in the fight against terrorism and the methods that are used by our friend and ally, the United States.
The case of the CIA detention camps and rendition flights and the case of the PNR Agreement demonstrate very clearly the urgent need for Europe to speak with a single voice.
We urgently need a single European policy in this area.
I welcome what Commissioner Frattini has said, because in my view a common EU policy is not one designed by a handful of ministers that meet behind closed doors, in informal meetings.
An EU policy is one made following a proper democratic procedure that involves Parliamentary scrutiny, i.e. in codecision with Parliament.
You therefore have my wholehearted support for the proposal on the bridging clause.
I hope that the governments too will now realise how urgent that is.
With regard to the PNR issue itself, we should distinguish three phases.
One is the short-term renegotiation of the current agreement, which is very urgent and needs to be concluded by the end of the month.
I have heard rumours which seem to indicate that the US is in no great hurry to conclude the Agreement and might actually ultimately prefer bilateral agreements.
It is therefore very important that all European countries and the EU institutions close ranks and adopt a united stance.
I very much welcome the much more forthcoming attitude adopted by the Council and Commission this week.
That is the best way forward.
Were there to be no agreement it would be absolutely catastrophic for the European Union and for the protection of our citizensâ personal data.
With regard to this agreement, we all seem to agree that the substance of the agreement should preferably be left untouched.
We would have preferred to improve the agreement, but the US would like to move in another direction.
I therefore feel that the best we can achieve at the moment is to have the same agreement but on a new legal basis.
During the negotiations, however, you should insist that the undertakings made in the current agreement be implemented without delay, because assessments have shown that even if there is an agreement it is not being fully and correctly implemented.
I would notably point to: the switch from the âpullâ to the âpushâ system, which is long overdue; information to passengers, which is key but which is apparently still not happening; and purpose limitation â which is a more difficult issue, but an absolutely crucial one.
I hope you can see to it that the undertakings are integrated into the agreement rather than being a sort of appendix that is not legally binding.
With regard to the medium and long term â i.e. the post-2007 review â we very much hope that by then the clause will have been adopted, that Parliament will have secured codecision and that everything will be dealt with as part of a proper democratic procedure.
At that point, Parliament will insist on proportionality, which is to say that there should be data-sharing, because we all want a safer world and to fight the scourge of terrorism, but that this should be proportional.
We should not share more data than is strictly needed to achieve our purpose.
It goes without saying that there should be adequate protection of personal data and procedural safeguards.
That is quite clear.
One of the proposals in the report, which fortunately received the support of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is that we start a parliamentary transatlantic dialogue.
I feel that this rift with the US needs to be healed.
We must fight terrorism together. It cannot be that while we call the Americans âcowboysâ they call us âcowardsâ, and we are deeply divided.
At the same time, there are proposals circulating on a European PNR policy.
I am rather unhappy that we only learned about this through the media.
We have heard that this idea was presented at an informal meeting in London a couple of weeks ago.
That is not the way forward.
If there is to be such a policy then we would prefer that it were presented here in Parliament.
Finally, I should like to make a very urgent appeal to the Council to adopt proper arrangements for data protection under the Third Pillar, along the lines set out by our rapporteur, Mrs Roure.
Â Â  . â Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we are four-square behind the objective of preventing and combating terrorism, given that this threat has already been visited on some of our Member States and hangs over all of us at all times.
We want to cooperate with other countries in the fight against terrorism, not least the United States of America.
One of our citizensâ greatest concerns at the moment is their security and the more united the Union is in this regard the more effective the response will be.
It is therefore preferable to have one agreement between the Union and the United States of America than 25 bilateral agreements.
This will put the Union in a stronger position as regards not only the prevention of, and fight against, terrorism, but also the protection of fundamental rights.
We must ensure that there is no legal vacuum at European level after 1Â OctoberÂ 2006 as regards the transfer of passenger data.
MrÂ Frattini took the right option, in light of the decision taken by the Court of Justice, to condemn the existing agreement, and at the same time to open negotiations on a new agreement with the United States.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has lent its firm backing to the Commissionâs request to the Council to grant it a mandate to reopen negotiations.
We know that this is a short-term agreement to fill in the gap between the obsolete agreement and a new long-term agreement, which is something that can and must be considered at the earliest opportunity.
As regards the future negotiations. I should like to underline the example of the agreements with Australia and Canada, which we find acceptable in terms of proportionality, which sets appropriate limits as regards scope, time, and amount of data, and which is subject to monitoring by a judicial authority.
I therefore support the idea of starting dialogue before the year is out between the EU and the USA, Canada and Australia with a view to jointly preparing the 2007 review and to setting up a global standard for forwarding passenger name records.
I should also like to welcome the desire expressed by MrÂ Frattini to maintain close cooperation with Parliament.
I hope that this desire is translated into practical action and is not restricted to rhetoric, and that the Council follows suit.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, on behalf of my group, I should, of course, like to begin by giving my full support to the report by my fellow Member, MrsÂ in't Veld.
We want a two-stage strategy: the conclusion of an interim agreement by 30Â September, in order to guarantee continuity and not to cause any inconvenience to Europeans who travel to the United States, and the negotiation of a new, better-founded agreement, during the review, which is initially planned for 2007.
Two stages are therefore required.
However, the agreement to be concluded before the end of the month must not be hastily negotiated.
MrÂ Frattini is proposing that we keep the same text and just change the legal basis, as denounced by the Court.
We can accept that, but only on two conditions.
Firstly, the European Parliament must be fully informed of the debates under way with the Americans and must provide a political input.
What is more, the national parliaments must also be kept informed.
Secondly, we must be certain that all of the undertakings will actually be complied with and implemented by the US authorities.
I am specifically referring to the possibility of shifting from the PULL system to the PUSH system, as provided for in Undertaking 13, and of establishing judicial review procedures in the event of misuse, as provided for in the agreements concluded with Australia and Canada.
In the longer term, the new 2007 agreement must offer European nationals the same level of protection of their private lives as that guaranteed in Europe, and that is indeed a minimum requirement.
Finally, during the informal meeting in London, MrÂ Frattini made several practical proposals concerning a European PNR and a biometric positive profiling system, to be used on a voluntary basis.
I should like to know what exactly is the status of this meeting, in which important proposals were discussed without Parliamentâs having been informed of them.
As regards a possible European PNR, it is quite clear that we will be unable to accept any proposals that allow Community legislation and national laws on the protection of Europeansâ personal data to be circumvented.
Nor will we be able to accept a procedure that bypasses the role and the democratic function of the national parliaments in this sector.
Furthermore, I would point out that the Commission proposals on these issues cannot be accepted without the framework decision on the protection of data under the third pillar being adopted.
My fellow Member, MrsÂ in't Veld, pointed this out, and this is an aspect that we will not lose sight of.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is not clear that there is any current use for PNR data in the US for the purposes for which the original agreement was signed â i.e. by the Customs and Border Protection Service â because CAPS II and the Secure Flight programme are dead.
In his article ten days ago, the US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff complained of being handcuffed and prevented from using all available resources.
He wants to analyse PNR records in conjunction with current intelligence, to identify high-risk travellers who are âunnamed threatsâ, and to share the information routinely with other homeland security sections, such as immigration, as well as the FBI and, indeed, âour allies in Londonâ.
So we do not need a European PNR system: we will get it by the back door.
The Chertoff vision is of data-mining and profiling on the basis of past and assumed future behaviour and stereotypes of potential terrorists.
This takes us well beyond the simple checking of people against watch lists, for which APIS data â i.e. name, date of birth, nationality and passport number â is quite sufficient.
We have not begun to tackle the risks of this, so we need a very good explanation of what PNR data is being used for in the United States and what profiling techniques are being used.
We need strict and legally-binding purpose- and access-limitation provisions.
Similar concerns arise in the context of the EU plans for European PNR and so-called âpositive profilingâ.
Under the 2004 EU APIS Directive, governments gave themselves the power to use the personal data for law-enforcement purposes âin accordance with their national law and subject to the data protection provisions under Directive 95/46/ECâ.
Surely the Court judgment on the US PNR agreement has shown that Directive 95/46/EC cannot be the legal basis for data used for security purposes?
Therefore we need the third-pillar measure.
Has the Commission thought about this?
I agree with Commissioner Frattini and Mrs in ât Veld on the need for a coherent EU policy.
If you look at this PNR topic, the SWIFT scandal or CIA rendition, you see a pattern of a disunited Europe: Member States running round like headless chickens, subject to divide and rule by the United States.
We are not even a reliable partner: we are not even ratifying the agreements like Europol protocols, which would allow cooperation with the FBI.
We are ineffective, dysfunctional and we are letting our citizens down.
We must stop this incoherence and achieve a clear and assertive EU competence, but that policy must be determined to safeguard our privacy.
Can we trust the Commission on that?
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the vast majority of us in this House are not opposed to the strengthening of security where that is necessary, nor are they hostile to the United States or to reasonable cooperation with them in those areas in which we and they have cooperated in the past and will need to do so in the future too.
The attacks on major European cities teach us â as they have done before â that the European Union and the United States need to collaborate, not least in security matters, but â and I am sure that this is the fundamental criticism that most in this House would make â what is required of the agreement on the forwarding of passengersâ personal details as part of the war on terror is that it should be rational and coherent.
What has been put before this House can certainly not be described in those terms.
Members from various groups have already spoken to address the fundamental problems that there are with it, the first of which is the use to which the data is to be put, and second the legal basis by reference to which the data is to be forwarded.
My group is not alone in having fundamental doubts about both of these.
The data should be used solely for the purpose of combating terrorism, and not with any other ends in view, and, in the final analysis, it is highly problematic in legal terms that citizens of the European Union should not be on an equal footing with citizens of the United States; it is not acceptable that our citizens should enjoy fewer rights than do their American counterparts.
What is needed is an even-handed and consistent agreement that guarantees the protection of data and deliberately restricts its use to the combating of terror and terrorism.
Political ends must not be treated as superior to fundamental rights.
That which underpins the rights enjoyed by all the citizens of this European Union of ours is something inalienable, and it is with grave concern that we see them being slowly eroded.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, talks are beginning tomorrow and the paradoxical thing is that we are not even aware of the basis for them.
The European Parliament is excluded from these talks about a problem that involves all of Europeâs citizens.
This is the first paradox in the affair.
My group strongly endorses what MrsÂ inât Veld is proposing, particularly the need to change to a âpushâ system for an agreement in the short term, and the need to avoid the direct transfer of data to the judicial authorities for an agreement in the medium term.
I understand the need to use the agreement rejected by the Court as a basis, partly because the United States is demanding even more from Europe.
We need, however, to consider the absurdity of certain proposals contained in the agreement rejected by the Court.
I am thinking of the 34 data items that have to be transferred to the United States, when we know perfectly well that most of these items are useless: the US authorities themselves say that they have only been using seven or eight of them.
Then we ought also to consider the need to establish real, legally binding protection for passenger data, because it is a duty of the institutions to safeguard European citizensâ personal data.
Systematically keeping a check on people in the name of the fight against terrorism is an authoritarian distortion of the rule of law and, paradoxically, by doing so we are helping to achieve precisely what the terrorists want.
Systematically keeping a check on people is an outcome of the same authoritarian attitude as the CIAâs secret prisons, which President Bush at last decided to announce to the world yesterday rather than continue to hide the evidence.
Let us hope that the countries of Europe will also stop trying to outdo the US.
We must avoid taking the same stance on this subject and being more extremist than the US in keeping a check on people in the name of this phoney war on terrorism.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report states that the EU-US agreement in this sphere is going to become âthe standard, both for European legislation and globallyâ.
Well, what a reference standard to have!
It is already an embarrassment.
The European Court of Justice has annulled the original agreement, and yet the replacement agreement only differs in its legal basis.
This Parliament challenged the original agreement between the US and the EU because it believed that the legal basis was wrong and disagreed with the substance.
However, despite this Parliament appearing to win the case in the European Court of Justice, nothing substantial has changed.
The legal basis will be altered, but since the European Court of Justice did not comment on the substance, in real terms nothing has changed except, of course, the fact that the European Court of Justice will not have competence over the new agreement.
It is clear that the Council is going to continue with this agreement in its original form, just changing the legal basis but still ignoring Parliament in the process.
So why is this Parliament again indulging in pointless activity by writing, debating and voting on this report?
It will be ignored by the Council.
In-fighting within the European institutions brought about the premature termination of the original agreement.
This whole process illustrates the chaotic nature of the European Union. This indicates clearly once again why the United Kingdom would be so much better served by organising such international agreements and arrangements on a bilateral basis.
Â Â  Mr President, it is of course touching, and also right and proper that there should be â as this debate makes evident â concerns about Europeansâ civil liberties, and so I want to avail myself of this forum in order to say that I do not see much defence of fundamental civil liberties when, for example, in my home country of Belgium, the stateâs security services blatantly bug the telephones of democratically elected members of parliament belonging to my party, which is what they did recently with the telephone of Filip De Winter, who heads our group in the Flemish parliament.
It is lamentable that, when the civil liberties and the privacy of elected parliamentarians, no less, in Brussels, in the heart of the European Union, are violated, I hear nothing said by those Members of this House who are jumping at the chance to rap the knuckles of the âGreat Satanâ in Washington, so let us not act like wronged maidens.
Yes, of course, the rights of Europeans and of travellers must be safeguarded as far as is possible, but those who, in the aftermath of this summerâs foiled terrorist outrages, still doubt the usefulness of much tighter monitoring in international air travel are, in fact, being almost criminally naive.
Regrettably, that is the price that has to be paid for greater security and for greater freedom.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have this ruling from the ECJ, our first priority is to avoid the vacuum that results from the absence of a treaty, for the consequences of this would be negative not only for the airlines but also for their passengers, in that it might even result in planes being banned from landing, and will, in any case, mean longer waiting times for passengers flying to the USA, since they will now have to supply the information at the airport.
It is for that reason that we support â and I personally do â Commissioner Frattini's intervention in these negotiations, which should involve an amended legal basis in accordance with the ECJâs ruling, but with the substance of the former agreement, covering precisely those things we proposed then and those that have been added.
For the benefit of all those who have not read the agreement, let me say that it includes the reduction of the data units to 34, the restriction on the use to which they are put, the requirement that passengers be informed, the requirement that the data be forwarded to only one department, namely the Department of Homeland Security, the right of review, and also the right to lodge complaints and appeals, not to mention the requirement that the European Union be notified where terrorist involvement is suspected â in short, it brings us greater security, and that, above all, is something we should make use of.
That, I think, is why it is now necessary that CommissionerÂ Frattini be supported, be encouraged to embark on these negotiations, in which he should of course seek a resolution of those matters where our demands have not yet been completely met â that much is clear, but what is fundamental is that we must not end up without any treaty: fundamental, that is, in the interests of our citizensâ security, of those who travel by air, and of the airlines.
Â Â  â Mr President, the issue of the transfer of the personal data of European citizens via the PNR is an issue which, as is only natural, has greatly preoccupied Parliament.
Taking account of the seriousness with which the questions of anti-terrorism and fundamental rights must be addressed, can anyone tell us exactly what this informal meeting was of certain ministers of the Member States in London in the middle of the summer, which was even attended by the European Commission, a meeting during which, it would appear, serious new anti-terrorism measures were proposed?
With what jurisdiction was it held?
Who convened this meeting?
Who authorised the eager participants to then issue a press release, 'allegedly' with the new European measures needed?
Secondly, as regards the PNR agreement itself, please tell us what it contains, Mr Vice-President, as you expressly promised.
Are there any material changes and, more importantly, will the USA's voluntary commitments become binding?
You said here, âthey could become bindingâ, you did not say, âthey will become bindingâ.
The United States have given the acute impression over the last few days that they preclude negotiation, that they are threatening not to sign a bilateral agreement and, instead, to conclude even worse bilateral agreements on the PNR with the Member States.
In other words, they are blackmailing us.
Why do you tolerate this blackmail from a country which admitted a short while ago that it had secret prisons all over the world, in infringement of every concept of international law?
Finally, could you please tell us, Mr Vice-President, the story of the European PNR which, it would appear, you discussed in London?
What does it mean?
Why is it necessary?
Why is it proportionate?
Will it be an effective measure when the United States, even today, refuses to tell us if use of the PNR with America was necessary or effective?
How would it have prevented the British or Danish citizens now being accused of being presumptive bombers?
How would it have prevented SeptemberÂ 11 or the attacks in London or Madrid?
The European Parliament therefore needs information immediately.
NoÂ one here denies that an anti-terrorist policy and cooperation are needed.
But the law is clear: in a democracy, measures must be necessary, effective and proportionate.
The national parliaments and the European Parliament must have their say.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that the Council â which is not present, even though the Vice-President is here to represent the Commission â will eventually be aware that this House, all of whose groups have joined together to speak with one voice, certainly does â albeit to varying degrees â see the need for negotiations between us and the United States, as equals, on arrangements relating to data protection, and indeed demands that such negotiations should take place.
That should give the other institutions something to think about.
The ruling by the European Court of Justice has not got us much further.
While it does tell us that we chose the wrong legal basis, it does not tell us how we could have made a better job of it, although that, indeed, is not what the Court is there to do; it is for us to take care how we go about doing things.
I would like to say something about the things we need to do in order to put this into practice.
I think we are going to end up in a whole load of difficulties if we carry on as we are doing.
For a start, and quite apart from the fact that we would rather do this at the European level, rather than having the nation states doing it each off their own bat, I would like to express my doubt as to whether we really do have the legal power to do it.
I have to say, quite honestly, that I am not sure about this.
Even if we do, the question arises of whether we can do it within the time allowed for implementation.
If we in fact do opt for either the third pillar or a combination of second and third pillar as a means of moving this process on, we will meet with problems of implementation, in most Member States at any rate.
We will have problems with their constitutions; I can say that in the case of Germany, and I am sure that most of the Member States will find further obstacles in terms of their constitutional law when it comes to implementing this agreement, and so it is in the individual Member States that the necessary conditions must be put in place first of all.
There will also be problems relating to the laws on the protection of data, since the European Union â with the exception of the first pillar â has no really effective means of data protection, which means that it is the Member States who will have to prepare the ground where data protection and the legislative process are concerned.
What I fear, then, is that the entry into force will be delayed for a bit by quite a few cases brought either before the European Court of Human Rights or the ECJ itself â provided that that is a legal possibility, which will depend on the legal position â or before the national constitutional courts, and so we should, leaving considerations of substance to one side for the moment, apply the greatest of care when dealing with the formal aspects in order to save ourselves further embarrassment of the kind that we cannot afford on the international stage, and certainly not in relation to this issue.
By way of conclusion, one has to consider the economic damage that would ensue if the United States were to threaten to prevent our airlines from landing there if we did not sign this agreement, and I would also like to ask why nobody within the European Union has ventured to remind our trans-Atlantic partners of this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Vice-President, it needs to be said loud and clear that this House was right to appeal against the agreement on the personal data of flight passengers; the European Court of Justice has already ruled that the legal basis on which it reposed was false, and it is only regrettable that it has not therefore had anything to say about its substance.
I might add that I think that the directive on data retention might well end up suffering the same fate.
What is meant â or required â to happen now, following the judgesâ ruling, is the conclusion, in a very short space of time, of a new agreement absolving all twenty-five Member States of the need to conclude bilateral agreements with the USA on an individual basis, which would certainly not be in the interests of a high â and above all else uniform â level of protection for the European public.
It will not, of course, be possible, in so short a time, to hammer out a whole new agreement, but there are things that have to be done if we are to have, as intended, a short-term agreement for one year.
I believe, then, that the EU must make it its priority to insist on the USA at last doing what it has repeatedly undertaken to do and allow its engagements to be incorporated into the body of the treaty.
After all, the practice adopted over the past two years has shown that the Americans do not take these engagements particularly seriously and, indeed, simply disregard them.
That is particularly the case when it comes to the principle that data be used only for a specific purpose, and it is very much in the interests of European citizens that their personal data should not be allowed to be passed on indiscriminately as the American customs and immigration authorities think fit.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, it is unfortunate that the European Court of Justice did not return a ruling on the merits of the question put to it by the European Parliament, thereby putting us in this complicated situation.
We are now being called upon to find a solution under pressure of time, because if no solution is found by 30Â September, then more than 100Â 000 European passengers a week are in danger of being unable to travel to the United States.
