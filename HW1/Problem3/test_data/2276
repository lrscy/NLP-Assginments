The Baltic Sea region may become the most dynamic and competitive region in the world, and this will be a huge benefit for the entire European Union economy in helping to make the Lisbon Strategy a reality.
The Northern Dimension must become a permanent instrument, identifying the Baltic Sea region as a priority.
It is very important to strengthen its internal pillar.
If the states in the region create a common energy market and promote the use of renewable sources of energy as well as energy efficiency projects, they have an opportunity to reduce their energy dependence on Russia.
In the formulation of new energy projects it is very important to involve all the European Union Member States that are stakeholders and to carry out an international environmental impact assessment, so that we may avoid a recurrence of the current situation with the potential construction of the North European gas pipeline.
The development of cooperation with Russia is one of the Northern Dimension's important tasks.
The Baltic States have a significant history of relations with Russia and accumulated experience that may produce good results.
At the moment Russia - which in terms of resources is one of the richest countries in the world - is in some curious way still receiving assistance from various European Union programmes.
The principle of parity and cooperation should replace such an approach.
In order for the Northern Dimension to be able to carry out its tasks, it needs a stable financial basis.
On this point, our views differ from the previous speaker, and we think that a separate budget line is necessary, to add to the existing resources from various sources.
This would make it possible to develop highly necessary infrastructure projects, such as Rail Baltica, a Baltic motorway and others.
- (LT) The Baltic Sea, as it has been previously mentioned today, is the inner sea of the European Union bordered by nine countries, eight of which are Member States of the European Union with the ninth being Russia, specifically its Kaliningrad and St Petersburg regions.
One third of the EU population lives in these eight Member States, contributing one third of the gross domestic product of the European Union.
Till now, the Northern Dimension was mostly targeted at the Russian regions; therefore, supplementing it with the Baltic Sea Strategy would enrich the Northern Dimension with additional specific content.
The Baltic Sea region leads in competitiveness compared with three other EU regions: Central Europe, the British Isles and the Iberian Peninsula.
Over the last few years, the Baltic Sea region has taken the lead over other European regions in terms of such indicators as wellbeing, productivity growth and scientific innovation.
The key advantages of this region are a good physical infrastructure, qualified labour force, low level of corruption and strong research sector.
Nevertheless, the poorly implemented competitive potential of the region must be noted.
Since not a single country here has a market of sufficient size to develop necessary competitive pressure; therefore, the solution is clear, that is to increase the integration of the region.
The European Parliament should approve an article of our resolution suggesting (start of quote): 'in pursuit of transparency and consistency (...), to assign the Baltic Sea Strategy a separate budget line, most likely under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, where, along with the current funding of the Northern Dimension, additional funds would be provided' (end of quote).
Apprehensions about the European Commission declining to pursue this idea are groundless.
It is much more important to persuade the EU Member States, especially those outside this region, to support this Strategy, since better integration of this region presents potential not only for the whole EU becoming more dynamic and competitive, but also for resolving other EU issues, such as energy security, common energy policy and better relations with Russia.
(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament's resolution supports the Northern Dimension policy and defines the North Sea region as a priority area.
Since enlargement in 2004, the Baltic Sea has virtually become an internal sea, the 'Mare Nostrum', of the European Union.
The Baltic region could become an example of the most dynamic economic region in the European Union, evidence of the development of a European economy based on cutting-edge technology, an economy that is modern and competitive on a global scale.
In this context, we must stress the need to protect the Baltic Sea ecosystem, which is extremely vulnerable as the Sea is shallow, its waters circulate slowly and pollution levels are high.
Particular attention must be paid to promoting innovation in the field of research and raising the issues of culture and civil society.
The Baltic Sea, which links the European Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland, should become an example of an area of peace and security.
I would particularly like to highlight the opportunities which exist for transforming the Kaliningrad rayon into a pilot region, with better access to the internal market.
These opportunities have been discussed in joint talks between the European Union and Russia.
Cooperation in the Baltic Sea region could point the way forward in this part of our continent, and mark out a way towards cooperation with Russia and other countries.
Mr President, of course we congratulate the rapporteur on his report and the points of interest it has raised, but I would not be fulfilling my role as President of this Parliament's Delegation for Relations with Iceland and Norway if I did not express some regret at the absence of a report or a resolution that expressed the full sweep of the Northern Dimension policy.
I regret that fact because I feel that we are, therefore, neglecting the big geopolitical issues that face us in the High North that find their focus in climate change, in energy supply, in marine resources.
Of course those issues concern the Baltic hugely, but they also concern the Arctic and the High North.
And if we want to bring our partner countries, Norway and Iceland, with us, then we have to reach out and not be inward-looking.
We have previously striven, as a Parliament, when we have talked about this issue, to bring the Northern Dimension away from just a ministerial level of policy.
We have striven to bring it back to parliamentarians, into the ownership of parliamentarians across the region.
I hope we will be able to do that in the meeting we seek to host at the beginning of next year.
But let me emphasise again: the Northern Dimension should not be just about us.
This year the Commission concluded a very important agreement with Greenland.
It may be a small thing, but it shows that the Arctic window is open and should remain open, and that there should be activity beyond our borders.
Next year is International Polar Year.
I hope that we will raise both our vision and our eyes to the High North and give it the focus and the attention it deserves next year within the Northern Dimension policy.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on having prepared a good report on the future of the Baltic Sea.
When we discuss the specific characteristics of the region, however, we should not forget important factors which have shaped its character, which include historical factors, such as the stocks of chemical weapons from World War II that remain at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
There is also the matter of a delicate ecosystem, additionally threatened by an increased volume of sea transport and planned investments, such as the construction of a northern gas pipeline, which could lead to an ecological disaster.
Before undertaking such activities, it is vital to carry out a very careful analysis of their potential influence on the natural environment.
It is also important to set up a consultation procedure with the interested parties and be prepared to amend any planned work if it turns out that it may have a negative impact on the ecosystem of the Baltic.
Ecological issues and national interests in the region also have to be taken into account when building the planned marine highway.
We need to ensure that there is equal access to Baltic sea ports and the benefits the motorway will provide.
It is also important to ensure close cooperation between the Member States in the building energy networks, and solidarity amongst the European Union Member States in their relations with Russia.
At the moment, Poland is blocking any agreement with Russia, until Russia opens its doors to our meat and agricultural products.
The European Union has responded by saying that the West has no intention of freezing for the sake of Polish sausages.
We remember the expression 'we don't want to die for the sake of GdaÅsk', and we all know how that story ended.
(Applause)
- (LT) Mr President, the report being discussed is an important step for the whole European Union.
A change in the political thinking of the New Age is coming to the fore which could be characterised by the concept of 'discovering the Baltic'.
The Baltic Sea consists of water, its coast and bottom, just as other seas.
The Baltic waters are shallow and the worst polluted among all of Europe's Atlantic seas.
The bottom of the Baltic Sea is already dead in many places, and whether a new Dead Sea will emerge in Europe depends on us.
This process was accelerated by many German chemical weapons submerged here at the end of World War II, including bombs and canon balls with dioxin, mustard gas and other 'souvenirs' which are starting to pose hazards after 60 years of corrosion.
This constitutes a threat of tremendous catastrophe, both to the water and the coast.
The coast is particularly attractive for its white sandy beaches and pine forests; the Curonian Spit is part of the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage registry.
Its beauty is a creation of nature and people; now, people are likely to destroy it and nature is unable to defend it.
The eastern coast of the sea is populated by ancient nations not willing to submit to ecological catastrophes caused by post-Soviet capitalism.
Today, I would like to emphasise not only the responsibility of Gazprom, but also of the German Government, for the outcomes of the Russian-German agreement concerning the so-called Northern Gas Pipeline, if repositories of lethal poisons at the bottom of the Baltic Sea are affected during construction.
The European Union, which blessed the funding of the pipeline without any investigation or warranty, should take even greater responsibility for the manifold negative outcomes of this alleged 'good business', meaning responsibility for the outcomes of economic discrimination and the political disintegration of Europe, as well as the ecological and demographic outcomes of potential disasters.
It is good that we will adopt this initial European Baltic Strategy document and are beginning to realise the responsibility.
(ET) In January 1990, Finnish prime minister Kalevi Sorsa held a Baltic Sea Parliamentary Conference with the objective of developing new directions in regional cooperation in the new political situation.
Unfortunately the representatives of the Baltic States were forced to spoil the conference, since we could already clearly see Russia's malevolent behaviour, which was tangibly expressed in the attack against the television tower in Vilnius a few days later.
We then used the platform to call the world's attention to this danger, and other objectives received less attention.
We did, however, present a strategic plan on behalf of the Green Party.
In rereading this, I noticed that, despite the drastic political changes that have taken place, this has not improved the environmental protection of the Baltic Sea itself.
One of our recommendations was to put an end to all oil transport on the Baltic Sea.
Instead, the volume of oil transport rose threefold.
The Russian newspaper ÐÐµÐ·Ð°Ð²ÐžÑÐžÐŒÐ°Ñ Ð³Ð°Ð·ÐµÑÐ° (Independent Newspaper) yesterday printed an article on the Baltic Sea gas pipeline.
The article claims that a proposal will now be made to the Baltic Sea states for the performance of the necessary ecological studies.
That is excellent, but unfortunately in the wrong order.
Attention was first devoted to political, then economic and only then to ecological conditions, as a form of decoration, as it were.
The end of the article is also noteworthy - the opponents of the gas pipeline plan to torpedo the whole operation using ammunition sunk during the Second World War.
The 6th Gas Pipeline in Urengoy apparently suffered the same fate, which was allegedly the sole reason for the collapse of the Soviet Union.
I would like to bring to your attention to the fact that all of the conditions were favourable for the timely performance of an ecological assessment in the Baltic Sea, as well as the environmental protection organisation HELCOM and eighty years of academic cooperation.
In sum: our delegation approves of Alexander Stubb's approach, and wishes to thank him warmly for this.
We also believe that, in accordance with Stubb's three pillars, there is no need to include the Arctic in the Baltic Sea strategy.
In our opinion, it would be worth opening - for planned work with the Baltic Sea environment, and much more - a new line in the European Union budget for this sea, which is unique in the world.
(SV) Mr President, as one of those who first mooted, and then helped to found, the Baltic Europe Intergroup network, I have for two years had the pleasure of contributing to the work that has now led to this report.
When the EU enlarged to include ten new Member States, it became possible to reunite the nations around the Baltic Sea.
Now, the heart of the region can give the Northern Dimension its vital spark.
The EU must make use of the Baltic Sea region's considerable potential.
The quicker the new Member States can increase their prosperity, the stronger the EU will become in relation to its neighbours.
If this state of affairs is to be brought about, active measures are required on the part of the EU.
We therefore need a practical programme from the Commission in which all the areas administered by the latter play their allotted role.
A strong Baltic Sea region is needed if issues important to the whole of the EU are to be resolved.
Through direct contacts between people, we must break down the psychological barriers between West and East.
We need a modern visa policy and better economic cooperation with Russia.
We must resolve the border disputes in the Baltic, restore the ecological balance in the Baltic Sea, obtain an end to the Russian boycott of Polish foodstuffs and do away with the up to 30-mile-long queues of lorries at the border stations in eastern Finland.
The EU is there to solve common problems.
Vetoes need not be the only way of directing attention to important issues.
A common EU strategy is therefore necessary.
It is important for the Commission to lose no time in getting to grips with this issue, and Mr Stubb's report is an excellent basis on which to do this.
(PL) Mr President, the Baltic Sea, which today is virtually an internal sea of the European Union, is a matter of priority for both the economy of the region and the whole European Union.
Unfortunately, the Baltic is the most polluted area of marine water in the world.
It therefore needs attention, that is to say a joint strategy and consistent collaboration between the countries of the European Union and Russia to implement this strategy.
It is therefore fortunate that an agreement on a new political declaration concerning the Northern Dimension and a strategic framework document will be discussed at the EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki, on 24 November.
When tackling the problem of the Baltic Sea, we must remember that around 85 million people live on its shores and that it contains rich and diverse animal and plant life, including many already endangered species.
For centuries, this sea has fed millions of people and given not only fishermen and their families their livelihoods, but also those engaged in other activities.
Seafaring people have also created their own culture, which we should protect with no less care than the natural environment, the beauty of the landscape and material wealth.
That is why we view the planned northern gas pipeline, and the associated dangers of chemical pollution and military mobilisation, with concern.
The Baltic Sea is a treasure which we have inherited from our forefathers, together with the duty to pass it, and its values, on to future generations.
Mr President, first of all let me congratulate the rapporteur, my friend Alexander Stubb, and my colleague Christopher Beazley for his good work as Chairman of the Baltic Intergroup.
I totally endorse Diana Wallis's remarks about raising the EU's profile in northern Europe.
The Northern Dimension is a wide-ranging EU policy which governs EU relations with the north-west Russian areas, including Kaliningrad, the Baltic and the Arctic Sea regions.
The Northern Dimension is implemented within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia.
It is conceived as a way of working with the countries of Europe's northern regions to increase prosperity, strengthen security and resolutely combat dangers such as the environmental pollution of the Baltic Sea, nuclear risks such as those posed by the Russian submarine fleet in the Kola Peninsula, cross-border crime and the management of marine resources, amongst others.
Eight EU Member States - Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Sweden - surround the Baltic Sea, and the EU's shared border with Russia has lengthened significantly following enlargement.
Nevertheless, EU-Russia relations cannot be dictated only by relations between the Baltic states and Russia.
Our strategic partnership and our collective EU needs for energy security, as well as cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the need to carry Russia in areas like preventing nuclear proliferation from countries like Iran and North Korea, transcend regional issues such as those addressed by the Northern Dimension.
There is currently financial support from Tacis and Interreg, but shortly Russia will be part of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, and the EU should have a proper budget line for the region.
Climate change is making the Arctic more accessible to human activities now, such as exploitation of natural resources and increased shipping, but the Arctic also has an important role to play as an early-warning sign for potentially catastrophic global climate change.
Russia's energy exports can also be a political weapon, we have now discovered, as we saw last year in Ukraine and this year with Georgia.
Now rumours abound that Russia wishes to set up an OPEC-style gas cartel, which we must resist at all costs.
I call upon President Putin to get around to ratifying the EU Energy Charter, which would give all EU companies more access to Russian oil and gas.
The EU must also invest more in renewables and low-carbon energy, while encouraging as much diversity in supply as possible.
(ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this is a shared sea, we have given it different names, and we must admit that we have not as yet come to see it as a shared space, or used all of its possibilities.
Thus I warmly welcome the efforts made by Alexander Stubb and President Toomas Hendrik Ilves in creating this strategy.
Under the aegis of the Northern Dimension, our shared lake strategy could grow into something even bigger.
I believe that in a globalising world and a multicultural, even expanding European Union, we all seek new identities, and the Baltic Sea could play an important role here, and become a kind of symbol.
Throughout history there have been connections between the countries that surround the sea, but cooperation aimed at the development of the region as a whole would take those relations to a new level.
We would all benefit from this.
The sea itself, which today is one of the most polluted bodies of water, demands joint action.
Why indeed do we need this strategy?
A common Baltic Sea area will not arise itself or from individual projects; we need coordinated activity ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to congratulate Alexander Stubb on an excellent report and thank him for his excellent levels of cooperation.
I just wish to raise one point, and that is the amendment which Diana Wallis and I tabled on the establishment of a local office in the Baltic Sea area.
At present, the European Investment Bank operates in 11 EU Member States and 6 countries outside the EU in the Mediterranean region and in Africa.
Just one branch, the one in Poland, is located in the Baltic Sea region and in a new Member State.
By contrast, there are eight branches in total in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region.
A branch office of the EIB was set up last spring in Vienna.
It is to be responsible for projects in eastern Central Europe and the Balkan region. But it is not the function of any branch to be responsible for projects in the new Member States, the Nordic countries or the Baltic countries.
I think that it is important to establish an office of this kind, responsible for overseeing funding operations in that region and making the Baltic Sea Strategy a reality.
The presence of such a branch office could also aid large funding projects under the EU's Structural and Cohesion Funds during subsequent terms, and in this way facilitate cooperation in the Baltic Sea region and promote major projects there.
(PL) Mr President, the Northern Dimension of the European Union's external policy is not just a priority for the Finnish presidency.
It is also an extremely important aspect of Polish foreign policy and the foreign policies of seven other European Union Member States which surround the Baltic Sea.
During the last dozen years or so, the Baltic has become a region for peaceful cooperation with Russia.
If we are to maintain this situation, we need to eliminate the dangers that have appeared on the horizon today.
The main threats today are the growing dependence of the countries in the region on Russian fuel supplies and the series of unsolved problems concerning the Kaliningrad area.
Addressing these challenges is beyond the capabilities of individual countries and also exceeds those of our group of eight countries.
It is therefore vital for them to be made a priority for the European Union as a whole.
Today, 24% of gas supplies come from Russia.
This percentage will rise in the future.
The possibility, mentioned by Charles Tannock a moment ago, of Russia creating a gas cartel is additional cause for concern.
Investments such as the Baltic gas pipeline are increasing the dependence of the entire European Union's on its eastern neighbour.
In addition they are causing dangerous political tensions between members of the Union itself.
Today, the Kaliningrad region remains a ticking time bomb.
We are not only concerned by the level of military mobilisation in the area, but also by the social situation in Kaliningrad.
A large percentage of the population is infected with AIDS, the natural environment is being destroyed and organised crime is rampant.
Therefore, if the European Union as a whole fails to take an interest in these issues, there will be no common policy with respect to energy or to Kaliningrad.
Without a common policy we will all face failure.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to expand on the topic of Kaliningrad, as it does represent a great challenge.
We had all hoped that Kaliningrad would become for Russia what Hong Kong was for China.
However, there are fears that it may become what Puerto Rico became for the United States.
Apart from the dangers mentioned by the previous speaker, Mr Klich, I would also like to point out a further unsolved problem, namely the fact that, 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, there are still huge stocks of weapons in Kaliningrad and no one knows what they are doing there.
The figures are available because Russia, as a signatory of the Convention on Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, is obliged to make these figures public.
There are more tanks in Kaliningrad than in the British and French armies combined.
What exactly are they doing there?
As I said, 15 years have passed since the end of the Cold War.
As a result, we clearly need to try to resolve this complex of problems jointly with Russia, as the entire Baltic region, and its future, largely depends on the future of the Kaliningrad region.
It is probably the most dynamic region today, and its potential for further dynamic development is enormous.
Mr President, this is a joint initiative by members of the new Baltic Intergroup, successfully chaired by Christopher Beazley, on the basis of which Alexander Stubb has drawn up a very efficient report.
I would draw your attention to its underlying ethos, which is not to create a separate region, but to open the Baltic Sea area up to Europe as a whole in the interests of all the EU Member States.
The Northern Dimension will therefore retain its present foreign policy aspect of cooperation with Russia, Iceland and Norway.
However, a very important new internal EU cooperation aspect will be added as a priority, which one might call the 'Beazley pillar'.
This is because we need to make full use of the cooperation potential of the eight Member States around the Baltic Sea.
Various studies show that the competitiveness index in this region is one of the highest of any European region in terms of growth in prosperity and productivity, scientific innovation, physical infrastructure, a skilled labour force and even a low level of corruption.
We therefore need to coordinate our efforts to fully harness the four basic freedoms with regard to this region and so achieve a new brand for it as one of the most attractive and rapidly developing in the EU.
We therefore also need a special budget line, and this would be our contribution to the development of the Lisbon Strategy.
Finally, I would like to remind the Commission of the first commandment, which is that the Commission should now take the initiative on the basis of this report.
- (LT) Mr President, I was prepared for a completely different speech, but I am captivated by the Commissioner's idea that we must focus on the issues of an unhealthy lifestyle in the Baltic region.
The geopolitical importance of this region has been ignored for years, yet the Baltic region acts as a driver of modernisation enabling development of Northern Europe to the Arctic.
Because of this region, the modernisation of Russia became possible (if one is aware of history).
Because of this region, Finland gained its strength. (It is a pity that the Finnish Minister is not taking part in such an important discussion.)
Therefore, the significance of the region has been constantly downplayed.
In my opinion, this report is an opportunity to thank Alexander Stubb for his efforts to give some impetus to the Baltic region, which is actually a driver of modernisation in Northern Europe, and in this case could even be a driver of modernisation for the entire European Union.
I would also like to second the idea of Mr Beazley that this project matches the key activity of Parliament to bring decision-making closer to the people.
I hope the Commission will keep this in mind as well.
(PL) Mr President, I believe that the Baltic Sea will increasingly unite, rather than divide, the countries of this region, by establishing and promoting economic ties, whilst respecting the political rights of these countries, and preserving its natural heritage.
However, this will not be possible if certain economic interests are promoted at the expense of others, without respect for the principles of good neighbourly cooperation, solidarity and shared responsibility.
A case in point is the construction of the Northern gas pipeline, which has been mentioned here several times, and is an investment that was made without consulting partners from the Baltic region.
We have to ask ourselves what our aims and priorities are in terms of closer cooperation within the group of eight Baltic countries.
On the one hand, we proclaim the need to protect the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea, while on the other we fear an open and honest debate on the environmental issues associated with the construction of the gas pipeline.
I would like to remind you that, last year, 60 Members of this House tabled a motion for a debate on the environmental aspects of building the gas pipeline.
This debate never took place.
The presidents did not include it in the agenda.
I would also like to inform the representatives of the Council and the Commission that Russia is hindering free travel on the Baltic Sea by not permitting ships to pass through the straits between the Vistula Lagoon and Kaliningrad.
This means that the port of ElblÄg, which was recently renovated with European Union funds, is dying because it has lost access to the open sea.
It seems that the unilateral interests of Russia, which has its army base on these straits, have been given priority.
The Baltic strategy has highlighted these dangers, and that is why I would like to thank Alexander Stubb for his report.
He can count on our support for the aims he seeks to achieve.
I would also like to thank all the members of the Baltic Intergroup and its leader, Christopher Beazley, for their commitment.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, I have my own personal Northern Dimension, being born in the north of Sweden, so I am sure that my colleague Mrs Ferrero Waldner would have had an easier time keeping a cool head in this debate!
I have very much enjoyed listening to this discussion on the Baltic Sea Strategy and to whole debate on the Northern Dimension as a whole.
Part of challenge is to ensure that the Baltic Sea Strategy is one that embraces all the important elements, and not just those connected to the Northern Dimension.
I am confident that the new Northern Dimension policy, with its future shared ownership by the European Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland, will substantially benefit the Baltic Sea region because none of the challenges faced by the Baltic Sea can be tackled without genuine Russian involvement, just as none of the challenges faced by the Barents Sea can be dealt with without Russia and Norway.
Let me comment on just a few specific issues that have been raised.
Firstly, regarding the Baltic Sea, investment decisions must of course be taken by investors, but the Commission's viewpoint has been that it is very important that proper environmental impact assessments are made for the implementation of the project, and we have not favoured one route over the other.
On the Kaliningrad oblast, this has of course been a priority sector for the Northern Dimension policy and will remain so.
It is also an area of particular attention in our bilateral relations with Russia.
The transit regime has now been successfully implemented and has been notably facilitated through very substantial EU assistance, on which the Commission expects to present its report by the end of the year.
Also, although the transit regime is an important issue, we should not forget that the key to success in Kaliningrad will be strong economic development in the oblast, supported by the EU in a harmonious manner with the Russian programmes for this territory.
Improved economic growth in Kaliningrad to reduce the gap with its immediate EU neighbours would help eliminate the long queues at the border.
At the same time, EU investments in border crossing infrastructure will continue.
That is how we are engaging with this very important issue.
As demonstrated by the very important opening of the St Petersburg south-west waste water treatment plant last year, with its tangible beneficial effects in water quality in the Gulf of Finland, cooperation and cofinancing with the Russian Federation is possible and it pays dividends both to their citizens and to ours.
The forthcoming large Northern Dimension environmental partnership projects in the Kaliningrad oblast combine with Tacis projects in the water sector in this same oblast to confirm these premises.
Furthermore, membership of the Northern Dimension as regards our EEA partners, Norway and Iceland, also provides a northern pan-European character to this policy, which we should welcome.
Finally, I would like to add to what Diana Wallis said. Canadian and US involvement also gives the Northern Dimension a transatlantic and circumpolar value that we should maintain.
Let me also comment on the budget.
In the Commission's view, the proposal in the report to set up a separate budget line for the Baltic Sea Strategy actually entails some risks.
It would go against the logic of simplifying the EU's external financial instruments.
The European neighbourhood and partnership instrument would be the natural tool with which to accompany implementation of the Northern Dimension policy, but other financial instruments will also have a contribution to make.
We cannot afford to neglect any of the Northern Dimension components and we should use all its potential and synergies in full.
The European neighbourhood and partnership instrument will provide new opportunities, particularly in the field of cross-border cooperation which, together with a larger contribution from a more prosperous Russia, and a notably larger availability of European Investment Bank funding for this area, will provide the right incentives and improve the well-being of the citizens of the whole of Northern Europe.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Beazley and all the speakers.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(ET) Ten years without review and re-assessment is too long, even for a long-term strategy.
The Northern Dimension initiative obtained its impetus and direction during Finland's last presidency.
Now Finland once again holds the EU presidency.
In the intervening time, the Baltic Sea region has changed beyond recognition.
Russia is now wealthy enough to buy up energy infrastructure throughout Europe.
The Kremlin is once again self-confident, even aggressive.
The Baltic States are now Member States of the European Union, and the Baltic Sea is our internal sea.
The Baltic Sea region is now the most competitive region in the world, mainly due to the success of the Scandinavian countries.
In order to maintain its position, it is of the utmost importance that the region also function as a whole in its expanded form.
The report by our colleague Alexander Stubb emphasises the need for a definite strategy for the Baltic Sea. The implementation of the strategy presupposes financing, and thus a separate budget line for the Baltic Sea strategy is unavoidable.
Without a budget line, the entire strategy would be no more than empty words.
The financial side of the Northern Dimension consisted only in providing aid to Russia.
European Union funds were able to significantly reduce the danger of nuclear and conventional pollution from Russia.
Now it is time to move ahead, concentrating on harmonising the level of development of the Baltic States and the Scandinavian countries.
Internal security, the safeguarding of nature, transport and infrastructure must be brought up to the Scandinavian level.
The relatively small markets of the Member States must be integrated.
There is much work to be done, and the sooner we begin, the better results we will be able to achieve.
The implementation of the European Security Strategy in the context of the ESDP (debate)
The next item is the report by Karl von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the implementation of the European Security Strategy in the context of the ESDP.
Vice-President of the Commission. The Commission welcomes this comprehensive report, which demonstrates the importance attached by the European Parliament to the European Security Strategy and more generally to the field of security.
As you know, this is not an area where the Commission leads, but we make an important contribution to security in situations of crisis.
I agree with the rapporteur that we need to act on the basis of a comprehensive concept of security in today's security environment and that both external and internal security aspects need to be adequately addressed.
We need to use all available instruments, be they civilian or military, be they in the hands of Member States or the Union, to achieve our goals in the security sphere.
And, as stated in the Commission's communication of last June entitled 'Europe in the World', we need to enhance coherence, effectiveness and visibility through a pragmatic and cooperative approach.
Let me assure you that the Commission will continue to cooperate with the Council in full respect of our respective institutional responsibilities.
I am encouraged by recent efforts in the EU amongst Member States, the Commission and the Council Secretariat to work more closely together on achieving the goals of the European Security Strategy.
Let me mention some examples: the development of the concepts of security sector reform and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, as well as concrete actions in Afghanistan and in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the border assistance mission at Rafah and in Moldova, and the planned mission to Kosovo.
The new instruments introduced within the context of the 2007-2013 financial perspectives will facilitate better coordination.
The Stability Instrument, in particular, with its short- and long-term orientation, will help us respond flexibly to upcoming challenges, while going some way towards meeting your demands for better parliamentary oversight in the security field.
The Commission has been actively developing policies to confront main security threats and to promote effective multilateralism.
Commission work has focused on, amongst other issues, the Neighbourhood Policy, the effectiveness of development assistance, humanitarian aid and civil protection.
Drawing lessons from the experience gathered so far, we will soon make proposals for a reinforced ENP.
The report also refers to various initiatives taken by the Commission in the fields of disaster and crisis response, including health emergencies.
The report welcomes the Commission's work on creating a European defence equipment market and specifically the forthcoming initiatives on defence procurement and intra-community transfers.
We are grateful for the Parliament's continued support in this delicate area.
Progress here will help to strengthen the competitiveness of European industry and the development of military and civilian capabilities for EU policies.
The Commission is particularly grateful to the Parliament for the support concerning security research and space policy, which are already specific thematic priorities of the Seventh Framework Programme.
We fully agree on the importance of research for competitiveness.
In these areas, the Commission is working closely with the European Defence Agency with a view to ensuring complementarity and synergies for the development of capabilities and the strengthening of the European industrial base.
The Commission and the European Defence Agency together have a key role to play in moving from a national to a European approach and in convergence between security and defence industries.
We will do this within the limits imposed by the current institutional framework and clearly stated political positions concerning research for civilian and defence purposes by fully respecting the civilian character of the European Security Research Programme.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that the reports by Parliament are most welcome, as are the joint meetings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs with the corresponding committees of the national parliaments and the public hearings.
Regular stocktaking can be helpful in guiding our efforts to adjust our strategies to a changing environment.
The Commission is pleased to contribute to these debates by giving full information on its activities as part of the overall EU effort.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to say how much I appreciate the Vice-President's presence here today, which demonstrates the importance that the Commission attaches to security and defence policy, while the Council's absence from a debate on it can - if one puts a favourable gloss on it - be interpreted to mean that the Finnish Presidency is, now that the pillar structure has been put in abeyance, on the way to accepting that security and defence policy, too, has become a matter for the Community.
Were it not for the fact that I subscribe to this favourable interpretation, I would be very angry at their absence.
This foreign, security and defence policy is becoming increasingly important, and I would like to thank Mr von Wogau for this report and also the Security and Defence Sub-Committee for the work that it has done, which highlights the truly decisive field into which developments are leading us.
When one considers the effort we put into securing our energy supplies, or the situation around Iran, the changes that may well occur in American policy in Iraq and Afghanistan following their elections, or the debate we had this afternoon on Gaza; not to mention the things that are going on in Darfur and in other regions, where some are buying raw materials while others campaign for human rights and then hold great summits in Beijing and Shanghai, it is not difficult to realise that this issue is going to be of increasing importance to Europe, and that is why it is necessary that some efforts be made.
It is only if we Europeans become more credible in terms of our military capacity that we will be able to get the trans-Atlantic alliance to seek to rely not merely on military might, but on the threefold chord of prevention - which takes precedence - combined with civilian crisis management and military capacity.
We will be able to achieve that only through our strong position within what is termed the West, and that is why we must also make it our concern to strengthen our links with NATO.
I would be glad if, instead of a multiplicity of individual operations with national headquarters, there were to be political agreement that these would run more on the basis of 'Berlin plus', for that would mean not only a more Community-based approach, but also, at the same time, more common purpose and cooperation with NATO.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, let me say something quite brief about the view our Socialist Group in this House takes of what has emerged from the committee.
There are three things that we regard as important.
First of all, there is the need to reinforce the diplomatic and civil elements of the security strategy.
Secondly, there is the need to avoid the traps that might leave us with an unfounded military doctrine; the text contains no terms such as 'pre-emptive' or anything of the sort.
Thirdly, the instruments and the institutional requirements must be kept absolutely separate.
We regard these as important advances, and it proved possible to make progress on these points by means of good cooperation with the rapporteur, for which I am grateful.
From a social democrat point of view, however, there still remain a few controversial items outstanding.
We can see the risk of the procurement wish lists getting longer and longer as Christmas draws nearer; we ought to be concentrating on the priorities we have already set ourselves, such as air transport, information and communication.
We do not actually need to aspire to amphibious motor vehicles, a Mediterranean fleet, and aircraft carriers, which hinders us from going after the things that really are important priorities in terms of the strategy.
The question must also be asked as to whether the last-named examples belong in some quite different context rather than in the security strategy.
On the other hand - although we will be endorsing most of the amendments that add precision to the parts of the text that have to do with diplomacy, civil society and disarmament - we do not believe that crisis prevention must, under all conceivable circumstances, involve the use of exclusively non-military means.
The reality we face today has already changed, and the rapporteur made reference to that.
We have sent troops to Macedonia in order to prevent the outbreak there of a civil war similar to those that have broken out in other states belonging to the former Yugoslavia.
In the Congo, we used not only civilian means, but also sent a contingent of troops, in order to ensure that the elections there could be held in peace, and I am confident that this contingent will be able to return home at the end of this month.
As I conclude this intervention, I should like to return to the point that the rapporteur made at the very outset and was quite right to highlight, namely that the analysis of the threats and of the action taken under the security strategy need to be reviewed on a regular basis.
Once the report has been adopted, the next thing we should do is to discuss how we, in this House, can organise this process.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I wish to begin by warmly congratulating Mr von Wogau on his excellent report, which offers an accurate and comprehensive survey of the current line of thinking of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence.
I also want to thank him for the efforts he made to reach the broadest possible agreement with the other political groups.
While this clearly means that my group will approve the report, I would like to stress two particular points.
The first point is the need to ensure effective parliamentary control, both at national and EU levels.
The EU, as has been said, is currently engaged in a growing number of military and civilian operations in various parts of the world.
I insist on the need for Parliament to be continually updated and to be informed and consulted whenever a new operation is being contemplated.
Until now, all these operations have gone well, but it is entirely possible that one day a major incident will occur and there will then be widespread clamour for parliamentary oversight.
Secondly, much greater clarification of the respective roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the High Representative, the Council and the Member States is also needed.
Who pays what is too often decided on a case-by-case basis, which again makes oversight difficult.
This is conducive to overlap and waste and, worst of all, also leads to outright competition between, for instance, the Council's special envoys and the Commission's delegations.
Both the Council and the Commission will of course deny this is the case, but a number of us know better, even if, luckily, such competition is not the general rule.
Finally, what is needed most of all is political will on the part of Member State governments and that, alas, is an entirely different story.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a matter of good manners in this House that one starts with warm congratulations to the rapporteur, and, while I am happy to do so, I also have to say that I am deeply saddened not to be able, for the first time in two and a half years, to recommend that my group approve a report - unless, that is, our main amendments to it are accepted.
I want to justify that firstly by reference to the report's content, and secondly on grounds of form.
What is fundamental is that a great deal of the report - as one Member has pointed out - reads like the armaments industry's shopping list, but such a thing cannot be sustained under the title of 'European Security Strategy and ESDP', which refers to far more complex concepts.
That being so, the report is not a comprehensive concept, but rather the very opposite of one.
I take it that that was the reason why the rapporteur's own group tabled 45 amendments, which is a considerable figure.
When one looks at the report in detail, it is clear that what it is attempting to do is to blur the boundaries laid down by treaty between internal and external security.
Europol is covered by the ESDP.
The intention is that the ESDP should be used for the purpose of combating terrorism, and for the protection of infrastructure, the energy supply, and of the external borders.
Combining police, military and judicial functions in this way is a blatant violation of treaties currently in force, and it also gives rise to additional security problems; it is the very approach taken by President Bush, Dick Cheney and the now-departed Rumsfeld.
Homeland security modelled on US security policy has already failed and there is no need for us to copy it.
Secondly, the report gives the impression that there is no such thing as the civil arm of the European Security and Defence Policy, even though most of the 17 ESDP missions are civilian in nature.
Nor is sufficient reference made to civil conflict prevention, yet that is precisely what is needed right now.
Thirdly, instead of going into detail about the defence market, it would have been timely to speak plainly about Europe's security and about disarmament - both conventional and nuclear - yet the subject occurs nowhere in the report.
Fourthly, I would like to look at the question of what military goods are to be purchased: aircraft carriers, satellite communication systems - all these things are asked for, with the justification given being that we are becoming a defence union.
What sign is there here, I ask you, of a realistic assessment of what we now have to do?
We have to work towards harmonisation; we have to compel the nation states, in the interests of all, to harmonise their strategies, structures and equipment, but the idea of us being a defence union is somewhere over the rainbow.
It always used to be the Greens who were fundamentalists, and it is quite astonishing that you have now gone that way.
As I see it, the resolutions adopted at Cologne, Helsinki and Feira have been turned on their heads, and, if I were a schoolteacher, I would give you nought out of ten for missing the point.
I regret to have to say it, but this amounts to an attempt at remilitarising European foreign policy.
In committee, we had negotiated a consensus, and it was the rapporteur himself who broke it at the last minute.
That is an unfair way of going about things, and something we cannot accept.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Greens appear to be learning.
The chairman of the security and defence sub-committee has produced a report on military policy in the EU.
The report has now been wrapped up in social democratic cotton wool, its language - originally unmistakeable - robbed of its punch.
It is evident that no place could be found for the statement in the draft to the effect that the EU ought, under certain conditions, to be open to the concept of pre-emptive warfare; that sort of talk was, no doubt, too plain.
The report makes the mistakes usually associated with a militarised EU foreign policy.
It incorporates a risk analysis of the European Security Strategy, according to which the principal threats faced by the European Union and its citizens are international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, failed states and organised crime.
What about poverty, hunger and social inequality?
The report speaks up for military border surveillance - aimed against whom, I wonder? - and for the use of military means to secure access to resources.
The EU wants to develop a strategic partnership with NATO; the report 'welcomes NATO's increasing capability of playing a role in out-of-theatre operations' - and that in a report from the European Parliament!
It also calls for a considerable strengthening of Europe's operational capacities, including air and sea transport, and the conflation of civilian and military is taken still further.
The report amounts to a catalogue of demands aimed at the further militarisation of the European Union - demanding, among other things, more money for crisis operations, which will have to be found from the Community budget, which means new financial arrangements.
After the games played on us with Athena, what is now being proposed is the introduction of a virtual military budget.
We all know that the Treaty of Nice, quite rightly, outlaws any freestanding military budget for the EU; that is why attempts are being made to resurrect the deceased EU constitutional treaty, for as it says, 'stresses the importance of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which will bring about major progress towards a Security and Defence Union'.
It is for precisely that reason that we are opposed to this Constitutional Treaty for the EU.
What is being called for here is the EU as a military union.
There are those for whom making the EU a military union is a goal, and paragraphs 51 and 52 of this report read like their wish list, with new weaponry and more money to buy it and enable the EU to be a military global player around the world.
That is the wrong way to go about things.
The EU is currently involved in at least 11 military and police operations around the world, and more are in the pipeline; the list now includes Afghanistan, where NATO troops are killing more and more civilians, and now the EU wants to join in the carnage as soon as possible, when what is needed - and now! - is for the troops to be brought home from Afghanistan and elsewhere.
The European Union has no need of more armaments; it needs to be a civil power.
What is needed is disarmament, and it is needed right now.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, in the early 1950s Jean Monnet proposed a European Defence Community, with a European army run by a European Minister for Defence, a common budget and common arms procurement.
This project was thankfully rejected by the French after President de Gaulle opposed the idea.
Undeterred, Jean Monnet and his acolytes pursued the idea of a European political union by economic means rather than by defence and military means.
Over 50 years later, we have a European Union which has almost completed its political agenda: it has its own President, its own cabinet in the shape of the Commission, its own Parliament, a single currency, flag, anthem and Court of Justice, just to name a few of its attributes.
However, if it is to be a real state it must have its own military forces, and that is what this report is about. The report calls for a common equipment and equipment procurement policy and for integrated command and control and communication systems.
What better way to ensure the integration of Europe's national military forces than by ensuring that they will begin so interdependently that they will not be able to operate independently.
The militaristic pill is sugared, however, by reference to humanitarian operations and crisis management.
However, call it what you will, it is an army, and if war is the continuation of politics by other means, then the European Union needs an army to pursue its foreign policy ambitions.
I am not surprised that Mr von Wogau pursues political integration by these means.
He believes in political integration and is open about it, and I respect him for that.
What disgusts me is that Britain's Prime Minister, the liar Mr Blair, and his rotten and corrupt Labour Government collude with the process of integrating Britain's armed forces into the planned European army, while pretending to defend Britain's national interest.
Luckily, you are over call-up age, Mr Batten, so it will never affect you.

The implementation of the European Security Strategy in the context of the ESDP (continuation of debate)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report by Mr von Wogau on the implementation of the European Security Strategy in the context of the ESDP.
Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for presenting a comprehensive analysis of the current problems of the European Security Strategy and for evaluating threats to the modern world.
One example of these threats: in paragraph 10 the report stresses a need for a major EU contribution to promote regional disarmament.
I would like to draw attention to the Kaliningrad area, a heavily militarised Russian enclave within the EU.
To continue pretending that this last vestige of the Cold War and Soviet expansion is something with which we have to accommodate would be dangerous and absurd.
Therefore the demilitarisation of this area, which should be followed by making Kaliningrad a pilot project and opening it up to free trade, should be one of the topics to be raised at the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit.
The von Wogau report clearly presents our final objective.
We are on our way to a Security and Defence Union.
However, it also reminds us that the EU is still a long way from this goal.
We are just noting progress, increasing capacities and looking for additional money.
There are some problems we need to be very clear about.
We need to establish a common market in the field of defence, to provide for a European budget to cover both the military and the civil aspects of security and to intensify cooperation between the EU Defence Ministers, with the final goal of creating the post of Deputy EU Foreign Minister in charge of the ESDP.
To that end, it is essential to avoid duplication of efforts and to coordinate all these activities with NATO.
There is an urgent need to provide the same access to space-based intelligence systems for all Member States on a common basis.
(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is often said in Europe that there is a crisis of public confidence in the European project and in European politics.
There is no such scepticism when it comes to security and defence policy.
As public opinion polls have shown, more than two thirds of the Europeans support this policy and take the view that the risks and dangers associated with terrorism, organised crime, regional conflicts and the spread of weapons of mass destruction require a joint, Europe-wide solution.
Mr von Wogau's report calls for a joint solution, and for elements of the European security and defence policy to be strengthened.
I wholeheartedly support this call and the efforts to establish EU security and defence.
The proposals for creating an internal market for developing, manufacturing and purchasing arms, a shared communication and media system and European civil defence mechanisms are among many that I consider to be steps in the right direction.
Europe needs a joint approach to the security risks and threats it faces and Mr von Wogau's report outlines such an approach in a way that is both realistic and outstanding.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, European security and defence policy has great challenges ahead of it, and the EU must not close its eyes to them.
What is certain is that the future will see the EU taking on more and more international commitments, and the disturbing developments in the Middle East, in North Korea and in Iran are harbingers of this trend.
What we need is effective decision-making machinery, a clear command structure, no doubt about who is empowered to do what, competent personnel capable of being deployed quickly and kitted out with modern equipment, and the logistical capacity for getting troops quickly to where they are going to serve.
The von Wogau report demands these things, and also contains proposals for their improvement; it is for these reasons that we will be supporting it.
Over recent years, the ESDP has achieved some progress; the battle groups will, with effect from 1 January 2007, have become fully operational, and the Foreign Relations Council, meeting yesterday, noted that there had been further improvements in the quality of equipment used by the Member States' armies.
The European Defence Agency makes a valuable contribution towards the harmonisation of the armaments market and the coordination of joint research projects in the security and defence sphere.
It has to be said, though, that the planning of EU mission off-budget is on the increase, and this is still a disturbing trend.
An increase in the number of missions presupposes that they are legitimate in democratic terms, but that cannot be guaranteed if their finances are planned without reference to the European Parliament, which results in an unjustifiable lack of transparency.
The report contains refreshingly clear proposals as to how this may be prevented, and these, too, we can fully support.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
(ES) Madam President, the drawing up of the European Security Strategy was influenced by three great debates of an international nature: the debate on the new threats that had to be faced and on how to face them, particularly following 11 September; that on the problems faced by the United Nations as a universal and multilateral forum for preventing and managing disputes; and that on the commitments to be made by the European Union in order to become a more active, capable and coherent actor at world level.
The European Security Strategy therefore points out that the greatest challenges that the European Union and its citizens must face today are international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, failed States and organised crime.
I naturally agree that those problems are important.
I fear, however, that this list does not place sufficient emphasis on other aspects that I believe are just as important, if not more so.
I am talking, for example, about poverty, the lack of a global justice system, the collective criminalisation of groups and communities, the increasing militarisation of the planet, the plundering of the basic subsistence resources of the poorest countries by the rich countries, the pollution of the environment and the destruction of social ecosystems.
In this regard, I do not believe that the European Union always offers the most appropriate response, in either political or structural terms.
Hence, for some time we have been hearing arguments in favour of creating a single European army, for example.
Nevertheless, that army is usually seen as an addition, or, if you like, a complement, to the 25 existing armies, and not as a replacement for them, as I believe it should be.
Though we apparently agree that, in order to deal with the current challenges, numerous armies of a national nature are no longer necessary, we still have a European Union with 25 national armies, whose personnel amount to some two million people, whose main duty is to defend the Member States' borders and interests and which jointly cost more than EUR 160 million per year.
Furthermore, these are figures that many of us would like to see dedicated to the prevention and management of conflicts.
In short, the actions and decisions of the governments do not currently appear to be consistent with the change of attitude towards security that we have been seeing recently, particularly at European level.
(EL) Madam President, the report describes in the clearest and most revelatory manner the nature of the European Union as an imperialist union of European monopolies which is being militarised.
The so-called 'European security strategy' has nothing to do with a security strategy for the people; it is an undisguised aggressive imperialist policy which moves in two directions. Firstly, towards going along fully with the USA and ÎÎÎ€Î in criminal action against the peoples and, secondly, towards the construction of the European Union's own mechanisms to strengthen its military power, so that it is also in a position to take military action and intervene on its own.
Its objective is to secure a better share when the markets are divided up.
This policy is based on the principle of preventive war, on the adoption, to all intents and purposes, of the new NATO military doctrine for imperialist interventions throughout the world, on the pretext of combating global threats, terrorism and interruptions to the flow of natural resources, the imposition of democracy, crisis management and the principle of preventive strike.
It announces that the imperialist interventions of the European Union no longer have any limits to their action.
Their scope is extending to the entire world.
It indirectly adopts the model of the imperialist interventions in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, in other words imperialist war on various pretexts, such as the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that were never found, followed by occupation and reconstruction.
This enriches the imperialists by plundering the wealth of the peoples.
It also promotes the creation of rapid intervention forces and deliberately links military and civil missions, baptising military interventions 'humanitarian'.
It even links the external security of the European Union with the creation of a European constabulary and policy force, with the militarisation of the borders and a military approach to immigrants and refugees.
It even increases funding for military purposes with hidden budgets.
For the workers, however, there are starvation wages and permanent austerity.
In promoting this strategy, the aggressiveness of the European Union is intensifying and escalating, both towards third countries and within it.
The enemy is the people.
Efforts to strengthen the military power of the European Union are linked to the efforts to strengthen it in the imperialist competition and within the frameworks of competition between the war industries.
The effort to show that, apparently, the European Union is distancing itself from the US imperialist policy in Iran is brazen deceit of the peoples.
The excitement about Guantanamo and CIA flights and abductions on European territory is hypocritical, given that it follows the same imperialist policy and, at the same time, strengthens operational cooperation with ÎÎÎ€Î.
The peoples must be concerned about and must act against the arming, militarisation and terrorism of the imperialists.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate you on the report on European security policy.
It is an excellent report which, in my opinion, requires no further amendments.
In particular, it does not require any amendments which would deprive the European Union of any military significance in the world.
If it wants to play a greater role in the world, the European Union must be able to have an effective military presence, not only on its own borders, but also in other parts of the world.
This will not be achieved by simply creating a defence agency and harmonising armaments.
We also need to convince European public opinion to support greater defence spending that would be in line with our ambitions.
Europe has proved that it does not abuse military power, so pacifist fears in this respect are unfounded.
In fact, we should instead fear for our political and military ability to take responsibility for global security.
The creation of a European security policy should not aim to copy NATO, our main, tried and tested defence policy instrument.
Neither should our strategic autonomy upset our political and technical cooperation with the NATO powers.
In fact, the Western world, which stretches far beyond the borders of the European Union, has a right to expect from us a real contribution towards cooperation and synergy in terms of our joint activities.
The report presented this in a well-balanced manner, and that is why we will gladly support it in tomorrow's vote.
(PL) Madam President, today's debate on the implementation of a European Security Strategy is one of the more important debates concerning the future of the European Union.
It is a step towards adopting some of the solutions contained in the dead constitutional treaty.
The proposal to create the post of a European Foreign and Defence Minister is a threat to the interests of many Member States.
Germany's agreement with Russia was a fine example of European solidarity in the field of energy.
It is very typical and should be viewed as a warning sign.
It makes sense that the Union needs an instrument to exert military influence on its immediate surroundings.
However, any attempt to take on military responsibility for global security would represent an attempt to replace NATO or, to be more precise, to weaken the United States' influence in Europe and the world.
There should be no competition between NATO and the European Union in the field of security and defence policy.
It must be stressed that NATO has a significantly more important role and capabilities than the armed forces allocated to the European Union.
Of course, there are members of the EU who are not NATO members, and we have to find a way to involve them in matters relating to European security.
This kind of cooperation should take place within the framework of cooperation between the national armed forces of the Member States.
We do not need to create new command headquarters, but simply to allocate parts of national armed forces to cooperate in specific actions.
However, it is vital to create a coherent European system in the field of intelligence, crisis response and the monitoring of economic threats.
It is for the national governments and the Union to monitor how individual Member States are prepared for terrorist attacks or whether they have an appropriate territorial defence system.
Moreover, the Union should deal with security in its immediate surroundings and not try to exert a global influence and become involved in local conflicts around the world.
Madam President, I have consistently opposed EU meddling in the defence sphere.
European countries are responsible for their security through their own efforts individually and through NATO collectively, and that is how it should remain.
The European Union has moved on to defence territory, not because it adds defence capabilities, because it does not, but because there are those who wish to see the EU acquire more State-like attributes and become a global actor, pursuing its own distinct foreign policy objectives.
To do this, it wants the full range of foreign policy instruments at its disposal, including armed forces.
This report, however, goes well beyond the immediate ambitions of even those who drive ESDP at the moment.
It advocates a Security and Defence Union and wants the EU to have its own defence budget.
Heaven help us if those responsible for the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and all the interfering and counterproductive over-regulation of our lives were to have a role in organising our defence.
These unacceptable proposals for a Security and Defence Union, for an EU defence budget, are enough in themselves to ensure the opposition of the British Conservative delegation, but the international context in which this report is being debated makes it doubly objectionable.
NATO is currently engaged in a vital operation in Afghanistan.
It is no exaggeration to say that the success of this mission is indispensable to NATO's future and to our own long-term security.
The Alliance has repeatedly called for reinforcement of this Afghanistan mission with combat troops, tactical lift helicopters and indeed with forward civil reconstruction efforts to consolidate the military gains that are made.
With some honourable exceptions, the response from European allies has been pitiful.
I have no doubt in my own mind that ESDP is a distraction from NATO and is part of the problem.
At this time of threat to the democracies, when solidarity is needed, it is disastrous for Europeans and Americans to have competing strategic visions, or indeed to have two defence organisations with overlapping membership, making competing claims on the same limited resources.
(PT) I wish to congratulate Mr von Wogau on his ambitious report.
It is a report that recognises that, in spite of the progress that has been made in the area of Europe's security and defence, much remains to be done.
I agree with what Mr von Wogau said in the Chamber today: the process of building a Union of security and defence has the potential to bring us closer again to the citizens of the Union.
The figures from Eurobarometer are clear: 77% of Europeans support a European security and defence policy.
Even in the United Kingdom, the country of Mr van Orden and of some of the most vocal Eurosceptics in this Chamber, support stands at 59%.
Yet this report is limited in scope.
Although it boldly proposes the creation of a European budget for the Union's military activities, advocates strengthening the role of the European Parliament and national parliaments in scrutinising Europe's security and defence policies and rightly calls for the advances proposed by the Constitutional Treaty not to be cast aside, this report limits itself to reiterating support for the initiatives put forward by the Council and the Commission in vital areas of industrial integration and the creation of a European defence equipment market.
It is disappointing that this report does not go further.
I am firmly in favour of introducing the principle of European preference in the area of the procurement of defence equipment.
What is at stake in the long term is the EU's strategic autonomy, and Parliament has thus far been unable to present its own vision in this area.
Madam President we must not let ourselves be blinded by the dogma of the market.
It is crucial that, following the lead of our friends and partners around the world, we do not forget the strategic and political implications of this sector of industry.
Madam President, this is the first serious review of the European Security Strategy by Parliament, but we are much less clear about NATO.
We say that NATO is responsible for our collective defence and a forum for transatlantic relations. We do not say what we would do if NATO fails to achieve peace in Afghanistan.
NATO is not supposed to be defeated.
NATO has suffered from an absence of clear strategic reappraisal since the end of the Cold War and it suffers from continuing poor collaboration with the European Union.
Parliament should not be so shy of a critical scrutiny of NATO, without which our grip upon the development of the European Security and Defence Policy will always remain fanciful.
(SV) Madam President, during my two years here in Parliament, I have come across many reports dealing with everything under the sun. However, the report we are now debating is the worst I have seen so far.
Mr von Wogau proposes now one thing and now another, but the main theme is that of militarising the EU by developing the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
He wants to extend the scope of the European Security Strategy. This would open the way for pre-emptive wars of the type we are seeing right now in, for example, the Middle East.
Mr von Wogau also believes that military efforts in the field of crisis management should be funded out of the EU budget.
In other words, it would be taxpayers in, for example, neutral Sweden who would pay for military operations around the world.
Among the more fanciful proposals is that of setting up a standing naval force in the Mediterranean Sea to take care of the EU's security interests in the region.
To top it all, the rapporteur also emphasises the need for a Constitution, because this would speed up the creation of a Defence Union.
When, in 1995, Sweden joined the EU, many Swedes were sceptical.
That the EU might become militarised was precisely one of the concerns dismissed by EU groupies as being completely unwarranted.
Today, slightly more than ten years later, we see that this is by no means an impossibility. On the contrary.
I, for one, do not want to see my three sons and other young Europeans participate in an EU army, and I therefore call on my fellow Members to vote against this report in tomorrow's vote.
(PL) Madam President, Mr Solana's 2003 strategy is an excellent document.
It accurately describes the threats and challenges we face, as well as clearly describing the specifically European response which has become the calling card for a European security and defence policy.
In this respect, it does not seem necessary to update this document.
After all, NATO has been using the same strategic concept since April 1999.
This is the only point on which I disagree with Mr Karl von Wogau's proposal.
The value of this report lies elsewhere, in the prospects it outlines for the ESDP.
It is the result of a frank appraisal of the current civilian and military capabilities of the European Union, and Karl von Wogau states that 'The European Union currently has at its disposal only a limited capability for implementing civilian and military operations'.
Karl von Wogau also draws the right conclusions from this assessment.
First of all, he calls for intensive cooperation between the European Union and NATO.
Secondly, he calls for the Union to focus its capabilities on our immediate geographic surroundings.
The rapporteur is aware of the cause of these limited capabilities, since he mentions the lack of strategic air and sea transport, interoperational telecommunications systems and intelligence capabilities, especially in relation to satellites.
These comments are by no means new, as these deficiencies have been with us since at least the first Capabilities Commitment Conference in 2002.
In my view, however, the report's biggest asset is to be found in the long-term perspective that Karl von Wogau outlines for the ESDP.
He moves beyond the boundaries of operational targets, in other words beyond 2010 and beyond the terms of the Constitutional Treaty.
This outlook involves the creation of a security and defence union.
We must not lose sight of this objective.
It is, and should be, the guiding light for the next steps that need to be taken to develop the ESDP.
Madam President, I would like to begin by quoting the results of the Eurobarometer survey, according to which 70% of European citizens are in favour of a European Security and Defence Policy.
The citizens of the European Union seem to have a better idea of the challenges of our time than the Council representatives, who are not present in the plenary Chamber in Strasbourg tonight.
The European Security Strategy should focus on the most important aims in terms of creating a common Security and Defence Policy for the European Union.
Above all, we should call for a new generation of satellite systems to be integrated into the European system and for the data gathered to be made available to the military and the police, as well as for the purposes of disaster management, using the satellite centre in TorrejÃ³n.
Intelligence remains one of the most important areas of this strategy.
Secondly, the rapid response groups being set up now must be provided with intelligence and communications equipment that is the same as, or at least compatible with that used by NATO.
Madam President, I congratulate Commissioner Frattini for staying on board for so long.
Perhaps he is excited about the next season at Ferrari, with Kimi Raikkonen driving for them.
Sorry, Mr Duff, I know you do not follow Formula One!
I should like to make five points.
First point: I support the report.
I think it is excellent.
There is only one thing I think goes a little over the top and that is the idea of a European Defence Minister to supplement our Foreign Minister.
We will wait for the Constitution to start with one and then perhaps have the other.
Second point: this concerns Mr Van Orden, who unfortunately has already left.
He raised a lot of problems about the relationship between NATO and the EU.
I always tell Mr Van Orden that he should get a life.
If we have the Constitution all those problems will be solved, but alas, he is probably not in favour of the Constitution.
Third point: I think the strategic interests of the EU and the US are exactly the same and this report shows that very well.
That is why I think we need to try to solve our problems hand in hand as Mr von Wogau suggests.
Fourth point: I think the biggest structural problem that we have between ESDP and NATO is that our cooperation does not really work in the way it is supposed to.
As a former civil servant, I think that the relationships are too much staff-to-staff, in other words too many civil servants dealing with civil servants.
Perhaps we should make the relationship political and thus get a result.
My final point is that I think the strength of the ESDP is its diversity.
If we only focus on the civilian aspects of crisis management, we are cheating ourselves.
The question is, do you accept ethnic cleansing, for instance?
If your answer is no, we also need a military aspect of crisis management.
So therefore I support the report with all my heart.
I think it is excellent.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr von Wogau for this report, which is comprehensive, pragmatic and also courageous.
I share the view - one held by 70% of Europe's population and most of the people in this House - that the only response to the major threats facing us, from terrorism to failed states, that ultimately promises any success is that of a European Security Strategy.
I also share the rapporteur's view that such a strategy must be constantly adapted if Europe wants to remain in future an area of security, freedom and prosperity.
Since there is hardly likely to be, in future, much support for increased military expenditure, we need to make more efficient use than hitherto of the means and resources at our disposal, and that is why the European Security and Defence Policy needs common standards, shared research and development and a single system of procurement.
There is a need for a single system of air and space reconnaissance and shared telecommunication standards.
There is a need for strategic cooperation between the forces deployed in the fields of external and internal security.
What is evident from present-day deployments of troops in the Congo is that, although their dedication has yielded successes, there are just as many deficits to be dealt with.
We all know that the EU, although an economic giant, continues to be a dwarf in security policy terms, but if it wants to become a political union, it must stop being a security dwarf and abandon national animosities in favour of something holistic and bigger.
It is for that reason that the Community needs a security policy that is also to be funded by the Community, with Parliament sharing in the decision-making and monitoring it, and with a political head in the person of a deputy foreign minister.
It is to this road that this report points, and that is why it is not only courageous, but also forward-looking in the interests of a secure Europe for its citizens.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I welcome the report which correctly reflects our opinions on the evolution of ESDP in the future.
ESDP should further enhance its civil-military character; the best combinations of all assets and instruments are able to offer us the optimal stabilisation result in the field.
The aim is to stabilise a crisis management area with a better perspective in the long run.
In this way, we should not be inspired by the military model of NATO, but be able to develop our own approach as is the case in Congo.
Belligerents trust us more since EU is not driven by a leader nation with political arriÃšre-pensÃ©es and its decisions are taken through transparency rules.
Rapid reaction in movement and transport is a common challenge for all EU operations regardless of their nature.
Europe should better explore the use of and synergies among its civilian transport assets.
Europeans are leaders in civilian air and maritime transport and such advantage should also serve our rapid reaction in crisis periods.
Multi-modal planning, optimal combination of different type of assets (air, sea, helicopters, rail) and better use of civilian assets need to be integrated into our concepts of how we conduct operations.
(PL) Madam President, whether the aims presented in the Security Strategy are achieved largely depends on the ability of the European Union to implement this document, which will, in turn, lend the European Union credibility in terms of a serious security policy, and make it a body capable of taking decisive action in crisis situations.
At the moment, we are facing many challenges in the field of foreign policy, such as the conflicts in the Middle East, military missions involving soldiers of the Member States and the emergence of new world powers such as China or India.
In these times, it is vital to strengthen our Common Foreign and Security Policy.
To make our Common Foreign and Security Policy more effective and efficient, we need to take key steps today and provide answers to the fundamental questions posed by the rejected Constitutional Treaty.
We also need people and institutions to conduct this policy.
This includes creating the post of an EU Foreign Minister, greater financial resources, better analysis of key problems and coordination of the policies of the Member States.
It is important to create our own pool of skills in the field of humanitarian operations, peacekeeping and pacification missions and crisis management.
The security of the Member States of the European Union can be assured by having an effective, multi-faceted system and a stable region.
Implementing the Strategy will largely depend on the will of the Member States and the diligent fulfilment of the responsibilities assigned to them.
Actions such as the adoption of a legal framework, an implementation timescale and commitments in the field of external relations will, in themselves, not be enough to create an effective system for preventing and combating threats.
Succession and wills (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on succession and wills (2005/2148 (INI)).
rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say straight away that, in relation to the measure before us, there are in the European Union between 50 000 and 100 000 cases of succession due to death, and this is a measure that is likely to become the reference in issues of international law.
Transnational succession is an extremely wide-ranging phenomenon, and it comes up against an increasing number of difficulties stemming from profound differences between the system of private international law and the substantive law systems of the Member States.
That often results in obstacles to the freedom of movement and the enjoyment of the right to own property.
The Committee on Legal Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing, has therefore decided to take the initiative to make successions in Europe simpler by using the power granted to it by Article 192 of the EC Treaty, and to call on the Commission to adopt a legislative proposal.
Since we, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately do not yet have the power to initiate legislation like all our counterparts in the national parliaments - that is an observation that I always make - I turn to you, Commissioner Frattini, and, with the strong backing that I am sure the qualified majority vote will give me, I call on you to carry forward an important request of ours in the interests of Europe's citizens.
You are aware that, for beneficiaries to take possession of an estate, they currently have to start proceedings in all the countries where the property is located.
This is not only a costly and laborious process, but, since the transmission of property by inheritance is a special way of transferring ownership, it is associated with emotional and personal aspects - highly complex interpersonal relationships that even transcend legal arguments.
I should like to mention a very personal recollection from my youth, when I was at university: Professor Cariota-Ferrara, who had done his thesis on inheritance law, used to say that inheritance law was a law about emotions, a law that often involved suffering.
Hence, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that our proposal will make a real contribution to creating a Europe of the citizens.
I am grateful to the committee, which debated this issue at length and thoroughly examined all aspects of it.
I truly believe that what we are putting before Parliament is a very important proposal that represents a step forwards for both political Europe and the citizens' Europe.
I therefore call on you to adopt this report, and I also ask Commissioner Frattini to do so on behalf of the citizens of Europe.
The report we are proposing includes measures aimed at ensuring that there is one applicable law and one competent court.
Applicable law and competent court should generally coincide, and the criterion for establishing them is also objective: the habitual place of residence of the deceased at the time of death.
Individual freedom of choice is not ruled out, however: people making a will may choose which law should govern the whole succession, either the law of their own nationality or the law of the country in which they are habitually resident at the time the choice is made.
Similarly, should disputes arise, the parties may choose the applicable law and the competent courts.
I should like to say a few words on a key point that I consider the cornerstone of our proposal.
The report proposes the introduction of a legally binding European certificate of inheritance, which will set out the law applicable to the succession, the beneficiaries of the estate, the persons responsible for administering the estate and their powers, and the property comprising the estate.
The certificate will be drawn up according to a standard model and will allow the property inherited to be recorded in the public registers of the Member State in which the property is located.
Mrs Berger has carried out a more thorough investigation than the others precisely on this proposal and has tabled five amendments.
In this respect, I must say that I am particularly concerned that the certificate should be compulsory, consistent and legally certain. Indeed, if that is not established, I think the whole structure of the provision will be adversely affected, and it will become less effective and rather less of a reference.
Not all the countries in the EU may take it into account, and it will end up being a consultative measure rather than a mandatory one.
In any event, that is likely to diminish its force, which should lie precisely in its legal certainty and its ability to reach all citizens, so that they can have a real chance of receiving their inheritance by means of these instruments.
In my opinion, the other amendments should be rejected, and in that respect I should like to appeal particularly to Mrs Berger to think again and perhaps to withdraw or recast her amendment in order to make this proposal more incisive.
Madam President, Mr Gargani, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to sincerely congratulate Chairman Gargani and the Committee on Legal Affairs for having drawn up a proposal which, if it is approved by this House - as I hope it will be - I will not hesitate to transform into a legislative proposal.
I too would like to begin with an observation.
We have worked for a long time to gauge the opinions of legal operators, of experts in the field, and, above all, of the citizens of the European Union, on the possibility of having an instrument clearly identifying the applicable law and therefore making it easier to create a real European area in the sector of succession and wills.
Well, from the results of a survey conducted by Eurobarometer in July 2006 on the various aspects of family law in Europe, it has emerged that, on average, 80% of Europeans believe that recognition of succession and wills within the whole European area is necessary.
There are, obviously, countries in which the consensus on this matter is even stronger: in Germany, for example, one of the great founding countries, and in Latvia, a smaller country, 92% consensus was recorded in favour of this kind of legislation; in my own country, Italy, the figure was 88%, as in Hungary.
There has therefore been a wide response, showing that, on average, four fifths of Europeans are in favour of facilitating European regulation on succession and wills.
In March 2005, the Commission published a Green Paper on the subject, which has enabled us to gather hundreds of responses of great interest from academics, the legal profession and operators in the field.
We have also gathered many good ideas from the hearing on transnational successions, which Parliament had the excellent idea of organising.
Among other things, I can inform you that the Commission has, in turn, organised a public hearing on the same topic, to be held on 30 November.
It will give us an opportunity to collect further ideas, which, I believe, together with Mr Gargani's report, will enable us to submit a legislative proposal in the near future.
The last subject on which I would like to comment briefly is that already touched on by Chairman Gargani, namely that of a European Certificate of Inheritance.
I share the rapporteur's view that, if we want a truly effective European instrument in this area, it must have binding effect within European territory.
In this regard, many of you will remember other instruments of private international law on which we have reached an agreement.
If a certain instrument, once adopted in one Member State, could be called into question every time in the other Member States in which it is to be applied - if it is not binding on them, in other words - one of the foundations of the area of free movement of decisions would be jeopardised.
Obviously, the objection could be made that a certificate of inheritance, as such, is always binding, since otherwise it would not be able to certify situations.
However, I believe that in this case it would be appropriate to emphasise its binding nature, as we are creating, perhaps for the first time, a useful instrument for resolving the problem of movement among European citizens that is also shown through the recognition of wills, that is the problem of succession and wills.
Allow me therefore to say in advance that I agree entirely with Mr Gargani.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Mr Gargani has presented us with a report that expresses the Committee on Legal Affairs' desire for the European institutions to take action in the field of succession law.
Commissioner Frattini has stressed that 80% of European citizens believe that succession law must be regulated and recognised in a harmonised fashion throughout the European Union.
We are not talking about theories, but about the realities affecting people who live in different countries or who have families in different countries and who, when succession takes place, find themselves in an absolutely desperate situation.
Unfortunately, the European Union's Treaties do not provide for the possibility of harmonising the substantive law on succession.
This is something that will probably have to be put right in the future, since it makes very little sense that the consequences, the legal system and the rights of inheritors should change entirely as a result of moving a few kilometres and depending on whether a person is established in one country or another.
For the time being, the Committee on Legal Affairs, by means of the report by Mr Gargani, is restricting itself to telling the Commission that it is necessary to begin to propose actions of a legislative nature.
Commissioner Frattini has indicated that the Commission is in favour of doing so.
We will probably not be able to go much further at the moment.
We in the Committee on Legal Affairs have discussed the merits and the content of the proposals that Mr Frattini includes in the annex; there are certain amendments tabled by my Socialist colleague, Mrs Berger, which are intended to correct some of the defects noted in that annex, but the most important thing of all is that the Commission is prepared to make practical proposals, as Mr Frattini has indicated in this House.
We cannot improvise on this issue, since we must work on the basis of our experience.
Anybody who has had to deal with an international succession issue within the European Union will have found themselves faced with huge difficulties, above all in terms of jurisdiction.
We should probably begin to deal with the issue from the point of view of jurisdiction, the competences of courts and the recognition and effectiveness of decisions, removing the exequatur procedure, as Mr Gargani recommends, which makes no sense in the European Union.
I therefore hope that Mr Gargani's efforts and Mr Frattini's contribution will make it possible for us soon to have practical proposals on the table for the development of Community law in this field.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to welcome the Green Paper, and thank Mr Gargani very much for his report and all the work that has been done on it in terms of consultation. It really is welcome.
This is clearly an issue that affects an increasing number of our citizens and that we have to address, but it is not a simple issue.
When one thinks about how terrible it is for any individual to have to deal with bereavement and then adds to that the difficulties of dealing with some sort of transnational legal situation, it is clearly an area that we have to try to tackle in order to make life easier for our citizens, having encouraged them to be mobile in the way that we have.
But the legal problems that this raises touch on subsidiarity.
They touch the culture of our different legal systems very deeply.
But it is clear that if we are to tackle the problem, we need, as Mr Gargani has said - and I think my group would also underline - to move towards a binding European certificate of inheritance.
That has to be our first goal, to have free circulation of such a binding certificate, in the same way as we have free circulation of ordinary judgments.
It is going to be difficult though because, as I have said, it touches matters of public policy within our various countries.
It touches matters of taxation law.
But I commend the report and hope that the Commissioner will be able to take it forward to a legislative instrument.
(DE) Madam President, the rapporteur - and chairman of our committee - deserves thanks for his report and also for having been willing to take on board a number of my amendments following the debates in committee.
I think today is a good day for a subject that is not exactly fun: death and inheritance.
Having adopted the services directive at second reading, thank heaven there was no derogation for funeral services, which is what many had wanted.
Tonight we are discussing European initiatives in the field of inheritance law.
Right at the outset, I would like to clear up a misunderstanding, since it is evident that a technical error has cropped up.
I am not seeking to make the certificate of inheritance anything less than binding, but only to delete the words 'unless and until proven otherwise'; on the contrary, indeed, far from wishing to do away with the certificate of inheritance's binding effect, I want to reinforce it.
Since I shall be clarifying this with the House services, it might perhaps be possible, under these circumstances, for the other groups to vote in favour too.
I hope that Amendment 3 is now acceptable.
We are proposing as a starting point a residence period of at least two years, for people should not suffer unexpected legal consequences as a result of short-term relocation, while we do not want to make it easy for someone to evade his own country's inheritance law, to the detriment of his family members, simply by moving elsewhere.
I would now like to put the case for my other amendments, which provide for the certification of conformity.
Since Recommendation 1 testifies to our desire not to interfere in Member States' procedural law, I see this examination of conformity as going against the principle of non-interference not only in the Member States' material law, but also in their procedural law.
I trust that these explanations will help the other groups to support our amendments after all.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Women in international politics (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Gomes, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on Women in international politics.
rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my gratitude for all the contributions that I received from all political groups in drawing up this report.
These contributions improved the report substantially.
The presence of women in international political life has increased.
Take, for example, Chancellor Merkel, President Bachelet and President Johnson-Sirleaf and Prime-Ministers Han Myeong-Sook of South Korea and Diogo of Mozambique.
Indeed, the EU Presidency is currently headed by a woman, Mrs Halonen.
Yet closer inspection reveals that the female presence in politics remains unsatisfactory, both at world and European level, including within each Member State.
Gathering data for this report was not easy, and that tells its own bleak story.
At global level, in spite of the declaration and the platform for action adopted in Beijing, and in spite of the Millennium Development Goals, only ten out of the 191 Member States of the United Nations have a woman as Head of State or Government and only 16% of members of parliament around the world are women.
In the UN, of the 91 envoys or representatives of the Secretary-General only nine are women.
In spite of Resolution 1325 of the Security Council, adopted six months ago, the composition of international bodies and missions involved in conflict prevention continues to be characterised by inequality.
Three weeks ago, the Security Council held a debate on women, peace and security in order to gauge progress in the implementation of Resolution 1325.
All agreed that there remains much to be done to translate good intentions and positive words into action.
What emerged from the debate were recommendations to involve more women in peace missions and thereby to improve the operational effectiveness of these missions.
There was also a call for an urgent change of culture in the office of the Deputy Secretary-General for peace-keeping operations.
Our report contains similar recommendations.
I now turn to the situation in Europe.
Despite Resolution 2025, and others from this Parliament, and despite, too, the Lisbon Strategy, the composition of the European Commission is not yet characterised by gender parity.
Furthermore, out of 107 EU third-country delegations, only seven women are currently serving at the level of Head of EC delegation.
In the Council, there is only one woman among the 14 personal representatives of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. This despite the abundance of qualified, experienced and capable women in the Member States and in the European Institutions.
At practically all levels of decision-making apart from the top, there are signs that the glass ceiling is starting at least to bulge, if not to break, because it is indeed only at the very top echelons of European power that women remain scandalously under-represented.
At national level, I wish to highlight the pioneering example of the Zapatero Government in Spain.
In a world in which the political machinery has a history of blocking women's involvement in political and economic power, this is a model example, which demonstrates that democracy characterised by gender parity is possible and depends a great deal on clear political leadership.
The conclusions of this report are simple: action must be taken to redress inequality of opportunities at European and national level in all fields: for example, the UN and its Secretary-General, by means of a human resources policy that ought to act as an example to the world, and the EU, by means of support to international women's networks and human resources policies ensuring the balanced presence of men and women in positions of political and economic decision-making.
In this connection, I welcome the fact that the Council has just sent a questionnaire to the Member States to gauge the level of implementation of Resolution 1325.
National governments must also encourage more women to apply for political positions at national, European and international level and must ensure that electoral systems produce democratic institutions with balanced representation; no democratic institutions should have fewer than 40% and more than 60% of either sex.
Quotas and other mechanisms designed to redress the balance, currently necessary for women, may become necessary for men.
Without parity of representation, democracy is incomplete and does not work properly.
In this regard, laws and measures contributing towards a better home and working life balance have a vital role to play.
Lastly, political parties should promote women's involvement by setting quotas and establishing other mechanisms for redressing the balance, including specific training for women to embark on a career in politics.
The impetus for change also depends on the quality of party political leadership.
Take my country, Portugal, for example, where women have only been allowed to become, for example, judges, diplomats and armed and security forces professionals since the fall of the dictatorship in 1974.
These are careers that could provide many more candidates of both sexes for all kinds of European and international missions and posts.
Since 1974, there has been extraordinary progress in the presence of women in these careers, yet this progress does not extend to the top of these fields, for example in government or party political decision-making.
It is abundantly clear that the glass ceiling effect is in operation, in spite of the overwhelming presence of qualified women in universities, public administration and the world of work as a whole.
A parity law governing the electoral lists of the political parties has recently been adopted and practical results are expected.
On the path we must follow, numbers should not be our prime concern.
Rather, we must recognise and highlight the qualitative difference made by the political representation of women in defining government agendas, in conflict resolution, in transparency and in presentation of accounts; in other words, in reinforcing the rule of law and democracy.
Vice-President of the Commission. Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the honourable rapporteur for this excellent report.
The Commission works hard to promote gender equality both within and outside the European Union and in this regard the European Parliament's sustained commitment to these issues is vital.
The world needs women leaders at all levels, be it in local communities or in international politics.
Women and men must participate on equal terms in the drafting of agendas that affect us all and in the development of solutions to the problems we are facing.
However, if we look around us, what do we see?
Men still make most of the decisions.
The main examples given in your report clearly demonstrate that the picture is not ideal even for our European democracies and, as you correctly point out, further efforts are needed even inside our respective institutions, the Commission and the Council, to achieve a better gender balance.
Stereotypes and discrimination persist, biased recruitment and promotion systems are rampant, labour market and educational segregation hinder women in achieving their full potential.
One of the core factors remains the imbalanced division of work and family responsibilities.
While the competence to act in this field remains at national level, I am convinced that the Commission can bring real added value by promoting awareness-raising, information gathering, research and analysis, networking and dissemination of best practice.
This role of the Commission is clearly reflected in our March 2006 Communication 'Roadmap to Gender Equality'.
The future European Institute for Gender Equality will also help keep the issue high on the European agenda, collect and analyse data, conduct research and disseminate good practice.
One priority of the roadmap is promotion of the participation of women and men in decision-making processes.
Considering that negative gender stereotypes are strongly related to the unequal representation of women, we have chosen their elimination as another key objective for our programme.
Amongst the Commission's strategic actions for the next five years, the establishment of a European network of women in economic and political decision-making can be highlighted, as well as awareness-raising campaigns, data collection, analysis and exchange of good practices involving all stakeholders to combat gender stereotypes.
The roadmap also includes the promotion of gender equality outside the European Union.
As an example of our action in the external policy field, I would like to mention the Five-Year Action Plan on Gender Equality being signed today in Istanbul by Ministers from the 35 countries of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
Women's political participation is one of the key pillars of today's Action Plan that will be supported by a regional project starting in 2007.
Through the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights, we fund several projects promoted women's empowerment.
As examples I would like to mention the regional project in West Africa aiming at enhancing women's participation in five countries of the region, the regional project in Latin America, seeking to enhance the democratic participation of young people, particularly girls, and the projects undertaken in Egypt, Jordan, Nigeria, Morocco and Kyrgyzstan to empower women to actively participate in political life.
It is useful that a reference to elections is included in the report.
In that context, the Commission has already incorporated the gender perspective into the election observation methodology and women's participation is systematically monitored throughout the Election Observation Missions.
A good example of this can be seen in the European mission recently deployed to Yemen.
As you know, the Commission has a strong and long-standing commitment to mainstream gender across the board in our external relations.
Since 2001, the 'Programme of Action for Mainstreaming Gender Equality in Community Development Cooperation' has given us a framework within which we have implemented an extensive training programme and developed political tools.
In 2007, in cooperation with the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation, we shall be launching a new capacity-building programme, this time directed principally at our partner governments, civil society and other programme-implementing partners in third countries.
A specific thematic focus of this programme will be the promotion of women's participation in peace building, along the lines of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325.
Finally, it is clear to me that, although progress has been made, tremendous efforts are still needed to progress towards gender equality and women's effective participation in the political sphere.
In that respect, the Commission is committed to continuing to mobilise all the instruments available.
Pressing issues include the following: first, we need a stronger gender focus in electoral, constitutional, legal and judicial matters.
We need to enhance our support of women's active involvement in defining and implementing policies at national level.
Secondly, companies need more women at board level to ensure that the widest possible range of thinking, perspectives, experience and abilities is brought to bear on high-level decision-making.
Third, overcoming gender stereotypes in education, training, the labour market and in the media remains an important challenge in all countries.
Finally, to achieve gender balance in decision-making, men must be mobilised and fully involved if we want to move ahead.
Family-friendly policies for women and men, such as more flexible working arrangements and quality childcare facilities, can be of much help.
Madam President, the initiative by Mrs Gomes to draft a report on women in international politics is praiseworthy because, as the Commissioner also pertinently observed, comparisons of the numbers and figures she presents - from Nobel prizewinners to the number of women who have reached key positions in international politics in the Member States or in international organisations - illustrate the lack of female participation.
It is incontestable that a democratic society must be represented in a worthy manner by both men and women and that equal participation should start with training and early initiation into the secrets of politics for men and women, without gender discrimination, and with the possibility of linking professional employment in international foreign politics with family life.
Alongside the rich action and promising plans of the European Union, the Gomes report would retain its value and topical nature if it did not include references to specific national governments and if it did not present lists of countries which have taken measures which cannot be evaluated merely by being referred to.
The participation of women as a mere physical presence on the international political stage is not enough.
On the contrary, it must be due to qualifications and abilities evaluated independently of their sex.
The constitutions and laws of the Member States should support the principle of equal treatment and the parties should promote worthy men and women without discrimination.
Is this not, however, a question of subsidiarity?
Can we dictate the composition of the UN?
We shall not therefore support these specific points of the report.
I do, of course, congratulate the European Commission on its efforts and the European Parliament should support the principle of equality and promote commensurate numbers during the composition of its directorates, delegations representations and delegations.
We shall only support the specific points of the report to which I referred.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Madam President, the balanced participation of women in decision-making is one of the main challenges of a policy of equal opportunity.
This matter also figures on the upcoming action programme on equal opportunities.
This effort must be brought to fruition in all spheres, including external policy, to name but one.
For equal opportunity cannot be restricted to the territory of the European Union.
We must promote the presence of women in political life around the world.
Our views remain voices in the wilderness if they are not accompanied by the necessary political will.
For this reason, it is important that at the March Summit six prime ministers, namely those of the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary and Sweden, approved the European Pact for Gender Equality, which extends the perspectives of equal opportunity to our collaboration with the Commission as well.
This will, hopefully, provide further possibilities both for women's advancement in the workplace and in the creation of a suitable work-family balance.
My fellow representative has done excellent work, and I propose that we approve the report.
(SK) I understand why, as a former diplomat and as a woman who has been involved in politics for years, Mrs Gomes has proposed this topic, and I congratulate her on it.
I fully support the idea that the equal and full participation of women in the political process and in decision-making should fully reflect the true make-up of society.
Such participation is important for future generations and for the proper functioning of democratic systems.
There is no doubt that equality between the sexes in terms of dignity and responsibility fully justifies the rise of women to public positions.
Genuine support for women in politics requires a clear acknowledgement of their value as mothers and their role in the family and this applies in relation to all other public functions and professions.
In addition, these functions and professions must be closely interlinked if we want social and cultural development to be genuinely and fully humane.
Let us be honest.
Women are always deeply involved in life's difficult moments, where they make great peacemakers and mediators par excellence.
We certainly need to do much more to ensure that the conditions under which women and mothers live and work do not result in any discrimination in the world of politics.
In the future, women will be increasingly involved in the serious, hotly debated issues of the day.
It is unusual to see a strong social presence of women in all areas, as women are naturally opposed to a society organised exclusively on the basis of efficiency and productivity, and they insist on redefining these systems in a more humane way.
In conclusion, I would like to express the wish that all women who are active in politics may become preachers of a new feminism, capable of appreciating and expressing the true talents of women in all areas of social life, without being tempted to imitate the models created by our male counterparts.
And these are talents aimed at overcoming all forms of discrimination in public administration and in political parties.
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, five days ago the United Nations celebrated the 60th anniversary of the creation of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.
On that occasion Kofi Annan stated that the world is finally starting to grasp that there is no more effective tool for promoting development than the empowerment of women and girls, empowerment, says Annan, that raises economic productivity, reduces infant and maternal mortality, improves nutrition and promotes health.
The concept of empowerment, first developed by the European Union, was launched with great impetus by the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women, the Beijing Conference, eleven years ago.
The time has come to revive the idea of empowerment by organising a new world conference.
In this report we call on the United Nations once again to convene the Fifth World Conference, and we do so with one voice, the European voice, representing 25, soon to be 27, members of the United Nations out of a total of 191 members, a group carrying significant weight.
This is one of the follow-up actions that we call for in voting for this thorough and balanced report, on which we congratulate the rapporteur.
(EL) Madam President, it is clear from the previous speeches that there is a lack of participation by women in the exercise of international politics, a record lack you might say, in comparison with other political sectors.
I therefore thank Mrs Gomes, who has given us the opportunity to debate this issue once again.
Firstly, because it is a very important issue from the point of view of equilibrium and democracy in the modern world and is a particular dimension of the efforts to achieve equality, justice and, of course, prosperity, as we have already heard.
The second reason is because this dimension is not usually included in the strategies for equality applied by the Member States and the European Union does not, of course, have the competence to impose it, although it could promote it more bindingly and more effectively.
The current situation is not satisfactory, as we have heard, nor are the forecasts optimistic, given that, according to surveys, globally we could exceed a level of 30% in the participation of women in national parliaments alone after 2040.
We therefore need to take a good look at ourselves and to apportion blame honestly, to recognise that simple truths and fundamental values are not being applied in practice as a result of the lack of awareness-raising of and information for society and, of course, the lack of political will in all the agencies, each for its part, as stated in the report and in the amendments tabled by my political group.
To close, I should like to comment on our responsibilities in the institutions of the European Union.
Both the European Commission and the European Parliament should routinely include in their external relations the dimension of issues of concern to women and should seek balanced participation, both in their speakers in external relations and in the composition of their delegations.
(PT) I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Gomes on her excellent report, which addresses a most topical and relevant subject.
Women remain under-represented in both national and European political life, and this is no less true of the European Parliament.
It is incomprehensible that there should be more women than men in universities and increasing numbers of women with masters degrees and doctorates, and that at the same time it is rare to find women in positions of political decision-making or economic power.
When they reach a certain level there is always a glass ceiling blocking their path.
Parity is a vital element of democracy itself.
Experience has shown that a quota system has led to a more equal, and in turn, a fairer and more harmonious, society.
The Member States must adopt laws that guarantee parity.
I should like to conclude, Madam President, with a rhetorical question.
How different would the world be if it were governed by a female majority?
Would Europe not be different, too?
(SV) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Gomes for a quite excellent report.
This issue is extremely important from the perspectives of both gender equality and democracy.
More than half of Europeans are women.
The fact is, then, that it is also important from a democratic point of view for women to participate as fully as men in the political decision-making process.
European policy on equality is based on welfare - something that we must treasure and on which we need to build further, for there are now major deficits where both equality and welfare are concerned.
It is a question of being able to combine private and professional life.
We are concerned here with the unequal distribution of family responsibility and with discrimination in employment and professional education.
We must help each other so that women too are enabled to participate in the political process.
A country in which power is not divided equally between men and women is not a welfare state in which all are equal.
In the long run, such a state is good for men too but, in the short term, men need perhaps to give way a little and allow women a little more room.
In spite of political statements, recommendations, action programmes and special legislation at national level, women are still under-represented in politics.
What is needed if we are to have equality?
I believe, unfortunately, that the only solution is to employ quotas and legislation, which should not be needed.
If men were to take part in the work to promote gender equality, this major problem could be solved.
(ES) Madam President, we know that international conflicts affect women in particular: the majority of refugees and displaced persons, for example, are women.
We must be aware, however, that it is not women who take the decisions that lead to these situations because, as Mrs Gomes's extremely interesting report makes very clear, there are practically no women in the places where decisions are taken on international policy, despite the recommendations of the Beijing Action Programme and Resolution 1325 of the United Nations Security Council and despite the fact that, according to experts, women have a particular gift for negotiation and reaching agreements.
It is a paradox that the majority of NGOs that play an active role in peace negotiations and post-conflict processes are made up of women.
The EU institutions must support these women, as the report points out.
It is urgent that we take all the necessary measures to ensure that there is a balance between men and women in all areas where decisions that affect our collective fate are taken.
An absence of women represents a democratic deficit.
The measures proposed by the report in this regard are very courageous and interesting and they are very much in line with those being taken by the government of my country, Spain.
Congratulations, Mrs Gomes.
(PL) Madam President, 'Women represent half the potential talent and skills of humanity and their under-representation in decision-making is a loss for society as a whole.'
This is a quote from the Athens Ministerial Declaration, which was signed 14 years ago.
In spite of many similar political declarations, special action programmes and corresponding legislation, the phenomenon of gender discrimination has not disappeared.
Out of nearly 44 000 members of parliament worldwide, only 16% are women.
Out of the 191 countries that are currently members of the UN, only seven have a woman as a head of state and eight have a female head of government.
The under-representation of women in the political and decision-making process is sometimes associated with the difficulties of trying to balance one's social, family and work life, and is also often the result of discrimination at work and in professional education.
The European Union should set an example to the world in terms of equal opportunities and democracy.
However, even here, in the European Parliament, women make up only 30% of MEPs.
Some countries, such as Cyprus or Malta, have no female representatives at all.
The Member States and political parties throughout Europe should aim to achieve a so-called 'balanced participation' of 40 to 60% of each gender on their lists of candidates.
Then social representation would really be equitable.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Gomes on her excellent report.
I hope it will contribute to changing the situation of women in political life.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Fighting trafficking in human beings (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Bauer on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on fighting trafficking in human beings an integrated approach and proposals for an action plan.
rapporteur. - (SK) Human trafficking is now spoken of as unquestionably the greatest shame of modern times and the most blatant violation of human rights.
It is also an exceptionally dangerous type of criminal activity, representing the third largest source of revenue after weapons and drugs trafficking, with a turnover in billions of euros and dollars.
Just today the Vatican issued a statement describing human trafficking as being worse than slave trade.
Experts estimate that every year approximately one hundred thousand persons in the European Union become victims of human trafficking.
The most recent findings by Unicef indicate that two thirds of Member States are among the countries of origin and destination.
The view that this does not apply to us is therefore mistaken.
Also incorrect is the idea that this is a matter concerning only a few thousand prostitutes, whose fates are often very tragic.
There are, however, new developments.
These include the increasing numbers of those affected by human trafficking in connection with forced labour, the provision of services, forced begging by children and petty crime, as well as trafficking for the purposes of illegal adoption or forced marriages.
A Council of Europe report also refers to evidence of trafficking in human organs in European countries.
Even though in the vast majority of cases it is women who are the victims, there is alarming evidence that children account for 40-50% of victims.
The report aims to offer an overview of the problem of human trafficking as a whole.
It is not about people smuggling or about prostitution per se.
It is about trafficking in human beings where early identification of the victim is of primary importance.
In the absence of early identification, the victims themselves may well end up being accused of immigration offences or of involvement in illegal activities and they may be extradited from the country before being given a chance to assist in exposing well organised criminal networks, with a high probability of again falling victim to the same networks.
In this context it is necessary to emphasise the importance of the European Union's plan as well as the tried and tested approaches, standards and procedures for combating human trafficking which are generally viewed as a major advance in this area.
I would, however, like to point out four problem areas in the report.
Firstly, despite the fact that this is an extremely serious crime, the situation in Member States with regard to the relevant legislation and its enforcement is far from satisfactory.
Five Member States have yet to ratify the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime or its supplementary protocol, known as the Palermo Protocol, to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children.
As many as ten Members States have not acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child regarding the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.
To date, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings has been ratified by only one country, and seven Member States have not signed it.
There are problems with commitments being honoured.
In one Member State the crime of trafficking is only punishable by a fine; in another country it is not possible to prosecute trafficking in children who are then forced to beg, as begging per se is not considered a crime; in other countries legal entities may not be prosecuted for committing such crimes.
Enforcement is also problematic in cases where Member States have all of the means available, for instance through labour law and the existence of labour inspectorates, despite which human trafficking still occurs.
Secondly, our failings in the area of prevention are no less serious.
I would like to refer to a shocking finding in a recent Unicef report, according to which as many as 30% of children in the world remain unregistered.
These children, along with those on the streets, can easily fall victim to criminals.
Thirdly, victim protection is more than just a humanitarian task.
There is convincing evidence from Europol that without victim protection we cannot count on being able to expose the well organised networks of criminals and middle men effectively.
And yet instead of protecting victims the easier option of criminalisation is often chosen.
Fourthly, it is obvious that an effective struggle against trafficking calls for enhanced cooperation between the Member States and Europol, Eurojust, Frontex, Unicef and other international organisations, including NGOs.
A unified method of identifying victims and a unified definition of the underlying crime would greatly help towards a better understanding of new developments and of the overall scale of the problem.
For now, we can work only with estimates that are regarded as totally unreliable by experts in the field.
For now, the criminals will continue to have a head start on the law enforcement agencies.
In conclusion I would like to thank my colleagues who have contributed to improving the report.
I would also like to express my agreement with an observation made some time ago by Helga Konrad, formerly OCSE special representative on trafficking in human beings.
The trafficking problem is at a crossroads; we know a lot about it, but there are doubts as to whether we also want to take action.
Many of us are of the opinion that the time has come for resolute action in combating this particularly serious, dangerous and shameful crime.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this very important report.
The European policy against trafficking in human beings is a priority not only for this Parliament but also for the European Commission and myself.
There is a need for further and more effective action to fight trafficking.
Even though many initiatives have been taken at national and international level, the results are not comparable to the enormous scale of the criminal phenomenon.
The European action plan approved, as you will remember, last December, is the framework for practical action aimed at tackling all aspects of trafficking.
I should like to stress some priorities that, in my view, are necessary.
First, for the Member States, it is essential that they accelerate the application of Directive 2004/81/EC on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal migration and who cooperate with the competent authorities.
It concerns, in particular, assistance and social reintegration measures, the reflection period and the issuing of the residence permit to victims of trafficking, taking into account also the Council of Europe Convention of 2005.
In this regard, it is important to point out that the reflection period and assistance measures are granted to victims irrespective of their willingness or capacity to cooperate with the law enforcement authorities and that, after the issuing of the residence permits, victims have access to the labour market, vocational training and education.
What is the situation so far?
Unfortunately, it is very disappointing.
So far only two Member States have transposed the European directive and only six other notifications of initiatives to transpose have been examined by the European Commission.
There have been no notifications at all from 12 Member States.
As you know, the transposition deadline expired on 6 August 2006 and I have therefore decided to start infringement procedures against all Member States that have not yet transposed this very important EU directive.
Concerning assistance and social reintegration, the need for close cooperation on a regular basis between public authorities, including law enforcement authorities, and NGOs must also be stressed.
I believe it is very important to have close and permanent cooperation between public authorities and the private sector on protecting and reintegrating victims.
Concerning investigations, following the initiatives taken by Europol, international police cooperation between Member States' special units should be enhanced.
I am promoting and encouraging better and closer cooperation between all the specialised national units dealing with countering trafficking in human beings.
However, on this point, there is a consideration I should like to submit to you.
With regard to prosecution I note, with disappointment, that very often charges against criminals exploiting victims of trafficking - for example for sexual reasons - are very weak, focusing only on the simple exploitation of prostitution instead of on the very real charge, which should be the reduction of victims to slavery conditions.
It is up to the prosecutors to decide charges, but I really hope that magistrates and judges will now take a much tougher line than in the past.
That is the real situation.
There are also priorities for the European Commission.
I have decided to set up an expert group on trafficking in human beings.
That group of experts will deal specifically with indicators and criteria in order to identify different forms of trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation.
In the same context, at the beginning of 2007 I shall propose European legislation on sanctioning employers who exploit illegal workers, whose working conditions are sometimes akin to slavery.
Concerning trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, we shall shortly be producing a questionnaire aimed at evaluating, inter alia, the possible impact of new legislation criminalising the use of sexual services in the knowledge that the person concerned is a victim of trafficking.
I am therefore keeping my promise to you about this questionnaire.
Furthermore, the root causes of trafficking must be addressed, including poverty, lack of job opportunities, gender violence and gender discrimination.
My departments will shortly be hosting an inter-departmental seminar on this issue, precisely to focus on the main problems that are emerging.
One last important point is awareness-raising.
The Commission is supporting the designation of an anti-trafficking day, possibly on 11 June.
That initiative aims at increasing the visibility of the problems connected with trafficking and the measures taken to counteract trafficking itself.
It will call for cooperation from public institutions and civil society and evaluate the quality and the results of all the actions that are under way.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Mr President, I should begin by congratulating the Commissioner on his very positive speech, and on everything he is doing in this area.
He is serious about making a difference in combating trafficking, and that needs to be recognised.
I also want to congratulate Mrs Bauer on her report.
It has not been an easy report to put together, as various opinions from a number of different committees have had to be incorporated into the final version.
I was responsible for the Committee on Foreign Affairs' opinion on human trafficking, which concentrated specifically on the external relations aspects of this problem.
A large number of paragraphs and recommendations from my opinion have been incorporated into the text of the report and I thank Mrs Bauer for her cooperation in that regard.
I wanted this evening to comment primarily on foreign relations issues.
The report stresses the need for Member States to sign up to international conventions, ensuring a positive obligation on countries to address issues relating to trafficking.
The Irish Government, for example, has not ratified the UN Convention against transnational organised crime and the protocol to that Convention to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking.
This anti-trafficking convention and protocol have been ratified by 121 States across the world, including most European countries, but seven EU Member States are still to ratify, which is unacceptable.
The report also urges EU Member States to implement the Council Directive on residence permits so that the option of temporary residence can be granted to victims of trafficking.
This is absolutely necessary in order to shift the focus away from viewing trafficked people as illegal immigrants and towards treating them as victims of abuse.
It will also encourage victims to come forward to the police by assuring them of compassionate and fair treatment.
One of the core elements of the Committee on Foreign Affairs' opinion is that the Council and the Commission should regularly raise the issue of human trafficking in political dialogues with third countries.
The human rights clauses written into EU agreements with those countries should be used, where appropriate, to raise concerns on trafficking.
There is clear evidence in various regions of the globe that pressure from governments, international organisations and NGOs is starting to have an effect on attitudes towards trafficking.
The EU has a responsibility to raise the profile, by all available means, of the continuing scandal of what amounts to modern-day slavery.
Europe needs to set an example if it is to insist on other parts of the world following its lead.
I am not satisfied - and this was confirmed to me by the Commissioner's remarks - that EU Governments are serious about this issue.
That has to change, and this report is a step in the right direction.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done on this report.
As has been said, I drafted the opinion for the Committee on Employment, where we focused on those people who were effectively trafficked for labour purposes.
Indeed, one of the things I welcome in this report is its recognition of the wide variety of reasons for people being trafficked.
My committee particularly welcomes the human rights-based approach of the integrated action plan, and recognises that this requires an emphasis, as the Commissioner said, on the forced labour or services, slavery and slavery-like outcomes of trafficking.
We have seen evidence of these slavery-like outcomes only too recently, in the shape of workers who have no choice of when, where or how they work.
They have no rights.
Their accommodation is tied.
They may find themselves beaten, deprived of any medical treatment, deprived of water in high temperatures, and sometimes, as was the case in Morecombe Bay in the UK, they are left to die.
When looking at the causes, the committee also examined the issue of demand and considered that the demand for low-cost, undocumented and docile workers in the European Union contributes to the illegal trade of trafficking in human beings.
It believes that the existence of such a workforce may drive down costs but that this is at the expense of human dignity and an undermining of labour standards, health and safety measures and fair pay and of local and/or state income, through a failure to pay taxes and social contributions.
We welcome the view expressed in this report that we should be looking, for example, at the dubious employment agencies that apply both for EU nationals and third country nationals, and which have become a front for these slavery-like outcomes.
We believe that there is a need to apply existing labour law and to network the information from labour inspectorates to bring it within the sphere of police intelligence so that we can stop or disrupt trafficking.
We also consider training to be an important dimension of that for those inspectorates.
We recognise the importance of good company practice where compliance is genuinely sought all the way down the line, and we also recognise the valuable work of networks, trade unions and reputable companies in helping to prevent trafficking and deal with the victims.
On a personal note, I very much welcome the action the Commissioner has said he intends to take on the issue of temporary residence permits.
I deeply regret the action of my own Member State, for example, which views victims, as Mr Coveney said, predominantly as illegal migrants rather than as victims.
The police tell us that those who are deported are often retrafficked around and around in a vicious circle, rather than being seen as vulnerable individuals, or indeed as potential sources of information.
I very much welcome what the Commissioner has said, and the report, and look forward to this being followed up with very strong action.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - This report is the result of enhanced cooperation, pursuant to Rule 47, between two committees, LIBE and FEMM.
I am therefore partly responsible for this report, specifically the parts dealing with trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation.
Seventeen years: that is the age of the typical victim of trafficking in Europe.
She is a young girl ending up in a brothel or in a so-called escort service in Germany, Austria or the Netherlands.
Seventeen years: that is the same length of time that this Parliament has been debating and producing papers on the issue of trafficking.
People say that we should stick to what we have been doing in this Parliament until now. But I say we have to stop the wishful thinking and the empty talk and resolutions and start dealing with this issue in a practical way.
First, we have to identify the enemy.
It is organised crime.
While we have been talking, they have changed their agenda from weapons and drugs to the more profitable buying and selling of human beings for the sex industry.
We are talking commodities. We are talking merchandise.
We are talking regular markets where naked young girls are sold to the highest bidder.
We are talking about girls who are sold at the age of 17 and at the age of 20 are worthless and thrown aside.
I have met them and listened to unbelievable horrors of being raped 14 times a day.
Do we want to end this, or do we just want to go on talking?
This organised crime industry feeds on the demands of ordinary men who believe they have a right to buy the body of a young girl as cheaply as possible.
Some people say trafficking in women and girls for sexual exploitation is already a crime, while prostitution is merely a matter of consenting adults making a business transaction. But more than 90% of the girls in the sex industry in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, where prostitution is legal, are from abroad.
How can you know that this girl is doing it of her own free will?
How can you be sure she is not smiling only because she knows someone will threaten her family back home if she does not comply?
If you see this as just another job, how come you would not want your daughter to do it?
Or your own wife?
The demand from men to buy sex is also a driving force in the trafficking business.
If you agree with me that we need to really do something about trafficking, please join me in voting against Amendments 23, 24 and 25 tomorrow.
Commissioner Frattini, I am very grateful for your work, but we are still awaiting the study on how the laws on prostitution in Europe affect the number of trafficking victims.
That is needed if we are to find the best practice.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Trafficking in human beings is a modern version of slavery.
It is not a recent phenomenon.
It has been growing in recent years and has reached alarming levels.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that there are some 2.5 million people in forced labour throughout the world.
This is already the third most lucrative form of trafficking, after drugs and arms.
It manifests itself in the form of sexual exploitation, as previous speakers have mentioned, as well as abusive working conditions, forced domestic labour, illegal adoption, forced begging and the sale of organs.
Fighting the trafficking in human beings is therefore one of the major priorities at both Community and international level.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to commend Mrs Bauer on her excellent report.
We agree that there needs to be a coherent European policy on fighting the trafficking in human beings effectively, one that covers all aspects of the issue, including questions relating to countries of origin, transit and destination, people who recruit and exploit and other middlemen, customers and beneficiaries.
Victims and witnesses must be protected, and prevention strategies must be put forward.
Trafficking in human beings is unacceptable and legal loopholes must not be allowed to facilitate it.
The law needs to be clear and far-reaching, and must be implemented and correctly enforced by all Member States.
There needs to be a legal platform acting as a basis for stepping up international cooperation, and I am appalled that it has taken such a long time to ratify and implement various international instruments, such as UN conventions.
I would call on the Member States that have yet to do so to take the necessary measures at the earliest opportunity.
In this connection, let me commend Mr Frattini for his remarks in the Chamber today regarding penalising those Member States that are late in adopting the transposed Community directives.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking Mrs Bauer for her sterling report and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for its constructive cooperation and for its enhanced cooperation with the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
I also want to thank Commissioner Frattini.
During the two and a half years that I have sat in the European Parliament, the issue of trafficking in human beings has assumed a prominent place on the political agenda, not only in the European Parliament but also in the Member States and among Europeans.
That is a good beginning.
I am very pleased that we are united in condemning people trafficking, as we were in condemning it in the context of the football World Cup.
I welcome the fact that we are now also including other aspects of people trafficking and that we are agreed that what we are talking about in this case is a modern slave trade, at least 80% of whose victims are women and children.
What worries me is the lack of analysis of what happens to the women and children once they have actually reached the EU.
It does not help to be outraged by cross-border trafficking if one does not see, or does not want to talk about, what happens subsequently in the EU.
Those who purchase sexual services buy women and children indiscriminately in an equally indiscriminate EU market.
Whenever I have met trafficked women, they have said that they have been bought and that they have been sold into prostitution and marketed to clients in a great many EU countries day in, day out, all year round.
This has been possible because we, here in the EU, still do not dare to talk about those women and children who are here right now.
It is time to change attitudes.
The next step is for us to obtain more knowledge.
The fact that 50% of those sold into prostitution are children is scandalous.
We should be ashamed of ourselves every day for not doing more, because we in the EU have a responsibility for children's rights.
I am proud to tell you that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are agreed as to how we want to move forward.
We wish to set targets, carry out studies and become better informed.
We shall then perhaps be able to agree on what is required in the short and long terms.
If you other political groups want to know what we are doing, I can tell you that we are preparing the way for a debate on various possible ways of putting an end to people trafficking in Member States, for example through the legalisation of prostitution or, as in Sweden, through a law prohibiting the purchase of sexual services.
Why is the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats afraid of university studies?
That is something I should like to know.
Merely to be opposed to people trafficking this evening is simply to say that we in the European Parliament are concerned about the matter.
We are, however, putting our heads, ostrich-like, in the sand and not assuming responsibility for what is happening to all those women and children who are being exploited here and now.
Many people say that we in the EU do little but talk when we should be setting practical targets.
The PSE Group and I therefore want us to set the EU a target whereby it is to halve the number of people exposed to people trafficking within ten years.
The PSE Group also supports Amendments 1 to 22 and recital P. We shall abstain in the vote on recital O because we are not adopting a position either in favour of, or against, an individual investigation.
On Amendment 25, we shall each vote in our own way.
I shall vote in favour of paragraph 1(al) and against Amendment 25, and this on the basis of my political experience of the view taken of the sex trade and prostitution in Sweden.
What is most important now is to pursue the 50% reduction in people trafficking and to implement the planned investigation in the EU in 2007.
