Mr President, three preliminary matters.
First of all, those of us who were there are aware of the positive role of the European Union, which, it is true, was the driving force behind what took place.
Secondly, the negative role of the United States, which, for example, put pressure on the countries it could pressurise - and I am afraid the number of such countries will soon be excessive - to prevent an agreement on renewable energy from being concluded.
Thirdly, our group - a delegation of eleven Members - attended the official summit, the alternative summit and visited two townships - called Soweto and Alexandra - and was able to see for itself what it means to be without water or sanitation, and with only very precarious housing.
Commissioners, I have to admit that, having visited these two townships, the debates that took place at the official summit seemed to me to be a long way away from the reality that was so close to the official summit, so safe and so luxurious.
This is a feeling I have to express and I therefore share the critical spirit of the resolution of the Committee on the Environment, which points out very clearly that, in matters such as the protection of biodiversity, in matters such as renewable energy, there are no clear, concrete objectives.
And in those areas where there are more concrete objectives, such as the reduction of poverty, the economic objectives are still not clear.
In other words, the summit did not discuss an objective which has been in the public domain for over thirty years: 0.7% aid to development.
And aid to development is constantly decreasing instead of increasing.
Other considerations are nothing but hollow words if this 0.7% aid to development is not implemented.
Despite the fact that we criticise the result of the Johannesburg Summit, it is true - and in this I agree with the committee and the rest of my fellow Members - that we need to follow up the minimum agreements to ensure that they are fulfilled.
Mr President, I listened carefully to the two Commissioners emphasise the positive role played by the European Union during the negotiations at the Johannesburg Summit.
I think that it is true that the European Union played a positive role.
I would like to draw everyone's attention to the fact that if we really want to make progress at this type of summit, we must be credible to the partners who take part in negotiations and discussions.
In this case, however, our credibility is marred by the fact that the European Union, in a whole string of policies, is doing the opposite of what it claims to want to do.
If we take the case of the common agricultural policy, the current debate on Mr Fischler's proposals shows that the majority of the Member States are reluctant to change, are reluctant to abandon the privileges that we acquired in the area of export subsidies.
We absolutely must make an effort in this area to withdraw export subsidies and to gain this credibility in countries which are affected by these subsidies.
If we do not do this, how can we ensure that, at summits of this type, these people listen to us slightly more earnestly than they do at the moment?
They are not listening to us, because we are not credible.
I am thinking of the agricultural policy, of the fisheries policy, which we are proposing to reform as well.
The future will tell us that if we are not capable of revising these policies, in the appropriate fashion, we will not succeed in gaining more influence at forthcoming summits, because the Johannesburg Summit is not the only one, there will be many others.
It is absolutely essential that we put our own house in order before we tell others what to do.
Mr President, in my opinion, the wording of items 6 and 7 on the CAP and the agricultural subsidies demonstrates three major political mistakes.
The first is a total ignorance of the declaration signed in Doha, where the European Union agreed to reduce its export subsidies, but managed to insist that all other types of subsidies, specifically the credits handed out by the United States of America and the state undertakings of other countries, should also be reduced.
And this is a major victory for the European Union to have achieved.
The second reason is that this wording reveals a completely ingenuous analysis, which states that a unilateral reduction of subsidies by the European Union could solve the problems.
Especially at a time when the United States has just approved an agricultural policy in which they increase their subsidies and especially when it is widely known that this new American policy is heightening the depression in world prices.
This way of thinking is all the more ingenuous because the USA is the largest exporter of agricultural products to the Developing World, and not only to the European Union.
The third reason is this declaration's incomprehensible silence on the European Union initiative known as 'everything but arms', which is to date the largest, most relevant and generous offer made by the developed countries to the world's poorest countries.
And the fact that this has been ignored and not mentioned is incomprehensible.
In other words, we are not valuing our own efforts.
All these reasons, therefore, explain why the wording of items 6 and 7 in this declaration on agriculture is known in politics as 'shooting oneself in the foot': this weakens the European Union, this European Union that has until now been the most powerful force promoting the interests of the poorest countries.
This is why it is crucial, in tomorrow's voting time, to remedy these aspects.
Mr President, politics works in such a way that, after each international meeting, we spend more time talking about the results that are, apparently, still unsatisfactory than about the actual progress that was made.
This is what happened after Rio, this is what happened after Kyoto, even though, in the meantime, Rio and Kyoto became undeniable milestones in the area of sustainable development.
The concept of sustainable development has become a chant, a sort of enchanted prayer that is uttered indiscriminately.
In my view, it is obvious that there can be no sustainable development without economic and social development - it is as simple as that.
Poverty is the major enemy to managing natural resources and protecting the environment in a responsible manner.
Responsible globalisation must become the process of a global economic development that makes genuine global solidarity possible.
State development aid is not sufficient, even if we manage to double or triple it.
USD 50 billion of state aid is not much.
Americans spend the same amount of money on the upkeep of their lawns!
In 2001, a year that did not bode well for international investment, private investment flows towards developing countries amounted to over USD 200 billion, in other words already four times more than the total state aid.
For private investment to reach all countries, we must, as a necessity, negotiate a multilateral agreement on investment protection, which involves creating international arbitration bodies responsible for resolving disputes.
No private investor - no ethical investment fund, even - will invest any money without guarantees and without the prospect of a return.
In the absence of any multilateral rules, there will be an avalanche of bilateral agreements.
There are already more than 1 200!
Yet, in all bilateral agreements, it is not the poorest partner who dictates the conditions.
Sustainable development needs global standards, and these standards are also needed for investments and for their protection.
Mr President, I would say that the outcome of the Johannesburg Earth Summit has been neither positive nor negative. It may suffice to say that it was a necessary, useful meeting, although the optimism of Rio, 10 years ago, has given way to a certain diffidence with regard to the time frames and to the goals to be achieved.
The endorsement of both a Plan of Implementation - focusing, inter alia, on poverty reduction, health, technology transfer and trade - and the political declaration setting forth an international commitment to work together to improve the use and distribution of natural and energy resources provides an ambitious goal for both developed and developing countries in terms of restoring the balance in North-South relations in the world and achieving sustainability of development and progress policies.
I do, however, hope that the conference was more than just a parade of Heads of State or Government and that it made clear the need for issues related to sustainable development to be given a central place in the international political agenda.
Johannesburg revealed precisely the need for supranational governance which can tackle the world's many environmental, economic and social issues, focusing particularly on the poor and developing countries.
The poor and developing countries' debt is, without a doubt, a key issue too, impacting considerably on the success of the strategy for medium- and long-term sustainable development.
In this regard, the issue of transparency, to be achieved through the computerisation of the budgets of the developing countries, is an essential condition if we are to continue along the path of cancelling past debts.
Mr President, I shall focus on the European programme on climate change.
I fully and wholeheartedly agree with everything Mrs Anneli HulthÃ©n has to say on this matter, but I do miss one aspect, namely communication with the citizen.
Since the recent floods, the seriousness of any potential climate change is starting to strike home, but few are aware, let alone convinced, of the need for action.
I would suggest three points that could facilitate communication with the citizen.
First of all, I believe that the citizen must be given clear choices.
Although Member States play an important role in this, the Commission can do a great deal to clarify the options.
What is the implication, for example, of reducing the maximum speed on motorways to 100 km/hour?
How much do we stand to gain?
What does it mean if each house were to be fitted with a solar panel or use low-energy light bulbs?
Are these merely drops in the ocean or do they make a substantial contribution?
If the choices were clear, then citizens could become involved in the subject of climate.
Policy on climate could then also become integrated in a climate strategy.
Secondly, policy on climate should be placed much more in the context of development.
Investing in sustainable energy is costly, but rewarding.
At present, 2 billion people have no access to electricity.
Sustainable energy is local and can give an enormous boost to development.
We should not only send out this message in Johannesburg, but also in Brussels and Strasbourg, and preferably every day.
Thirdly, a flagship is what is needed.
Member States must invest jointly in the development of sustainable energy and energy efficiency.
Something along the lines of the Airbus project.
The Sixth Framework Programme for research and Article 169 offer good opportunities in this area.
A flagship project is visible to the citizens and can play a key role in public awareness.
Commissioner, in my view, there could be a little more enthusiasm for policy on climate.
To date, we have mainly sent out a negative signal and a sombre message.
More attention to communication and the political aspects could contribute to public involvement.
Mr President, I have just had this confirmed to me by various Fisheries Ministers meeting at Reykjavik in Iceland. These Fisheries Ministers came from the USA, Chile, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, the Faeroes, Norway, and so on.
They say unanimously that Johannesburg is on the right track with this decision.
Rarely enough are there real political decisions. Everyone prefers to rush to coat their personal or national egoisms with a veneer of sanctity, particularly when the eyes of world public opinion are upon them.
This time, though, there was a real decision on sustainability and on the fisheries sector, which has undergone such a severe battering.
This agreement on a point of principle was achieved very quickly.
It sends the message that there is nothing more to be discussed, and that now is the time to act.
That is Johannesburg's appeal to the world.
It is also addressed to us who have Europe for our home and sit in this Parliament.
The reform of European fisheries policy simply will not wait.
It is of great intrinsic value and must not be used to gain advantages in other policy fields by being a pawn in negotiating tactics and games that it is all too easy to see through.
That is what is also called meeting each other halfway at the expense of fisheries.
Johannesburg was unerring in recognising that.
Fish stocks are to recover by 2015. Now we have to get a move on.
I hope this will be one of our successes - one of the successes of the European Union within the framework of a reform that is imminent and can be delayed no longer.
Mr President, Commissioners you will be beginning to find our speeches repetitive.
Great: in a multi-national and cross-party body, that means our message will get through.
We all agree, for example, that energy is the largest contributor by far to the emission of greenhouse gases.
Some of us think that nuclear energy is expensive, outdated, potentially dangerous and no solution at all to energy problems.
But we all agree that transport is the key energy problem: fossil fuels must be replaced by alternatives, and very soon.
How?
We agree that renewable energy and energy efficiency are key solutions.
This was recognised in Johannesburg, but unfortunately, only to a limited extent.
However, we should act quickly on this through the EU.
Remember that the key role of energy in poverty alleviation was recognised at Johannesburg, and that the new EU programme, COOPENER, on renewable energy and energy efficiency in the developing world, will help to access some of the funding which will be available, this programme is important.
There is, incidentally, a very strong gender implication to the provision of energy, because of the tasks of women throughout the developing world.
The failure to achieve targets for renewable energy - a failure for which the United States, to their shame, are largely responsible - can be overcome with goodwill and effort from the European Union.
On the matter of implementation: Carrying suitcases from summit to summit does nothing.
It is what happens in between the summits that matters, and I urge you, Commissioners, to use your legislative powers and your monitoring ability to ensure that what was said at Johannesburg, even if it is not enough, is carried through.
Mr President, I was one of the Members who attended the summit in Johannesburg and was fortunate enough to meet some of the thousands who went there from all over the world to focus attention on the need for people-centred policies.
We heard over and over again that the summit had to change the lives of the poorest people in the world if it was to be a success.
We did not expect dramatic changes and we did not get them, but there was some modest progress.
For example we saw a move towards achieving better governance.
I hope that this Parliament will actively support universal membership of the UNEP for environment ministers.
This could be the starting point for a world environment organisation.
This brings us to the central question of enforcement and monitoring.
We know from experience since Rio that it is one thing to make agreements but another to ensure they are implemented.
We welcome the possibility at last of bringing the Kyoto Protocol into force, but it has been a long and difficult process.
How will progress from Johannesburg onwards be achieved? It is not clear.
Although the Johannesburg Declaration includes a commitment to an inclusive process, which means involving the kinds of groups that met around the summit, how is this going to be done?
Similarly the regional and local level are important.
We know how the private sector is going to be involved, but how will different levels of government be involved?
Finally, I welcome the fact that the efforts to include biotechnology as an intrinsic part of sustainability were resisted in Johannesburg, despite the efforts of the United States. At the very time when the summit was going on to use a human crisis to try and force GM food aid on some of the world's poorest countries.
This takes away freedom of choice, undermines human dignity and works against sustainability.
We must continue to resist it.
Mr President, Commissioners, if we are critical of the results of the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development, it is because we were in fact expecting much more.
We are aware of the critical situation of the planet, the deterioration, the pollution, the lack of natural resources, and the extreme poverty of a large part of the population which means that these people live and die in inhuman conditions, and are forced to emigrate to other parts of the world where these conditions do not exist.
And, although it is true that there have been agreements, it is also true that it has not been possible to conclude many other agreements.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, you said it was time to turn our words into actions, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations also said this, using other words, but just as forcefully.
This, however, was not possible and despite the good will of the European institutions, the problem of reaching the agreements that were supposed to have been the minimum basis for solving the serious problems we have in this world was not solved.
I believe that the Commissioner is right to say that frustration should not mean that we politicians stop making ambitious proposals.
Frustration should make us far more ambitious and, even if only by means of voluntary agreements, we in the European institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must move forward with all these proposals - many more than those on the table - because, in fact, the maintenance of living conditions in the world might depend on the example we set here in the European Union, where we do have that political will.
If we - each and every country - show this will and this commitment to agreements, programmes, dates - not with words but with actions - the agreements that are currently still voluntary could be extended to other countries and in ten years European good practice could mean that in future Johannesburg will not be what it is today.
Mr President, Commissioners, I am reminded of the optimism caricatured by the French philosopher Voltaire in the person of Pangloss, which, in fact, derives from the philosophy of the German philosopher Leibniz, according to which 'everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds'.
If Voltaire were to return here, however, he would also draw a caricature, certainly a very impressive one, of those that today think that everything is for the worst in the worst of all possible worlds.
This almost phantasmagoric pessimism that affects many commentators, many politicians and many Members of this House is unjustified.
It is unjustified because at the Johannesburg Summit, as I see it, indication was given of the right way forwards, the correct diagnosis was made, and the European Union acted correctly at the summit, and we should be congratulating it on this instead of being constantly critical.
The summit pointed in the right direction but we must also take account of the fact that the rich countries are going to have to pay for the policies that were outlined in Johannesburg and that control mechanisms must be established to ensure, as has already been said, that words are translated into action.
I would also say that the Johannesburg Summit served to reveal some of our fears and weaknesses in analysing the world's problems.
I wish to highlight only one of these, if I may, which is the issue of birth control and the world's population.
It makes no sense that this problem should not be addressed because we fear religious dogma, the type of dogma that Voltaire condemned, or because we fear being considered Malthusian.
We all know that it is precisely where the population grows at a faster pace that we see more poverty and more degradation of nature.
And, therefore, this issue of birth control, of the global regulation of the world's population cannot be ignored in any discussion about the survival of the earth and about a more humane life for human beings.
We now come to the speakers from the political groups.
The good news is that I can be flexible in terms of timings: speaking time can be extended if the speakers so wish.
Mr President, the previous speaker referred to Voltaire.
Let me refer to a Danish author, Hans Christian Andersen, who wrote a story that many of us have read, The Emperor's New Clothes.
Sometimes I feel that the debate we are holding is a little reminiscent of this very story.
Everyone can see that the emperor is naked, but we will not, dare not, actually say so.
I am therefore one of those who cannot in any way see the Johannesburg Summit as a success.
I think that it was good that the meeting was held, that a large number of contacts were made and that a number of good decisions were taken.
Given the problems we face on this small planet; poverty which continues to spread rapidly, the spread of infectious diseases, the many environmental problems and, especially, the tremendously rapid development in technology in many areas, some form of regulatory framework is required if it is to work well.
What we arrived at in Johannesburg is not sufficient.
Unfortunately, I am afraid that we will meet here again in five or ten years and that we will then see that a great many of the problems that have quite rightly been identified in connection with Johannesburg will have become worse.
Let me raise an issue where I think that the final result from Johannesburg leaves a great deal to be desired.
As early as 1992 in Rio de Janeiro it was seen that current patterns of production and consumption are not working in a world with seven to eight billion people.
At the same time, everyone wants the poor countries to develop.
It is therefore obvious that production and consumption must change.
What I had hoped for from Johannesburg was a real commitment from the rich countries to assist with the modernisation of patterns of production and consumption in the poor countries.
This applies to energy production, which is now expanding very rapidly, this applies to transport, it applies to chemicals, waste handling, agriculture and water.
Every year, countries like China, India, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil invest hundreds of billons of US dollars or more in new energy production.
Most of this is carbon technology.
We have a self-interest in helping out with favourable loans, with subsidies and with technical cooperation in order to actually ensure that the required energy development also occurs in an environmentally friendly and efficient manner.
Unfortunately we do not have the instruments.
I welcome the initiatives that the Commission took on Sustainable Energy.
I think that this was very good, especially in the light of the Commission's previous doubts about making vigorous efforts in this area.
I will gladly contribute towards working out the details, but this is a very limited measure compared with the great needs that exist.
I consider that we need efforts of a completely different magnitude.
It seems as if we have realised this too late.
In a few years, we will undoubtedly increase resources in this context, but they are required now.
Let me conclude by stating that perhaps we simply have too great a level of expectation from this type of international cooperation.
I think that Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m made a very true remark in the days after the Johannesburg Summit.
She said 'that it is possible that we must find other ways, that we must identify countries that want to go further, including hopefully the European Union'.
We should perhaps create partnerships with companies that want to progress further and faster, with popular movements, with researchers and so on, so that we can achieve greater speed in some of the areas where the situation is particularly critical.
We simply do not have any political system at the international level that is a match for the development that is now occurring, where so many problems of different types require common rules.
I look forward to initiatives from the Commission in these areas.
I would ask the Commission in each individual case to involve Parliament at an earlier stage.
As regards the initiatives that the Commission took in the areas of water and energy, we have never had an opportunity to present any opinions, something which is somewhat frustrating considering that there is indisputable commitment and interest in these areas.
Mr President, I would like right away to enlarge on Mr Wijkman's analogy with Hans Christian Andersen's story of the king's new clothes.
I do think that there are enough Members of this House, who, on finding the king totally naked, would say so out loud in the plenary.
I believe it is very difficult to assess either the role of the European Union or the results of the Johannesburg Summit.
None of us is satisfied with the results.
We would, in various areas, have preferred results that went further.
I would, though, like to say that I see the European Union's - Europe's - role as having been a good one and one that was also well coordinated.
It should also be said at this juncture that, on the most important demands, coordination between the European Union and the candidate countries worked.
I am of course not satisfied with the Commission's attitude towards us, or with the information policy.
I want to address Commissioner Nielson directly in saying that we did not expect all our demands to be met, but it is sometimes the case that the tone is what matters in music, and at times our side was dissatisfied with the way the parliamentarians were negotiated with or spoken to.
I took part in this delegation as a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and one of the major topics in Johannesburg was of course the way in which development is financed.
It was also clear that we will not go back to the way things were before Monterrey.
One generally wonders whether it makes sense to stage UN summits of this sort at short intervals and then end up with little substance to the agenda at a summit on sustainability.
That, though, is the responsibility not of the Commission, or of Parliament, but of the United Nations.
The question I want to put to the Commission is a very straightforward one: how will we monitor the Monterrey undertaking to allocate an average of 0.39% of gross domestic product to development cooperation with effect from 2006?
Will Parliament receive reports on development?
I am from Austria, and on this point I am less than proud of my own country, which is among those at the bottom of the league as regards support for development cooperation.
Now for the actual question. I know that you cannot draw up the national budgets, but what form will follow-up take, including as regards Parliament?
Something I found quite absent from Johannesburg was the issue of population growth and that of reproductive health.
I found the formulations in the final text to be woolly, to say the least.
There is reference in them to health and to mothers, but not to reproductive health, which, along with family planning, I believe to be essential issues in sustainable development.
I would, however, like to express my gratitude for the clear position that the European Union has taken up on these issues.
We know that America, with the fundamentalist states, has stood in the way of progress of every kind and that the requirements of the Cairo Action Programme on reproductive health are far from being complied with.
Mr President, Parliament's task is, in the first place, to monitor the Commission and, in general, the Council's and Commission's achievements in Johannesburg.
I think that this debate demonstrates that we can be rather positive about the role Europe played.
In my view, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m was right in saying that the European Union was the driving force behind the Johannesburg Summit.
As far as I can see, though, the results of Johannesburg are too insubstantial, but this is actually more despite rather than thanks to the EU's efforts.
I believe we can be pleased about the role we ourselves played on that forum.
Nevertheless, the outcome of Johannesburg is, broadly speaking, too insubstantial.
In not one single area have verifiable and firm goals been established, and sanctions pertaining to the infringement of the already weak goals are completely lacking.
I believe that this is because these goals were too abstract.
Everyone is in favour of cleaner water, less poverty and more education, but in my view, the Heads of State or Government should have directed their energy more towards achievable and concrete projects.
The Rio Summit had already taught us that concluding agreements that cannot be enforced is an empty exercise.
Despite this, some positive results have been achieved which have been mentioned in this debate.
I should particularly like to single out progress in the field of cleaner water, hygiene and the prevention of diseases.
These elements are, of course, of crucial importance, particularly for the poorer sections of the world's population.
Another positive development is what has finally been said in the documents on fisheries and on energy, although concerning the latter, these documents could have easily been a bit more constructive in the chapters on wind and solar energy and hydropower.
Anyway, this too is something which causes no problems in the EU but has run into major problems elsewhere.
These texts are upbeat, even the introduction in the text on agriculture and relevant subsidies is upbeat, in my view.
It is not, however, the EU that we have to thank for this, of course.
Quite the reverse, in fact; the EU could have been a little more accommodating on this front.
Anyway, we are all familiar with the internal situation.
It is a matter on which we need to reach a better position internally the sooner the better.
Agriculture still remains a weak point for all of us in those international negotiations, and this is something we only have ourselves to thank for and which requires our involvement.
It is also related to the issue of environmentally harmful subsidies, something that we know Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m wishes to address in the EU.
It is a matter related to agriculture, but also to all kinds of other subsidies that we provide in the EU, as this is also done worldwide.
The fact that we made little progress in this area in Johannesburg should serve as an incentive to address it within the EU and outside it as a matter of priority.
I should like to finish off with a comment on the role of Parliament's delegation.
I did not intend to mention this at first, but since the matter has now been brought into the open in such a manifest way, I should like to say a few words.
This delegation was, incidentally, excellently led by our fellow MEP Mr Moreira da Silva.
I should like to express gratitude on behalf of our group for the way in which he acquitted himself of this task.
I should also like to thank the Danish Presidency.
We - at any rate those of my group who attended the Johannesburg Summit - were delighted with the communication at the summit.
I am, however, somewhat surprised about the comments by Commissioner Nielson on this score.
I can understand that it is disagreeable to be monitored by troublesome MEPs, but it is still necessary for us to join forces more effectively at times like these.
We must create a wider support.
I think that the MEPs who attended the summit had a positive attitude and that better cooperation and communication benefits us all.
The Commissioner struck me as somewhat acidic in his comments, and the environment is acidic enough as it is without the need for an acidic Commissioner.
I therefore hope that in future, at other conferences too - for this was not a one-off problem, but one that also plays a part elsewhere - better cooperation will be established between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Cooperation is fluid and requires a positive attitude, not only from Parliament, but also from the other institutions, and this will eventually benefit us all.
Mr President, with all due respect to the Commission and the Council, the judgments we are making here in the European Parliament are being made on the basis of resolutions which we passed before Johannesburg.
We passed our resolutions and we held our debate and, that being so, I have no desire to challenge all the positive points we have managed to find in Johannesburg or what Mrs WallstrÃ¶m has said or what the honourable Members who were in Johannesburg have said.
I shall not reiterate them, just as I shall refrain from reiterating the negative points, the specifics, aid, renewable sources of energy etc., issues which my honourable friends have already raised.
I should like, if I may, to comment on two or three other points which perhaps received too little attention.
We said before Johannesburg that we need to strike a balance between development and trade on the one hand and environmental protection on the other.
This balance was not struck.
The Johannesburg text is full of references, reservations and provisos, just to make sure we keep our hands off trade.
It is written with one eye on the World Trade Organisation and there is no institution with the same standing and influence as the World Trade Organisation to oppose it.
That is a fact.
It is not good, I am not saying it is fatal, but it is a fact nonetheless.
A second point we made was that we needed to incorporate the cost of environmental protection into our production and our consumption in the most practical way possible.
Instead of this, which implies certain things, it implies taxes, it implies bans, political arrangements, a whole series of topics under discussion, we have a statement to the effect that we need to change production methods and consumption patterns.
And why not?
All very ambitious and even rather literary, I think, but it does not say to what.
To me, it is totally incomprehensible, as it is to my first year economics students.
A third point we made was that we would at least try to keep to and, of course, build on and implement what was said in Rio.
For example, what has become of the principle of prevention?
Why was there a preventive approach?
What does this bode for the future?
For the policy which we, the United States and others will apply?
Why were the United States so insistent?
A fourth point we highlighted was the policy and international dimension of environmental protection and sustainable development.
Instead, nothing was done.
And with all due respect, not only was no world environment organisation set up; it was buried post haste before Johannesburg had barely started and all discussion of greater political coordination between old and new bodies, between Bretton Woods and the World Trade Organisation, for instance, with the political objective of sustainable development, was sidelined.
Why?
How are we supposed to pursue a line of thinking that says we set targets, we introduce measures, we monitor and control and we impose sanctions?
Which is the very essence of governance.
Governance means no more and no less.
Because if all it means is moralising to Developing World countries, however useful that may be, it is too little and it is highly hypocritical on our part.
I think that pretty speeches were made, with no targets, means or timetables and we need to keep an eye on that.
I suggest and request that we think hard.
Surely somehow - I think under the Rules of Procedure - the European Parliament should be able to set up an ad hoc committee to permanently monitor the application of all these pretty speeches along general lines to have come out of Johannesburg, so that we can also look at what the Commission and the spring Council bring and what is happening internationally, so that we do not just simply end up like Epimetheus, saying what we like or dislike after the event and with no monitoring on our part.
Mr President, let us not mince our words. Johannesburg was not a success.
The results were disappointing, but I am pleased that the Commission is now giving a balanced judgment rather than the overoptimistic views it expressed immediately at the end of the summit.
In our view, if the summit were to be rated according to the Dutch rating system, it would be given a four out of ten, a fail in other words.
I am bound to correct the Commission on one point, namely biodiversity.
It has not been agreed worldwide that we will put an end to the loss of biodiversity by 2010.
The only thing that has been decided is to significantly reduce the extinction of species, while only this spring, 100 ministers in The Hague called for an end to the loss of biodiversity by no later than 2010, as we have also stated at European level.
The question is, of course, why Europe has achieved so little.
Of course, it is true that the United States wanted hardly anything, but many G77 countries are also tired of unfulfilled promises. They were promised more development aid while they are, in fact, receiving less.
This is why it is logical that these G77 countries have focused on the traditional fight against poverty and for clean drinking water, sanitary facilities and energy for the poor.
This is what they got, which is a positive thing.
We must, however, search our own conscience.
Too many key players in Europe, particularly Commissioners Lamy and Nielson, saw Johannesburg only as an intermediary step between Doha and CancÃ¹n.
That is why Europe had hardly anything to offer to the G77 countries.
This is not helped by the fact that we still have not reformed our own agricultural policy and that we consider our own trade interests to be more important than sustainable development.
We have not got our own house in order in terms of agriculture, fisheries, traffic, energy and the use of materials.
I do not think that mega-summits of this kind will work any more in future.
We should move towards UN summits that address specific goals, the prime example being Kyoto.
If it is impossible to conclude a treaty at world level, Europe should at least act consistently on its own patch.
What we need, for example, is a UN treaty in which multinational businesses are required to issue a social and environmental report that is inspected by independent accountants.
We can start with this in Europe.
It is also necessary for large businesses, maybe over a 5- or 10-year period, to commit to using the same environmental standards outside Europe as they do inside.
Volkswagen is already doing this.
After all, South Africa and Namibia do not have environmental legislation, let alone any system of enforcement.
We cannot wait for a worldwide regulation in the environmental field.
Another example is deforestation.
Rio failed to produce a treaty, and so did Johannesburg, but there is something we can do in Europe.
Why does the European Commission not suggest that a clear label be introduced for timber and timber products?
A green label for sustainable timber and a red label for incorrectly produced timber.
My group would like to see us adopt an even-handed approach in trade policy.
I hope that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m will join in the preparatory meetings of CancÃ¹n and that she will be representing Europe at that summit in CancÃ¹n in a year's time, for this is the only way we can prove that we take sustainable development seriously.
Mr President, I consider sustainable development to be an expression of the task given by God to mankind to cultivate and preserve the earth.
It is essential for a balance to be struck between social, economic and environmental components.
Moreover, we should try to achieve this balance in the developed and the developing countries alike.
The Johannesburg Summit has culminated in a plan of action which mainly focuses on the economic goals and not so much on the environmental goals.
This is hardly a balance, therefore.
Ten years ago, a legal framework for climate and biodiversity was established in Rio.
The Kyoto Protocol has been drafted for climate, but ratification and implementation are still a major point of concern.
As far as biodiversity is concerned, we opted for the status quo ten years ago.
As Mr Alexander de Roo mentioned earlier, this goal has now been watered down in Johannesburg to a decelerated decline in biodiversity.
In addition, the summit did not manage to reach definite agreement on sustainable energy.
Despite great European ambitions, and it is certainly no criticism of the Commissioners, worldwide sustainable development has not been given any extra impetus.
Fortunately, there are also a number of positive elements to report, including target goals for drinking water and sanitary facilities, chemicals, fish stocks, the fight against poverty, hunger and child mortality.
As regards development aid, however, the rich nations have for the past ten years been promising that they intend to spend 0.7% of their GNP on it.
When will this happen?
I would have liked to have seen a deadline set for this.
The fight against poverty can create scope for environmental protection, for it is true that if people have no food, no housing and no clean drinking water, environmental protection is often a concern for later.
In other words, we must create a support structure for environmental protection and this is why it is our primary task to do something about the fight against poverty.
If the agreement, taken from the Johannesburg plan of action, that trade policy should not affect the development of poor countries and is taken seriously in the area of the environment, this will have far-reaching consequences for European agricultural and trade policy.
I should like to hear from both Commissioners what their views are on this.
Many people seem happy with the outcome of the UN Conference in Johannesburg on sustainable development.
Whether my grandchildren will see things in the same light 20 years from now remains to be seen.
This is a requirement, however, if we consider Mrs Brundtland's commitment to achieve a good definition of sustainable development.
The implementation of the goals will certainly need to make a contribution to this.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I believe that we are all staunch advocates of the need to improve the quality of the environment.
I am, however, convinced that we must take as a starting point the consideration that the quality of life and, in many respects, the quality of the environment in the world too are not declining, as some people would have us believe, and that we must therefore avoid any form of disaster-mongering, and I am thinking here of the - subsequently disregarded - predictions of disasters which characterised the environmentalism of the 1970s, from Stockholm to the Rome Club.
This does not, however, mean reducing our efforts to address environmental issues, which are, moreover, the items on the Johannesburg agenda.
I have two points to make in this regard. Firstly, as, moreover, has been pointed out repeatedly by Members too, I am convinced that one of the decisive factors in improving the quality of life of many peoples and, therefore, of the environment, is the need to open up markets to international trade.
I believe that the United States, the subject of much criticism in this House, is right on this point, and I feel that Europe must do more in the area of agricultural policy, agricultural protectionism and other forms of trade protectionism. We would point out that the Everything but Arms initiative of which the Commission is so proud - and it is right, in part, to be so - provides for the elimination of all agricultural duties and quotas on products such as sugar, rice and bananas imported from the poorest countries.
This is the commitment we Europeans have to make good.
Secondly, the countries which do most to protect the environment are democratic countries where human rights are respected, the countries with open economies.
The increase in development aid has been mentioned: that is all well and good, but I would point out, first and foremost to the European Commissioners and Commissioner Nielson, that much of the aid which Europe appropriates serves to fund dictatorships, non-democratic countries, countries without open economies.
In those countries, our funding does not lead to improvement of either the quality of the environment or environmental policies.
Mr President, I would like to thank you all for a good, comprehensive debate.
I would like to start by thanking Mr Moreira da Silva and Mr Maaten for their kind words concerning cooperation between the institutions of the EU in Johannesburg.
I will pass on these words to the Danish Environment Minister, who is today meeting his Chinese counterpart to discuss issues including those we are discussing here.
As you know, the EU-China Summit is being held in Copenhagen today, and consequently he is unable to be here.
Mrs Scheele wished that there had also been coordination with the candidate countries.
I have been informed that in fact there was daily consultation with the candidate countries. I, too, consider this to be of great importance.
She says that nothing about women and health was mentioned in the declaration, but I would like to draw attention to the fact that it was stated in very concrete terms that environmental threats to health are to be reduced.
This is to take place in accordance with human rights and fundamental freedoms and in conformity with national legislation and cultural and religious values.
So there is something included in that.
I have noted Mr Lange's desire for Members of Parliament to be present at the morning sessions.
I have noted it.
I cannot make any promises about that here today, but we must learn from experience and am therefore grateful for the suggestion.
Many people have touched on the issue of EU agricultural policy and there is not much that I want to add to this.
What Mr Lannoye and Mr Maaten have said cannot be disputed - that agricultural policy is a problem area when we within the EU, for our part, try to reach agreement on a more sustainable future.
I would like to mention again that at the ASEM Summits last week and this week a decision was made at the request of the Chinese to hold a preparatory conference on agricultural policy in Beijing, so that the European and Asian countries can be as well equipped as possible for the summit in CancÃºn.
So things are making progress.
At any event there will be opportunity to continue this dialogue with a number of other countries.
I noted with great interest Mrs Corbey's suggestion for increasing awareness among citizens of how they themselves can contribute, and without referring back to what was said I would like to thank Mrs Langenhagen, Mrs McNally, Mr Wijkman and many others for their committed contributions.
I have noted the literary examples that have been given: Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Emperor's New Clothes' and Voltaire's Pangloss who, whatever happens in 'Candide', thinks that all is for the best.
This is very amusing and we should always bear it in mind since, after all, Andersen and Voltaire had a keen sense of the human urge to forget the cares of the world when it suits us.
However, I think that at the end of my contribution I should be allowed to point out that the institutions of the EU did good work in Johannesburg.
As Mrs WallstrÃ¶m said, the EU was the engine behind the process.
New goals were set and existing goals were tightened up.
Certain deadlines were set.
Now it is a matter of keeping each other to them, of leading from the front and thereby being justified in making others adhere to these objectives. For as Mr Papayannakis has just said, follow-up is crucial.
Now it is a matter of follow-up.
I am looking forward to it and therefore before I hand over the floor to the commissioners I would like to thank them for the great work that they have done and will continue to do in connection with the follow-up.
May I thank the Commissioners for their cooperation in agreeing to speak at the end, rather than at the beginning of the debate.
Mr President, I shall start by carrying on exactly where Minister Haarder finished.
The Commission is looking forward to this.
As Mrs HulthÃ©n pointed out at the beginning of the debate, we are also looking forward to coming back to Parliament in February to discuss how the follow-up is to be organised.
All this is quite positive.
There is one new aspect that is very important: the water and energy initiatives are EU initiatives.
We are moving into new terrain.
It is not defined only by what the Commission does.
This is a 'Monterrey-plus' landscape, because we are about to announce and launch global EU actions, which also makes it quite interesting.
I turn to the discussion on how we view this matter - whether with complacency, or pessimism, or optimism etc. From a literary point of view it is not totally correct to say that the emperor was naked.
He was wearing some clothes, but only his night attire.
So one would be justified in asking whether he was half-naked or half-dressed.
There is no certain answer to this, just as there is no certain answer to how we should approach this area.
From the very start - even in Johannesburg when we were trying to respond to questions at press conferences - we tried to avoid using the terms 'success' or 'failure' because it was clear that this would never bring us and the people we talk with through the media close enough to something that was a professional and correct evaluation.
Again, in the course of the discussion we have tried to address the wilful pumping-up or the toning down of expectations before the meeting, which have been referred to as deliberate working methods.
This makes a lot of sense, but the truth is that with global UN meetings like this we must calibrate expectations to fit in with reality.
We are firmly in the realm of intergovernmental work.
Comparing that with what we in Europe could do if we unite is, unfortunately, not fair.
Everybody talks about the international society.
We do not have one, we are trying to create one.
That is where we are.
I am pleading for professional realism as to how we evaluate these things.
On balance, whilst progress was made, we would have preferred to have made much more progress.
However, to express dissatisfaction as Mr Turmes did when he said that we did not come back with the whole Christmas tree, complete with decorations, is an illustration of the fact that one has not allowed oneself the minimum of realism.
That is the raw material that creates results.
I wonder whether a debate like this is taking place in any other political centre in the rich North.
I doubt that the US Congress would devote a day to discussions, as we are, after Johannesburg.
It would be nice if this happened, but let me remind you that it would be an error to think that it was only because of US attitudes and resistance to multilateral agreements that these were so difficult.
It is a dangerous illusion to think that the whole G77 group is very enthusiastic about these different targets, or committing itself to a specific energy mix within a certain timeframe.
This is not how it is in reality.
The things we need to change cannot be changed easily.
Mr Moreira Da Silva said some very important things which characterise indicators of progress.
They are more specifically action-oriented compared to Rio, but this is exactly what we should be doing with regard to Johannesburg.
Secondly, Mrs McNally and others pointed out the closer and clearer link between the environment and poverty.
It is extremely important to move closer to reality.
The balance between the issues of trade, development and the environment has been taken up by a number of speakers.
We must remember that the basis on which we were able to work in Johannesburg was very clearly defined by decisions in the Council clarifying our mandate.
In essence, Europe clearly wanted, and needed, to stick to the Doha formula.
We could neither add nor subtract anything.
This was the political basis on which we were able to negotiate in Johannesburg.
Some may not like it, but it was a diplomatic achievement for Europe that we came back from Johannesburg with a formula that clearly reflected our words and left the Doha track open and clear, as it should be.
Please bear in mind that the meltdown in Seattle was due to an overload of the international agenda.
If we had not cleared this up, and done what we did in Doha and Monterrey in order to allow the world to discuss sustainable development in Johannesburg, the whole thing would have been one big mess, damaging our attempts to tackle our problems with liberalising, and reducing subsidies for, agriculture.
All that is now part of the Doha track. This would have been damaged if we had tried to 'redo' Doha in Johannesburg.
As far as the institutional debate is concerned, some people clearly find it a problem that I described the cold hard reality of institutional agreements.
I noted Minister Haarder's remarks when he said that he could not promise any changes here today.
Strangely enough this is exactly what I told Members of Parliament in Johannesburg.
I could not undertake to depart from the institutional agreement.
Nor should we regard this debate as simply a discussion between Members of Parliament and a Commissioner.
Normally one says that it takes two to tango, but the institutional complexity of the European institutions is such that for us it takes three to tango.
It is therefore a mistake to think that this discussion is just between Parliament and the Commission.
In fact if people look at what actually took place in Johannesburg, they will see that we did our utmost to try to inform parliamentarians.
I would certainly have welcomed full participation by parliamentarians until the end of the summit.
Unfortunately, however, after the weekend, very few stayed in Johannesburg until the end.
The money spent on travelling there with nine assistants would have been far better spent if Parliament had allowed its representatives to stay throughout the international meetings rather than returning home in the middle.
That would have strengthened cooperation.
I would say to Mrs Evans and Mrs McNally that an integrated approach to energy, gender, poverty, health and population - a point which was also very strongly made by Mrs Scheele - corresponds exactly with the kind of approach that is required.
Mrs Evans stressed the importance of enforcing monitoring.
The best method is to incorporate this into the country and regional strategies to secure ownership in the South.
Considering what I said before about the lack of enthusiasm shown by many countries in the South to do these things, it is extremely important that we ensure that this is anchored in their own planning.
Mrs Scheele also asked how we are monitoring the financial commitments to development assistance levels made by Member States and the Union collectively in Monterrey.
Fortunately, monitoring is already available via the reports which are made to the Development Assistance Committee in the OECD.
This means that every donor country is obliged to submit information which the Commission will use to gain feedback.
Discussions will be held on a regular basis to ensure that this increase is actually happening.
The discussion on reproductive health and rights dominated the last days of the summit.
This is another reason why I would have welcomed the presence of Members of Parliament during that time.
Article 47 of the political declaration was the result of a huge battle that was fought, day and night, before we finally managed, with the support of Canada, to get the established Cairo terms accepted.
These were reintroduced into the text and we avoided a major defeat at the hands of the dark coalition of you-know-who. We ended up with something acceptable.
This was an unwelcome drama. It is very disturbing to have to fight for something like this.
I have covered some of the aspects.
Certainly, the enormous follow-up task is going to be a huge challenge.
The water initiative - trying to organise regional cooperation in all the major African river systems - will be a huge project.
We hope this will also feed into the general effort of trying to create more stable regional cooperation, which again will be good for democracy, stability and liberalisation of trade.
So we see the water initiative there not only as an aim in itself but as something which is also very positive with regard to its indirect effects.
Mr President, we have been here since 9 a.m. to speak about the outcome of the Johannesburg Summit.
Some Members have taken pleasure in attacking the Commission on the pretext that it has, apparently, failed to communicate sufficient information.
In my view, the Commission did a good job in Johannesburg.
It defended European positions, even though it was unable to impose Europe's views on the rest of the world.
And although the Commission did not have enough time to boost the egos of certain Members who were twiddling their thumbs in their hotel, it is certainly not a tragedy.
I also think that the same Members who criticised the Commission should have at least stayed in the Chamber to listen to the answers provided by the Commissioners and the Council.
Mr President, as you know, I led Parliament's delegation in Johannesburg and I should like to explain something, because I think that Commissioner Nielsen has confused matters somewhat.
Commissioner Nielsen has not understood why we are praising the Council and criticising the Commission for the fact that Parliament was not given the institutional role it should have had.
I shall try to explain once again: Let us separate the institutional level, the role of Parliament, from political cooperation.
At the institutional level, we want both the Commission and the Council to support our right to participate in the daily coordination meetings of the European Union.
This is a matter to be resolved under the forthcoming revision of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Cooperation policy is a very diverse thing and we had the feeling that, in the framework of cooperation policy, the Council was acting with transparency and the Commission was guilty of omission.
And this is what is causing us certain difficulties because we were not used to this sort of behaviour by the Commission; we were used to seeing its commitment, to holding joint Parliament press conferences with the Commission and with the Council, to openness, to a real involvement of Parliament, which this time we only felt was apparent, unfortunately, on the part of the Council.
Mr President, I too was in Johannesburg and I spent very little time at my hotel, and not because I was doing the rounds of the famous bars of Johannesburg.
I just wanted to say this: the Commissioner referred to the presence of MEPs in Johannesburg and said, I think somewhat condescendingly, that we left before the work was finished and would have done well to have stayed until the end.
I assume the Commissioner meant, if we expected to be taken seriously.
Could you please confirm to us from the chair that our delegation to Johannesburg had orders from the Bureau itself to leave for Europe by Sunday at the latest in order to attend September's part-session.
The Rules say that Members cannot be on mission during Parliament's plenary session.
Mr President, I would like to turn to our audience today and welcome them to this debate in the European Parliament.
We are discussing two different things, although they are interlinked.
We are discussing a report that has been drawn up by Mrs HulthÃ©n, a Swedish MEP, about how to combat climate change.
I would first like to comment on that and then make some concluding remarks about our discussion on Johannesburg.
I will now speak Swedish for a little while.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
I have received a motion for a resolution
. (FR) Being aware of the lack of conviction at international level in favour of a sustainable development which reduces poverty and preserves the environment, we are nonetheless reassured that the principles agreed at Rio will be honoured.
Which was not self-evident, so whose fault is it?
Community responsibility for this lamentable lack of progress should not be diminished.
The collective failure amounts to a loss of credibility.
It is ridiculous to seek majority agreements with the G77 countries, who were allies at Rio and Kyoto, whilst the Union's own plan for a sustainable development within its borders has failed!
The examples are as numerous as they are revealing: biodiversity, the subject of a Convention in Rio, continues to decline sharply.
Species are disappearing and habitats are being lost forever.
The 'Biodiversity' action plan is honourable, though it is nothing more than a pious hope.
And it is still an instinctive response for many Member States to overlook the 'Birds' and 'Habitats' Directives.
It is our essential political and moral responsibility to demand of ourselves what we are demanding of others.
The Commission must provide an annual presentation of the progress made in integrating the dimension of sustainable development in all Community policies.
In order to restore Europe's credibility, we must, in conjunction with our international partners, draft a policy to eradicate poverty and industrial processes that are damaging our ecology.
Mr President, on a point of order, on Monday I raised a point of order about Rule 2 and yesterday had the Minutes corrected to indicate the exact purport of that point.
In my remarks on Monday I suggested that there was a risk of a certain meeting of Pesca Ministers having been intended to interfere with the independence of action of Parliament.
Mr JovÃ© Peres was one of the rapporteurs in question and he made a statement this morning.
I fully accept what he said and if I caused him embarrassment I would like to apologise.
Colleagues, fifty years ago the first meeting of the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community, the predecessor of the European Parliament, took place here in Strasbourg.
We celebrate today, therefore, fifty years of parliamentarianism at the heart of our common European project and enterprise, and fifty years of the contribution of parliamentarians to sustained and sustainable peace with prosperity.
On that occasion on 10 September 1952, Jean Monnet, as President of the High Authority, welcomed 'the first European Assembly invested with the power of decision'.
The next speaker on that day was Konrad Adenauer who said that the new Assembly 'marked fresh and significant progress in our project of creating a new Europe'.
Today on behalf of the Parliament I acknowledge and salute that illustrious post-war generation of the pioneers of European integration: in paying tribute to their indelible achievements, we today pledge our own energies as a directly elected European Parliament and pledge our own commitment to serve the rising generation of Europeans across our entire continent, as we move to embrace the historic and unprecedented enlargement that now awaits us.
To mark this anniversary, I would like to invite you to participate in a ceremony which will take place today at 1 p.m. in the space next to the hemicycle.
This will include the raising of the European flag and a short musical performance by a colliery band from the Saar.
You are all very welcome to attend.
I would also like to remind you of an invitation to the opening of an exhibition about the history of the European Parliament and European integration.
The exhibition, entitled 'A story with a future' will be formally opened at 2.45 p.m. this afternoon in the Visitors' area on the ground floor of the Louise Weiss building.
I would now like to welcome to the distinguished visitors' gallery a delegation of five senators and seven members of parliament from Chile.
The delegation is led by Senator Gabriel ValdÃ©s, Chairman of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee.
The delegation is in Strasbourg to take part in the Fourth Interparliamentary Meeting between the European Parliament and Chile which is being held today and tomorrow.
As you know, the European Union and Chile have signed an agreement on economic partnership, political coordination and cooperation.
On behalf of Parliament I welcome the delegation and wish them a successful interparliamentary meeting.
The next item is the vote.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Report Smet (A5-0279/2002)
Mr President, this report was also voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure which allows for no debate and no amendments to the report.
The British delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support.
The new rule, however, leaves us no option but to vote against certain reports.
Most of this report represents the very worse of politically correct claptrap.
Women are increasingly achieving more top positions in society and this will continue to improve as, in my country at least, women are more successful than men in gaining university places.
We do not support quotas or interference in the ways in which trades unions, for example, select their officers.
The Committee on Women's Affairs and Equal Opportunities talks about gender mainstreaming whilst at the same time its very existence contradicts this principle.
The Moderate Party's delegation to the European Parliament has voted against Mrs Smet's report on the representation of women among the social partners of the European Union (A5-0279/2002).
The principle of equal rights for all is one of the most important cornerstones of our society.
Rights are, and shall remain, individual.
The collectivisation of rights can be the first step towards the reduction of their importance.
The European Parliament should as a matter of principle not pronounce on how independent organisations, such as employers organisations and trade unions, should be structured.
This is up to them and their members.
Otherwise, the Moderate delegation considers that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should be abolished and that its business should be taken over by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Mrs Miet Smet's excellent report once again provides us with the opportunity to condemn the dearth of European statistics on the number of women in the social partner organisations.
Although many strategies have been implemented in order to remedy the underrepresentation of women in the upper echelons of these organisations, as well as in delegations to social consultation and advisory bodies, we must, as the rapporteur recommends, make a start at European level on the systematic compilation of data relating to the role played by women in the decision-making process.
It is, however, certain that the application and effectiveness of the measures taken remain entirely dependent on the political will within the organisations.
Awareness-raising campaigns prior to trade union elections and the establishment of networks among women negotiators also constitute incentives for increasing the representation of women.
After reading this excellent report, I can only recommend that you vote in favour and reiterate that the Commission must urgently compile these data in the proper fashion with a view to creating a database on the representation of women within social partner organisations.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (DE) I voted in favour of the report on the representation of women among the social partners of the European Union.
According to statistics produced by the European Trade Union Congress, the proportion of women in positions of leadership is under 25%, which is far too low.
I believe that it is particularly important to achieve balanced representation of women at leadership level in trade unions, which, in wage negotiations, play an important part in promoting equality of opportunity.
It has emerged from various studies that women are seriously under-represented in wage negotiations, the consequence of which is that women's issues are taken too little into account in the labour market.
Women know what the real working conditions of female employees are and where equality is lacking.
If more women were to be in charge of negotiations, I am quite sure that greater consideration would be given to women's interests in the labour market.
I therefore call on the social partners to devise support programmes for women in order that their presence in decision-making circles may be enhanced.
The interests of female employees must not be ignored.
As part of the European Parliament's objective to be proactive in terms of the participation of women in the decision-making bodies of the various organisations, the report by Mrs Miet Smet is an important milestone, and I am pleased to support the report in this House.
It is extremely important to implement strategies which seek to promote a more balanced representation within social consultation bodies.
Within these bodies, decisions are taken that are crucial for women, concerning equal opportunities in the workplace and prospects for career progression.
In order to protect women's interests, we therefore need to compile accurate statistical data, which is the first essential step in achieving a genuinely balanced representation.
The increased presence of women will thus help to create new points of view on all the policies defined by the social partners.
This report is heading in this direction and must be given backing so that the European Parliament can gain further credibility in terms of its objectives.
This will require the cooperation of social partners, and particularly of employer organisations whose efforts, it must be said, are lacking in this area.
It is clear that this report is also applicable to the framework of enlargement, and that it is important to start to involve the candidate countries immediately in the process of making the presence of women more balanced.
Mr President, this report was voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no debate and no amendment to the report.
The British delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support.
The new Rule, however, leaves no option but to vote against certain reports.
Whilst we support much of what the HulthÃ©n report contains, and of course its objectives, we could not vote in favour of a package that contains references to European eco-taxes.
Tax is a matter for Member States. It is not within the competence of the European Union.
. (EL) The Anneli Report is well intentioned and proposes practicable ways of keeping to the first phase of Tokyo Protocol commitments, although it also expresses reservations about numerous shortcomings in the text.
The most important points are:
One: a directive needs to be approved for the promotion of combined heat and solar energy which will safeguard low costs and high output.
Two: the same priority should be given to a directive on the promotion of biofuel-based heat production.
Three: the Commission needs to submit a communication on quantitative environmental targets in the transport sector by the end of 2002, so that transport also contributes to the 8% Kyoto reduction target in the gas emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect, stressing the need for all motor vehicles to be included in the strategy to reduce CO2 emissions.
We need to favour fuels and technologies with low or zero emissions.
It is very important that we promote the use of biofuel and the use of ecological fuels in the transport sector.
Four: in industry, the Commission should immediately propose a framework directive on fluorinated gases in order to reduce emissions in all sectors.
Five: a proposal for a directive on more energy-efficient public procurement should also be issued immediately.
Six: at a political level, the European Union should condemn the USA's lack of environmental measures and its efforts to undermine the Kyoto Protocol as a minimum reaction to the USA's failure to take any action.
We have voted in favour of Mrs HulthÃ©n's report, (A5-0237/2002).
For us Swedish Moderates, the most important environmental issue is to avoid development that can cause climate change on our planet.
To us, it is obvious that the use of carbon for energy production must be phased out.
Work on environmental policy must be more clearly focused on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
We have voted in favour of the present report as we consider that attempts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and achieve the targets in the Kyoto Protocol are important.
This does not mean, however, that we support the report in its entirety.
Items 16, 26, 34 and 35 advocate the coordination and harmonisation of environmental and energy taxation.
We are opposed to the EU managing the taxes of the Member States.
A decision must also be made on environmental taxes in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
A carbon dioxide tax might need to vary among the Member States, since it must be set off against other measures that the Member States need to take to achieve the lower emission targets.
. (NL) Freight transport by road has increased considerably over the past 20 years.
This has led to bottlenecks and pressure to keep widening motorways and to build new roads.
This form of transport takes up a great deal of space, is noisy and contributes significantly to the greenhouse effect.
The Commission is right to conclude that this problem must be addressed by shifting from the roads to rail, inland shipping and coastal shipping.
A majority on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are opposed to this and want to spare road traffic.
A modal shift is said to be too costly, and the alternatives are also faced with shortages of capacity and environmental objections.
It is true that the often ageing diesel locomotives should become cleaner and that the canal network has been neglected.
This is now being seized on as an argument for handing out subsidies to restrict pollution and congestion on the roads.
Furthermore, the thresholds for those subsidies are being halved.
It is also true that the remaining road traffic should become cleaner.
Nevertheless, I fear that although the EU will be handing out much more funding, little will actually change as a result.
Road transport will then get the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the necessary environmental investments, and demand for more motorways will continue to rise.
I voted in favour of this important report, bearing clearly in mind the worrying predictions of the Commission, which suggest that road freight transport in the European Union will increase by around 50% by 2010.
I fully share the objectives of the Marco Polo programme, and the rapporteur's view on how to reduce road congestion and improve the environmental performance of the worldwide transport system.
I also believe that congestion constitutes a threat both to the environment and to the vitality of the economy and am, therefore, in favour of measures that reduce congestion and pollution and encourage the transfer of freight transport from road to rail, inland waterways and short sea shipping.
We must also pay attention, however, to areas in which bottlenecks occur and the factors causing these in these other modes of transport, so that the Marco Polo programme does not lead to a transfer of congestion from one mode of transport to another.
Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to say I was disappointed to see that Amendment 6 from the Committee went through.
This whole directive was really about cross-border legal aid.
To take the whole cross-border element out, and to try and look at the whole question of harmonising legal aid throughout the European Union, is - in my opinion and that of my Group - bound to lead to one hell of a muddle.
If we had stuck to the Liberal amendment and had concentrated solely on cross-border legal aid cases, then I think we could have had a workable document in front of us today.
Unfortunately we do not.
However, that being said, we did ultimately vote for the directive.
There are other parts in it which we feel we can support, and we leave the Council of Ministers, hopefully, to sort out the bits that unfortunately went through.
In the wake of the attacks of 11 September, the Council urged the Commission to examine urgently the links between maintaining domestic security and respecting international obligations in the area of the right to asylum.
The Commission's approach was disappointing, since it dealt with only one issue, that of how to deny terrorists and other criminals the right to asylum.
This approach equates to viewing the problem through a microscope.
On the other hand, it is an entirely different question - a much more serious one - that is not even mentioned in the Commission's document: what would happen if a considerable proportion of the population of a third country requested asylum in one or more Member States, because of the risk of oppression in their own country?
The world has changed since 1950.
The Geneva Convention was designed to protect individuals facing persecution.
Today, due to globalisation and the ease of travel, we must contemplate the fact that, one day, the Convention might be applied by whole populations or millions of refugees who would destabilise our countries.
This is the pressing issue we now face.
Governments have a duty to deal with this by supplementing existing legislation with means of protection other than conventional asylum.
The British Conservative Delegation fully supports greater cooperation between judicial authorities, especially in the execution of judgments and the service of legal process throughout Europe.
This both assists British business and helps with the completion of the Single Market.
However, we do not see the measures in this Report as being helpful and its resource implications in offering free legal assistance, regardless of the merits of a case, to anyone who wishes to pursue an action are both naÃ¯ve and totally impractical.
The British Conservatives therefore cannot support the measures in this Report.
It is a fact that the criteria for EMU should have included criteria for combating unemployment in the Member States.
The quantitative and qualitative targets set at the Lisbon Summit and the fact that promoting high levels of employment was included in the European Union's main objectives has helped fight unemployment and reduce the number of unemployed to 13 million.
The objective, however, of full employment set in Lisbon is a political commitment by the leading Member States, not a binding legal commitment.
Nonetheless, in order to combat unemployment in the Member States, European governments need to learn from each other, coordinate their approaches and exchange best practices.
The proposals in Mr Herman Schmid's report on the guidelines on employment could help us make a careful evaluation of these guidelines.
What happens, however, when a Member State such as Greece, where unemployment has risen from 6.3% to 11.1% in the ten years between 1990 and 2000, has had the same recommendations on combating unemployment since 1998?
Safeguarding employment should be a priority, not an empty gesture.
We cannot support the report since it advocates coordination within areas that we consider are best dealt with at national level, including the coordination of employment and social policy.
We consider that these issues should remain at national level, since the differences between the Member States are great and will increase further with enlargement.
A European policy in these areas cannot take account of the great differences that exist between the Member States.
We even consider that coordination and harmonisation within these areas could put continued EU cooperation at risk.
We do not therefore adopt a position on the actual measures in the report, but vote against the report on grounds of principle.
As we take stock, five years after the European employment strategy was implemented, and before the 2003 guidelines on employment are finally adopted, it is important to reiterate that unemployment is still a scourge, and that it is the main cause of social exclusion.
That is why several things must be done: we must call on the Commission to analyse the causes of the weak economic growth in the Union and to put forward proposals with a view to encouraging genuine and meaningful growth in order to increase the number of jobs.
Regarding the method, we must strengthen the role of the national parliaments in the drafting of national action plans; we must give the European Parliament a role, as part of the co-decision process, on questions relating to employment under the open coordination method, and we must also involve the social partners more closely.
Regarding the substance, we should emphasise the development of local and regional labour markets in order to boost initiatives designed to attract productive investments and to encourage economic balance, social cohesion and job creation in the least-developed areas and regions.
We must also consider how to improve the integration of legal immigrants in the labour market.
. (NL) The EU and its forerunners have been born from the desire on the part of major international businesses for one unfettered market with a common currency.
As a result, employers' interests have weighed down heavily on the EU's management structures and EU policy.
For 50 years, there have been calls for more attention to solidarity with those who will never occupy economic positions of power.
The trade movement asked for a 'Social Europe', and the Council, the Commission and Parliament created the impression that this social Europe was on its way.
Three years ago, this ambition was officially abandoned.
The 2000 social summit in Lisbon was not about pensions, social benefits, reducing working hours, public investments, strengthening public services and economic stability, but about large-scale privatisations and increasing company profits.
This mind-set was expected to result in winning the competitive battle with America and Japan.
Unlimited economic growth without redistribution was said to automatically solve all social problems.
Social policy is now at risk of being made completely subordinate to economic policy.
This policy completely ignores the fact that the crisis in 1929 could only be halted by active government intervention, as advocated by the economist Keynes.
Given a declining economy and growing unemployment, the neo-liberal approach is a recipe for certain social disaster.
My colleague, Mr Herman Schmid, is right to denounce any future adherence to this approach in employment policy.
Increased levels of unemployment and announcements of new waves of redundancies - that is what we have to show for five years of the European Employment Strategy.
The European Union's restructuring policy does not create jobs, it restricts them, especially full-time, stable jobs, while so-called growth deprives millions of people of the right to work or offers them a poor substitute in the form of part-time employment, with all the financial and social consequences that has for family life.
So celebrations are unjustified and do not reflect the real picture, which is that generalised, long-term unemployment - and we are talking decades here - is hovering around 10% and is accompanied by generalised, temporary, short-term forms of employment, for which employers may even be subsidised, in order to artificially reduce the figures by making several unemployed persons share one job.
Active employment policies are being used as an excuse to subsidise big business while depriving families of even the most basic right to survival.
The proposed 'employability' model may appear to reduce official unemployment statistics, but it does not reduce the fear, insecurity, unhappiness or poverty of working-class families.
Pronouncements about combating poverty, full employment and so on are hypocritical and their only objective is to foster self-delusion among the working classes and take the edge off the social problems which the very policy of serving multinational interests creates.
That is why we call on the workers to rally round and overturn this anti-grass roots policy.
Although I disagree with some paragraphs, I decided to vote in favour of this report on taking stock of five years of the European Employment Strategy. I particularly welcome the fact that, according to the observations made by the rapporteur on the future of employment in the European Union, businesses will be asked to give greater weight to the family-friendly organisation of work.
I also welcome the view of lifelong employability as a means of preferential social integration, particularly given the increased ageing of the working population in all the countries of the Union.
It is becoming increasingly important to focus national employment policies and the European Employment Strategy itself on giving dignity to labour and not only on the economic aspects of harmonising the EU's productivity index with the USA, which is mentioned often in the Commission communication.
In addition to having to be 'productive', employment must be also a means of achieving one's potential and of social integration.
The Luxembourg process introduced a new way of working within the EU.
It involved taking new initiatives to strengthen employment policy in the Union.
After five years, we can now say that this strategy has been successful, even if there is still much to be improved.
The open method of coordination is not based on legislation, but on common policy objectives.
This has proved to be an effective method of managing employment issues.
Parliament does not have co-decision in the open coordination.
A role that is based on co-decision, which is now required in recital R in the adopted report, would undermine open coordination as a method.
As a Swedish Christian Democrat I cannot support this.
Recital E in the report also criticises the entrepreneurship pillar, stating that the emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises has been too narrow a perspective.
This statement is in direct contradiction of the political priorities of the Christian Democrats in Sweden.
For this reason also, I have not been able to support the report.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on the following:
the report (A5-0296/2002), by Elmar Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on Progress in implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) [7330/2002 - C5-0205/2002 - 2002/2010(INI)],
the Council and the Commission statements on the Middle East, and
the report (A5-0286/2002), by Gary Titley on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the third annual report on arms exports (operative provision 8 of the code of conduct) [2001/2254(INI)].
Two ministers will speak today on behalf of the Council: Mr MÃžller for the Danish Presidency and Mr Yiannitsis on behalf of the next Greek Presidency.
As you know, Denmark, as a result of its referenda and Treaty arrangements, is not connected with the dossier on defence issues, and so we have the unusual and perhaps unprecedented situation of a troika in operation in the House.
We welcome both Mr MÃžller and Mr Yiannitsis.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, it is a very great honour, as deputy Foreign Minister of Greece, to address you today on the aspects of European security and defence policy with military and defence implications.
I should particularly like to take this opportunity of thanking the Danish Presidency for the way in which it has cooperated on this novel experiment by the dual presidency, which is no easy task.
May I start by saying that the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies were especially productive and gave a tremendous fillip to the European security and defence policy and it is befitting for us to acknowledge that from this forum.
There has been a whole series of developments which I should like to mention.
The first, and perhaps most important, is the official announcement in Laeken last year that the European Union is now ready to carry out certain operations and is gradually moving towards full operational capability which will allow it to take on even the most demanding of Petersburg-type missions.
The second point I wanted to mention concerns the development of military capabilities, which are perhaps the most important factor in completing the Union's operational capabilities and which have also made considerable progress.
A conference was held on improving capabilities, giving both the Member States and third countries the opportunity to make additional contributions, and the action plan on capabilities was adopted in Laeken.
The Spanish Presidency also pushed on with the application of the plan in question, and I should like to acknowledge that.
May I point out that the announcement of partial operational readiness in Laeken is not simply of theoretical value.
It says that we have the political will to implement the CFSP mechanism, even if it is still unfinished.
What this means in practice is that we have given the go-ahead for specific operations to be undertaken in the Balkans, such as the policing mission in Bosnia and Task Force Fox in the FYROM.
The Spanish Presidency also seriously addressed the related matter of equipment and took the relevant initiatives.
My fourth point concerns the European Union's first exercise, which was conducted during the Spanish Presidency and allowed the procedures planned to be tested and conclusions to be drawn which will be invaluable in improving these procedures in the future.
And as part of this procedural operational framework for the defence and security policy mechanism, I should also mention that framework guidelines defining the funding system for military operations, which is again a very important aspect, were adopted in Seville.
A great deal has, of course, been done to set up the mechanism for developing capabilities which, in turn, is the basic tool of military administration.
Much of the work has already been done and all that remains is to enhance certain points so that the mechanism can be put into action.
However, there are a few outstanding questions, such as relations between the European Union and ???? and the related issue of the involvement of European allies who are not part of the European Union.
As far as the first question is concerned, progress has not been exactly spectacular.
Unquestionably, some progress has been made, mainly following discussions within ???? of individual issues pertaining to relations between the two organisations. However, it is true to say, by way of a general conclusion, that relations between the two organisations need to progress further.
The reason given for this in certain quarters is the delay in dealing with the outstanding issue of participation.
I should like to point out that this is not entirely accurate because, although resolving this issue would certainly make it easier to complete permanent arrangements, the fact that it is outstanding is no reason to delay on individual matters.
Here too, progress has been made, as noted in the Seville conclusions, thanks to the efforts of the Spanish Presidency which, working with the General Secretariat and with the help of certain partners actively involved in the overall issue, brokered a compromise proposal before Seville.
Unfortunately, this proposal has still not been developed.
However, the Presidency and the General Secretariat are continuing in their endeavours, as instructed in Seville.
As far as relations with third countries are concerned, significant progress was also made in Seville, which adopted arrangements to broaden the provisions made in Nice on the involvement in European defence and security policy of potential partners, such as Canada, Russia and the Ukraine.
As far as the European Union's taking over the Task Force Fox operation in the FYROM is concerned, serious preparations have also been made here.
However, given that one of the sine qua non for taking over this operation is that permanent arrangements have to be in place between the European Union and ????, which there appears to be little likelihood of completing by the end of October, we may have to examine alternatives.
Of course, this does not reflect all the progress made on the CFSP over the last year.
A great deal of more or less important progress has been made, but there is too little time to describe it all.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European defence enterprise is helping to satisfy the demands of European citizens, which are being voiced even more loudly at the moment, for the European Union to take a strong lead on defence issues.
The European Parliament, with its direct links to the citizens of Europe and with its sensitive approach to important issues in the European Union, will, we are sure, help with this new dimension currently being structured in the European Union.
We are aware of the fact that, with the CFSP, we are opening up new prospects for the European Union and the cooperation established at the outset is very important.
For our part, we shall do our very best during our presidency.
To close, I should like to thank the European Parliament and its president for giving me the opportunity to present the defence aspects of the policy for which Greece has assumed the presidency during the current six-month term.
Mr President, I have been asked to respond to both the Brok and Titley reports and to make a statement on the Middle East as well.
I should like to begin with the report by Mr Brok.
This offers a very good overview of the progress achieved and the new challenges that emerged in 2001/2002.
When we met here 11 months ago to discuss the previous CFSP Report, we had just been hit by the terrorist attacks in the United States and the war in Afghanistan.
The picture today has changed dramatically.
The impact of 11 September on world politics has been immense.
I agree with Mr Brok that there are currently four major tasks for our Common Foreign and Security Policy.
None of them are easily met: firstly there is our partnership with the United States.
The complexity and diversity of this indispensable partnership inevitably generate a certain degree of friction.
We stand united against terrorism, we share similar values. But our interpretation of these values is not always identical.
United States leadership since the war has been based on two pillars, represented perhaps by the work of President Truman and General Marshall: first containment of threat; second the establishment of a global rule book and of global institutions which could encourage democracy, open markets and the rule of law, both on continents and internationally.
That approach, which produced so much prosperity and stability for the last half of the last century, is still the right approach today.
That is why all Members in this House are united in thinking that the right way of approaching the problem of Iraq is through the means of the United Nations.
In our cooperation with the US, but also more generally, the European Union has shown resolve in the pursuit of this multilateral approach to foreign policy.
We strongly believe that multilateral arrangements and conventions, the UN, the G8, the OSCE and others are the key to tackling the security, development and environmental problems which confront the world.
The structures of ESDP and its relationship with NATO are of particular concern.
I am worried that despite almost indefatigable efforts of many, the Berlin-plus issue remains unsettled with consequences, as we know, for our aspirations in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Finally, bilateral relations have continued to expand in the past year with virtually all major countries in the world.
Among them, Russia is an increasingly important strategic partner.
Today, we have an ambitious, comprehensive, bilateral agenda with Russia, including a structured and intensive dialogue on Common Foreign and Security Policy.
This partnership also helps us to address sensitive issues like Chechnya.
I broadly agree with Mr Brok's remarks regarding the agenda of our regional policies.
The report includes a series of proposals which are welcome, such as the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly, fresh initiatives for our partnerships with Asia and Latin America and support to the New Partnership for Africa's Development in sub-Saharan Africa (NEPAD).
There are four issues that I would like to touch on in particular.
In the Western Balkans we need to ensure that we work together to preserve the integrity of the stabilisation and association process.
Those agreements should not be seen as political goodwill signals.
It is in no-one's interest to finalise agreements with countries before the objective criteria for an agreement have been fulfilled.
Regarding Iraq, I spoke to the House on this subject earlier this month and said that we must continue to press for full Iraqi compliance with the UN resolutions.
The political action on Iraq at present is in New York and that is exactly where it should be.
Afghanistan is an issue I remain seriously concerned about.
The assassination attempt on President Karzai and the bomb in central Kabul earlier this month are just the most recent examples of the fragility of Afghanistan.
We must not spare efforts to help the central government extend its authority to the entire country.
At the UN, in the margins of the General Assembly, I attended an important meeting of Afghanistan's principal aid donors at which we underlined the importance of delivering as rapidly as possible on our respective pledges.
The regional agenda, important as it is, must not stop us from thinking ahead.
There are long-term strategic issues that we need to keep in sight.
There is firstly, for example, the institutional framework for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The architecture of the treaties is complex and our work on CFSP is right at the institutional frontiers.
The work of the Convention will soon produce new proposals to improve the present arrangements.
I look forward to participating in the discussions of the Dehaene Working Group.
Secondly, there are preparations for the consequences of enlargement on CFSP and ESDP.
Enlargement will have a major impact on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
Together with the Danish Presidency, we have started thinking about the consequences of this.
We have to make CFSP structures responsive enough to cater for 10 or more new Member States.
Through the Wider Europe initiative we will look more closely into how to organise relations, and whenever possible, seek partnership with the 'near abroad' in the East, the South-East and the South.
Thirdly I should mention Crisis Management and Conflict Prevention which must become a cross-cutting issue for all CFSP and external relations initiatives.
Our work on conflict indicators will be instrumental in gearing diplomatic action and aid programming towards conflict prevention and crisis management.
We need to implement the GÃ¶teborg programme for the prevention of violent conflict and we need to further strengthen our human rights and democracy promotion policies.
There are many examples of how CFSP yields operational results when we effectively pool national and EU resources, both in the Commission and in the Council.
I look forward to working with Parliament on improving our mechanisms for this and in extending full democratic control and accountability to the field of CFSP.
But I must say, and I hope it will not be regarded as a revolutionary observation, that however much we discuss improving instruments, however much we discuss institutional architecture, in my judgment on the basis of three years' experience there is no substitute for political will.
Secondly, let me refer briefly to the admirable report by Mr Titley on the code of conduct on arms exports.
That code is politically binding on the Member States, and the Commission has a limited role in this process.
We nevertheless welcome progress made in the Council with respect to improving the implementation of the code and enhancing transparency provided through the annual report.
We welcome Parliament's intensive interest in this subject and in particular the constructive and very ambitious stance of Mr Titley's report which encourages the Council to pursue and improve further its work in this area.
We share several of the suggestions presented in the report, such as those referring to arms-brokering activities and the production of military goods under licence, as well as the control of the end user of arms exports.
We also welcome the suggestions for all Member States to publish national annual reports for ensuring the maximum involvement of the accession countries in information exchange and denial notification as well as for promoting adherence to the principles of the code by third countries.
The Presidency has spoken about the Middle East and about the positive atmosphere at our Quartet meeting of 17 September.
I am sure Parliament is aware of the huge amount of work the Danish Presidency put into the preparation of this meeting.
It was constructive and the meeting served to set the basis for a possible peace plan, as well as for further international support for Palestinian reform.
Unfortunately the situation on the ground gives no reason to believe that things will get any better soon.
There was a six-week period of calm - calm of a sort, at any rate, even though during that period 50 Palestinians were killed.
Then there were the despicable suicide bombings. There was also the bombing of the Palestinian school and so the violence increased again.
To be fair there were some signs of improvement which have passed largely unacknowledged.
We were encouraged by the declaration of Fatah/Tanzim of their intention to stop attacks on Israeli civilians.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres called the Fatah document a 'first dawn of a different season, hopefully' he added, 'spring'.
But this new understanding seems to have evaporated and the Palestinian Authority and President Arafat have again become the target of an assault in retaliation for suicide attacks by those who do not believe in peace.
Let me stress once again - as I have done on several occasions in this House - that we must continue insisting that the Palestinian Authority does everything possible to stop terrorism.
We should exert the utmost pressure on the Palestinian Authority to prevent terror attacks and to bring terrorists to justice.
But how does it help the cause of peace to deprive the Palestinian Authority of the power and means to do any of these things?
How does it improve security to destroy the Palestinian Authority?
How does the isolation and attempted humiliation of President Arafat and the Palestinian Authority contribute to the fight against terror?
Or, for that matter, attempts to drive him into exile.
No wonder the Secretary-General of the United Nations described Israeli policy this week as bankrupt, as being likely to increase extremism rather than reduce it.
On a less gloomy note, the Quartet reviewed the Palestinian reform process which seems to be on track in as much as this is possible under the current situation.
The reform of financial and budgetary management is continuing with European Union support and under European Union pressure.
In this context I welcome - as a positive first step - the decision by Israel to pay USD 45 million in frozen tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority through the same bank account and the same monitoring mechanism which was set up as a result of our support to the Palestinian Authority.
I repeat: through the same bank account and using the same monitoring mechanism which was set up as a result of the efforts of the European Commission and the European Union.
I hope that the irony of that remark is not lost on some of those who have been criticising the efforts that we have made in order to promote the cause of reform in the Palestinian Authority.
And I hope that Israel will immediately release the remaining money.
A wide sector of Palestinian society regards elections as a crucial part of the reform process.
The pressure for elections must be maintained.
The events in the Palestinian Legislative Council over the past week and the resignation of the Palestinian Cabinet shows the emergence of a real democratic debate within Palestinian society.
This is a very positive sign of parliamentary life.
I sincerely hope that a new Palestinian Cabinet dedicated to the reform process is formed soon and that the achievements of the past few months are not destroyed.
The European Union is ready to provide assistance if there is a minimum guarantee that the elections will be free and fair.
Whilst we fully support Palestinian elections and the need for Palestinian people to elect their own leadership, we continue to caution against elections if the legal, administrative and logistic framework for elections, including the political environment, is not in place.
And how can those things be in place if there are closures, if there are curfews, if there are tanks in the streets?
But despite the progress on the reform agenda the humanitarian and economic situation continues to deteriorate.
This has been recently highlighted by UN envoy Catherine Bertini in her sobering report on the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories: two thirds of the population is under the poverty line and up to half of the population is currently unemployed.
The situation must dramatically improve if we are to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe.
But we must do much more than fighting the symptoms of the crisis.
We must address its causes.
Providing humanitarian assistance can only be a short-term approach - improving the economy must be our goal.
Let me mention here that the European Union's humanitarian work is severely affected by the restriction of movement, not just within the Palestinian Territories but on arrival at the border.
This year so far we have had over 20 cases of Israel denying entry to EU humanitarian teams.
Finally, the Quartet agreed to hold in November a ministerial-level meeting of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee, involving the major donors in the international community.
The meeting will review the economic and humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as efforts to support and encourage the reform process in the Palestinian Authority, including the prospects for elections.
I should like to bring to Parliament's attention the fact that donors will inevitably be asked to identify the possibilities of additional funding.
I should warn Parliament I am likely to come back to Parliament and the Budgetary Authority as a whole on this in the near future.
Over the last six months we have made some political progress.
The perspectives are much clearer now; and the Palestinians and the donor community are working hard on building institutions and reforming existing structures.
But there is a danger of this becoming a sort of virtual politics, while the real situation on the ground goes from bad to worse to appalling.
Every day we talk of peace; every day people die - Palestinians, Israelis.
How much longer must this go on?
How much longer must Israelis and Palestinians live in Gethsemane?
Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for having responded to comments that the rapporteur has not even made yet.
As you are in charge of the sitting, I would like to remind you of the following, which is to be found in Rule 120(5) of our Rules of Procedure: 'In a debate on a report, the Commission and the Council shall, as a rule, be given the floor immediately after the rapporteur's explanation.'
It must surely be clear to you that, whilst the Council is allowed an explanation, it is the report that is on the agenda.
I do not believe that this is a right or careful way to handle the work of committees in the plenary.
Thank you very much!
Thank you, Mr Brok, for the point of order.
As you know, we have a joint debate, including two reports and statements.
In the context of the joint debate it was the collective will of the political groups to follow the order as indicated.
I am the servant of the political groups in the matter of deciding the agenda, and, in view of the fact that this is a joint debate and not just a debate on reports, it seems to me that it is within the discretion of the groups to seek to order the debate as they have done.
If you object to this, if you do not wish to pursue that precedent for the future, I would ask you to raise your objections inside the political groups.
This is a joint debate, it is not only a debate on reports. I am not going to entertain a debate on this.
The point is noted, but this is not the place to resolve the matter.
Mr President, Mr MÃžller, Commissioner Patten, Mr Yiannitsis, ladies and gentlemen, a debate such as today's is an occasion on which to take stock of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, highlighting its positive aspects, whilst not omitting those that merit criticism.
I would like first to extend my very warm thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Titley, for the excellent reports that they have produced.
Mr Swoboda, we can talk about that some other time.
I would have had no objections to the two rapporteurs presenting their reports, but that was not my decision, nor do I have any reason to question the President's rulings, so that is not a question for me, and I am therefore not going to comment on it.
The positive elements of European foreign policy include a topic that we have not yet mentioned at all, that is, the accession of the central European countries to the European Union.
That is, indeed, at present still a foreign policy matter, and when these countries join the European Union, it will be a matter for internal affairs.
That we will soon - we hope, by the end of year - be concluding negotiations with what are obviously ten European countries, is in fact a great success story. It is one of the great European political successes.
Reference has been made to the Balkans, and that is also a positive development.
There, the European Union is playing a positive part in the interests of stability, security and democracy.
Afghanistan has been mentioned, and here too Europeans have been active; 13 of the 15 EU States are involved in Afghanistan, whether militarily or in other ways.
What is actually astonishing is that, although we - by which I mean the European Union and its Member States - are the greatest donors of funds, this actually goes almost without being noticed.
When the Americans donate a million dollars somewhere or other, then the whole world gets to know about it.
When we donate a billion euro, I sometimes get the impression that it is the best kept of Europe's state secrets.
We have to give some thought to how we can make our public relations work even better.
Turning to Iraq, we very much support the American President's efforts to involve the United Nations in this issue, and we call on all Member States of the European Union to take up a common position as Europeans together.
We see it as irresponsible for one or more Member States to go their own way.
Not only does it do damage to that country's relationship with the United States of America, but it also shows a lack of solidarity with Europeans in the European Union, for we can influence American policy and global politics only if we Europeans act together.
We now have to require the Iraqi dictator to open up his country to inspections - the British Government produced an important document on the subject yesterday - and, if these inspections on the ground are not feasible, then it is the Iraqi dictator who, at the end of the day, bears the responsibility if military action has to be taken.
I can endorse everything that Commissioner Patten said on the subject of the Middle East.
Whilst we remain convinced that the escalation of violence must be halted, and that terrorism by suicide commando must come to an end, Israel's responses are quite disproportionate; the Palestinians, too, have their own dignity.
I can, then, only encourage the Council and the Commission to stick to their policy of talking to both sides in reasonable terms.
There are others who do not do it in this way, and we have an important part to play, as both sides trust us - one perhaps rather more than the other.
We Europeans must cooperate with those whose dignity is being violated.
What we are saying, with the utmost clarity, is that Israel has the right to live within secure borders, but the Palestinian people also have the right to live in peace and within secure borders.
The representatives of the Palestinian people must also be given opportunities to express their views and suggest sensible ways ahead for the future.
Mr Yiannitsis, the deputy defence minister of Greece, was right to point out that there is as yet no agreement between the European Union and NATO on access to the North Atlantic Alliance's planning facilities and military capabilities.
We hope that we will soon be able to come to an arrangement, and also call upon our Turkish partners to contribute towards finding a solution.
I will conclude by observing that Commissioner Patten referred to the need to improve Europe's foreign, security and defence policy instruments.
We hope that the Convention will make important proposals on this, and if the European Union is to be able to act and commit itself as it is in Afghanistan, then effective institutions must be the outward expression of this.
Our group will therefore do all in its power to make the Convention a success, for on this will depend to a great extent the European Union's success with its Common Foreign, Security and Defence Policy.
(Applause)
Mr President, Presidents-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall limit my speech to the subject of the Middle East, because I understand that this was the agreement reached by Parliament on Monday.
Then I believe we need to discuss the Brok and Titley Reports - and I congratulate both rapporteurs on their work - and the rest of my group will talk about other subjects.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the facts are indisputable and do not currently allow for the cautious optimism you have expressed with regard to the Middle East.
Unfortunately, every day we receive the most terrible, bleak news of the situation.
We unreservedly condemn the mass suicide attacks against the population.
We also condemn the fact that there is a continuous list of deaths every day, but, most of all, I believe we now need to address the Israeli Government - the government presided over by Mr Sharon - which is well aware that the physical and political destruction of the Palestinian Authority and its headquarters will not help either to end the attacks or to put an end to a desire that is unanimous at international level, the creation of the Palestinian State, even more so at a time when things are happening in Palestine which are important for democrats: the threat of a vote of no confidence, the resignation of the government and the announcement of forthcoming general elections.
In that context and in that part of the world, this is something that must be taken into account.
Now, therefore, in keeping with our multilateral focus and our respect for the UN - and let us remember that it was the UN that created the State of Israel by means of a resolution - Israel must be told that it must fulfil each and every one of the UN resolutions, and that no one has the right to choose which resolutions they wish to apply, on the pretext that they are biased.
This must clearly be our line of approach, and I therefore wish to express here the support of my group for Resolution No 1435, and to ask for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from within, outside and around Ramallah and the withdrawal of occupying forces from Palestinian cities.
That is the way that corresponds to the three-stage plan you mentioned.
We also welcome the statement made by the High Representative and we ask that you take a stronger line with regard to the Quartet so that true changes can take place.
I also hope Mr Patten will allow me the liberty of asking him to tell us about an important political and budgetary aspect, concerning his reference to Israeli and Community payments into the same account.
I ask him to provide Parliament with a detailed report analysing the destruction caused in Palestine territory by the Israeli State and funded by the European budget.
The taxpayers, our citizens, have a right to know this and it should be made public.
In conclusion, Mr President, I would say that you should continue with your work, because it is absolutely necessary and there is no other way of overcoming a situation in which, at any given time, the only question we can ask ourselves is how much blood must be shed for both parties to be able to overcome this kind of tragic escalation.
(Applause from the left)
How can we prevent the United States from taking unilateral action in future, or from carrying out preventive attacks, wherever and whenever, even without our approval?
Simply invoking the United Nations and international law is not enough as a formula to change Washington from a unilateral to a multilateral player.
Only if the European Union organises itself more effectively on a political and military plane can it be a worthy Atlantic partner.
However, as long as European leaders set greater store by internal political considerations than they do by common foreign policy, our endeavours in this area will be in vain and we will continue to give America all the political leeway it needs to determine its own agenda.
This particularly applies with regard to Iraq.
The European Union must sail a liberal course midway between two Social-Democratic extremes: Mr SchrÃ¶der, the electoral opportunist, and Mr Blair, President Bush's London branch manager.
The pressure on Saddam Hussein to allow unfettered access to all weapons and to destroy all dangerous weapons must be stepped up to the highest level possible.
Needless to say, possible military action cannot be ruled out then.
After all, if we continue to allow Saddam Hussein to ignore the UN resolutions, he will become a great danger to his environment and the UN Security Council itself.
Military action does, of course, require the Security Council's explicit approval.
If the international community joins forces, the Atlantic allies will have to follow suit.
Only with Europe's help can America tackle the problems in the world effectively.
Political and cultural differences should not make us blind to Europe's and America's common interests.
Although the enlarged EU can add more weight globally, decision-making must be adapted and the right to veto must be abolished.
It remains crucial, though, for a common foreign policy in Europe to become more important than the political leaders' own national profile.
If that does not change, we only have ourselves to blame for America being able to take global control on its own.
Mr President, the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council on the Middle East gave me great cause for alarm, because there are, even so, few or hardly any regions of the world in a state of conflict that has such a profound impact on global stability. There are few regions in which a State breaches international law, humanitarian law and United Nations' resolutions to such a degree and quite so repeatedly, and there is certainly no State associated with the Union which treats Europe in such an off-hand way, destroying Palestinian infrastructures that we have financed, which refuses, first Mr Solana, then Mr Moratinos, the right to visit an occupied Palestinian territory.
And there is, above all, no State which treats the appeals that we make to it with such scorn, practically torpedoing the peace efforts on which we are working.
It is in this context that the President-in-Office of the Council speaks of optimism and sees the main obstacle to peace to be the Palestinians.
I cannot comprehend this!
You are obviously right to condemn outright the suicide attacks and any act of terrorism against innocent people, in Israel just as in any other country.
The Palestinian Authority also condemns them systematically and has often tried to put a stop to them.
But what has Mr Sharon done during the last six weeks of relative calm to try to dispel the tension and re-launch the dialogue?
The Ha'aretz newspaper answers for you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in pointing out that 30 Palestinian civilians were killed in August alone and Yedioth Ahronot, another newspaper, condemned the irresponsible nature of these crimes, although, apparently, the number of terrorist attacks has fallen spectacularly.
This is the truth, and it has to be told, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr Sharon will not bring security and peace to his own people by re-occupying Palestinian towns, setting up yet more colonies, starving the population and destroying everything that can keep the hope of a State alive, particularly the hope of Palestinian Authority, and this is something being pointed out by many dignified and courageous people in Israel itself.
What credibility can the Elsinore peace plan that you mentioned have, if you gloss over the root causes of the Middle East tragedy?
What sort of tragedy might this reckless headlong pursuit of the strategy of force lead to, if all those who have some authority do not use all their influence to stop Ariel Sharon?
You did not even demand an end to the siege of President Arafat or the withdrawal of Israeli forces.
Does it not bother you that your position is a considerable distance from Commissioner Patten's, for example?
Europe must live up to the world's expectations of it.
Today, you unfortunately fell far short of them.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, in addition to what we have been saying over and over again for some time now, I would like to make two comments.
Regarding the Middle East, we are in a global situation in which there has just been a new development, which is not yet reflected in either the Brok or Titley Report.
The US Administration is putting forward a new strategy for re-organising the world.
As part of this new strategy, the US Administration is telling us that there are situations in which we must intervene and take preventative action.
This is its first argument.
Its second argument is if the United Nations supports this action, all well and good; if it is against this action, it does not matter, we shall take action with the support of our friends.
I urge the European Union to draft a memorandum in response to this new situation.
I do not want the response from Mr SchrÃ¶der, from Mr Blair or Mr Chirac, or from Mr Anyone. I want a response from Europe regarding a situation which completely changes the last 50 years of history.
Over the last 50 years, we have attempted to put in place a global justice system and global rules by means of global institutions such as the UN.
It is clear that, in a region such as the Middle East, there are two states, two entities that do not respect the decisions of the UN.
Israel does not respect the decisions of the UN, it is true, but there are those within the Palestinian Movement who do not respect them either.
I therefore fully agree with the condemnation of Israel, of the Israeli policy, but I do not agree with the way the Palestinians condemn the attacks, which is purely verbal.
This is one of the problems: we are faced with two sides who do not respect what the United Nations or the political forces decide.
Yet the two nations concerned need political forces which respect what global law asks of them.
Both sides need political leaders which respects what is asked.
That is why I believe that we in Europe - unlike the US - shall only make progress in the Middle East if we show the same empathy, the same sympathy for the Israelis as we show the Palestinians, only if we feel the same way for the Israelis as we do the Palestinians.
If someone, a political force, decides to support one side rather than the other, we shall have lost, because it will be impossible to go forward.
This is why the role of the European Union is so important.
The Union is the only political entity which is capable today of making each side see reason and of helping, at the same time, both the Israelis and the Palestinians.
It is this policy that Europe must pursue; but above all, Europe must condemn Ariel Sharon when he blockades Yasser Arafat and condemn the Palestinians when they hide behind terrorists.
Mr President, for a period of six weeks there was a form of peace in the Middle East and our attention turned to Iraq.
That peace has been shattered by renewed acts of terror intended to wreck the peace process.
Once again suicide bombers attacked in Israel.
More families have been bereaved and more victims have been added to the tragic pages of the Middle East conflict.
Then came the deployment of Israeli tanks in Ramallah and in the north of the Gaza Strip. Palestinian children were targeted in their schoolyard in Hebron.
Both sides must show their commitment to peace by acting with maximum restraint, as called for by the EU Presidency in its recent declaration.
Force cannot defeat force, but peace can be built on peace.
The siege of the Palestinian Presidency compound is counterproductive.
Restricting the freedom of movement of the Palestinian leadership does not contribute to fighting terror.
It is hard to see how it will lead to a reform of the Palestinian Authority.
For far too long the Palestinian people have been denied their legitimate rights.
Their ability to survive is constantly undermined.
They are stalked by poverty.
Without jobs and essential services they are forced to live in appalling conditions.
The people of Israel also live in a situation of insecurity.
Attack and counter-attack are leading nowhere.
The parties must move forward.
The security issues must be addressed, but not at the expense of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinians.
The European Union is committed to working closely with the UN, the US and Russia in seeking ways to encourage and assist the parties involved to end the conflict and move towards a permanent peace.
The conflict must end.
The way to move forward is through cooperation and dialogue, and permanent peace must be established.
This must be our resolve.
The longer the conflict continues, the more it becomes a source of regional instability.
Mr President, what is reprehensible in the Brok Report - as we have already said, but it is increasingly clear - and, generally speaking, in the CFSP's approach, is this belief, which could be described as surreal, that the EU Member States are automatically associated due to Europe's natural general interest in the world, so that all we need to do is conjure up a pre-existing and straightforward foreign policy that is familiar to the initiated at the very least, to enable the European Union to become, quite naturally, a major player on the world stage.
This belief is put forward, in the report that is, with the call for the communitarisation of the CFSP, which was also quite rightly criticised last August by the French President, but which constantly comes back to and which is based on this - I repeat, surreal - idea, of the pre-existence of an interest and, therefore, of a common foreign policy.
Yet, reality, from one crisis to the next, continually challenges this belief.
The crises in the Balkans, firstly in Bosnia and then, more recently, in Kosovo, in the meantime, the crises in the Great Lakes region, the various phases of the crises in the Middle East, have shown us that the European Union has never ever succeeded in taking an initiative and in playing a role other than that of the stooge, of the United States, obviously.
We can only respond to the initiatives taken by others, on other sides of the Atlantic, and, the worst thing, which is, in a way, the most delightful thing for those who know what Europe is really made of, namely of independent nations, is that in several crises, particularly in the current crisis in Iraq, there are - poor old Europe, it is still in disarray - stark differences between London and Berlin, and Paris as well, and these are, to a certain extent, patently obvious.
Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should perhaps reflect sooner or later on the very way the CFSP is put into practice, because we are verging on a degree of absurdity, by constantly repeating that we will do better next time and that, from one report to the next, we will be able to define a common foreign policy.
This is still a figment of our imagination and will remain so.
I think that, sooner or later, we should reflect on just how possible this common foreign policy actually is.
Mr President, looking at the dramatic way the current geopolitical situation has become more acute since 11 September last, there is much to be said for Europe having a Common Foreign and Security Policy.
It will not, however, be an easy matter.
When the USA - at a time when Bill Clinton was still President - and England bombed Baghdad shortly before Christmas 1999 without a UN mandate, I wrote a comment piece in an Austrian newspaper, Der Standard, the key point in which was that this bombardment, denounced by France, Italy, and Russia, and which drew a sharp protest note from the Vatican, had resulted in a fine crack running across Europe.
Today, I leave it to you to judge whether this chasm has widened or become narrower in the meantime.
I would also ask you to consider whether substantial European interests would be affected by an attack on Iraq or even on Iran, which is sought by certain hawks in the US administration who aim to topple the regimes in Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt as well.
It is in any case to be welcomed that the EU's Foreign Ministers, at the informal Council meeting in Elsinore expressed their opposition to military intervention in Iraq.
This awakens hope that the current geopolitical tendency, led by the USA, of resorting to force rather than having recourse to international law, will not be endorsed in Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that both the European Union's history and its contemporary outlook provide great proof of its capacity for peacemaking, in the form of the development and enlargement of the European Union itself.
It is an area of stability, democracy and prosperity, which will be extended by the enlargement of the European Union.
I consider this a crucial justification for a specifically European policy of making further progress in these areas.
We have to use it to build bridges to those parts of our continent that even now are not able or due to join the European Union, as well as with those who do not want to.
Relations with Russia are, for example, made crucially important by the enlargement of the European Union; a positive interaction must come into being, and we must not set up new boundaries, but rather these boundaries must be turned into bridges.
Commissioner Patten, what the Commission has now proposed in connection with Kaliningrad strikes me as a step in the right direction when it comes to finding a starting point that takes into account small countries' interests, their sensitivities and their claims to sovereignty, and also enables them to implement Schengen whilst at the same time accepting that Russia has a certain interest in the matter.
I hope that these negotiations lead to a constructive result that incorporates both points of view.
I know that the Danish Council Presidency has a particular interest in this issue.
The European Union is also on the right track in other areas, for example in the Barcelona process.
We are proud that we are able to say that we spend three times as much of our budget on preventive action in the area of external policy than does the United States of America.
We should also have something to say about the positive elements.
But - and this is the big 'but' - Europe still lacks a voice when it comes to the real issues of war and peace.
The significance of what has happened over recent weeks in connection with Iraq, whether it be the uncritical tagging along behind Washington, whether it be an uncritical rejection of its demands for electoral reasons, is that there is no common European position.
Yet it is only together that we can exert the pressure that is needed to keep the dictator's hands away from weapons of mass destruction, and, on the other hand, to be able to enforce a process of consultation with the United States of America, one that will give consideration not only to the risks of a military intervention but also to all the options for a peaceful solution to the problem of how to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein has in his possession, and does so in tandem with the United Nations.
In neither of these directions have we demonstrated our capacity to give our citizens security, and we have known since 11 September that security is no longer clearly bounded by certain frontiers, but that it is also possible for a mere handful of terrorists to be operating with dangerous weapons in the midst of our own countries and to be capable of killing people in their thousands.
This has to do with the fact that most people in our Member States have not yet grasped that the small size and weakness of our Member States means that national interests can only be safeguarded if we pool our capacities.
What is needed is for us to really grasp that and also get it through to our citizens - or rather, it is the citizens that will get it across to the governments, as 70% of the public in the European Union favour a European Security and Defence Policy!
Only in the foreign ministries of our countries is that not yet understood!
It also ties in with military capabilities.
That the 60 000-strong rapid reaction force will be set up on paper by next year, is something of which I am certain, but will it be at all effective, being blind and lame for lack of any logistics capability or satellite facilities?
Is it truly operational and capable of making a contribution to a secure peace?
Are we in a position to devise an arms policy that will make us independent and give us the technological capabilities that are also of great importance for competitiveness in non-military spheres?
Mr Titley's report will go into this in greater depth.
Have we sorted out the problems we had with Operation Amber Fox and Macedonia?
Do we have rules to prevent the European Union and Turkey from being at loggerheads?
All this shows that national posturing and egoism have prevented us from making really decisive progress in matters of war and peace.
I do believe that much of the good that was said in the aftermath of 11 September is now forgotten and was locked away in governments' desk drawers not long after it saw the light of day.
Let us take, for example, the issue of external and internal security.
Let us just retrieve the great speeches our Heads of State or Government delivered after 11 September, and let us see how much was put into practice.
If we do, we will see this for the low point that it is.
I believe that our projects will only succeed insofar as we fashion a vessel in which a common European will can develop in the area of foreign, security and defence policy.
That is what makes the Convention so very important.
We have to bring about a reform of the institutions, one in which Europe speaks with one voice, with a voice, moreover, that is subject to Parliamentary control, and whose Budget is subject to Parliamentary control, in other words, with a voice originating from the Commission, although any such external affairs commissioner should of course be legitimised by having a special link with the Council.
The creation of dual structures, which is currently being talked up so much, has, however, nothing to do with the people involved at the top, who do outstanding work.
It costs money, and 80% of its energy is expended on infighting instead of being used to develop European positions in external affairs.
That is only human nature, but I do think it is something we should overcome.
We are shortly to have twenty-five Member States, and then that really will not work any more!
What this shows is that, when it comes to these issues, the European Union must at last come to realise where its interests lie.
I believe that the public have moved on from what we are doing politically, and so we in this Parliament should pursue this campaign rigorously.
It is the governments of the Member States that are enfeebling Europe, while we should be restoring her strength!
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Commissioner Patten for his kind words earlier on.
When we are discussing the Code of Conduct, I think we have to set it in a very clear context.
We should begin by recognising that the Code of Conduct is the most comprehensive international arms export control regime in existence. Nowhere else is there such a sharing of information about arms transfers.
We must also recognise just how far we have come. We were told at one time that a Code of Conduct was not possible.
Then, that if we had it, it would be no more than a statement of intention.
