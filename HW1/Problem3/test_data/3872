It seems to us that the Commission has failed to respond to this issue and is displaying a haste to liberalise port services which we feel will have no real impact.
Secondly, although we are in favour of competition, it must have an equitable basis.
The Commissioner said a few moments ago that there is a one to three ratio between the prices charged by different European ports.
While this is probably true, the main explanation lies in the radically different social conditions in different countries. Without directives on social issues, collective agreements and harmonised statutes, what has happened to road transport for example, will also happen to ports.
In other words, competition will not be fair but will entail a levelling-down of social conditions. The dock workers understand well that we are not implementing competition but a terrible mechanism to reduce prices and salaries.
Thirdly, we are completely opposed to the way the concept of self-handling has been introduced.
Why are we opposed to this?
Mr Hatzidakis wondered why we should not liberalise everything now that we have liberalised one sector. He is fully aware that the greatest amount of social malpractice probably takes place in the maritime sector.
We fear that self-handling would simply be an excuse for significant social dumping. We would like to pose the following questions.
How can we guarantee that national social standards will be complied with when they are all different? Who will ensure compliance with social standards?
How can we ensure that multinational crews, comprising Philippinos and Malaysians, for example, respect social standards? How can we ensure fair competition with the port's dock workers?
This is why we propose the common position be rejected. This is doubtless also why the dock workers are demonstrating their discontent.
Mr President, with all the commotion outside, the port directive is perhaps more controversial in the second reading than it was during the first debate.
We have not finished yet if we are really voting out pilotage services tomorrow.
Mediation with the Council is therefore on the horizon.
As a Liberal I am far from happy with the scope.
I had wanted more leeway, especially on the point of self-handling.
I have a couple of amendments that make it possible for self-handlers to unload cargo both on the ship and on the quay.
I think that the unions' fear about social dumping is nonsense.
Sufficient guarantees can be built in.
In particular, I find it regrettable that the people at the top are communicating so badly with the rank and file.
There is no threat, there are just opportunities.
Opportunities to show that they have the most experience, that they can work smoothly and efficiently and that they can therefore offer a keen price.
Ultimately, what we are talking about is better quality and more services, but a monopoly must not be allowed to develop.
Closing ranks and holding back modernisation will ultimately be at the expense of the working conditions of the dock workers themselves.
Mr President, today it has once again become clear how far decision-making in the European Union is from the reality of the people it concerns.
In this case, the people are the workers in the ports.
Once upon a time there were a lot of them; their work was dirty and dangerous and poorly paid then.
By organising themselves they have been able to improve these things and protect themselves against poorly paid, unskilled labour being hired in from outside by illegal contractors.
Years ago the European Parliament called for rules governing competition between ports, particularly between ports serving the same hinterland, such as the North Sea.
A lot of government money has been squandered on excessively low tariffs and excessively generous facilities to please the shipping companies.
The European Commission has now picked up on this, but not with a view to restricting competition between ports but rather to promote it within the ports.
This competition is trampling all over the dock workers.
That means a return to the old situation.
The main aim is to cut labour costs even further.
A lot of the work has already been mechanised, and the cost of port labour forms only a negligible part of the cost of goods these days, but they even want to cut back on this.
It is true that the amendment limits opportunities for extremely low paid crew from developing countries to take over loading and unloading on quays from registered local dock workers, but this is difficult to monitor.
We can expect a large number of disputes about rules being flouted and competition being distorted in years to come.
That was not sufficiently clear to the trade unions at the first reading in November 2001.
They have since agreed on their complete rejection on a European level, but many of the elements relevant to them have now been declared out of order for the second reading, and demonstrators have been kept far away from this building.
Strikes against this unreasonableness are the only weapon the people have left.
In order to avoid this, the entire proposal must be dropped, as was advocated by more than 40% of the Members at the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the International Labour Organisation has found it necessary to behave in a regulatory way in respect of port labour, precisely because port labour has so much to do with safety and because this is an area where social dumping has occurred.
Many countries have signed these conventions, and you will naturally say: 'We are not opposed to it either, and we also allow these countries to organise themselves further.'
My country also wants to be able to retain its 'Major Law', but that is naturally not what it is about.
What the dock workers are afraid of, and this is an area in which I share their anxiety, is the fact that safety in the ports will go out of the window in favour of cheap prices.
The Prestige accident has already been mentioned by many people.
Are we going to see serious accidents like this in the future when goods are loaded and unloaded?
The other great risk is that of social dumping on account of self-handling.
Commissioner, is that really what you are aiming for, competition through social dumping?
I do not think that we should go down that route.
We must ensure that compulsory licensing is introduced.
I therefore really do not agree with what you are advocating, as I am sure that anyone subject to strict licensing laws will also experience distortion of competition.
They will be priced out of the market, and cowboy ports will develop, just as we already see ships sailing under a flag of convenience that are the terror of the seas.
Mr President, today dockworkers have demonstrated against this measure outside this Parliament.
I had to fight my way through teargas to gain access to the building.
As a new Member I thought this was possibly normal practice.
There has already been a protest in Brussels and there will, no doubt, be many more.
However, this directive offends not only against workers' expectations but also against the dock companies, which have invested heavily in facilities and infrastructure.
These proposed rules are throwing their businesses into turmoil.
For this reason we voted against the measure at first reading.
Now we see a series of amendments, which typifies the approach of this Parliament: seeking to make slightly better something that is inherently flawed.
If this Parliament truly represented the wishes of the people, it would throw this directive out, but it will not.
That itself demonstrates what we already know: this Parliament has nothing to do with representing the wishes of the people; it has its own agenda, which has nothing to do with democracy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the view that Parliament has betrayed the voters in working on this directive.
I endorse the proposal for a directive and the balance reached, thanks, not least, to Parliament's work.
I believe that opening up to the market could be positive, not least as regards access to port services, but only under the conditions specified and introduced by Parliament's amendments: only provided that safety, professional qualifications, contractual and social rules and environmental protection are rigorously safeguarded where all the companies and all the kinds of services connected with aspects of the different port services are concerned.
The same must apply to self-handling.
I am not against self-handling in principle, but it must not become an excuse for promoting forms of social dumping and ways of economising on professional qualification or safety.
This is transparent competition.
This applies to new ports too, in order to ensure the availability of private investments.
Direct control over services and providers must be possible - and is highly desirable - but with due regard for those conditions: professional qualification, contractual and social rules, environmental protection and safety.
Unless these conditions are observed, we will be lumping together things which are so very different that they neither properly serve the interests we represent nor further progress towards the objectives we want to achieve with this directive.
I hope that the balance achieved by Parliament can be preserved.
Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this afternoon we have seen that our directives do have some effect on the people of Europe.
We have, in particular, seen that the dock workers are angry, very angry, and also desperate.
Why?
Most likely because they are heard too infrequently in this Parliament.
More likely, however, because they are coming up against a cold, liberal Europe that subordinates safety, safety at work and health, social matters and jobs to blind liberalisation dogma.
They are also angry about the proposal you launched in February 2001, Commissioner, in which you pulled their social charter out from under their feet with one stroke of the pen.
It will come as no surprise to you that you are not very popular in Belgium, and I still regret that you did not have the courage to have a direct debate with the dock workers in Antwerp, for example.
That could have been enlightening.
In Parliament we should have discarded the proposal immediately after the first reading, we should not have amended it.
Various colleagues have already told me that it is not what we wanted.
So why did we not vote it out?
I will continue to fight against this directive, I will vote against it tomorrow and I will continue to do so.
Because I still do not understand what its added value is, not even in its amended form, although I do admit that it is much improved.
I will tell you why the dock workers are striking, Mr Jarzembowski.
They are, of course, striking because if you permit self-handling in another country, you must also permit self-handling in your own country straight away because of the sacred competition rules, and that is the reason why I continue to oppose it.
I hope that we will be able to vote the proposal out, but I fear that we will not be able to do so.
I am therefore hoping for strong amendments: self-handling out and compulsory licensing in.
I found out today that we are better at defending this Parliament with a police force than we are at maintaining the social system in Europe.
Mr President, people need to be reminded in this debate that ports, as hubs of intermodal transport, play a key role in European transport policy as a whole.
Their levels of efficiency throughout the Union must be improved by agreeing framework conditions for fair competition both between and in ports.
The Commission proposal and this compromise we are discussing represent a cautious start to this work.
I would like to make a couple of observations regarding the content of the proposal. In my opinion, the duration of authorisations is too long, and the end result with regard to the matter of self-handling will be no more than a small step forward.
We could have gone further, taking into account our committee's insistence on the prevention of social dumping.
Nevertheless, this directive is a step in the right direction and Mr Jarzembowski deserves our thanks for working with such perseverance with regard to this difficult issue.
Mr President, the competition and race for profits that you wish to introduce into the administration of port facilities are already practised in maritime transport.
This has led to ecological disasters involving the Erika and the Prestige and finds expression in the employment of seamen at salaries ten times lower than European salaries.
When you talk of reducing the costs of port services, you are clearly talking in terms of lowering salaries, cutting jobs, increasing work rates and doing away with the forms of social and wage protection contained in the collective agreements.
We are therefore opposed to this European directive, and we call for ports and port facilities, which are useful to society as a whole, to be made a public service.
We reject the idea of having dock workers compete with one another on the basis of their status or origins, for that would be to the detriment of everyone.
All those who work at ports must benefit from the same conditions of salary and social protection, modelled upon the most advantageous available.
With regard to the dock workers who demonstrated before what became a besieged Parliament and were greeted by water cannon and tear gas, I should like you to assure us, Mr President and Commissioner, that the demonstrator who was arrested this afternoon, having chained himself up in the courtyard of the European Parliament, has definitely been released.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
I also welcome onto the platform some representatives of the dock workers who have got in.
Today I feel a bit like I am in the Middle Ages, in a fortified castle.
What can I add in a minute?
So much has been said already, but this afternoon I had another meeting with some of the people from the dock workers' unions, and I was impressed by their message.
This directive brings ports of convenience closer.
This directive organises social competition between the European ports which will result in social dumping and also, in time, the destruction of the dock workers' charter as we know it in Belgium.
Nobody is asking for this.
Europe is apparently the crowbar used to tackle problems in some countries.
Allowing self-handling without a prior compulsory licence has other negative consequences, as has already been mentioned here: a lack of safety and problems with environmental disasters at sea.
That is all we need.
My group and I are therefore voting against self-handling and in favour of the social protection of dock workers, and I hope that some socially aware fellow members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will follow suit.
Mr President, I naturally feel that Mr Dhaene's appeal to some socially aware colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was addressed to me personally, as I am one of them.
I would like to deal with just one point, namely that of compulsory licensing.
As the directive now says, it is being left up to the Member States to decide whether or not to issue a licence.
So they can choose for themselves.
In other words, the Member States and the port authorities are free to decide whether to operate an obligatory system of this kind or not.
At the same time, however, we are creating - and I do not understand this, Commissioner - an additional competition-distorting element in this directive itself.
What will happen is that one port will comply with the compulsory licensing rules and may impose strict conditions in terms of workers' qualifications, social conditions, safety, the economic development of the port and so on, and another port will not do so, which will ultimately distort mutual competition between the ports.
It is therefore being left up to the Member States to decide whether or not to do this.
My amendment, and an amendment that was also tabled by other people, concerning the introduction of compulsory licensing was declared inadmissible in the parliamentary committee on the basis of Rule 80 of the Rules of Procedure.
I have now been told that the President of this Parliament may now declare these amendments admissible after all on account of a number of new elements, which Mr Bouwman has referred to.
If this is the case then I will vote in favour.
I support compulsory licensing because I am in favour of the same competitive conditions existing in all ports.
Mr President, Commissioner, this directive and this proposal have their own personality.
We began with the rapporteur's positions, which gradually changed and which at the moment are being transformed by Parliament's vote.
I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur on doing his job, which is to defend the position of Parliament and not his initial position.
Furthermore, these negotiations have helped us to understand that Parliament must respect the Commission's exclusive powers of legislative initiative.
Some Members have tried to introduce proposals, but this has not been possible, which I believe is positive, because we must all respect everybody else's role.
This directive attempts to open up a European area of transport, which is absolutely essential, because at the moment the State areas are of no use to us.
This directive, with its proposal to open up the market, attempts to stimulate a mode of transport which is very positive in terms of its relationship with the environment.
Until now, maritime transport, apart from the transport of oil and dangerous goods, has been secondary, but it provides the possibility of improving European transport from the point of view of the environment, congestion and safety.
We have already had experience of access to the market in relation to other means of transport and there have been no dramas or traumas; therefore, what there has been is an increase in their management capacity.
It is true that, at the moment, with the proposals in the directive, we are not talking about reducing the number of jobs in ports.
We are talking about increasing the number of workers in ports while making them more efficient.
We must also forget the idea that liberalisation and lack of safety go hand in hand.
Aviation is a mode of transport in which safety is vital and nobody can claim that its liberalisation reduces safety.
Let us not forget, Mr President, that Parliament has made a great effort to bring its position closer to yours.
In conciliation you must now reciprocate in relation to self-loading and pilotage.
Mr President, I bring greetings from the Finnish dockworkers, who know how to load and unload ships professionally and competently.
They send their greetings and say that the proposal now before us should be rejected.
If it were to go ahead, stevedoring would become 'flag of convenience work'.
It would be done by people who sail on 'flag of convenience' vessels and who lack the special professional skills that are needed in the difficult snowy and icy conditions that exist in the north to guarantee the occupational safety of other dockworkers.
We have had bitter experiences of flag of convenience vessels flouting terms and conditions of employment and health and safety and environmental protection standards.
Under the guise of competition, ship owners are now trying to extend the exploitation of seamen from the seagoing context to the ports.
That cannot be accepted, given that it is being done on the pretence that it increases competition.
Both port employers' and workers' organisations unanimously agree that competition will not increase with this directive.
It is only economic and social dumping that will increase.
Mr President, Commissioner, free access to the port services market and equality of opportunities are requirements of the Union's Treaties and, in this regard, it is urgent that reliable information be available in order to regulate and monitor that no State provides aid to their ports, since this jeopardises free competition between the different Community ports.
There are, however, aspects which should not be exclusively regulated by the Union.
The Member States and their constitutional bodies with competences in this area must maintain their capacity to include their specific rules on invitations to tender for service-providing contracts and for the protection of the workers involved.
Furthermore, pilotage, mooring services and stowage, given their status as obligatory services, must not be included in the Community Directive, but their regulation must remain in the hands of the respective port authorities, without prejudice to respect for European social conditions.
And, just as an airport would be in chaos if it had various air traffic control companies, in a port there must only be one pilotage service and one mooring service and self-handling must not be allowed, and would only be acceptable if it were carried out by regular seafaring crew who furthermore are duly qualified and have sufficient knowledge to ensure that safety is not jeopardised.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jarzembowski, European industry needs efficient maritime transport.
That is something which the proposal for a directive on market access to port services, in the form in which it appears in the Council common position, is well placed to promote.
If adopted, quite a few of the changes now proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism at second reading, will, unfortunately, crucially undermine the directive's ability to contribute to just such more efficient maritime transport.
That particularly applies to the amendment to Article 4.9 whereby the provision that would give industry the option of self-handling using land-based personnel would disappear from the directive.
If this amendment were adopted, owners of consignments would, in the future too, be prevented from loading vessels using their own skilled and authorised personnel and their own resources.
If this and other unnecessary, and unnecessarily detailed, amendments were to be adopted, antiquated port structures would unfortunately persist, to the detriment of maritime transport's competitiveness.
We Swedish Moderates believe, moreover, that all port services, including pilotage services, should fall within the directive, for this could be a positive development for European trade, for an efficient, safe and competitive shipping industry and for better options in terms of transferring cargoes from road to water.
Many people want to achieve this, but extremely few are working towards doing so.
One step in the right direction would be to reject all the amendments that limit competition and to support those which really are aimed at promoting it.
That is something I hope Parliament will do.
Mr President, the Commission has proposed to us a legal framework guaranteeing respect for competition rules and for economic freedoms in order to permit freedom of access to the market for port services.
The initiative may be thought constructive in principle but, given the maritime disasters experienced by Europe in recent years, you will agree that there is the a need to ensure that the regulations voted for meet the demands of maritime security.
That is why it is important for the text adopted to consider each particular port service in its own right.
At first reading, I tabled two amendments designed to exclude pilotage and mooring services from the scope of the directive.
The House voted in favour of these, and that is something I am delighted about.
At second reading, our rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, once again proposed that pilotage services be excluded from the scope of the directive, a proposal not taken on board by the Council.
In the interests of consistency with our vote at first reading and in order to allow pilots to continue contributing to environmental protection and to safety in Community ports, I therefore request a vote in favour of excluding pilotage services from the scope of the directive.
On the issue of excluding mooring services, I think it would be preferable not to liberalise this service, which is also one of the key features of port safety.
An opening up to competition would be slightly more acceptable to the relevant services if certain points in the directive, such as self-handling, were to be reworded.
Having opted for self-handling, the ship owner must ensure that this is maintained throughout the operation.
We must avoid enacting regulations authorising an Ã  la carte system.
That is why I would encourage you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of Amendment No 13, seeking to limit self-handling to seagoing personnel.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you for all your points of view and comments, including those which reject the Commission's proposal.
I believe it is important that we can hold a debate and that you can present your arguments.
But there are certain issues I would like to clarify because, having heard some things which have been said here, it appears that we are talking about different texts.
Firstly, the general issue of whether or not we want a competitive maritime transport system which can be incorporated into an intermodal network and which can provide an alternative to road transport.
Yes or no?
Secondly, we have an entirely ideological question.
Some of you believe that monopoly is the ideal situation.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe in principle that the option of healthy competition is much better than a situation of monopoly.
This is essentially an ideological question.
Having said all this, the facts appear to point more to one side than the other.
It is true that there are elements, areas, market segments, which, due to a lack of size, do not allow for several operators.
But when there is competition things work better.
There is a higher quality of service, better prices and better costs, and more competitiveness.
Ladies and gentlemen, our air sector, as was said a moment ago, does not appear to have suffered as a result of introducing competition.
This Parliament wishes to introduce competition into the rail sector and has voted for that by a majority.
Here we are talking about also introducing competition into port services in large ports.
Ladies and gentlemen, you say that this puts an end to safety and you link it to the Prestige.
What does this have to do with the Prestige?
Absolutely nothing, ladies and gentlemen.
It bears no relation.
I am sorry, but they are different issues.
Furthermore, nobody is asking for a reduction in the safety elements.
This is why in the fields of pilotage and mooring services, in all these fields, specific and special precautions are being put in place, including in loading.
It is said that the port authorities, which have the best knowledge, can regulate conditions in their own cases - which may consist of a certificate or of proven knowledge.
We are allowing the port authorities to develop this aspect in accordance with their better knowledge of the situation in each European port.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that this is a proposal in favour of transport in general and also in favour of creating more work in our ports and having more competitive ports, which have more activity and which can cooperate in the economic development of the European Union.
That is what I am in fact doing in transport, in the ports, in the other sectors of transport and in energy.
That is quite simply what lies behind the Lisbon spirit.
In fact, what we are talking about here is a fundamental proposal and what we are proposing is the European model.
I will now discuss the second point that has been discussed, which is social dumping.
Nobody wants social dumping, ladies and gentlemen.
Nobody.
We want more work for more activity in ports and furthermore with adequate social guarantees and conditions.
Because, according to the European model, competition is introduced while maintaining social standards and guarantees.
That is the European model, which is regulated liberalisation and which is not genuine liberalisation.
Because liberalisation and regulation in principle appear to be contradictory, but, nevertheless, in Europe we are capable of combining the two elements: the advantages of the market with the guarantees of a system of solidarity.
And that is what we are doing, ladies and gentlemen.
I would read two things to the honourable Members.
One, what does self-handling mean?
Article 9 states that self-handling is the situation in which port services can be provided for an undertaking or by an undertaking for itself using regular personnel, not temporary personnel or personnel employed for a specific task, but 'regular land-based personnel and/or seafaring crew'.
The key is that we are talking about regular personnel.
But, as well as regular personnel, I would point out that Article 13(2) states that the national employment and social rules will be obligatory and that social dumping cannot take place.
Ladies and gentlemen, please read the way this text has ended up because I believe it is crystal-clear.
I believe we have to consider what we are doing.
We do not intend to reduce safety levels, to carry out social dumping, or anything of the kind.
If we were to abide by your fears in relation to liberalisations, Ryanair or Virgin would not be operating, for example, and we would all be living with State monopolies, and I believe that more than one of you makes use of Ryanair and Virgin.
So do I. Let us see if we can come to an agreement.
And we have not as a result reduced safety in European air transport.
Let us tell the truth, please.
I understand that there has been a protest outside this Parliament.
You are politicians, ladies and gentlemen.
So am I. We must listen to everybody, but let us tell the truth.
Nobody is proposing social dumping.
On the contrary, we are talking about guaranteeing social standards and requirements relating to employment, and of regular personnel, not temporary personnel.
If we restrict it to just seafaring personnel, we would then, on the contrary, be taking the wrong approach.
I believe we also have to consider land-based regular personnel equally.
The third element which you have insisted on once again is that of competition between ports.
Of course we are dealing here with competition between ports. What we have to ensure is that that competition is not unfair.
And in this regard I agree with the honourable Members and the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, in particular.
With regard to Amendment No 10, let us find a solution which can clarify it further, within the limits and margins laid down in the Treaty, which we clearly cannot change by means of this text.
Finally, the issue of timeliness, mentioned by Mr Savary.
He said that we should do everything apart from this.
Mr Savary, the problems of the maritime sector, maritime safety ... this House has done a lot of work, as have the Commission and the Council, to improve maritime safety and we know, and the honourable Members are perfectly aware, that if the rule we proposed had been in force, we could quite possibly have prevented the last accident.
Still more can be done and we are going to do it.
But let us not say that we have begun with the ports because that is not true.
On the contrary: we are practically ending with the ports.
We have a very serious transport problem in Europe and we must seek solutions which are alternatives to road and rail transport, in other words, land-based transport.
In an enlarged Europe, in which distances are increased, the maritime sector has many more possibilities and it makes much more sense to create European cabotage.
But in order to create European cabotage and for it to genuinely compete with other transport systems, that is land transport, we need efficient port services.
And that is what we intend, once again: to introduce competition into the large ports - I would insist - in a regulated manner, providing social and safety guarantees.
That is simply the European model.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (ARTICLE 120)
I deeply regret the fact that the Council and Parliament have chosen not to hear the protests of the tens of thousands of workers who, throughout Europe, have risen up against this proposal for a directive and who are today demonstrating in Strasbourg.
The common position approved by the Council on access to the port services market warrants the following comments:
'Self-handling' will endanger employment as well as the social conditions of port workers, since it does not enshrine respect for the legislation and collective bargaining agreements in force in the Member States,
it breaches ILO Convention No 137 on the stability of employment in the sector; on the stability of income gained from employing contracted workers in the sector and on the right of priority for gaining employment in ports,
it breaches principles that are enshrined in Portugal's constitution, which require, at the very least, a prior sounding to be taken of organisations representing workers,
it contradicts declared objectives increasing maritime safety, by allowing agencies from outside ports which do not, therefore, have a thorough understanding of their particular characteristics, to use nautical services and to handle cargo.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport [12695/1/2002 - C5-0585/2002 - 2001/0265(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at last we have reached an agreement so that this directive can be approved and we can therefore offer a stable framework for companies which are investing in these fuels.
I would like to stress and express my gratitude for the cooperation of the various rapporteurs - Mrs Rothe, Mr Kronberger and Mr Clegg - which has been excellent.
I trust that on Wednesday we will all support this directive.
The final text is not the one Parliament would have liked, since at first reading it stated its desire for binding objectives.
However, we have shown a significant degree of flexibility in order to bring ourselves closer to the Council's position and this has taken the form of nine amendments.
Of all of them, I would like to highlight the one relating to the reasons for which a Member State can have different objectives to those in question and I would respectfully ask the Commission to verify compliance with this Article 4 of the directive.
Commissioner, I congratulate you on this second directive to promote alternative and renewable energies which respect the environment.
But I genuinely regret not being able to extend these congratulations to other members of the Commission, who are resisting proposing coherent measures which, from the point of view of other policies, would assist compliance with this directive.
I am referring specifically to the Environment Directorate-General, which, since 1998, has been due to establish technical specifications for biofuels and captive fleets, as laid down in Directive 98/70/EC.
Establishing these specifications is urgent and inexplicably the opportunity to do so was missed on the occasion of the recent revision of the aforementioned Directive 98/70/EC.
Everything suggests that we will have to wait until 2005, when this directive is going to be reviewed, to have clear specifications.
I hope that this is not the case and that the problem can be resolved sooner.
For as long as these specifications do not exist there will be no quality standards to apply to biofuels.
This is a significant vacuum in relation to the quality of marketed fuels.
It is a paradox that the Environment Directorate-General should make proposals to reduce the sulphur content of all types of fuel and not make the least effort to promote the marketing of alternative fuels, which significantly reduce emissions and which contain no sulphur.
As for the Agriculture Directorate-General - what can I say? - it has recently presented a mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and this establishes aid for energy crops of EUR 45 per hectare, considerably lower than that for other crops and a more than insufficient maximum guaranteed area of one and a half million hectares for the whole of the European Union.
Furthermore, it is proposed that 10% of land must permanently be left fallow and energy crops will not be able to be produced there as they have been until now.
It should not be acceptable that, on an issue such as the one we are dealing with, with benefits for such diverse sectors as emissions, the replacement of oil and rural development, Community policies display such a flagrant lack of coordination.
Meanwhile, in the United States, Brazil or South America biofuels are receiving decisive and coordinated support from those governments.
The objectives set in the directive are ambitious, but achievable.
The action plan proposed by the Commission sets an objective of 20% alternative fuels by 2020.
Some may believe that this is unrealistic, but they also thought this of the directive promoting renewable energy which was approved two years ago.
This directive established clear time limits and objectives and continued the support systems.
Despite opinions to the contrary, the growth in these forms of energy has been astounding.
This directive is forward-looking and will open the door to the development of other fuels and technologies.
I have absolutely no doubt that, with will and solidarity, we can create a market for biofuels which ensures that they are competitive in the future.
I would therefore ask this Parliament to support the approval of the report next Wednesday and I trust that the Council will reach an agreement as soon as possible on the directive on the taxation of energy.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso, for the great rigour and care with which she has produced this report.
I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for the serious way they have analysed this report.
Furthermore, I would like to thank this Parliament for the support it has been giving to this issue from the outset.
With the adoption of this directive we will have specific legislation for combating greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector as well.
Furthermore, the directive provides benefits from the point of view of the security of energy supply and it may eventually lead to the creation of employment in rural areas.
An agreement on this proposal, without going to conciliation, would eliminate any possible final reservations of the members of the Council with regard to the Commission's proposals on tax relief for biofuels.
As you will know, this proposal now forms part of the framework directive on taxation in energy and I believe there has recently been really encouraging progress and we hope that the Council will soon adopt it and it will enter into force.
The Commission can accept all the amendments proposed, although I would like to comment on Amendment No 2 a little later.
Firstly, I will deal with Amendment No 8, which is the key amendment.
Throughout this entire process the Commission has promoted the inclusion of binding objectives.
We believe that this would send a very clear message to the industry with regard to the seriousness of our proposal on biofuels.
I recognise, however, that the procedure so carefully drawn up in the Council's Common Position, with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, provide a solid basis for action and may provide a system for reaching an agreement between the Council and Parliament.
For the first time, the States will have to establish objectives for biofuels.
These objectives will have to be based on the provisions of the directive; that is, 2% in 2005 and 5.75% in 2010, which represents an increase in the overall use of fuels in each of the countries.
This clearly represents a very significant but realistic increase - as the rapporteur said earlier.
The States which for any reason want to set lesser objectives, will have to justify it and there are a series of criteria on which that justification will have to be based.
It should be pointed out that the Commission, like Parliament, would have preferred the list of criteria to have been restricted to the points established in Amendment No 8.
However, we accept that equally valid reasons may still arise for the establishment of lesser objectives.
And we recognise that for the majority of States the use of biofuels in transport will be a new area of activity; we cannot therefore make a final judgment a priori on the obstacles which may arise.
The Commission is firmly convinced that any other criterion used by the States to justify different objectives must be equivalent to the those laid down in the directive.
Finally, I will mention Amendment No 2.
Recital 13 stresses the importance of the standardisation of fuels and proposes that the Commission and the standardisation bodies supervise and implement these standards in order to guarantee that biofuels gain the confidence of consumers and manufacturers.
Within this context, Amendment No 2 proposes stressing, in particular, volatility parameters.
However, there are various parameters in relation to rules for fuels and in this regard we believe that perhaps the amendment should say 'including volatility parameters'.
We can therefore accept this amendment in principle but with this modification.
I would like once again to thank the rapporteur, all the members of the Committee and Parliament for your support and naturally I can assure you once again that, as you have requested, the Commission will ensure strict compliance with the provisions agreed for this Directive and I hope that the Council will shortly approve the taxation elements, which are essential if it is to have real content.
Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez on the efforts she has made to achieve this successful outcome of a compromise.
Even if she is not wholly satisfied with it, I think she has done a splendid job.
It is just as well that we do not have mandatory requirements but I think that, given goodwill on all sides, we will see some progress in the application of biofuels.
With the European Union already importing 50% of its energy needs and this rising to 70% by 2030, it is important that we exploit all possible indigenous resources of energy as well as promoting greater diversity of energy sources.
By developing biofuels and other renewable energies we are contributing to increased security of supply.
In my constituency in Scotland, we have the materials and the know-how to be able to develop this industry and are eager to put these proposals into action.
We are also hoping to improve our environment with better air quality and a reduction in greenhouse gases.
In the blending of biofuels into conventional transport fuel we can introduce these changes in a simple way that will not require vehicles or filling stations to be adapted.
Biofuels also promise to create new jobs in rural communities through crop production and in the construction and operation of processing plants.
This will provide a well-needed boost to the flagging rural economies.
But biofuels remain uncompetitive without significant government tax breaks.
A 50% reduction in tax to match conventional fuel prices will mean subtracting a hefty chunk from Member State exchequers.
How many of our governments are prepared to lose this revenue?
We are also concerned that the proposals as they stand will not necessarily result in any major real environmental benefits: production methods for most biofuels use substantial amounts of energy and create high carbon dioxide emissions.
We may also see higher inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides.
Member States must decide to promote biofuels that give an overall cost-effective benefit to the environment.
Most importantly we must also invest in research to improve the cost effectiveness and environmental benefits of biofuel crops in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, for the important preparatory work she has done with regard to this vital issue.
We are now taking the first step in the right direction, although the use of biofuels must be promoted far more vigorously from here on in.
I think the targets should be binding, which is what Parliament insisted on at first reading.
Parliament's position also took account of the different circumstances that exist in the Member States by making it possible to have temporary derogations.
I well understand the rapporteur's willingness to show flexibility with regard to the mandatory nature of the targets in order for any real progress to be made in this important area.
This time we shall not get any further ahead.
The compromise amendments are satisfactory.
Many factors speak in favour of increased use of biofuels.
Firstly, by promoting their use we reduce the need for imported energy and hence the EU's dependence on external energy production, and especially oil imports.
Secondly, biofuels are a renewable energy source and therefore a much better option in terms of the environment than petroleum products.
I also regard as very important the point of view that biofuels are a means of boosting employment.
That means new opportunities for farms and also where agricultural competitiveness is facing huge difficulties in the more traditional areas.
Mr President, I support the action plan of the European Commission, which seeks to promote the greater use of alternative fuels in Europe between now and 2010.
Firstly, biofuels help to reduce over-dependence on oil-based fuels, which is a cause for concern as regards both the environment and security of supply.
Secondly, biofuels are environmentally friendly and they emit between 40 and 80% fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels.
We all know the target we must reach to comply with the provisions of the Kyoto Accord and reduce the excessive use of greenhouse gases, which only result in a depletion of the ozone layer.
Biofuels are in many cases manufactured from organic waste.
This makes it possible to use waste materials, which would normally be thrown away, in order to produce energy.
Biofuels offer new sources of income for European industries.
We must take advantage of the job opportunities which could be created in research and technological activity.
There is clearly a divergence of opinion between the Council and the European Parliament as to whether mandatory targets should be set for the use of biofuels in Europe.
We must do all in our power to bring about the greater use of biofuels.
The economic and environment benefits are obvious.
Biofuels must be introduced, targets met and the work of Member States' governments strictly monitored and evaluated.
European governments should radically change tax systems to encourage European industries to invest more in the biofuel industry.
It is not only the present generation which will benefit from these new changes, but also future generations.
I wish to compliment Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez on her excellent report.
Mr President, Commissioner, energy and the environment are two of the EU's most important challenges.
Both these challenges are placed before us when we talk about biofuels and alternatives.
Measures to reduce the impact upon the climate and to increase the security of supply are important.
The transport sector is one of the most important areas when it comes to the long-term security of supply.
This is strongly linked to environmental work, but the transport sector is also important to economic development and the possibility of growth.
Fuel alternatives are extremely welcome.
The use of biofuel may contribute to a reduction in the use of existing fossil fuels and to developments being steered in the right direction.
The 'right direction' means reducing the effect upon the environment.
Alternative fuels, including biofuel, must be introduced in a cost-effective way.
The objective of sustainable development must be our prime concern, and we must act with a view to the long term.
New technology is being developed constantly.
Today's new technology will be old-fashioned and ineffective tomorrow.
Through the decision we take today, we must avoid making future technological development more difficult than necessary.
We should instead behave in such a way as to facilitate future leaps in technology without ignoring safety or sustainable development.
As I said before, the decision we make must reflect long-term thinking.
The focus must therefore be upon promoting those biofuels that, in view of their life cycles, have particularly good characteristics in terms of climate, environmental impact and cost-effectiveness.
Trade and industry need stable basic conditions if managers are to feel confident about their assessments for the purposes of investment.
It must be possible to write off new plant in a manner commensurate with the timescales for technological development and with the costs of new plant.
It must not be made more difficult to use biofuels in their pure, or all but pure, forms than to use fuels blended from fossil fuels and a small amount of biofuel.
It is also important for the individual Member State to be able to decide what form of biofuel is most suitable on the basis of the fundamental conditions that prevail.
Given this background and the position adopted a while ago by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we are on the way to adopting a constructive long-term position in the European Parliament and one characterised by the goal of sustainable development.
Mr President, the directive now before us forms part of a whole area of legislation to promote the use of renewable energy sources in different sectors, and therefore represents some of the several and various measures to implement the Community strategy for sustainable development adopted at the Gothenburg European Council in June 2001.
The directive is especially important because developments in this very area of transport up till now have been absolutely pitiful.
My colleague, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, has really done an excellent job.
Transport accounts for more than 30% of the end use of energy in the Community and that figure is growing all the time.
This trend will become stronger still and there will therefore be an increase in carbon dioxide emissions.
This increase will be still greater in the candidate countries, relatively speaking.
According to the Commission's White Paper, carbon dioxide emissions associated with transport are estimated to increase by 50% over the period 1990-2010, and the main source of emissions is road traffic, which accounts for 84% of carbon dioxide emissions connected with transport.
This is why the White Paper is calling for less dependence on oil by the transport sector, for ecological reasons. This is currently at a rate of 98% and would be reduced by using alternative biofuel-like fuels.
Promoting the use of biofuels in keeping with sustainable farming and forestry practices will create new opportunities for sustainable rural development.
This could play a part in the creation of new jobs in rural areas.
Moreover, it will be possible to obtain by-products, which, owing to their vegetable protein-rich content, could be used as animal feed.
Growing plants for biofuel production would have to be combined with current programmes for cultivation, adhering to the principle of crop rotation.
To guarantee the existence of sustainable cultivation practices we should nevertheless draw up a set of clear environmental criteria so that, for example, using the same cultivated area later on for food production does not pose a risk.
The timetable approved by the Council only contains two targets with binding dates.
These must not be forgotten.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, once again for her work, as well as the committee and all the Members of Parliament and I would like to say that today we are discussing an important text which I hope Parliament will support when it votes.
It is important because, as Mrs Rothe has said, it is not sufficient simply to state principles.
It is not sufficient to say that 12% of our energy must be renewable. We must take measures so that that becomes the case.
I confess that when I make a promise I like to fulfil it.
The promise had been made by others.
I am trying to take measures so that this promise, this agreement, this commitment made by all the countries in this Parliament and in the Council, of 12% renewable energy, may genuinely be achieved.
I believe this is an extremely important measure, together with the provision on green electricity.
It is not perfect, we would all have liked to have had obligatory objectives, but I believe the compromise contained in this proposal is reasonable and puts significant pressure on all the States of the Union to finally comply with what has been said here.
In the transport sector there are very few measures we can take to reduce CO2 emissions, but this is one of them and, by supporting it, I hope that we can implement it quickly, in addition to the issue of taxes, which is essential if it is to really work.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
The next item is the oral question (O-0003/2003 - B5-0084/2003) to the Commission, by Mr Stevenson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the socio-economic crisis in the white fish sector.
(In the absence of the author of the question, the President gave the floor to the Commission first)
.
Mr President, last December, as the Commissioner has just outlined, following a five-day meeting of the Council of Ministers, a new transitional cod recovery plan was agreed which has had a devastating impact on much of the EU whitefish sector.
Under these new regulations, which came into effect on 1 February this year, savage quota cuts have been linked to draconian limits on fishing effort.
Whitefish vessels can now only fish for 15 days a month, including steaming time to the fishing grounds, and the 15 days will be reduced to 12 days unless a further 20% of the fleet is decommissioned.
We are literally asking our fishermen to burn their boats.
Scotland, where there are only 162 dedicated boats left in what used to be Europe's biggest whitefish fleet, will bear the brunt of these cuts.
If we scrap another 20%, the fleet will fall below the critical mass needed to sustain jobs in our harbours, ports and processing factories.
The industry will go into free fall.
In addition, the majority of the remaining vessels will be ones that, because they are under 10 years old, are not eligible for decommissioning subsidy.
These are the vessels on which the future of our whitefish fleet relies.
These are the vessels on which we rely to catch cod, haddock, plaice and other whitefish once the stocks have recovered and the total allowable catch limits have been increased.
Sadly, however, these are also the vessels with the biggest outstanding debts to the banks.
It would not surprise me if many of them were forced into bankruptcy.
The skippers and crews, who have often mortgaged their homes to raise the cash to build these boats, will lose not only their jobs and boats but also their homes.
But Scotland is not the only country affected by these draconian measures.
Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and France have all suffered cuts.
This is why the Committee on Fisheries voted unanimously - at least with only one abstention - to support this emergency resolution, the crux of which calls upon the Commission to adopt less drastic measures for the long-term recovery of cod which would secure the maximum number of jobs in the EU whitefish sector.
The resolution also calls for the allocation of an additional EUR 150 million to compensate fishers, processors and ancillary workers affected by these conservation measures.
I would suggest that EUR 48 million should be used for transitional funding to compensate fishermen and ancillary workers affected by the 15-days-at-sea fishing limits.
I would hope that this aid could be found from the flexibility instrument.
The balance of EUR 102 million should be reprogrammed out of the FIFG for the 2004 budget and should be targeted towards golden handshakes to induce fishers and ancillary workers to leave the industry, early retirement grants and retraining aid, as mentioned by Commissioner Fischler.
One day last week in Scotland the entire whitefish fleet agreed to switch off its satellite tracking systems for 24 hours in silent protest at the catastrophe that has engulfed the communities involved.
In the main fisheries inspection centre there is a large screen on which dozens of tiny lights indicate the position of each fishing boat in the North Sea and around the Scottish coast.
These lights represent information beamed from the satellite-tracking systems.
One by one the lights went out, signifying in a dramatic way the fate that awaits Scotland's whitefish vessels.
I hope the House will agree to provide this urgent and desperately needed support.
Our fishing communities are crying out for help.
Please heed their call.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and on behalf of my group, I would like to express our full support for the oral question and the resolution presented by Mr Stevenson on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, in which, as he has just said, it has been approved practically unanimously.
Fishing is an economic activity.
Sometimes we worry more about fish than about fishermen and we have to deal with both.
It is true that it is an economic activity that involves a natural resource which must be protected.
But this protection should be carried out through reasonable long-term measures, with expert scientific support - one of the European Union's outstanding tasks - and with the support of the sector in question.
And when these measures are taken in this way, the sector itself will accept them better.
Furthermore, we must lay down accompanying socio-economic measures in order to alleviate their possible consequences.
The motion for a resolution being presented today to the plenum in the name of the Committee on Fisheries has been entirely accepted and moves in the direction which we have discussed in the Committee on Fisheries not only for cod and for these white species, but for all species in general.
Today we are talking about cod and all the white species, but tomorrow we may talk about others and I believe that the solidarity with the people affected is laudable - in this case with the Nordic fishermen and essentially with the countries mentioned here, as well as Scotland, and all the Members have worked together on this.
I have been pleased by the words of the Commissioner in support of these measures proposed in the committee and I would like, Mr President, on a personal basis and as a Galician, to say that, just as this House showed solidarity with Galicia in the case of the failure to reach an agreement with Morocco or following the Prestige accident, it is now the turn of the Nordic countries and the Scots and we will stand together and show mutual solidarity.
Mr President, in December 2002 the Fisheries Council agreed a compromise which effectively halved catches for the Scottish and UK whitefish fleets and stopped vessels going to sea for more than 15 days a month.
These are drastic measures but far short of the all-out moratorium recommended to the Commission by its scientific advisors on fish stocks, ISIS.
United Kingdom and Scottish ministers have been attacked for agreeing to the hard-fought compromise.
At the time one of the fishing leaders commented that he doubted that the Archangel Gabriel could have got a better deal in the circumstances.
Inevitably such actions have a socio-economic impact on the communities that depend on fishing for whitefish - especially cod.
We must acknowledge this.
I give my personal support to the resolution before us this evening.
I also welcome the GBP 50 million compensation package approved by the Scottish Parliament last week and the related compensation packages in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
It is significant that we are discussing this issue as vital talks take place today and tomorrow in Brussels.
Scottish and UK fishermen have joined fellow fishermen and civil servants from other EU countries at the European Commission's Fisheries Advisory Committee.
Talks will focus on a long-term cod recovery plan.
I am delighted that the Fisheries Commissioner, Mr Fischler, will bring forward amendments to the current restrictions which have proved to be 'too rigid'.
However, the negotiations on the long-term recovery plan will be tough.
We really have to think carefully about the right road to take.
I want us to examine all possible options on effort control.
Saying 'sod the cod', allowing fishing to continue and hoping for the best is hardly an option, nor is renationalising the CFP.
This ducks the difficult issues posed by the need for stock recovery.
We really need to rationalise the CFP and cod recovery.
We must work in a cooperative manner with industry, ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution.
We must also create regional committees, allowing decisions to be taken as close to those affected as possible.
Doing nothing in the light of declining cod stocks is not an option.
The difficult task of arriving at a quota figure that is sustainable, yet scientifically credible, remains.
Mr President, in supporting this motion I speak particularly of the need to give financial assistance, both to cushion the socio-economic effects of the measures that have been taken and to help the industry to survive until the stocks have recovered.
For colleagues whose constituencies are landlocked I offer the following analogy: supposing for good environmental reasons, such as a drastic cut in CO2 omissions, road haulage operators were told by the EU that they could only use their lorries for two weeks out of every four, and then only on condition that a significant proportion of the vehicles were taken off the road altogether.
Imagine the fiscal consequences for the businesses concerned, then imagine that these businesses are the mainstay of towns and villages with fragile economies, and think what the outcome would be for local shops, schools and other services.
Sadly, we who represent fishing communities around the North Sea - certainly those of us from Scotland - do not need to use our imaginations.
We can already feel the effects.
Of course assistance with restructuring can be given from within Member States.
As Mrs Stihler has already said, the Scottish Executive has managed to find GBP 50 million from its already restricted budget. That is a measure of the seriousness of the situation.
But I believe that the EU too must shoulder some of the financial responsibility.
This is in part because past shortcomings of the CFP have contributed to the crisis. To a larger extent, it is because any democracy must adhere to the moral principle that where the direct effect of legislation is the destruction of people's honest livelihoods, they are at least compensated accordingly.
I hope that the EU counts itself as such a democracy and that this principle will be fully expressed in the forthcoming vote.
Mr President, just this once I shall resist the temptation to lambast the Commission and the Council for their contributions to the crisis facing the whitefish sector in Scotland.
I can assure fellow Members that there certainly is a major crisis of confidence in the European Union's ability to manage fisheries at all.
However, I will concentrate my remarks tonight on the main and most important purpose of the resolution which accompanies this question, that is, the social and economic consequences arising from the decisions made at the December Fisheries Council.
Businesses are already feeling the pain from the interim cod recovery measures: not just the fish-catching sector, but whole communities.
It is predicted that the long-term recovery plan will continue to inflict real economic and social hardship.
I hope, therefore, that this House will unite in support of this resolution, calling for up to EUR 150 million of additional EU funding - and 'additional' is the important word here.
This amount would be in addition to Member States' commitments, constituting a fund to help offset the widest possible range of economic and social consequences that the European Union fisheries management decision will inflict.
My preference would be to aim for the use of the flexibility instrument for this.
Not so long ago, as has been pointed out, the political will of this House and the Council, and the loss of fishing rights in Moroccan waters, brought about a similar, highly-concentrated downturn in activity.
There will have to be detailed discussion of plans and priorities for the use of such a fund, but I certainly hope that this week we will take the first step towards setting it up.
I call upon the UK Government to abandon its previous resistance to taking part in such a process.
Mr President, there must be no doubt at all about the objective of the harsh measures proposed by the Commission and endorsed by the Council concerning cod stocks in the North Sea.
The aim is, in fact, long-term restocking designed to preserve as many jobs as possible in the fishing communities that have been netting white fish for years and that are to be temporarily and fairly compensated and not required to diversify once and for all into other areas of activity.
In order to attain this objective, we need not, however, confine ourselves to these draconian measures for limiting the number of days on which fishing is engaged in.
It is imperative that we learn lessons from the Canadian experience, which we need to examine very carefully indeed.
The moratorium introduced in the North Atlantic twelve years ago has not, I regret to say, had the expected effect. The cessation of fishing has had no effect upon the state of cod stocks off Newfoundland and Nova Scotia and in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.
Forty thousand jobs have been destroyed but, for all that, there has been no restocking.
The Canadians now recognise that fishing is just one factor among others in the development of cod stocks. Other factors play key roles and must be studied much more shrewdly and taken into account to the same extent as fishing: climatic factors, the change in water temperature, the importance of natural mortality and the significant removal of cod by seals, of which there is a population explosion, as well as by mackerel and herring, which are proving to be great consumers of cod eggs.
It would also seem that, in Canada, fishermen have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation and management of restocking plans.
If we want our game plan to give us every chance of success, it is therefore vital quickly to define a framework in which it will be possible to collate local experience and scientific expertise on a permanent basis and not confine ourselves to banning fishing and keeping vessels in port, as if such measures alone were automatically going to result in restocking.
The latter, rudimentary courses of action must necessarily and quickly be supplemented by in-depth analyses - funded through the release of financial resources - of a wide range of factors, extending to include the effects of fishing for the purpose of producing fishmeal. This would make it possible to implement a much more elaborate administration policy and so to preserve as far as possible what must remain our chief objective: a future for the fishing communities concerned.
Mr President, it is very sad that we are having this debate tonight and that we need to give GBP 150 million in funding to help the fishing industry.
It is because of the failure of the common fisheries policy that we are having to provide this money.
We should also look at industrial fishing - and I know there are mixed views about this - in which sand eels are extracted from the sea bed.
Sand eels are part of the food chain of the cod and these things are all linked.
The process of having quotas for fish and throwing healthy fish overboard over the years has also contributed greatly to the position we are in.
But we must now face up to the reality that cod stocks are low and that the families and communities involved in the fishing industry who need support should receive it.
I strongly support the resolution to provide GBP 150 million of additional funding.
I would urge the UK Government to take this up and use it in a very efficient way.
One of the problems with funding of this type, as was found when it was used in Spanish waters, is that it is very difficult for the fishing boats, those tied up for the processing industry and others, to claim these funds.
I would urge Commissioner Fischler to look at the way this money can be spent.
If we offer people money and they cannot then obtain it, they will only end up more frustrated than they were before.
I urge everybody to support this.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am able to say straight away that I support the resolution.
The resolution deals with those aspects we are discussing in Parliament and, in general, with what gives rise to the problems in the regions when we implement such dramatic decisions concerning certain fish stocks - in this case, cod in particular.
There can be no doubt that there must be a balance in the marine environment.
There must be a balance in the stocks.
Clearly, such dramatic decisions can, however, be damaging to the regions and to those communities that depend upon fisheries and the industry surrounding fisheries. The EU must therefore intervene and raise some of these problems.
In that connection, I should also like to draw attention to the fact that fisheries-based industry and gutting and canning firms must have raw materials, and it is therefore now time for us to review the tariff barriers that prevent the raw materials from reaching our companies in the EU.
Price mechanisms and tariff barriers mean that the prices for these raw materials are very much higher than the prices for the same raw materials on the world market.
Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to make it clear from the outset that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is very concerned about the socio-economic crisis within the white fish sector and that we are also in favour of providing financial compensation to those fishermen affected by necessary measures to save and conserve the cod stocks.
This crisis must not prevent us from taking necessary measures to conserve the white fish and cod stocks in the long term, and item 2 of the resolution is therefore very important.
In this, the European Parliament calls upon the Commission and the Council to ensure that changes to the measures taken to conserve cod stocks are made in such a way as not to lead to a further reduction in cod stocks but, rather, to maximise their chances of recovery.
The Greens have also tabled a new amendment in which we ask the Commission and the Council to take account of the fact that ISIS researchers believe that many cod stocks in EU waters are now down to a critically low level.
I do not believe that any of the laboured arguments we have heard in Parliament are of any help.
Clearly, it is the fishing effort that matters.
New test trawls on Sweden's west coast also show that cod stocks are at their lowest level for 23 years and that the number of one year-old fish of this species amounts to only a tenth of the number a year ago.
This is worse than we thought.
It is therefore also an unprecedented scandal that the EU is preventing us from calling a halt to cod fishing in these waters, which we would do by means of a moratorium.
That this is a disaster is a matter of actual fact.
We have our hands tied, which is enormously frustrating.
I really want to question the way in which the Commission is acting in this matter.
Mr President, the fisheries industry in crisis - we have heard it all before.
But this time it is extremely serious.
Where I come from in Northern Ireland fishermen have already suffered severe setbacks and quotas and have cooperated in six-week closures during the spawning season, for the last three to four years.
That was done in a cooperative way.
No doubt they will cooperate again in the future, if such closures happen.
But what is the future to be?
It certainly looks very bleak at present for those fishing communities.
That is why I believe that this proposal - which I support - gives hope to the people who live in these remote communities, where no other hope exists for them and no one seems to want to help.
By that commitment to those areas we would begin to show that we are giving them a lifeline for some kind of a future and that they have not been forgotten.
As to that future, I have no doubt that the industry must be involved in the decision-making process.
This has been one of the weaknesses down the years, for as long as I can remember.
The scientists blame the fishermen, the fishermen blame the scientists and we try to find a way through.
High-wire negotiations only lead to mistrust.
I was in Brussels, along with Mr Stevenson, when the negotiations took place last December.
The way they were conducted was no way for us to conduct such important negotiations.
I hope you will bear that in mind and make sure it does not happen again.
I appeal for the stakeholders in the industry to be consulted in a meaningful way, not with platitudes.
Their views should not be overlooked in any way.
We are discussing people's livelihoods, their way of life, indeed their very existence.
I call on the Commission and the United Kingdom Government - because in the past they have not shown themselves to be prepared to put up the matching funding - this time to put their money where their mouth is and make sure they give support to these communities.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for this additional answer.
At the end of this debate, I have received a proposal for a resolution on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries.
The vote on this resolution will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
I declare the 2002-2003 annual session closed. I would remind you that, pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, the European Parliament will meet tomorrow, Tuesday 11 March 2003, at 9 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 10.29 p.m.)
Opening of the session
I declare open the 2003-2004 session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of several Basque Members of this House. I am also fully committed to the defence of all human rights, especially the most basic right of all, namely the right to life.
As some honourable Members will be aware, Domingo DurÃ¡n, an officer in the Spanish national police force died last Friday at the age of 51. Eight years ago he was guarding a Bilbao office processing national identity cards and lost the use of all four limbs as a result of an attack by ETA.
Mr Cox, I believe it would be appropriate for you to issue a condemnation of violence of any kind in your capacity as President of the European Parliament. In particular, I call on you to condemn terrorist violence in pursuit of political aims, and to convey the condolences of the House to the family of this victim of terrorism.
As an expression of our solidarity with the people of Spain and especially the Basques I would also like to call on all those present in the House today to join in a minute's silence in defence of freedom, political coexistence and respect for the rule of law.
Mr President, further to your reference to Guantanamo Bay, I should like to inform the House that a group of Christian Liberation Movement activists has been rounded up, harassed and attacked in Santiago, the capital of Cuba.
I expect you are aware that the president of this movement is none other than Oswaldo PayÃ¡, the winner of the 2002 Sakharov prize. Mr PayÃ¡ has issued a statement detailing the events and calling on all governments and institutions to bring pressure to bear to ensure that these peaceful activists who belong to his movement survive unharmed.
I would therefore urge you to take up the case of these people, Mr President.
We will do that.
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission strategy for 2004/2004 budget guidelines:

The debate on the state of the Union is an established item on our agenda.
It gives us the chance to look at progress in the year just ended and our objectives for the current year.
This year, the debate falls at a particularly sensitive time in terms of both international affairs and the life of the Union.
The Iraq crisis, enlargement and the Convention weigh so heavily on our minds and hearts that there is no need for me to mention them. I shall only stress that today's debate gives us all the duty to weigh up the opportunities and challenges connected with the unification of our continent and to reflect on the lessons to be drawn from the Iraq crisis at a time when we are drafting the new constitutional charter of our Union.
Let me start with enlargement today.
Last December, we wound up accession negotiations with ten countries.
Ten countries we should now call 'acceding', not 'candidate' countries.
Meanwhile, negotiations are going ahead with Bulgaria and Romania so that they can join shortly afterwards and, with the necessary adjustments, joint work is continuing with Turkey.
In this regard, before you all, I want to express my thanks to the Commission staff and Commissioner Verheugen for their dedication and their hard work.
The Union's task, however, in the area of enlargement does not end with the decision taken at Copenhagen.
Indeed, Croatia's recent application shows that another region of Europe is knocking at our door. Here I refer to the western Balkans.
I want to make it quite clear that the unification of Europe cannot be regarded as complete until the Balkan countries are members of the Union too.
This prospect of membership must be clearly offered, while it must also be stressed that the criteria followed in the first round of enlargement will be applied just as strictly.
After years of uncertainty, democratic debate in both the old and the new Member countries of the Union will now be on firm ground.
The very positive outcome of the referendum in Malta is an auspicious sign and an incentive to even greater efforts.
Important though it is, the accession of the new Member countries is only one stage in the process, and it must not obscure the fact that there is still much to do.
The first job is to complete economic integration.
The current 15 Member States can and must do much more to promote growth and employment and to reduce disparities.
It is the future Members, however, those that are to join next year and those that will join a little later, which warrant the greatest attention.
Our shared goal must be to foster sustained growth, strengthen cohesion, step up environmental protection, reduce disparities and, ultimately, encourage all to adopt the euro.
Broadly speaking, those are the main points of our economic integration project.
While this is our first priority, the second task is to advance the political debate, and that is equally important.
It is time we had an in-depth, honest, completely transparent debate on the type of Europe we want to build together.
The very success of our integration has already made it unavoidable.
The Iraq crisis and the state of international relations mean we can put it off no longer.
The possibility of war in Iraq deeply stirs the feelings of Europeans because reconciliation and peace lie at the very foundations of the European Union.
It affects us Europeans all the more here and now because chance would have it that four of our Member Sates and one candidate country are currently members of the UN Security Council.
In this situation, we have to guard against two temptations.
One temptation would be to build a Europe that is in opposition to the United States.
This crisis is marked by widely diverging views on the instruments to be used.
These differences are important because they mark the line between war and peace, but they do not affect the ultimate objective of our policies or the solidity of our alliance or cast doubt on the whole web of transatlantic relations, our shared history and the extent of our bonds.
The second temptation we must guard against is focusing solely on the dissension within the Union. Differing views have clearly emerged among both the 15 Member States and the future Members in recent weeks.
However, as the extraordinary meeting of the European Council of 17 February rightly pointed out, we are all agreed on a large number of fundamental points. We all want the UN to remain the cornerstone of world order.
We all support the Security Council in carrying out its duties. We all believe that war is not inevitable but, at the same time, we think that Iraq must be made to face up to its responsibilities.
That said, we must confront our weaknesses head on.
Indeed, we Europeans not only have a political obligation to reach a common position: after Maastricht, we are obliged by the Treaties to show loyalty and mutual solidarity.
The Member States on the Security Council have a particular duty to coordinate their actions and keep others informed of what is happening, while the permanent members should defend the positions and interests of the Union.
The mechanisms for this are clearly inadequate, but does this mean we have to wring our hands and conclude that the objective of joint action is unachievable?
Absolutely not.
Failure to put in place effective procedures and instruments that facilitate the emergence of shared positions will make it hard to forge a common Union foreign policy and will certainly delay it.
Our imagination and our determination must be equal to the challenge.
Giving in is absolutely out of the question.
The questions before us, which we have to answer, are both difficult and crucial.
What kind of Europe do we want?
What guideline are we following?
I personally cannot be content with a 'supermarket', or some sort of large Single Market.
Do we not want to build a genuine political area that allows us to affirm and defend our principles and our values throughout the world?
Then we cannot continue indefinitely in this state of 'European schizophrenia' in which we expect the Union and the integration process to provide prosperity and development while relying on the United States to guarantee our security.
European public opinion is remarkably clear about what it wants.
The regular Eurobarometer surveys carried out by the Commission reveal that our citizens, in particular, want the Union to ensure their security, both at home and abroad.
This afternoon, to step up our commitment in the defence sector, the College will adopt a Communication strengthening the European defence industry.
On the question of war and peace - and we have had a spectacular and unprecedented demonstration of the public's views in the streets and squares of our cities - the shared views of the public know no barriers in Europe.
This is a sign that the peoples of Europe are moving closer together, a sign which prefigures and anticipates the reform of the European institutions and procedures.
This shared sentiment, this spontaneous sharing of values in no way reduces the importance of an in-depth, open political debate: it only emphasises the need for it even more.
It was no accident that the Commission's first contribution to the Convention on 22 May 2002 proposed a project for Europe that highlighted, amongst other things, the need for a Union that can 'exercise the responsibilities of a world power.'
One of the few benefits of the tragic Iraq crisis is that it is actually forcing us to talk honestly about the very nature of our way of coexisting and doing things.
We must not be afraid of an open debate, for it is only through dialogue that possible solutions can emerge.
This brings me to the Convention.
I have always believed that our mission was to bring about enlargement and reform of the institutions in parallel.
As they stand, the institutions and procedures, conceived and designed for a community of six largely homogenous States, no longer meet the requirements of a larger, more diverse Union.
That is why I feel it is positive that the candidate countries have been full members of the Convention right from the beginning and that they are making an active contribution to it.
Indeed, I would like to stress that one of the most encouraging aspects of the Convention's work is precisely the way delegates meet and work in a variety of mixed configurations that make any distinction between the representatives of the present and the future Member States essentially impossible.
This is not the time or the place to go into the progress made by the Convention, but I would like to say that the wide consensus on issues such as the constitutional nature of the text to be produced, the streamlining of instruments and procedures, the full inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the legal personality of the Union is grounds for optimism regarding its conclusion.
As I have said, this is not the place to go into details, but there is one point I regard as essential, in the light of both the international crisis and the role the Union is called to play on the international stage; I am referring to the use of majority voting across the board.
The requirement of unanimity actually causes paralysis, as we have seen in recent days.
This is already the case now and will be even more of a problem in the enlarged Union we have decided to build.
This is another reason why we need an open political debate on the new enlarged Europe.
Only if we have devised a common project will we be ready to fully accept the basic rule of every democratic institution, which is majority voting.
Only when we feel that we agree on all the basic elements that unite us will we be able to accept being in a minority whenever necessary while still feeling fully represented.
Ladies and gentlemen, today's annual policy strategy debate will define the political horizons and resource framework for 2004.
It kicks off a process that will end with the adoption of the budget and the presentation of the legislative work programme for next year.
Throughout this process, we shall be engaged in an intense detailed debate with Parliament and the Council in order to define the fundamental political options.
I would stress that the work of the Parliamentary committees will be of crucial importance here, in particular.
A new element in the strategy for next year is the 2004 - 2006 multiannual programme that is to be approved by the European Council, a completely new departure.
I am confident that our interinstitutional cooperation will generate a work programme that matches our ambitions, and we have very high ambitions, as is quite clear from the political priorities we have set ourselves for 2004.
Indeed, next year, our efforts will focus on enlargement, growth and internal and external security.
Without going into the details of the individual aspects of this programme, I would like to draw your attention to the issue of our relations with countries that are already our neighbours or will be neighbours of the enlarged Union.
I am referring to the band of countries stretching from Russia and Ukraine to Morocco.
With this ring of friendly countries we propose to step up cooperation to start a process that may in time lead us to share 'everything except institutions' with all of them.
A common market, a reinvigorated political dialogue based on shared principles and values and the harnessing of the full external potential of our common policies: these are the pillars of the new strategic concept for the Union that we are setting out in a communication on a 'Wider Europe'.
Only in a wider area of stability and prosperity can Europe deal safely with the sometimes disturbing developments on the world stage and fully exploit the opportunities offered by globalisation.
Like all Europe's policies for the coming years, this medium- to long-term strategy for relations with neighbouring countries calls for the preparation of a political project for the Union, and its financial implications will need to be determined.
The medium-term political programme preparing the forthcoming Financial Perspective will play a key role here.
The Financial Perspective must not only be in line with the constitutional Treaty that will emerge from the Convention and the subsequent intergovernmental conference but also lay the necessary foundations for an enlarged Union that strives to achieve three major political objectives: peace, freedom and solidarity.
In this regard, by the end of the year or, at the latest, in early 2004, we shall put forward our overall political project for the enlarged Europe and outline the broad guidelines for the financial proposals it calls for.
Then, we will prepare the relevant legislative proposals so that they are ready for adoption towards the middle of next year.
We have completed the enlargement negotiations.
Now we must define the political project for the enlarged Union.
This means we must say what can be done at Union level to foster and safeguard civil liberties, how the Union can complement Member States' laws in fundamental areas such as health, security and the area of freedom and justice, what policies at Union level can best contribute to sustainable prosperity in Europe, what objectives the Union should set itself to further regional and social cohesion in an enlarged Europe that will have much greater economic disparities than the Union of Fifteen, what changes will be needed in research policy and the Structural Funds to achieve those objectives, whether expenditure on cohesion should rise, fall or remain unaltered if economic inequalities are to be reduced both between Union countries and within the individual Members, and, lastly, what policies are needed to project the European model externally, particularly in countries that are close to us.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen today, the Union is a Union on a journey.
A Union that must draw on present experience to grow stronger, so that it can assert its identity and its role in the world more decisively.
The current crisis must serve as an incentive for us to speed up the reform process which is underway. This process is necessary irrespective of enlargement, but enlargement and the present international context make it even more imperative and urgent.
Today, we have a chance to reinvigorate our unity. Our fellow citizens are calling for this and events leave us no choice.
The Convention is a potential turning point in the life of our Community: let us all strive to make it a success.
Together, we can succeed.
Together, we can and must lay the political and financial foundations to complement the institutional basis and open this new chapter.
The work we accomplish together this year and next year will, to a large extent, dictate the nature and role of the Union in the world, the Union we will leave to future generations.
Mr President, first of all, the PPE-DE Group appreciates the documents which the Commission has put in front of us this morning.
It is an historic and unique occasion.
This is the first time in our history where we have had the opportunity to debate budget guidelines with policy documents at the same time.
So now we can see how we begin to fit the priorities to the resources available.
It is a pity that the Council is not with us because it too could have been part of this debate.
I shall start with the broad document which has been produced by the Commission this morning.
It sets out the outline of Union finances post-2006, rightly asking which project we want in terms, for example, of the competences that the Union will have, the limits to the geographical size of the Union, and a whole range of matters which set our budget debate in the right perspective.
First I shall deal with the substance.
It is right that we should have a range of ideas, with working groups set up by the Commission dealing with peace and prosperity and with questions of sustainable development.
But in terms of the external side, the working group does not cover what the external dimension of the Union should be.
As the President said about the current context, it would seem to be relevant that we should be thinking about substantive issues such as what the transatlantic partnership is going to be like in five years' time.
We have asked for a report.
It has not been produced.
Indeed, we included in the budget for this year - 2003 - a request to have a document drawn up.
When one asks the question, 'what should be the strategic priorities for the Union in the external field to 2007?' a deathly silence descends.
Next, in terms of procedure, we should be a little careful that this Commission, although very active in looking forward to the next financial perspective, could bring us in theory to 2013, which not only covers the next Commission but also the Commission after that.
To find ourselves in 2003 already discussing 2013 all seems rather far away.
In this context there is one specific question I would like to ask the President of the Commission.
The last phrase of this interesting document says that the duration of the next financial perspective could be brought into line with the five-year mandate of the Commission and of the European Parliament.
Does that mean that the financial perspective would be to 2010 instead of 2013?
The PPE-DE Group is in favour of the financial perspective covering a five-year period.
I would like some clarity on that point.
While talking about the Commission, Mr President, you mentioned the Convention.
When we envisage a post-2006 Union with 500 million people or more, how will it be possible to run a Union with fewer Commissioners than we have today?
There seems to be this refrain across the House at the moment that we should have 10 to 12 Commissioners.
I do not see how we can run a Commission with only 10 to 12 Commissioners when most governments have at least 30 to 35 ministers to run their own countries.
We are dealing here with the Union, a much bigger enterprise, so why not have 30 or 35 Commissioners?
It seems to me quite normal that we should do so in the context of the Union of tomorrow.
Secondly, the priorities of the budget for 2004 are well set out in the annual policy strategy document in terms of the three points that are made.
Concerning sustainable growth, it makes sense to have better integration of environmental concerns.
In addition, the PPE-DE Group is interested in the document concerning a better relationship with our neighbours in terms of security and stability.
Above all, we are interested in the enlargement process and in making sure that we can fulfil our obligations and that Member States are fully integrated into the Union after 1 May 2004.
We also share the view that the procedure for dealing with these policy strategies as they go through the committees and then through the budget process will be very important in order for us to be able to see that they are properly brought together.
The questions we will be asking concern the significant rise of 780 in staffing numbers and, in particular, whether we need so many civil servants in the interpretation and translation departments.
Finally, I come to my group's priorities during the budgetary process.
We remain faithful to what has guided us in the last few budgets in terms of three particular elements which are important to us.
Firstly, the completion of the reform of the institutions.
This is where the Commission started out.
We would like to ensure that this reform is completed by the end of our mandate.
We still find irritations here.
Yesterday mention was made of a document which was quoted partially in the press about the ongoing affair of the chief accountant who has been suspended.
We would like to see that document.
It is not so secret - most Members, including myself, have a copy.
Why is there this fear, this wish to keep secret a document that is already half-known?
We would like to see that document as soon as possible.
Secondly, there is the question of the A-30 subsidy lines - a specific, but very sensitive point for Parliament.
We would like to be clear on what the Commission will be proposing in terms of these subsidies for particular institutions.
We have differing views across Parliament as to what should and should not be benchmarked and we need a common approach on that.
My last comment pertains to a letter I have from the Secretary-General about follow-up to parliamentary acts.
Here we find that at least 25% or 30% of reports that we ask for in this House are never produced.
It states with regard to Parliament resolutions on COS documents that, of the 490 requests we made last year, the Commission has decided not to follow up 104 cases.
We would like clarification as to why the Commission is not doing what Parliament requests and we certainly feel that there should be some reflection in the budgetary process if the Commission does not wish to do what Parliament has requested.
I conclude by saying that this is a key moment in this budgetary process.
The Commission has set out some useful lines of discussion and debate looking ahead post-2004.
I hope that at the end of the process our Parliament will be able to reach the right conclusions in the interests of our citizens.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we are presented here today with a highly technocratic document and a speech by you, Mr Prodi.
I would not want to deny that the speech, being political, is more to my taste.
What I would like to do is to try and bridge the gulf between the two elements.
You are indeed right, President Prodi, to say that the framework conditions are far from favourable, and they will probably not be anything like favourable in 2004 either.
The threat of war in Iraq has opened new fault lines within the European Union and also within the candidate countries.
Today, unless there is radical change, our foreign and security policy lies in tatters, and economic developments - particularly where jobs are concerned - have not been as favourable as we expected.
This means that we have to take a rather more critical approach to things.
Let me start with what enlargement is intended to achieve. It is indeed the case that we have to see to it that enlargement ends up being a success.
To all those who - perhaps with the events of the last few months in mind - have given it as their opinion today that we have to delay enlargement, I would like to put the counter-argument that this would divide and weaken Europe still further.
I concede, though, that many of us are disappointed at how little evidence there is among many of our neighbours - and, admittedly, among some of our members - of any emotional and intellectual attachment to the European project.
They are right to say that the European Union is not a supermarket, and that it is not a bank either, one from which one just collects money for a few projects.
Nor is it an artefact that exists only to be used as a justification when unpleasant but necessary reform measures have to be taken.
Mr President, I believe that we have probably all failed - and not only in relation to the Iraq issue - to highlight the objectives and actual raison d'Ãªtre of the EU as a peace project.
President Prodi mentioned the International Criminal Court.
Here too, we have neglected to convince the new members of the immense importance to us of, for example, the International Criminal Court, and also of the United Nations, and of how dear these multilateral institutions are to us.
That was a mistake and a failure.
Perhaps we are paying the price for what was sometimes a too legalistic and narrow view of the acquis communautaire.

The Commission is now proposing that we should establish a circle of friends around the enlarged EU, but, President Prodi, we have, over the past few years, not even managed to gain enough friends among the governments of the candidate countries, and we have to concede that the Americans have sometimes had more success in alienating at least the governments of certain countries even before their accession, using lobbyists' money, a closely-woven network of institutions and foundations, some of them funded by the diaspora, and, where necessary, pressure and threats as well.
The Commission also has the task of considering how we can counteract that, and how, above all at the level of culture and society, we can put the European idea across to more of the public, in addition to the united voice of the European Union.
Let me now deal with stability in and around Europe.
Here too, I believe, we have to take a rather broader and deeper view of the individual regions and shape relationships along appropriate lines.
The objectives involved are too imprecise and undifferentiated, as Russia needs to be handled in a different way from the Mediterranean, which in turn calls for an approach different from that taken to the Balkan countries, which, by the way, have been potential candidates ever since the Zagreb Summit even though this paper states that they have yet to acquire that status.
We must concede, though, that our visa policy as regards these countries - to which I travel very frequently - is lousy.
Business people, scientists, journalists, students - all those who could help to foster friendship with these countries - are often deterred by a visa policy that is highly restrictive, mindlessly unmoveable and bureaucratic, irksome to these people and, above all, to the most important opinion leaders in the countries from which they come.
We must of course have a restrictive visa policy, but these social groups could receive flexible treatment under it.
Now for the third objective - sustainable growth. I admit that this is a very vague concept, but it is one that already means a number of things to me.
I simply ask myself whether we really do have a coherent policy for growth.
We invest too little - not only in research and development, but also in infrastructure.
Think of public transport, which could also do more for the environment.
Too little is being done to make educational establishments more efficient while maintaining access to them for the broad mass of the population.
We often accuse people - our own citizens - of lacking the willingness and courage to take risks.
If, though, the gaps in the social networks in our own countries become ever wider and let more people fall through, it is not surprising if people are often afraid - of risks as much as of anything else.
Likewise, the progressive undermining of services of general interest - an area in which we are still awaiting a coherent policy from the European Union, and especially from the Commission - often has the unfortunate effect of leading some people to blindly oppose globalisation, or, at any rate, to be suspicious of the common market.
Here, too, I want to underline what you said. The European Union is indeed not a supermarket.
We should be perfectly capable of combining the objectives of sustainable development with social market economic policies.
My group does not see the desire for greater individuality, more flexibility, more mobility, more - to use a new expression - employability, as an antiquated concept.
We will have succeeded when people throughout Europe have an appropriate social security network available to them.
My group is firmly convinced that - even if only to avoid unfair competition - this network must also embrace those who have migrated here.
We must therefore affirm our commitment to a European model of capitalism, one that, in the long term, is more efficient, more social, and more humane.
Let me conclude by reiterating my warm welcome, and that of my group, for this paper.
It is my belief, though, President Prodi, that, as you said in your speech, we need more conviction in matters of policy, as well as strategies that come to terms with the popular mindset, both in our own countries and among our neighbours.
Do something, Mr President, to ensure that the Commission's documents clearly express the nature of the European project - that it is neither technocratic nor administrative, but political.
Mr President, at a time when the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe have been subject to quite a great deal of criticism from EU Heads of Governments, and from European Commissioners and others, for making their views on the Iraq crisis known, the ELDR Group strongly welcomes the statement from the European Commission that the central priority must and will remain enlargement.
It is in our view absurd that so many criticisms have been made of candidate countries; they have been reprimanded in a condescending manner when the divisions that have opened up within the European Union in the current crisis are almost entirely of the making of the existing Member States.
It is of course true that the European Union is not a supermarket, but equally it is not a temple in which people who speak a little too loudly are asked to remain quiet.
The reasons why divisions have opened up are largely to do with insistence by existing Member States on a slavish allegiance to Washington, or an equally stubborn hostility to everything that emanates from the United States.
The candidate countries are innocent bystanders in that debate and should not be penalised for having being pressured into making their views known.
That is why we strongly welcome your emphasis, President Prodi, on making sure that these current problems do not in any way derail or slow down the enlargement process and hope that you will do everything possible to see the enlargement process through to its logical conclusion next year.
The second point I would like to make is on the issue of governance.
This document is a useful step forward in the improvement of EU governance and to that extent we welcome it warmly.
It is crucial that governance is improved at an institutional level.
There is no point in one institution or another raising its game if the other institutions do not reciprocate.
That is why the ELDR Group is especially keen that the somewhat stalled talks in the interinstitutional working group, which is looking at the way in which we all collectively improve our law-making capacity, should conclude as quickly as possible.
Deadlines have slipped; the group should have concluded its work at the end of last year and the new deadline for the spring summit also now seems unrealistic.
It is essential that we all pull our weight in the three institutions concerned to make this institutional approach a reality.
Let me give you an example.
You cite at length in your document the very laudable attempts in the European Commission to apply impact assessments of a number of key legislative proposals.
I think you are proposing to do that on 31 proposals in 2004.
There would be no point in those impact assessments if MEPs in the European Parliament or Ministers in the Council of Ministers were then to ignore your assessment and simply revise the legislation without any regard for the impact.
That is why many of us in the interinstitutional working group have been urging you in the European Commission to think about how you could extrapolate your excellent work in the impact assessment field and urge all institutions to sign up to similar practices.
We would certainly urge you to redouble those efforts in the weeks ahead.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking in the debate of 18 November 2002 on the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2003, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, I said that I could not see how anyone could be against the political priorities stated, but I added that there was a wide discrepancy between the objectives and the measures taken to implement them, resulting in increasing dissatisfaction on the part of public opinion and the risk that the European ideal itself might be rejected by those who, like myself, want a European Europe.
Four months later, having read the long communication from the Commission and heard President Prodi, and speaking on behalf of the GUE/NGL, I would be tempted to say the same thing, except that today's information document is far more watered down.
It is a display of what I would term blind optimism. Worse still, I find it to be extremely dated and swamped with useless, obvious facts.
For example, the mandate of the Prodi Commission ends in 2004; European elections will be held and 732 members will be elected; enlargement will take place on 1 May provided that the ratification process is complete.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, world peace is severely threatened and the UN is in danger of losing credibility.
The Member States are divided between those that uphold peace and those that are in favour of war, between those that are blindly following the United States and those seeking a balanced European position.
The economic crisis and the recession are worsening rapidly, unemployment is increasing everywhere with thousands of people the victims of harsh redundancies, insecurity in all its forms is flourishing to the detriment of the weakest and, in the face of these mortal challenges, the first two of which were raised by President Prodi this morning, the written communication discusses new forms of governance, stability, new social and economic agendas, quality of life, border security and even traffic and registration taxes for private vehicles.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the members of my group are not all pro-Europe, to say the least, but they are realists.
The vast majority of them, given that Europe now exists, demand that it should at least be a people's Europe, that it should be democratic, pay attention to social issues and not be subject to the diktats of the economy, in order to respond to the real problems of European citizens.
I am sorry to have to tell you, therefore, President Prodi, that not only do we disagree with the ideology that underpins your proposals but, what is worse, these proposals, even if we were to accept this ideology, are barely equal to the major issues we need to resolve.
That, Mr President, is why, with all the respect that is due to you and that I have for you, I would ask you to review your document.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to extend my warmest thanks to both of the rapporteurs, and the Commission too, of course, for all their work.
I share the disappointment of my fellow Member Mr Elles with regard to the absence of the Council.
Today we are discussing the budget guidelines and the Commission policy strategy at the same time, as we hoped that a kind of synergy would arise between the two.
That is very difficult, however, when those policy intentions are tabled so late: too late to discuss them at length in the groups and also too late to compare them with the guidelines drawn up by the European Parliament.
Therefore, my group believes that it is important to choose another moment this year for the Commission to clearly set out its specific priorities for the coming year; not a laundry list of good intentions, therefore, but political choices combined with a time schedule.
Indeed, we have little time left in this legislative period.
I take as an example the agreements concerning chemicals.
These are supposed to be implemented in 2004, but there is a danger that a number of changes which have been agreed upon will be presented too late, which may mean that the procedure for these additional changes cannot be finalised before the end of this term.
In that case, of course, there is no way we can make that 2004 implementation date, and my group is concerned about this.
In a different context, too, the motto of my group in recent months has always been 'make law not war'.
In our view, legal instruments and abiding by agreements are essential; especially in matters of human rights and democracy.
We should like, therefore, to make further agreements on the clauses included in the treaties with third countries.
Parliament must play a role in monitoring those agreements, and conclusions must also be drawn.
How else is it possible to prevent those important clauses - to which the European Union also makes constant reference in order to indicate its support for human rights and democracy - becoming just empty words?
The equal treatment of men and women also touches the heart of the Union's values.
Last Saturday was 8 March - International Women's Day - and so I thought it fitting to say something about that here, too.
The directives have been very influential in the emancipation of women and it is vital that they are complied with, including in the candidate countries.
This is a part of the acquis communautaire that has to be adopted without transitional periods.
I expect the Commission to indicate whether, in its opinion, it has sufficient financial and administrative means for this.
If not, this is another part that must be included in the budgetary procedure.
I should now like to turn to a point of an entirely different order.
The report by Mrs Gill states - against her wishes, incidentally - that political parties have to be paid out of Parliament's budget.
This really leaves me dumbfounded.
Have we not learnt anything from the report by the Court of Auditors, which said that there must be no interconnection between the groups and the political parties?
In addition, this would make the line between donating money and buying votes a very fine one.
Could it be that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats finds it convenient that the Council has no control over these funds, because in that case the Council, in accordance with the gentlemen's agreement, will also not have any say as regards the funds for the political parties?
In the view of my group, that is unacceptable.
If, against our hopes, the amendment by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, advocating the inclusion of those funds in the general Commission budget, is not adopted, we shall unfortunately feel compelled to vote against the report.
Ladies and gentlemen, President Prodi, today, in addition to the Commission strategy for 2004, we are debating the economic and budget guidelines.
As the economic and social climate is extremely tense, I am surprised by the optimism of the Commission communication and, to be frank, exasperated by this way of approaching debates.
I could have written Paragraph 2 of the draft resolution on the state of the European economy which calls on European leaders at the next Spring Economic Affairs Council to avoid vague, self-satisfied speeches, and I would vote for it tomorrow.
That, however, is the only part of this debate with which I agree.
As far as the rest is concerned, there is a vast gulf between, on the one hand, the Commission's lyrical flights of oratory as regards the most competitive European economy, the knowledge-based society, new governance and, on the other, the dashed hopes of growth and employment despite the repeated promises of the single market and the euro.
It is shocking and cannot easily be explained.
Perhaps Mr Prodi will be able to explain why the Commission is speaking this way when the analyses carried out by Eurostat and the OECD clearly paint a pessimistic picture.
The government of my country has also, at last, accepted the facts, having shown excessive optimism for which, ironically, the Commission has not failed to criticise it.
It is even more shocking to see that, faced with the facts, the Commission is persisting with enlargement and using all possible means to try to make the European Union attractive.
I found the advertisements that appeared in the Maltese daily newspapers, announcing the sum of aid the country will receive if it joins the Union, to be particularly inappropriate.
I experienced the same unpleasant feeling on reading the following part of your strategy for 2004: 'Against this background, this Commission wishes to leave the foundations for the success of the enlarged Europe.
In this context, this Commission notes that 2004 will see the completion of the objectives that it set at the beginning of its mandate'.
This passage reminds me of another extract from five years ago, which stated that the mandate of the Commission at that time had been characterised by progress in several fields in order to prepare for the future with the necessary confidence and resources.
This passage merits consideration in view of what happened to the previous Commission and the political objective of transparent, effective management.
It is up to you to prove to us that you are not taking the same path, and that will not leave us much time to police the world.
Mr President, today, the Commission is presenting us with a communication on its annual policy strategy, with regard to which I would like to make several comments.
First of all, with regard to the form: the very first paragraph states, and I quote: 'The Annual Policy Strategy adopted by the Commission [?] seeks to define the Commission's policy priorities and ensure that there is the right match between policy initiatives and the corresponding resources'.
This phrase could give the wrong impression.
It leads us to believe that the Commission is a government adopting its policy strategy.
This is not the case: this communication is merely a proposal which must, one way or another, be adopted by the Council, which is the only body with the power, under Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, to provide the Union with its political impetus.
I would also note that the Council is not present today, and I do not know what conclusion to draw from this absence.
Secondly, the right priorities have been chosen, but it is possible to infer a difference in approach between the first, enlargement and the working of the European Union, and the second, border stability.
Within the Union, including old and new Members, there is a kind of Community fundamentalism; in relations with neighbouring countries, however, flexibility and variable geometry allow the implementation of differentiated frameworks for cooperation.
It seems to us that flexibility should be present in all cases.
President Prodi has just repeated yet again that, in a Europe with 25 States, we would have to abolish unanimous decisions and generalise qualified majority voting.
Our opinion is that qualified majority voting will not work either if we do not also accept the right of veto for national parliaments and variable geometry.
Mr President, the 2004 financial year will be an unusual one for several reasons.
Firstly, our Budget will have to take into account the fact that, on 1 May of that year, ten new Member States will probably be joining us.
For this to be possible, the financial perspective will have to be changed.
Negotiations are still taking place on this subject, but, as far as Parliament is concerned, adoption of the acts of accession, and the figures they contain, should not automatically signify approval of the financial perspective.
Further discussions will be needed on this subject.
Parliament has a very strong preference for a budget to be adopted in December of this year for 25 Member States.
That means that we shall have to work on the basis of 15 Member States for the first part of 2004 and then, as of 1 May 2004, for the ten new Member States on top.
The budgets will therefore have to contain certain remarks to make this possible.
Another new element of the 2004 budget to which I hope Members will become accustomed is a new system called 'activity-based budgeting'.
As I have said, everyone will have to become accustomed to this.
What are the priorities of the 2004 budget?
First of all - and Mr Prodi has already said this - we have to see to it that the economies of the new Member States are integrated into those of the present Member States.
We must promote economic activity and, to that end, we must first of all create better investment opportunities in those countries, and we must look into all the means to make that possible.
The second priority of the budget is improving administrative capacity in those countries.
How will they be able to cope with the enormous sums of money they receive and how can they see to it that good projects are submitted?
I now wish to say something about the various budget headings; starting with heading 1, agriculture.
Everything will depend on the results of Commissioner Fischler's mid-term review, but irrespective of this, we should like attention to be paid to a number of matters.
First among these is the question as to the precise nature of the relationship between the payment of agricultural subsidies and European environmental guidelines.
We shall have to determine this more precisely.
The second point concerns the question as to whether it will be possible to develop insurance schemes in the future for animal diseases.
We are currently seeing avian influenza in the Netherlands, and we have seen foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever.
We shall have to look into this.
Furthermore, is it possible to take further action to promote the sale of agricultural products, especially high-quality agricultural products?
Regarding heading 2, structural funds, the main thing is that we have to do what we have promised.
We have to see to it that the countries who have been told they may receive structural funds do actually receive these and that the administrative restrictions are not too restrictive.
We shall have to investigate the consequences of the n+2 rule and the consequences of the 4% performance reserve.
As regards heading 3, internal policy actions, a number of items under this heading have already been laid down.
For the rest, we shall have to devote attention to what Europe can do in the field of combating terrorism - which is very topical at this time.
What can be done better at European level than in the individual Member States?
What can we do towards the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, towards better protection of the external borders and a better asylum policy?
What can we do to improve nuclear safety in the new Member States?
Lastly, I should like to raise another point: what can we do about the proliferation of agencies?
It seems that every year yet more agencies are added.
Is that not excessive?
I should also like to raise a final point: what can we do about the ageing population of Europe?
As always, heading 4 requires special attention, particularly at this time.
What will be the consequences of any crisis in Iraq or a crisis in the Middle East?
We shall be confronted by many more points, and we shall therefore have to keep a close eye on those.
Concerning heading 5, administrative expenditure, we shall have to look carefully at the results of the Commission reform.
We shall also have to see what the results of the extra allocation of officials have been which we have carried out in the past, et cetera.
Regarding the last point, heading 7, a decision was taken in Copenhagen to categorise aid to Turkey under heading 7, and the Commission agrees.
The Council, however, has also said that we shall have to wait until 2004 to look at whether negotiations with Turkey can begin.
We shall have to look at whether this heading will have to be renamed and whether we shall have to divide it up into different sub-headings, et cetera.
My final point - I can hear your hammer, Mr President - is that I am anticipating constructive cooperation with everyone in this Parliament, and especially with the many committees.
Lastly, I shall also be paying special attention to the point raised by Mr Elles.
Mr President, the 2004 other institutions budget, as Mr Mulder has said, will be the first one for the European Union composed of 25 Member States.
Consequently, it is likely to be more complex than any other and I would therefore like to thank everyone at the outset for their cooperation.
For me it is imperative that the European institutions are provided with the necessary means to complete their preparations, because enlargement must be visibly successful to the European citizen.
Within this context, there are three main themes in my resolution.
Firstly, to achieve greater accountability through improved presentation and transparency of the budget.
I want to improve the quality of the spending, not just achieve the spending.
There is a need for further development of the information on most important cost factors, to achieve greater effectiveness and sound financial management.
Real transparency will only really be evident externally to European citizens if we have it in the first instance internally.
Our current system does not always lend itself readily to achieving this goal.
Decision-making is too centralised and there is not enough devolution and delegation in management structures.
Whilst we are on transparency, one of the major new areas under consideration is funding for political parties.
I am very disappointed that those on the other side of this House, who claim to be champions of transparency, are pushing for funding within Parliament's budget instead of the Commission's.
Surely this will leave us open to allegations that we are looking after our own political interest.
This budget line should remain with the Commission, which has the mechanisms for managing it objectively.
The Commission is wrong to take a very short-term view and propose otherwise.
My second main concern is that we connect and communicate more coherently with the people of Europe.
We need to be more innovative and ambitious in almost every area of our operation, never more so than in our information and communication policies.
When it comes to informatics, our website has to be seen more as a communication tool than just an information port.
Parliament has to play an even greater role in the interinstitutional communication strategy executed by the Commission.
Furthermore, we need greater endeavours by everyone to ensure active citizenship and civic participation.
It is therefore crucial that European citizens are better informed about the activities of Parliament and how European legislation can influence their daily lives.
To achieve this we need to consider creating a European public media space.
My third theme is to create a flexible framework for the future operations of Parliament and other institutions.
This is probably one of the greatest challenges for all the institutions and I welcome the 'raising the game' proposals put forward by Parliament's Secretary-General to improve the focus of our secretariat's activities and give greater legislative assistance to Members.
It has to be said, though, that this is a fairly tame set of proposals.
Within these proposals there is one for establishing a tabling office, which is definitely a step in the right direction.
I know there are those who have reservations about this, but if we are honest with ourselves the number of mind-bogglingly trivial amendments that we have to deal with is astonishing.
I would have welcomed greater ambition and innovation from the Secretary-General, but I recognise the limited appetite our institution has for reform and change.
In conclusion, I have been a rapporteur for only the last couple of months.
However, I have discovered the process to be extremely instructive.
I have found nooks and crannies in this House that I never knew existed.
If I may beg your indulgence, I would like to share some of my initial impressions with you.
I have come across some amazingly talented, committed and hard-working people, but for every one of them there are two who just appear to float.
It is remarkable that this House achieves what it does and continues to evolve, given the resistance in almost every structure.
The culture I have come across throughout the institution seems to be extremely hostile to even a small amount of change and no sooner has an opinion been expressed than there are letters flying around objecting to it.
There are few who have truly appreciated the full implications of enlargement.
There is a belief that we can carry on doing things as we have up to now, but just do them ten times more.
The people of the new Member States have had to show extreme flexibility in moving from the old system to the new system.
We in the institutions need to start showing similar flexibility if we are to enhance the credibility of our institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the annual policy strategy gives a framework to the 2004 Budget, which will be special in that it will be the first Budget for people in twenty-five Member States and, officially speaking, the first Budget in the new form in which greater emphasis is laid on European Union policies.
Enlargement will become a reality in 2004, and we in the institutions must do everything possible to ensure that it is a success from the very outset.
The new Member States will participate from the day they join in all the programmes funded by the European Budget - programmes in agricultural policy, structural policy, environmental policy, the research programmes, and, to take another example, the programmes to promote trans-European networks.
Whilst the financial framework for the new Member States was negotiated in Copenhagen, the adjustment of the Financial Perspective has to be a decision taken jointly by the Council, Parliament and the Commission. That being so, it necessarily follows that Parliament has, as agreed, the right to examine the appropriateness of the proposal to the financial adjustment of the framework.
I do hope, though, that we will be able to come to a joint resolution on the adjustment of the financial framework before the treaties are formally signed on the Agora in Athens.
Speaking for the Commission, I can reiterate that we will of course give you every assistance in examining every option when it comes to framing a joint resolution on this.
In 2004 there will be new programmes for the new Member States, for example the Schengen facility, which will be, for the first time, a sort of cofinancing arrangement, whereby the European Budget will fund the performance of tasks in fulfilment of the Schengen criteria.
For the first time, too, there will be financial aid, for example for the decommissioning of atomic power stations.
As the new Member States will also, however, have to transpose legislation on competition and the environment from day one, the Commission will also be asking the budgetary authority, as soon as this year, to authorise additional posts, and, as we will have to cope with a new linguistic diversity, half the posts required in 2004 will be reserved to the language services.
Among the other priorities for 2004 are the maintenance of political stability, and, as the President of the Commission was just saying, this has both an external and an internal dimension.
As regards the external effects, this priority will find expression in the Budget by our proposal for an increase in funds for the Balkan region and also for the MEDA programme.
The Commission also proposes that pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania - as promised to both those countries - should be increased in order to give both these countries more help towards achieving their goal of becoming Member States of the European Union in 2007.
The Commission also proposes that funds for Turkey should be substantially increased in order to support processes of reform and its preparations for accession to the European Union.
The Commission will, in addition, be putting forward a new proposal for dealing with migration issues within the various policy areas.
We will be proposing a new multiannual programme for this.
Another priority is sustainable growth, which means that, for example, one of our proposals that needs to be improved is that on ways of combating marine pollution arising from tanker accidents, and we also need to build up resources for the fight against communicable diseases.
When I compare this list with what Mr Mulder said in his speech and with your report, on which I congratulate you, many of the priorities set for the 2004 Budget by Parliament and the Commission appear to be very similar.
In so far as that is the case, I also hope that we will be able to bring the Budget procedure to a satisfactory conclusion.
I also want to congratulate Mrs Gill on her report.
I would like to use the time remaining to me to deal briefly with two questions that have been put.
The first question has to do with the proposal for an instrument for the Budget lines in Chapter A-30.
We will be putting such a proposal to Parliament at the end of April.
As regards the second, on the funding of parties, what is crucial in the first place is that we at last achieve the breakthrough and enact a legal basis enabling this chapter to be concluded in such a way that there is a quite unambiguous legal base on which funds can be allocated to this from the European Budget.
As regards the question of who, in view of the separation of the powers, is most competent to administer such funds, we will certainly still have the opportunity to debate this in greater depth.
In 2004, enlargement - an historic event - will be a reality.
The President of the Commission has described how the Commission has decided to discharge its responsibility and submit proposals for the Union's tasks, and the financial resources they will require, in the period after 2006.
The Commission has a very open mind as regards the arguments as to whether this proposal for the new Financial Perspective - that is to say, for the period after 2006 - should cover the period up to 2013 or 2011.
I take the view that this is in fact a propitious time to shift to a five-year cycle.
We are fortunate in that we will have the time to debate these matters together and determine the best framework.
The proposal on the financial framework must be appropriate to the challenges that the future will bring, and, in financial terms, these will affect the issues Mr Mulder raised, of what we can do to really make Europe into an economy based on knowledge and the most competitive economy of all, of how much more we can contribute to this from the Budget, and of which programmes are required in order to do this.

The expectations to which the President of the Commission referred - that is to say, the public's expectation that the European Union should contribute to their security - invite the question as to what, for example, that means for the European Budget.
As the task of securing our borders is a matter of common interest, should it not find its expression in some sort of joint financing?
Enlargement will result in increased economic disparities within the European Union, and this will make particular demands on the funds we will be injecting as an expression of solidarity.
These tasks will make it necessary for us to submit proposals.
Even if, as a European Union, we want to play a greater role in foreign affairs, this will have to be set down in appropriate proposals on the Budget.
This means that our task will be to produce proposals for a Union consisting of twenty-five or twenty-seven Member States, and it stands to reason that any such proposals must represent an added value for the citizens of the European Union.
I can already promise you that we will make use of the time available to us this year to work closely with Parliament in elaborating these proposals.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gill, Mr Mulder, this year is another in which our committee has concentrated its attention on the central issues of security on the external borders and complete freedom of movement, which are of great importance in terms of the finance allocated to the Budget areas within our committee's remit.
It is unfortunate that, this year again, I have to observe that we have still not progressed much further as regards the complete realisation of internal freedom of movement.
It is for that reason that we urgently need the requisite funds to secure our borders and defend ourselves against the trafficking of human beings.
We continue to need unambiguous common rules for legal immigration.
The reinforcement of Europol and Eurojust, along with the fight against terrorism, continue to be among the European Union's most urgent tasks.
Our objective remains what it always has been - the creation of a common judicial area, by which means alone we will succeed in winning the public over to enlargement and convincing them of its advantages.
It is with specific reference to enlargement that I want to draw attention today to the increasing cost of internal security in the European Union of the future.
The EU will have to spend a good deal more money on both Eurodac and Eurojust if we want, for example, to achieve an equally high standard of protection on the new borders when the EU has enlarged to include twenty-five states.
Schengen, too, will, in future, result in further increases of expenditure for the EU, which will, as I have said, have a total of 25 Member States.
What all this means is that the internal policy budget will have to be topped up if the European Union is to do justice to its objectives and tasks, and if the area of freedom, security and justice is not to have a merely theoretical existence.
It is for this reason that I appeal to my fellow Members to support the amendment we have tabled today on the guidelines for the 2004 Budget procedure and the amendments that will be brought in during the forthcoming debates on the Budget.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
(NL) Thank you, Mr President. To begin with, I am pleased that Mr Mulder is a rapporteur this year.
Whilst being a member of the Committee on Budgets, he is very well informed on agriculture, and, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should also like to express my confidence that we shall enjoy constructive cooperation with the Committee on Budgets and with this rapporteur.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would like to make a couple of main points with regard to the guidelines.
To begin with, we note that a particular policy is starting to take shape with regard to animal diseases in Europe.
Regarding the keeping of animals, the European Union has different legislation from other parts of the world, and our policy makes animals more vulnerable to disease.
I note that, in the past, we have had outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever in the European Union, and now we have another outbreak of avian influenza.
That means that we need a better policy and also need to develop better insurance systems in order to adequately combat precisely this sort of crisis, and, furthermore, must also set aside sufficient funds to enable livestock farmers and livestock farming to survive this kind of crisis.
I therefore welcome the fact that Mr Mulder's report includes what is necessary in that regard.
The second point concerns the shift in the sector towards greater market orientation.
That means that we must do more for promotion, market orientation and the organisation of the financial policy in this field.
The third point concerns the new Member States, in regard to which this is a historic budget.
I refer to the report by Mr Xaver Mayer, in which he expressly asks that the Sapard funding be paid out in any case in the new Member States.
If this should cause problems of a legislative nature, we shall have to try to find a satisfactory solution, but in any case, these funds must also be paid out in the new Member States in future, especially for the restructuring of agriculture and horticulture.
It is also important that policy, especially with regard to food safety, the development of animal welfare, and environmental instruments in agriculture, be geared more towards the development of instruments for financial policy.
