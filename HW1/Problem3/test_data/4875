We have already acted.
Since the beginning of the crisis last autumn, the Commission has made use of export refunds in order to support the market.
But the effects of those measures have been limited, not least as we have been faced with import restrictions on our exports into many third countries.
It is clear that we cannot handle the poultry meat crisis effectively on the basis of export refunds alone.
Member States have also announced or taken initiatives with regard to the possibility of using state aid.
There is a broad range of support possibilities via state aid, such as rescue and restructuring aid for farmers running into difficulties.
Those rules are designed to give quick, effective support to those in the sector who are really in need.
We will, in the light of the crisis, examine any proposal as quickly as possible, taking into account both the need for rapid help and the need to avoid distortion of competition.
However, we also need to consider alternative measures at EU level.
And therefore we have found ourselves hampered by the existing legislation.
Our current CMO provides for measures that would allow special market support in cases where veterinary restrictions have been imposed.
The current scope of our CMO, however, does not allow the Commission to act in response to a crisis that is sparked by a lack of consumer confidence.
And that is exactly the situation we are in today.
Therefore the existing legal framework has to be changed in order to provide the legal basis for new market support measures for the sector.
We are therefore proposing to extend the existing exceptional market support as laid down in ArticleÂ 14 of the CMO in order to include support measures in cases where serious market disturbances are caused by consumer reaction to public health or animal health risks.
Our proposal also entails a sharing of the financial burden between Member States and the Community budget and would only be introduced upon a request from the Member States.
We are now taking a first step.
We are filling the legal gap.
Once our proposal is finally adopted, Member States will have to submit their proposals for practical steps that will fit their specific situation.
We believe that will allow the best possible flexibility, and therefore the most efficient response to the current crisis and to future similar situations, if they were to arise.
There is no time to waste.
Thanks to the European Parliamentâs constructive stance and the rapid procedure it has chosen via which to consider this proposal, we should now be able to ensure a final adoption in the Council in the coming weeks.
This will be an important step towards delivering those measures that our poultry sector is so desperately asking for.
Â Â  . Mr President, tonight we are talking about exceptional market measures for a very successful industry in the EU.
We have some five billion chickens in the EU.
It is an industry that is not subsidised by the common agricultural policy.
We are, as the Commissioner said, facing a reduction in consumer confidence with regard to chicken meat.
In some Member States we have seen that consumption drop up to 70%.
There is no doubt that we need to promote how safe chicken meat is, especially when properly cooked.
In the EU we have put together very good measures to help stamp out the disease when it comes into Europe.
At the end of the day, we really need to reduce production and sort out the demand for chicken meat.
One of the benefits of the poultry industry is that the time from when you start to incubate an egg to the time the chicken is ready to eat can be as little as nine weeks.
Therefore it is possible to take production out.
I do not believe that export refunds are the answer to this crisis.
The problem is that if you put a lot of extra chicken meat on to the world market â which is already saturated â and if you are not careful about using public funds to subsidise it, you may find that meat comes back to the European market.
I believe the way forward is to reduce the supply and then try to increase demand to get the industry back on its feet.
It is not only the poultry sector that suffers but also the cereal sector, because five billion chickens eat an awful lot of wheat.
At the end of the day I agree with you, Commissioner, that 50% co-financing between Member States and the Commission must be the way forward.
I believe that will be the way forward for a lot of agriculture in the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by emphasising that the way in which the Commission dealt with bird 'flu was methodical, controlled and efficient.
Unfortunately, however, the lack of information for consumers, the communications policy and the role of the media and the lack of direct national measures, especially control measures, have helped consumers to lose their confidence which, in numerous cases, will probably take a long time to recover.
The repercussions to date in Europe are a 35% reduction in sales of poultry and eggs, with significant differences from one Member State to another.
In Greece, consumption has dropped by 65% over the last ten months and stocks of 20Â 000Â tonnes have accumulated, while in France, the biggest poultry producer, there are stocks of 25Â 000Â tonnes.
The intervention measures by the Commission and the national governments must be immediate and the market crisis must be addressed with the most effective economic and social measures for poultry farms and incubators.
The results of the bird crisis, as my honourable friend MrÂ Parish said, are also important for the cereal sector.
That is why, in addition to amending ArticleÂ 14 of the regulations on the operating regime of the poultry and egg market, we propose:
- firstly, 50% financing of emergency measures linked directly to sanitary and veterinary measures;
- secondly, 100% financing from Community resources in cases in which the fall in consumption is due to the blow to consumer confidence;
- thirdly, promoting market measures, such as granting aid for warehouses, for a period required to stabilise the market and
- finally, aid for the withdrawal of stocks and compensation for the destruction of eggs and poultry.
These measures will balance out market supply and demand.
I would highlight in particular the Commission's point that permissible state aid also needed and needs to be given, at national level, to domestic poultry farmers and to poultry farms as small and medium-sized enterprises.
Community and national aid must be given at once.
It is already overdue, with the result that many undertakings face closure.
There will be many social problems in Greece, because they employ 15Â 000 people.
Mr President, Commissioner, if I may make a joke, if governments and the Commission delay in taking effective measures and interventions, bird 'flu will turn into worker 'flu.


Â Â  . â In a number of countries, production has been significantly affected, and in some cases has already stopped altogether; thousands of tonnes of poultry has been stored in refrigerators, which is expensive and there is no market for its consumption.
Poultry producers are therefore enduring difficult times.
There are countries in which poultry and egg production have suffered enormously, even though there have not been any cases of avian influenza.
It is therefore essential that support be provided for producers and that Community financing for compensating market measures be set at 100%, as was the case for swine fever and BSE, given the seriousness of the socio-economic situation in a number of countries and the difficulty of guaranteeing cofinancing.
We have also proposed funding for the removal of poultry while the market is inactive, in order to offset the costs of refrigeration.
A long-term information campaign must also be launched throughout the EU in order to regain consumer confidence.
It strikes me that this could also be a funding proposal for the Union itself.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am somewhat bemused by the European Unionâs approach to the bird flu scare.
The EU has, it seems to me, made a mountain out of a molehill.
There is no evidence whatever to suggest that bird flu has mutated and can be passed between human beings.
In fact there is very little evidence that it can even be caught from birds unless there is considerable direct contact with the remains of dead birds.
Despite that, in Britain there have been lurid headlines about 320Â 000 possible deaths and bodies being disposed of in mass graves.
This very day, a full-scale bird flu outbreak rehearsal, involving several hundred people, has started in the county of Norfolk, with the dramatic title of âOperation Hawthornâ.
The theatrical way in which the matter is being handled is creating an atmosphere of hysteria, and the EU has played its part in that by holding well-publicised, international summits to discuss the bird flu crisis.
It now wants to set aside EURÂ 5Â million over the next five years for exceptional market support measures to deal with the alleged crisis.
There is even what appears to be an open-ended commitment for more funds in 2011.
It seems to me that the EU and some national governments are guilty of creating a massive public scare that has severely damaged the poultry industry, with little or no justification.
Forgive me for being cynical, but it also appears to be a handy way for the EU to promote itself as a caring organisation.
Whatever we are actually dealing with here is a virulent outbreak of public hysteria, generated by a highly contagious burst of over-the-top publicity from the national governments and the European Union.
In short, everyone needs to stop flapping around like headless chickens and start examining this matter with a degree of objectivity.
If we are going to allocate those large sums of money, they should be used for the production of educational literature that can be disseminated to the public.
That material should let the public know that there is actually no risk from properly cooked poultry and that it is perfectly safe to buy it in supermarkets and to eat it in restaurants.
Let us stop making a crisis out of a drama.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, from the medical point of view we seem to be winning the war against avian influenza, because very few outbreaks of the disease have occurred and only isolated cases involving human beings have been reported.
Where the media are concerned, however, the issue has been dealt with in a most unsatisfactory manner.
No reliable and objective information on the threat of an epidemic was made available, nor was information provided on how to protect oneself in the case of an epidemic.
The mass media made headline news out of every dead swan found.
Avian influenza is being presented as a further horseman of the Apocalypse.
The information reaching the man in the street is anecdotal, disorganised and often inappropriate.
Action by the veterinary services tends to run counter to common sense.
Slaughtering entire flocks of domestic birds seems to be done for show, just for the sake of being seen to be doing something.
It hardly makes sense, when millions of wild birds can spread the disease unhindered.
In addition, there have been many cases of thoughtless cruelty.
We have all seen on our television screens live birds rammed head downwards into sacks that were then handled as if they were sacks of potatoes.
Furthermore, unfounded information was put about according to which avian influenza could also be transmitted to humans by cats.
This led to a number of instances of negative treatment of the latter.
In view of this situation, it is hardly surprising that the market in poultry is in the grip of panic and threatened by disaster.
It is therefore entirely appropriate to act in support of the market.
This move deserves our full support, and I have in mind also the amendments aimed at increasing the degree of support.
In particular, I would like to draw attention to the amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the NationsÂ Group aimed at increasing the level of support in the new Member States where farmers and breeders are in a particularly difficult situation, as they are only in receipt of partial direct payments.
The best way to support the poultry sector is to provide reliable information and calm the market down.
It is best for this to be done by the European Commission, because the latter probably inspires greater confidence than national authorities in crisis situations of this nature.
The Commission should disseminate clear information on how the disease spreads. In particular, it should state categorically that consumption of poultry meat does not represent a health risk.
The media should also be asked to exercise restraint and avoid creating panic.
There are lessons to be learnt from this crisis.
Should similar situations arise in the future, reliable information must be made available to the citizens at a much earlier stage.
Â Â  â Mr President, to try and save time, I shall be very quick this evening.
I should simply like to thank the Commission for acting so quickly last week on the Councilâs proposal.
Parliament demonstrated that it was also effective and, if all the institutions put their minds to it, it is clear that we can make the right decisions in eight days to respond to natural disasters, and come to the aid of the victims.
Furthermore, I agree with my fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and we have already spoken a great deal about avian influenza.
We have for once acted quickly, and it cannot be said that it is because of Europe that the breeders will have to wait to receive compensation.
Â Â  Mr President, I was gazing at MrÂ Daul, who has spoken very well and in a short space of time; I wish I could do the same thing.
In any event, Commissioner, I also wished to congratulate the Commission on its rapid reaction to the problems being suffered by the poultry and egg market.
It is also the case that we have reacted with the urgency asked of us so that these two Regulations could be amended and the Commission would be provided with the legal basis to act.

As you have pointed out, however, MrsÂ FischerÂ Boel, this crisis is not currently being caused by the outbreak of an epidemic, which has not appeared in the majority of Member States, and for the time being there are no restrictions on the movement of poultry within the Union, but rather, as you pointed out quite rightly, it is due to a loss of consumer confidence and the resulting fall in consumption.
In this regard, Commissioner, we are in a complex situation that has only just begun, but which is very similar to the two market crises suffered by beef following the outbreak of BSE.
And on both occasions, Commissioner, market support measures were taken at Community level and funded at 100%.
My group has therefore presented two amendments to the Commissionâs proposal in this regard.
We accept the 50% co-funding of health measures, but we would ask that measures to support the market in view of the crisis caused by a loss of consumer confidence be of a Community nature and therefore be 100% funded from the European budget.
Commissioner, as I have said, we believe that this co-funding mechanism â contributions from Member States for measures that have always been of an exclusively Community nature â would set a serious precedent within the CAP and could jeopardise the principle of the single market.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Union has a wealth of experience in overcoming crisis situations.
It has applied exceptional measures to support the market on a number of occasions in the past, notably in connection with mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease.
It has now fallen to us to face up to avian influenza.
The importance of poultry as part of the food sector must not be underestimated.
It is essential to introduce exceptional measures.
All that remains to be decided is the scope of the aid and the size of the funds.
Practice has varied to date.
The Community has covered a varying percentage of the losses incurred by Member States, usually between 50% to 100%.
The regulation before us today also provides for significant support to the poultry sector.
Unofficial discussions indicate that the proposal for the Community to refund 50% of the costs borne by the Member States is strongly supported.
Unfortunately, however, equal does not mean fair, especially as the old Member States are in receipt of 100% of direct payments for farming whereas the new Member States are receiving barely 30%.
That is why I believe a principle should be adopted whereby Member States receiving 100% of farm payments receive a 50% refund of the costs incurred, and countries not in receipt of full payments that are funding farming from their own budgets should receive at least 75%.
We need to be consistent.
Either we just talk about a Europe of solidarity or we get down to creating it.
If we are to create a Europe of solidarity, it must manifest itself in social and economic terms.
As a rule, people show what they are made of in difficult, dramatic and catastrophic situations.
It is often said that a personâs worth is best assessed in terms of the extent to which he or she is prepared to share with others.
It therefore follows that the Union of nations and states will be judged according to the extent to which it guarantees fair distribution of cost and income and also in terms of the degree of solidarity and justice it demonstrates.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have been hearing about avian influenza amongst wild birds on an almost daily basis recently.
This is indeed a disease that mainly affects wild animals, but can it be restricted exclusively to wild birds?
There is no clear answer to this question, but we do know that the disease occurs amongst farmed poultry.
The poultry sector has very specific characteristics.
Within the European Union, it operates on market principles, and consequently there are only limited opportunities for supporting it.
A way of providing aid for the poultry sector in crisis situations must therefore be found.
This aid should be awarded in such a way that it does not infringe market principles and is only implemented in exceptional situations, when the market is in crisis.
A broader approach is called for, encompassing consideration of the special characteristics of farming and the need for intervention in certain agricultural markets in specific situations when intervention and outside aid are patently necessary.
I believe this is a good learning opportunity for us.
We need to find a way of providing special support instruments within the common agricultural policy, in order to help this sector.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should also like to welcome the measures proposed this evening, which will hopefully be carried in tomorrowâs vote.
Action had to be taken on account of the fact that, in some countries, this crisis is affecting a great many farmers, not to mention the sector itself and all those working therein.
I should also like to say a few words about the manner in which the measures are to be taken, specifically those concerning market management.
In this regard, as has already been mentioned by my group just now, I hope, as regards cofinancing, we will be giving priority to 100% European funding.
Furthermore, it strikes me that the time has come for Europe to reflect on the manner in which we apply the precautionary principle when it comes to all health problems, or any other problems that may affect our individual countries and the continent as a whole.
I believe in fact that unless Europe applies the precautionary principle, there is a major risk that, due to a succession of problems, and the fact that not all States have all the information or deal with information in the most appropriate fashion, as has been the case in recent months, there will be crises affecting entire sectors, both industrial and agricultural.
We then ask farming and the WTO, in this case the poultry sector, to come along and compensate for the impact that is not down to the structures or to the farming sector, but, rather, to panic, as has rightly been mentioned, with specific examples, this evening.
I therefore believe that we need a Europe-wide policy to address crisis situations and ensure that measures are taken at European level and are applicable across the board.
This particular crisis is an example that should set a precedent for the future.
It should lead us to reflect on both agriculture, and, more importantly, on other sectors such as public health, with the aim of henceforth applying the precautionary principle at European level.
Â Â  Mr President, it is good that we are doing something to assist the poultry industry.
Unfortunately we have had other experiences of loss of consumer confidence in other food products.
In Ireland we have had no cases or reports of wild birds or others with avian flu, but we have suffered a fall in consumption of up to 20%.
Europe has been accused of making a mountain out of a molehill but the truth is that we are in a very difficult position.
I sympathise with the Commission.
How do we keep avian flu highlighted so that we do not have a human pandemic and so that we spot the problem in wild birds, while at the same time trying to avoid scaring consumers?
It is an extremely difficult balance.
I believe that Members of this House can play a role in communicating effectively and without panic what is happening throughout the European Union and why we are taking action.
There is a huge gap in consumer knowledge.
The trouble is that we have large quantities of poultry meat in storage.
Export refunds may not be the answer because markets are closing down to us.
We need to manage the stocks.
While they are there, they are a huge problem.
I feel that removing hatch eggs is part of the solution, but I would worry that you could go too far.
Let us hope that this crisis is just for the short term, rather than the long term, and that we rebuild confidence and consumption.
I believe that is what we are all trying to do.
However, the poultry sector throughout the European Union is pleased that the EU is responding.
Part of that response has to be accurate, clear, panic-free information to consumers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I was delighted to endorse the Commission initiative on exceptional support measures for the poultry and egg sector, and I am sure many other Members felt likewise.
Swift and decisive action is needed.
Even though Europe had been preparing for the advent of avian influenza for some time, we did not manage to stop panic spreading.
Initially, only wild birds were affected, and when the first cases of infection amongst farmed birds were confirmed, the demand for poultry went into free fall.
In some countries it went down by as much as 70%.
Sales and exports were reduced, and certain countries imposed import restrictions, banning the import of Community poultry.
This widespread panic is being fuelled by the media, which often fail to provide reliable information.
Instead of informing and reassuring the public, they simply aggravate the situation.
Avian influenza itself does not represent a serious danger to breeders.
The main problem is the media and the panic arising as a result of the lack of cohesive information on the subject from the European Union.
I welcome the fact that the Commission has proposed exceptional market support measures for the avian sector to deal with the loss of consumer confidence in this sector.
Nonetheless, the proposal to cofinance 50% of the costs may have a negative impact on competition within the European Union and amount to a step towards renationalisation of the common agricultural policy.
We should also remember that diseases know no borders, which means that a highly virulent strain of avian influenza can easily spread across them and become a problem for the Community as a whole, not just for an individual country.
One hundred per cent support should be guaranteed in such circumstances.
That is the only way to win this battle.
Partial financing will achieve nothing.
Decisive action at European level is called for.
The House will recall that 100% finance was made available in the case of BSE.
Why is the Commission not proposing similar terms in the case of avian influenza?
It is worth adding that the Commission proposal under discussion is simply a set of temporary measures that can only be in place for a limited period.
They do not guarantee the stability of the markets in exceptional situations in the long term.
A new cohesive insurance system is therefore needed, as has been repeatedly stated in the House.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being here tonight and in particular I would like to express my great satisfaction with the speed with which the Commission has dealt with this issue, which I believe to be important for everybody, for consumers and producers, in the European Union.
I am delighted that account has been taken of the fall in prices and also the fall in consumption that we are seeing in the European Union.
I am delighted, because consumers are losing confidence in the face of the possibility of being infected with a disease that we all know cannot be caught in this way.
Nevertheless, loss of confidence can lead them to stop consuming products such as eggs or chicken, and that would be very bad news, of course.
I believe that we must distinguish between veterinary measures and market measures.
You are proposing a market measure which, for the first time, you are deciding should be co-funded.
Well, in this regard I cannot congratulate you: I believe 50% to be insufficient.
In 1997, in the case of BSE, you will remember that 100% was paid.
The same happened in the case of foot-and-mouth disease.
This is therefore the first example of co-funding of market measures which, as my fellow Member has said, could lead to imbalances in the market, distortions of competition, a concealed renationalisation of the common agricultural policy, and this could lead to very bad results for everybody, including those who are sceptical about the common agricultural policy, because renationalisation would lead to much more of the protectionism which they believe is already too much.
I believe that those who are sceptical about the current common agricultural policy should consider this.
I therefore believe that it should not be co-funded and we have presented an amendment which I hope this House will support tomorrow.
It will depend on the governments whether or not this subsidy is requested.
If it is 50%, in many cases certain governments would take a long time to do so.
It seems to me that the fundamental problem is that there is no money, either to finance emergency measures or to fund the common agricultural policy, because, essentially what we have is a terrible agreement, and in the future it will be very much worse, in view of the approaching financial perspective.
There is not enough money?
Then the governments, in the Council, must provide it.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the loss of revenue incurred by operators in the poultry sector, due to the loss of public confidence, could reach 50% to 60%.
Against this backdrop, the Commission has proposed changes to the regulations as regards the application of exceptional market support measures.
Such measures are expected by operators who have suffered as a result of an emotional reaction on the part of consumers, and I commend the Commission on acting swiftly.
Yet to seek to increase the volume of exports to address the current shortfall in internal consumption runs counter to the principle of food sovereignty.
In this regard, is it reasonable to advocate, as some Member States have done, the destruction of healthy poultry stocks in order to regulate supply?
Such a move would only benefit the large companies that have relocated to Brazil.
This is the signal they need to restock the European market.
What is needed is to activate a safeguard clause to block imports of industrial poultry from outside Europe, especially as it appears that the more industrialised the sector, the more intense the avian influenza virus; in Asia, Laos, where there are no industrial holdings, has been spared, in contrast with neighbouring countries such as Vietnam and Thailand.

I wish to emphasise that the necessary precautionary measures that we are rightly taking in our countries will have a greater effect on traditional farms, which are more concerned with producing high-quality poultry, than on industrial farms, which benefit from additional support.
An example of this is the segregation measures, which are restrictive for small free-range poultry holdings.
Lastly, mindful of previous crises that have seriously affected the agricultural world, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy in 1997 and dioxin in 1999 â not forgetting that these problems were entirely different from avian influenza â would it not be opportune to set up a special commission, this time pre-emptively, tasked with detecting the causes of crises, in order to prevent them rather than trying to cure them?
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to endorse what Mr Daul, the chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, had to say, and warmly congratulate the Commissioner on the speed with which she has come up not only with an action plan, but also with unorthodox proposals to tackle the problem that is currently afflicting the poultry industry.
She has understood very well that Europe must pull out all the stops in order to face up to this crisis.
Indeed, the spreading of bird flu by migratory birds and the threat of the virus for people show that society has every reason to bring this disease to a standstill and ensure that the poultry sector does not go under.
It is, in fact, too crazy for words that, despite the threat to public health and the uncertain spread via birds living in the wild, vaccination against bird flu to protect man and animal is still a taboo subject.
The much-heard argument that vaccination leads to sales problems has almost turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy, because as long as Europe, as a prosperous market community, hides behind this argument, worldwide vaccination will itself continue to be treated like an contagious disease.
Turning to the proposal itself, I would like to say that so far, market measures have always been taken, and funded, by the European Commission, with good reason, because in that way, the common market was strengthened and distortion of competition prevented.
The Commission now proposes to cofinance up to a level of 50%.
I have to say, also on behalf of my party, the CDA, that the Commission in this matter, given its limited financial scope, has probably gone for the best option by plumping for cofinancing.
Nevertheless, I should like to call on the Commission to make firm pledges so as to avoid distortion of competition among Member States.
The CDA would also like to see this regulation help the countries that use vaccinations and experience market losses as a result cushion the consequences, and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has tabled an amendment to that effect, to which, I hope, this House will give its unanimous backing.

Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner on her stamina.
All evening, she has been listening to a persistent misunderstanding under which the Members of this House labour.
The European Union is not an insurance company.
Where entrepreneurs run risks, they should take out insurance, and that they can do.
When France was plagued by FMD, the French Government provided a soft, low-interest loan and the cattle farming industry subsequently paid for the damage it had suffered by means of a disaster fund they had set up themselves, and that is how things should be done.
The European Union cannot be held responsible for all damage suffered by a sector, in whatever industry.
If a sound insurance system in poultry farming is lacking, we will have no choice but to take action.
That is the European Unionâs only option.
What action, though, can it take?
It cannot push up export subsidies, because that would be a scandal.
It would be unacceptable to pass on our problem to the developing world.
It would also distort the world market and is at odds with negotiations and agreements within the WTO.
What can be done is to encourage Member States, in the event of an outbreak of a crisis, to grant poultry farmers soft loans of the kind I have referred to.
Looking at the measure that the Commission is advocating, I can, to some degree, see where they are coming from, but I think that we must first call for a sound insurance system to be in place for the poultry farmers themselves, because then entrepreneurs will be shouldering their own responsibility, and that is something in which they can take real pride.
Â Â  The Commission acted correctly, wisely and in good time.
We have an excellent Commissioner.
While you are Commissioner, European agriculture is in good hands.
Poultry consumption has fallen by thirty percent in the European Union, but in Hungary it has only fallen by fifteen percent, because the government has taken firm steps to gain the trust of consumers.
I fully agree with the proposal of the Commission.
The Commission has accepted an excellent plan for market measures.
I believe that marketing and regaining the trust of consumers, referred to by several Members of this House, including MrÂ Daul, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, are at least as important.
Therefore, I fully support the report, and I agree that we must help European poultry farmers.
I also agree with the issue of cofinancing, because we, the new Member States, have already experienced cofinancing: we cofinance direct payments at a rate of thirty percent each year, and I think it is fair to apply cofinancing in this issue, as well.
Therefore I fully support the efforts made by MrsÂ FischerÂ Boel, and I would like to express my thanks again, on behalf of the European and Hungarian poultry farmers.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by sincerely thanking you for the very broad support that we have had for this change in the CMO.
I shall now make some comments on the 23Â amendments.
In Amendments 1, 2 and 22 you asked for a list of the different support measures to be put into the Council regulation.
As I have said previously, it is important to give a certain flexibility to the Member States.
They should decide themselves which tools they want to use.
I do not want to bind their hands, but I have clearly said that it is important that we try to address the problems upstream.
But ultimately I leave it to the Member States.
Some of the measures stated in your various amendments are going in the same direction.
However, I should just like to mention one of them concerning the financing of an information campaign; this in fact belongs to a completely different legal framework.
Therefore, I believe that some of the other measures proposed deserve to be looked into further.
Once again, I must underline that the purpose of this change of regulation is to try to fill in the legal gap that we have experienced and then allow the Member States to suggest the different possibilities that they consider to be the most efficient for them.
Therefore, while I have some sympathy for some of the measures you have proposed, I cannot accept or introduce them into the regulation as has been suggested.
Some of you mentioned co-financing, which is proposed in 11 of your amendments.
We have had the possibility of discussing this issue on several occasions when we amended our regulation on exceptional market measures.
The Commission considers that co-financing on market support measures is an important way to ensure that Member States assume their share of the responsibility for the handling of different crises linked to health issues.
We use this type of co-financing in relation to our veterinary measures, and we have had more than ten yearsâ experience in the co-financing of related exceptional market measures.
It is not the time for changing this approach and I am therefore not in a position to accept those amendments.
On the information campaign you asked for in Amendments 1, 2, 16, 17 and 22, it is not the kind of measure that fits into this proposal.
However, there is a Council regulation on internal promotion for European agricultural products, and I have asked my services to prepare an amendment to the existing Commission regulation so that generic promotion of poultry meat would be eligible for European funding.
It would be a waste of money to start a promotion campaign at this stage, but I can assure you that when the time is right, then all the legal aspects will be settled so that we can act immediately.
On Amendments 8, 9 and 23, I do not think it necessary to exclude certain measures on animal welfare grounds.
The slaughter of animals is not a priority in the intended measures and the Commission will propose action in line with the different animal welfare standards.
Nor can I support AmendmentÂ 7 on export refunds.
The Commission uses the export refund instrument in a prudent way, taking into account our different responsibilities within our international commitments regarding this instrument.
On soft loans, I do not exclude at this stage any potential national proposal, provided that it does not destroy or distort competition.
That is quite clear, and I can promise â as is already the case â that I will act as quickly as possible on any proposal put on my desk from the different Member States.
On vaccination, Member States that decide on a vaccination policy should examine carefully the possible consequences that such a step might have on their international trade.
Trade problems created by vaccination cannot, in my view, justify the use of exceptional market support measures based on the new ArticleÂ 14.
Let me turn to ArticleÂ 14 in the existing Council legislative text, which was the subject of a question: Member States shall ensure that where producers contribute to the expenditure borne by Member States, this does not result in distortion of competition between producers in different Member States.
I would like simply to underline that this was the wording we put into the discussion we had last year on co-financing.
Finally, on procedure: the European Unionâs swift handling of this proposal is another sign of its credibility as a valuable partner in tackling the problems that might arise within the agricultural sector.
Once again, it has been a great pleasure for me to do business with you.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Cornillet on behalf of the Committee on Development on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 [2005/2104(INI)] (A6-0063/2006).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the report on the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 is actually included on the agenda.
I will not go back over the detail of the report and will merely refer to two sessions, that in Bamako in AprilÂ 2005 and that in Edinburgh in NovemberÂ 2005, without forgetting the next session, which will be held in Vienna in JuneÂ 2006.
I should like to point out in this Chamber just how worthwhile it is, as was the case this year, for sessions organised in Europe to be held in the country holding the Presidency.
It does, in fact, seem extremely logical to maintain and to perpetuate this system, which was adopted two years ago.
I should also like to highlight the very solid contribution of our colleagues from the ACP countries, and we must congratulate them on that.
We simultaneously conducted six joint missions, and allow me for the first - but not the last - time to emphasise the adjective âjointâ.
It is essential, in fact, that both the Permanent Assembly and the missions share a joint vision of matters.
To do the opposite would make no sense at all.
I should also like to point out that an increasing number of horizontal votes between the ACP countries and the EU representation have been held.
In my opinion, the practice of separating houses must be drawn on as little as possible without it being necessarily removed from our Rules of Procedure.
That being said, it is true that the objective, in the long term, would be to hold an increasing number of votes that make it possible to secure an ACP-EU majority.
Furthermore, it appears that our colleagues from the ACP countries are less involved in what we might call an âintellectualâ capacity.
By that I mean that we are in agreement with them on the fact that what was an expense for us â namely, in actual fact, the EU expenditure that consists of the ACP budget â is revenue for them.
The need for parliamentary control at these two levels is, moreover, becoming increasingly clear to them.
To this end, we, for our part, have requested the budgetisation of the EDF in order to guarantee parliamentary control regarding the use of this Community expenditure but, at the same time, the parliaments of the ACP countries also need to submit to parliamentary control what they consider to be revenue.
That is a joint battle that we will have to fight if the vital need for parliamentary control is to be recognised.
As for the future of the ACP, I welcome the amendment made to the Cotonou Agreement.
The budget for the tenth EDF now amounts to EURÂ 22.682Â billion.
We have already complained in this Chamber about this sum, which does not live up to our expectations of EURÂ 24Â billion.
The Austrian Presidency has already responded to us.
I have no doubt that my fellow Members will shortly take the floor on this subject in order to request a realignment.
It is not a matter of endlessly repeating the same questions, but we are awaiting more forceful responses than the ones we have been given.
The EDF surplus also poses a problem.
To date, it stands at almost EURÂ 11Â billion, which naturally raises questions about the procedure and the ambition of the projects dealt with, because it is unforgivable that EURÂ 11Â billion should not have been spent in countries that have such glaringly obvious needs.
What does the future hold for the EDF?
If we fulfil our political commitments in 2010 and if we succeed in devoting 0.56% of our GDP to development aid, then the European Union will grant an additional EURÂ 50Â billion per year to this budget, even though it had made the political commitment to devote only half of that amount, or EURÂ 25Â billion, to Africa.
It is quite clear that if this policy is complied with, the additional aid that is available will actually correspond to one annual EDF budget.
Nevertheless, if the way in which we spend that budget were to be examined, it would only raise questions.
Furthermore, I wonder about the proportion of the aid to developing countries that will be managed by the European Union and that will be in the region of 20%.
In that case, even if my choice of term is a little strong, the EDF will be reduced to the status of a minor instrument of aid.
The problem of its budgetisation, which is absolutely crucial and needs to be done as soon as possible, thus becomes even more acute, as does that of its âfungibilityâ, meaning the possibility of granting very ambitious regional projects, such as rail infrastructure, a place in the European Unionâs general system for action.
That is what would make it possible to ensure coordination between the member countries and the European Union.
The EDF can become that coordination lever, and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can become an element of specific control, in the knowledge that all of the least developed countries in the world are members of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Finally, there is above all the problem of understanding European Union policy.
What I was describing just now as Community expenditure earmarked for development aid is provided by our taxpayers.
As such, action must be clear because it is no good the populists grabbing hold of the figures that I have announced to you and crying out: âWhat on earth are you doing with all of that money?â
We therefore need this matter to be viewed and understood from a political perspective.
Â Â  .
Mr President, the rapporteur has produced an excellent report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. He has summarised very well all the recent developments of the Assembly.
It is indeed becoming an increasingly strong parliamentary pillar of ACP-EU cooperation.
The establishment of the standing committees and the joint drafting of reports by the ACP and the EU members of the Assembly have led to more frequent and more intense contacts between parliamentarians.
The Assembly has become a mature forum, where issues of concern to ACP and EU parliamentarians are addressed in an open debate where broad consensus on many development issues is emerging and where votes by separate houses have become a rare exception.
This framework has allowed the Assembly to discuss and reach agreement on a broad variety of issues ranging from governance over finance to trade questions.
The resolution calls on the Assembly to organise meetings between EU and ACP Members of Parliament at regional or sub-regional level to strengthen regional integration and foster cooperation between national parliaments.
The Commission is ready to make its contribution to the success of such arrangements.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that the Commission shares your view on the Assemblyâs role as a model for cooperation.
My colleague Mr Michel has participated in all the Assemblies held since he took office.
Commissioner Michel also looks forward to attending the next Assembly which will be held in Vienna in June this year.
Â Â  . â Mr President, let me start by extending warm thanks to MrÂ Cornillet for his comprehensive report on our activities over the past year, in many of which I have of course participated as first European Vice-President of the Assembly.
I would also, at the outset, like to thank equally warmly our two co-presidents â the European co-president Mrs Kinnock, who is with us today, and, in her absence Sharon Hay-Webster, for their great dedication over the past year, which has been exemplary, and we look forward to their continuing with their work.
The primary object of the Parliamentary Assembly is to reinforce the parliamentary dimension of the Cotonou Agreement.
The many things that we do together are intended to help our counterparts gain influence in their own countries and gain the same self-confidence that we have gained over the years in our dealings with our governments and the executive.
Our shared experiences, and our journeys together to various places, have led us to shared conclusions, for example as regards the reform of the market organisation for sugar.
It is good that the Commissioner for Agriculture is present with us today, since she knows the figures inside out and knows what we in Europe are doing to lessen the impact of reform of the market organisation for sugar and how little, in comparison with that, is available for the countries concerned.
It is apparent from that that our reform directly impacts on these countries, two of which â Guyana and Jamaica â I have myself visited.
In Guyana, we can â without intending to â contribute to the destabilisation of a whole country if we do not lessen the impact of our reform by making adequate compensation available to that country.
There is another important aspect that I would like to highlight.
We call on the Commission to set aside an appropriate proportion of European development funding for the political education of parliamentarians and other persons in positions of leadership, enabling the development in these countries of the sort of political culture that will strengthen responsible governance in the long term.
In conclusion, I would like to mention the official contact that we established with the Pan-African Parliament at the end of last year, when I was able, on behalf of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to confer with Sharon Hay-Webster, and I have since become the chairman of this delegation.
It is important that we should foster an awareness in Africa that the continent shares a common destiny and of the important role there that Parliament can play in this respect.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the report by my fellow Member, MrÂ Cornillet, illustrates the quality of the work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005.
The JPA is a permanent forum for political dialogue that tends to become an instrument of prevention, of conflict resolution and of support for the democratic process.
The role of the JPA is therefore very precious in the context of the Cotonou Agreements.
It is a unique tool for dialogue between the North and the South.
In the future, it must work more effectively, particularly in terms of dealing with major crisis situations, such as the one in Darfur, provided that it is given the resources to do so.
This aspect is above all the responsibility of the European Union, which must attach political priority to this partnership with the ACP countries, by respecting its commitments in the negotiations under way on the sum of the tenth EDF and by finally refraining from taking back with the one hand what it gives with the other, as illustrated by the sugar reform.
By finally giving the JPA the political respect that it deserves, let us thus definitively enforce what is laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, that is to say that the Assembly shall meet in Europe in the country of the EU Presidency.
Let us not welcome our ACP partners in a half-hearted fashion, as that would be a downright poor political signal for us to give.
However, it is also the responsibility of the JPA itself.
It must make progress with its reform and its working methods, and the next development could result in regional conferences being held.
This objective could be set by the beginning of 2007.
Finally, we, as members of the JPA, also have a political responsibility, by abstaining, for example, from voting in separate houses, which is not only the negation of the JPAâs joint character, but also the means used all too often these days for the purposes of thwarting the outcome of a vote.
I find all of that in the Cornillet report and I therefore believe that, as far as we are concerned, it constitutes a road map for 2006.
Â Â  . Mr President, how to help the countries of Africa and other parts of the developing world is a key factor in ensuring a more prosperous and therefore a more stable world.
What Africa needs in particular is respect for the rule of law, respect for contract law and the protection of private property.
Under those circumstances there will be economic development and prosperity.
This is very hard to achieve when many of the governments are socialist or quasi-socialist or simply kleptocracies.
The story of international aid to these countries is sadly one of waste, embezzlement and corruption.
If the EU really wants to help these countries, it should not help consolidate corrupt systems through more aid.
What it should do is embrace free trade and lower the trade barriers and tariffs â in fact remove trade barriers and tariffs that are holding back the economic development of these countries.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cotonou Agreement of 2000 had the good intention of giving the ACP countries help from the EU in getting out of the gutter.
Even though, today, its continuation is probably a foregone conclusion, there are still a number of things wrong with it, and I shall sum some of them up.
There are still, among the ACP countries, six dictatorships, namely Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Swaziland, Cuba and Eritrea.
It is a matter of fact that these countriesâ dictators constitute an obstacle to their economic development.
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and its Political Affairs Committee in particular, must make it a priority to bring real democracy to these countries.
At the same time, the ACP countries also include a number of countries in which religious practices still prevail over the rule of law.
The humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is a direct consequence of this, among other things.
In some of them, womenâs rights count for nothing and the mutilation of women â despite what has already been done to counteract it â is still a daily occurrence.
It was the Cotonou Agreement that first acknowledged that corruption was an obstacle to development.
It is still going on; it has not yet been stamped out, and constitutes a serious obstacle to the alleviation of the needs of the least well-off in these countries.
Let me close by quoting the Indian Nobel economics prizewinner Amartya Sen: ânever yet has famine occurred in a democratic countryâ.
It follows, then, that, in addition to the principle of âaid for tradeâ, we also have to consider the idea of âaid for democracyâ.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I think that it is with satisfaction that we can look back on the past year and on the Bamako and Edinburgh agreements reached by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Good reports have been adopted, and the capacity for tackling burdensome tasks has been further enhanced along with the quality of political dialogue.
That is important if we want to help build up political stability, which is what we accomplish by strengthening the parliaments.
At the end of the day, though, what matters in development cooperation in the ACP countries is the concept of ownership, and it is that that we will take as the starting point for our work.
It is still the countries themselves that bear primary responsibility for their own development.
Through dialogue in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, we hope to further promote good governance, democracy and the protection of human rights, and I might add that I am also happy with the appointment this week â to which reference has already been made â of this Houseâs delegation to the Pan-African Parliament, which can be an additional instrument.
Today, I want to ask that particular attention be given to two projects that have been running over the past year, and will continue next year, namely the economic partnership agreements and the reform of the sugar market, both of which will have a great deal of impact on both Europe and the ACP countries.
We must see to it that both continue to help put the ACP countries in a stronger economic position, and in that respect good consultation with them will be of crucial importance and must involve their parliaments too.
This House treats cooperation between the ACP countries and the EU as being of particular importance, since it involves a Joint Parliamentary Assembly consisting of 77 members of this House and 77 members of the ACP countriesâ parliaments.
We debate together and adopt resolutions together in what is a unique and valuable arrangement.
What is needed for peace and political and economic stability in these countries is not just financial investment on our part, but also investment in contacts devoted to deliberation and dialogue, in order to get to know one another better and understand one another better.
In that we cannot invest enough.
I look forward to the 11th meeting in Vienna in June this year, and I hope that it will be a successful one.
I thank the rapporteur for his outstanding report and for the pleasure of working with him.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank MrÂ Cornillet for his excellent and wide-ranging report, which covered all the points raised in the debate this morning.
Anyone looking at our Joint Parliamentary Assembly over a number of years, as I certainly have for around 12Â years, has seen a very heartening increase in confidence, maturity and, indeed, in engaging on issues related to trade and to political dialogue, to which we attach great importance.
Someone said that everything in Africa was terrible and things were not improving.
I do not think that we can make that case.
There are limitations, but we are there, working behind the Cotonou Partnership Agreement with parliamentarians in a unique way.
There is no other North-South parliamentary assembly such as ours that has this opportunity to press on governance, democracy and human rights, and that is what we do.
On the EDF, briefly, we are concerned and we had a debate at the part-session in Brussels a few weeks ago.
Many of us are concerned about the situation of the overseas countries and territories in relation to the EDF.
We are concerned that allowance has not been made for the entry of East Timor into the ACP-EU relationship, and we have a number of other concerns.
We are always puzzled about the 3% or 4% administration costs.
I do not know why the Commission needs to put money in to pay itself for the job it is doing.
I find that rather odd.
Let me turn briefly to sugar, with which the Commissioner has been directly involved.
At the weekend I am going to Africa â Swaziland â and Mauritius to look again at the issues related to sugar there.
The Commissioner must be aware that the figures we now have on the budget line, going from EURÂ 130Â million up to EURÂ 170 million by 2013, are far short of what the Commissioner and others had promised, which was EURÂ 190 million.
My own government talked about EURÂ 230 million.
They are going to get EURÂ 1.1 billion at the end of 2013 and it is back-loaded.
How can that be sensible?
We urge the Commissioner to look at this and to try to make this more workable.
Stop this back-loading and increase the amounts on the budget line for these countries.
The issue is not just about employment in sugar, as the Commissioner must know â because we made enough fuss about it in Europe â but also about the other developments that depend on and grow around that source of employment.
Thousands and thousands of livelihoods are at stake in those 18 Sugar Protocol countries.
You can rely on us in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to keep raising this issue.
We have work in progress.
Our committees are working well and I think that we can fairly say that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can only grow in strength in future years.
We will continue to fight on EDF, trade and other concerns and priorities that we share with our fellow Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians.
Â Â  Mr President, there are many things in the report by the ACP delegation which in my capacity as Member I should draw positive attention to.
I am not therefore talking now about the situation concerning the ACP countries so much as the work of the delegation.
Firstly I am grateful to the Bureau of the European Parliament for its decision to authorise the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to be held in Edinburgh.
The meeting was a success, and Great Britain, the country holding the presidency at the time, and the City of Edinburgh deserve praise for organising the event so well.
I hope that it will be possible to organise the JPA in the country holding the presidency in future as well, because the place where the meetings are held brings true added value, as does the fact that the meetings are held by rotation in the EU-ACP countries.
It was also excellent that representatives of the ACP and the EU were able to participate in the informal council of ministers for development cooperation organised by the UK Presidency in October.
Hopefully the practice will also continue when my country, Finland, takes over the presidency in July.
The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has an important role in implementing the political dialogue provided for by Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.
The objective is to strengthen democracy, good governance and the human rights situation.
It is just a slight nuisance that our meetings always partly coincide with Committee Week.
For me it has meant that I have never been able to be continuously present at a meeting.
I do not know whether other Members share the same opinion, but I would think that it would be easier to get away during the week when Parliamentâs groups hold their meetings.
It would perhaps be worth testing this option.
I am also happy that standing committees have been set up.
They have made for better upstream cooperation between the European Parliament and the ACP members.
I realised how viable the system was when I myself produced a report.
Â Â  â I should first like to commend Mr Cornillet for his report, and the joint chairman of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly for her hard work and commitment in the work of the Assembly.
I should also like to draw attention to the conclusions of the Womenâs Forum that took place at the fringe of the Assembly during the final session in Edinburgh in November.
The discussion touched upon the issue of the trafficking of women and girls from developing countries and the poorest parts of Europe to the wealthiest areas of Western Europe.
Some 600Â 000 to 800Â 000 women are trafficked every year across international borders, which corresponds to more than the entire population of some ACP countries, for example Cape Verde, Djibouti and the Comoros Islands.
The Womenâs Forum established a bridge between countries of origin and destination.
The debate was lively, with strong participation from the contingent from the ACP countries.
In the final conclusions, the participants called on the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to draw up a report to identify the measures needed to combat this scourge in all ACP countries, including European, African and Caribbean countries.
It should be noted that the Forum was arranged for the fringe of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and that resources are not made available for it.
I therefore call on Parliamentâs services and the Conference of Presidents to consider harnessing funding for such a positive, results-focused organisation.
On a more general level, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly last year discussed the situation in Darfur and West Africa, but did not address the breakdown in the rule of law and the electoral process, and the serious violations of human rights in countries of key, symbolic significance such as Ethiopia, where the African Union has its headquarters.
There have, however, been important developments in the fight against impunity in Africa; for example, the dictator Charles Taylor has been arrested and brought to justice.
Other dictators such as HissÃšne HabrÃ©, and former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu, currently being harboured by ACP countries like Zimbabwe and Senegal, must also be brought to justice.
These are further cases in which the Assembly can play a key role in ending impunity in Africa.
On this issue, I must say that it would be most useful if the debates were more genuine.
Sometimes, there are ACP countries acting more as the ambassadors of their governments and less as critics of the situation in their countries.
I feel that as MEPs we have a duty to find ways of supporting our counterparts from ACP countries who are determined to tell the truth and to encourage them to take action to bring about change and better governance in their countries.
Â Â  Mr President, I think we see the ACP relationship as maturing well, which may sound like the description of a long-term mistress, but it is true that we know each other, we understand each other, sometimes we excite each other, sometimes we see each otherâs blemishes, but we grow to value each otherâs qualities.
My message to the ACP is that we still wish on principle that ACP delegates should only be from among members of parliament and not ambassadors, and preferably from government and opposition parties, which would better reflect the balance of the European Parliamentâs delegation.
I am not sure whether one day we will have the EP meeting the APÂ â the African Parliament, including, of course, the Caribbean and PacificÂ â but certainly we must play our part in sustaining and developing that African Parliament concept.
My message to the European Parliament is that REACH has shown us how intimately the work of each of us affects that of the other.
We had valuable discussions in Bamako and in Edinburgh and this Parliament, I am sure, will take the ACP views into account.
Often, however, we legislate for all the right reasons in the European Parliament yet we have not heard the worries of the ACP, because we have not listened.
That is why I say to the Commissioner that the ACP is not just for our good friend Mr Michel: it is for all the Commissioners in the College.
I am very pleased that this House overruled the Presidency of Parliament on the question of where the last JPA should be sited in the European Union.
It was right for us to site it in the country holding the Presidency, just as we rotate our meetings in the JPA in the ACP countries.
That gives ACP members an opportunity to see different aspects of different policies in Europe, for example the malaria vaccine research in Edinburgh.
In the same way, we learned much from seeing the desertification of the Niger; or the implementation of the vaccine fund on the ground in Mali, where we could see the people who are most affected actually benefiting from the work being done.
The flu pandemic threat and the avian flu pandemic reality show just how important it is that we continue to work closely togetherÂ â Europe and the countries of the ACPÂ â for our mutual benefit.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too would like to add my voice to the congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, who, in his report, has given a really very good overview of the good work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Many speakers have mentioned the womenâs forum that takes place at every meeting of the Joint Assembly, and I would like to do likewise, for the in-depth discussion of the political and economic problems specific to women in the ACP countries is very helpful, not only to the womenâs forum itself, but also to the Assemblyâs ensuing plenary debates.
I need do no more than remind the House of the exciting debate on genital mutilation that took place in Bamako in Mali â itself a country in which this practice is not yet proscribed by law â when the discussion went on for hours and we even managed to get it carried on the radio.
I would now like to share with you some thoughts on the work done by the committees, which has had the effect of markedly improving the work of the ACP-EU Assembly, in that fewer amendments are tabled in the plenary, and the higher degree of trust established between MEPs and the representatives of the ACP countries means that compromises are achieved more often.
I would, though, like to reiterate something that has already been said, namely that it is important to give thought to the scheduling of the European meetings of the committees, which are held in Brussels.
It is sometimes a real shame that we should have to take part in votes in our own specialist committees, which can go on for hours, and are thereby prevented from taking part in the exciting and important debates in the ACP-EU committees, which is sometimes â wrongly â taken as an indication of a lack of interest.
Â Â  . Mr President, I agree with the speakers that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has become an accepted, respected forum for dialogue.
The resolutions adopted by this Assembly sometimes even launch debates that go beyond that forum.
Mr Bowis mentioned the resolution on REACH, adopted here in November last year, which has led to a much more focused discussion about the impact of REACH on the developing countries.
The next Joint Parliamentary Assembly also promises to be interesting.
It will deal with such important issues as the role of regional integration in the promotion of peace and security, the problematic issue of energy in the ACP countries and the social and environmental aspects of fisheries in developing countries.
I know from my colleague, Mr Michel, that he is very much looking forward to attending those meetings.
On the sugar issue, I am indeed familiar with the issue of funding for the Sugar Protocol countries.
We have had this discussion before.
I should just like to reiterate that EURÂ 40 million is available in 2006.
What is more important is that we do not forget that the impact of the price drop agreed within the European Union will not have an effect on the ACP countries until 2008.
They have another two years to try to adapt their production with the money available from the European Union.
You know that considerable funds will be available from 2007 until 2013.
In the European Union we have shown that we also have a responsibility towards those countries that will be affected by internal legislation concerning the need â that I am quite sure everybody feels â to adapt our agricultural policy to a more global trade.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has done some great work in deepening our ties with ACP countries and affords them a crucial link to our deliberations, particularly as we come to finally address our trade policies, which all too often hinder rather than help development.
Scotland has been at the forefront of calls for change in 2005, with the Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh, the G8 summit in Gleneagles in the summer, and of course we were delighted to host the ACP-EU meeting in Edinburgh.
What we now need to see is our Member State governments putting our fine words into action, and making development policy not just a matter of doling out aid but of working with developing countries in fair trade, to all our betterment.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Committee on Development on aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries [2005/2141(INI)] (A6-0048/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we are, in this House today, having a serious debate on a matter that is not always easy to discuss in the context of a debate on development cooperation.
Quantitatively speaking, Europe is the worldâs greatest donor, but there has been a growing global awareness over recent years of the truth that the way aid is targeted is at least as important as the quantity of it.
Last yearâs Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness forms an important benchmark for action on this front and the Commission has recently responded to it by means of a package of measures on the effectiveness of aid which we will shortly be discussing in the Committee on Development Cooperation.
My own-initiative report, on which we are to vote today, makes a few serious recommendations as to how to make aid more effective.
The effectiveness of aid is dependent to a large degree on good governance, free from corruption, for not only is it the case that aid money is raked off, but corruption is also a hindrance to development and has a disproportionate effect on the poorest members of society.
It makes access to essential services, such as basic education and health care, more difficult and sometimes impossible.
Corruption is an enormous problem on a worldwide scale.
Estimates by the World Bank suggest that in any one year, over USDÂ 1 billion â that is, 1Â 000 billion in our terms â is paid in bribes.
In Africa, the worldâs poorest continent, the amount estimated as being lost â USDÂ 148 billion â is more or less equivalent to 25% of the continentâs GDP, and corruption is present at every level of society and nearly everyone is affected by it: politicians, civil servants, the media, multinational enterprises and the international donor community.
Responsibility for good governance and effective aid is shared by the donor community and the developing countries themselves; âit takes two to tangoâ.
My proposals therefore deal with what we â the European Union, the Commission and the Member States â can do in practical terms, preferably together with the international community as a whole.
My principal proposal is for the drawing up of a blacklist of corrupt regimes, which should receive no further loans from banks or other financial institutions.
Those who do lend money to governments on such a list would be exposing themselves to the risk of debt and would be unable to ask the international community to bail them out.
This would prevent the people from becoming the ultimate victims of the likes of Marcos, Kabila, Abacha or any of their successors.
I then propose that a small percentage â 0.5% â of the amount paid out directly to a countryâs government be required to be paid as budget support to civil society watchdogs.
Such groups, belonging to organised civil society, are engaged in the public monitoring of the governmentâs income and expenditure in terms of the development goals.
There also needs to be support â paid out of the same amount â for national parliaments, enabling them to better discharge their monitoring function together with the watchdogs.
Another proposal is that businesses found to have been involved in corruption in respect of projects in developing countries should thereafter be excluded from European tenders.
Here too, I propose the compilation of a blacklist of such businesses.
Those who can show that there has been improvement, through, for example, changes in management, would get a second chance and could be removed from the list.
Finally, all Member States of the EU must delay no longer in ratifying the UNâs anti-corruption treaty, which dates back to 2003.
At present, only two of them have done so: France and Hungary.
That state of affairs must change.
This treaty is the first international agreement to use international law as a means of combating corruption, by, for example, preventing and penalising money-laundering, promptly freezing financial assets held in banks overseas, and seizing those assets where corruption is proven.
Such are some of the proposals I have put forward in my report.
They represent, of course, only a couple of steps that Europe can take in addressing the enormous problem that corruption presents to society, but let us â the Commission, Parliament and the Member States â make them a priority, so that we no longer merely point the finger at the developing countries, but also own up to our own wrongdoing.
I will be interested to hear how the Commission responds to these practical proposals, for, remember: âit takes two to tangoâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.
The Commission is particularly keen on ensuring that the aid it manages serves the objectives of combating and ultimately eradicating poverty, and in that respect the power management of financial resources is crucial.
Hence the decision to make governance in general a horizontal and central theme in the programming of the tenth EDF, because combating corruption can only be successful when embedded in a broader agenda of capacity building.
In this context we share the view of the rapporteur, MrÂ van den Berg, on the importance and scale of the problem.
Corruption is indeed a major obstacle to development. It hits the poorest in developing countries the hardest.
It is responsible for political instability and the violation of human rights, and it reduces the level of resources available for development funding.
Secondly, we agree that corruption is a very complex phenomenon which needs to be addressed through a whole range of different measures.
International agreements are important, and the report notes that the UNÂ Convention on Corruption still has to be ratified by several of our Member States.
We need to work with private-sector organisations, and we need civil society watchdogs.
In our assistance programmes we have various measures to support good governance, such as reforms of the legal system, support for Supreme Audit Institutions, assistance for civil society, and support for national parliaments, which was the subject of a debate at the recent ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
We already support civil society watchdogs, for instance Transparency International chapters in some countries.
Thirdly, on budget support, MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Berg pays particular attention to that, and rightly so, not because it is especially prone to corruption, but because it is part of the solution.
Its big advantage is that it directly addresses a major source of corruption in many countries, namely the weak management of public finances.
Our budget support goes only to those countries which are clearly committed to reforming their public finance system and, by strengthening sensitive areas like public procurement, it makes an important contribution to the fight against corruption.
Project-type assistance, on the other hand, is heavily based on public procurement but cannot address weaknesses in the system.
You are aware of the special report by the Court of Auditors on public finance management in the framework of budget support in ACP countries, which supports the approach adopted by the Commission.
I also want to highlight the importance of the harmonisation agenda, which was the focus of the Paris Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in March this year and emphasises the importance of strengthening beneficiary country systems of financial management and control, which is precisely one of the things that we are doing.
One note of caution, however: budget support is not earmarked for a specific sector, but specific sectoral reform measures and targets can establish the conditions for the funds which are, of course, paid into the general budget.
Fourthly, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness also underlines the importance of improving the transparency of public procurement procedures in our partner countries. Those procedures are often a source of corruption.
My last point concerns our colleagues in the field.
One of the key objectives of the devolution process is to ensure that aid is more closely supervised in the field and to make the most of the detailed local knowledge of our âin-countryâ staff.
Delegations can check that aid is properly used.
Moreover, for some kinds of contract we now require external audits before we make the final payment, and a comprehensive system for programming external audits was introduced in 2003, covering audits to be launched both by headquarters and by delegations.
In summary, we share much of Mr van den Bergâs analysis.
We think more attention could be paid to public procurement issues, and we think some of the detailed measures proposed need to be reviewed and discussed further.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr van den Berg on an excellent and valuable report.
There is no doubt that overcoming corruption in the allocation of development aid is one of the main obstacles that we face in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
While concern mounts over a deficiency in funding for MDGs, we must ensure that the aid is being provided to developing countries and is being allocated efficiently.
With increasing levels of aid, there is growing concern that politicians and officials will misuse money intended for the worldâs poor.
As Mr van den Berg said, corruption is widespread, affecting every sector and bureaucracy.
We must remember, however, that it is by no means solely a problem for developing countries.
There is a common argument that aid should not be channelled through government.
However, we are increasing budget support and I am pleased to hear what the Commissioner has said about strengthening institutions to eliminate corruption through budget support and the reform of the public sector.
Massive restructuring of civil service and public financial management is necessary.
Often these reforms are the sole responsibility of a few select civil servants.
Civil servants in developing countries, who live on low, public sector wages, are struggling to keep their families out of poverty.
They are subject to bribes and often have to moonlight in order to supplement their incomes.
How can we expect people to implement the necessary reforms if they are not paid accordingly?
I suggest to the Commissioner that we recognise and acknowledge about 200Â civil servants in each developing country as the key players in the decision-making process and include them in budget support.
Why do we not follow Singaporeâs example and give these civil servants extra supplementary incomes, comparable to our standards, so that they are not tempted to take bribes to keep their families in the style to which they have become accustomed?
We also need to deregulate.
Regulation is the mother of corruption.
The power of the paper impels people to get permissions, and permissions are sought and bought by corruption.
If we deregulate as much as possible in the developing countries, we will have a chance to address this problem.
After all, regulation was used as a colonial instrument: the power of the paper, as opposed to the soldier in the village, to enact the imperial masterâs wishes.
When independence came, these countries kept those controls in place.
They did not deregulate the imperial controls and, because of that, corruption has become endemic because regulation has been piled on regulation.
We need to get the national parliaments in developing countries empowered with thorough investigative capacities to look at corruption in those administrations.
We are on the right track.
I congratulate MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Berg on an excellent report and I am very pleased to hear what the Commissioner has said.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should first like to commend MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Berg on his excellent, timely and important report.
The EU, and its Member States, contributes over half of public aid to development, overall.
Following the decisions taken by the 2005 Spring European Council and the Gleneagles G8 Summit, international aid is set to increase substantially over the next ten years.
In this context, if we are to properly accomplish the Millennium Goals, appropriate transparency mechanisms must be brought in to ensure that development aid actually reaches the people on the ground it is designed to help.
As the van den Berg report says, the appropriate management of development aid is essential to the good governance of the recipient countries.
I should like to turn to the example of Ethiopia, where despite the fact that it is the largest recipient of external aid, which accounts for almost 25% of the country's public budget, there have nevertheless been serious breakdowns in the rule of law, democracy and human rights.
Pursuant to Articles 96 and 97 of the revised Cotonou Agreement, serious cases of corruption can lead to political consultations.
The EU should not hold back from using this tool.
Naturally, in the medium and long term, it is crucial to foster a dynamic civil society with a free, balanced press.
This is the only way in which the citizens of developing countries will be able to expose corrupt governments and to free themselves from them.
On a more practical level, the EU must bring pressure to bear on the parliaments and governments of developing countries to step up control over military spending.
Shadow and parallel budgets are in themselves a form of corruption, directly affecting internal, regional and even global security.
The lack of transparency in this area is a clear example of the link between corruption, bankrupt countries and security.
In other words, when we speak of corruption, we also speak of war and peace, and as such the problem is not confined to developing countries, given that our own EU and western governments more often than not have a part to play in this.
The G8 countries, for example, are responsible for more than 80% of world arms exports.
I welcome the efforts made by EU Member States towards ensuring the compatibility of arms exports from the Union with the technical and economic capacity of importing countries under the EUâs Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
It is vital to guarantee that money for development is not diverted towards arms.
Unfortunately, we are still awaiting detailed reports from the Member States on the implementation of the rules of this code.
In this murky area of arms, corruption and violence, Europe has a responsibility to guarantee that the arms sold by European companies and by European governments reach their legal recipients, and only them, and do not fall into the hands of criminals, militias and repressive governments.
The partial implementation by Member States, including my country, of the 2003 European Council common position on arms brokering means that there remain legal loopholes in this area in Europe.
Unless we start being tougher on arms control within our own borders, it will be difficult to combat corruption in this area in developing countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, many congratulations to MrÂ van den Berg for his excellent report.
The scourge of corruption is neither new nor rare.
It has accompanied human activity since ancient times and is widespread amongst both the developing and the developed countries â the only difference being that in the developed countries, it is practised more professionally and more elegantly and is thus more difficult to recognise.
So, with corruption being so common and extensive, how effective have attempts made at international level to curb it actually been?
Not very, I am afraid.
The estimated amount of USDÂ 1 trillion paid in bribes today is not less than the corresponding amount in previous years; in fact, it is more.
The reason is simple: corruption cannot be controlled by signing conventions and declarations alone, but only by the strict implementation of such conventions and declarations by concerned.
To that effect, we in the developed world must set a good example.
While passing judgment on corruption in the developing world, let us look at ourselves. Also, let us consider critically our own state of affairs and let us analyse ourselves by asking some simple questions.
How free from corruption is a system that allows United States Government officials at the highest levelÂ â names like Cheney and Rumsfeld come to mindÂ â allegedly to be involved and have a personal interest in companies awarded multi-million contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan?
How corruption-free is it to have the wife of the Prime Minister of Britain, Mrs Blair, working for a large law firm and taking up highly politically sensitive cases, which directly involve and are affected by political decisions taken by her husband?
Should not the Roman proverb that Caesarâs wife must not only be honest but must also be seen to be honest apply here?
How free from corruption is a system that allows United Nations officials and other related persons, including the son of the United Nations Secretary-General, to be accused of involvement in oil-for-aid scandals?
Closer to home, how corruption-free can the system be seen to be when Members, or their close relatives, of the European Parliament and other EU institutions, involved in making legislation, are at the same time members of boards of companies, or are stakeholders in companies which stand to make huge profits from such legislation?
Is a simple declaration of interest really good enough?
Lastly, may I draw your attention to two amendments by MrÂ Kristovskis, concerning recital N and paragraph 22.
These amendments correct a mistake that was made in the original report in recital N, in which Cyprus was omitted from the list of EUÂ Member States that have not yet ratified the 1997 OECD Convention.
In fact, Cyprus has repeatedly attempted to participate in the OECD, but Turkey, for political reasons unrelated to the subject, blocked such participation.
By voting positively for these two amendments, we will make it possible for Malta, Lithuania, Latvia and Cyprus to ratify the OECD Convention.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I too should like to thank MrÂ van den Berg for his excellent report.
He is going to be showered with praise as a result, which is something at least.
It is clear that the fight against corruption is absolutely crucial, in terms not only of the effectiveness of European aid, but also of its credibility.
How can we really convince our fellow citizens or the Member States to give more if corruption remains endemic?
This is also the condition of the viability of a constitutional State and of an economy.
This is therefore a crucial battle that we must fight to the end, one that has become somewhat more complex with the advent of economic globalisation, due to the ease with which capital can be moved and also due to the new budgetary aid process at EU level.
The rapporteur does a good job of highlighting all of the questions posed by this new budgetary aid system with regard to the fight against corruption, as well as the heightened problem, in the present context, resulting from the increased pressure put on raw materials and, in particular, on scarce oil supplies.
There is therefore also reason to fear both a resurgence of attempts at corruption for the purposes of gaining access to the last remaining fossil fuel reserves and an increase in conflicts linked to the trade and traffic in weapons.
Weapons and oil are in fact the two large sectors, in the macroeconomy, in which a high level of corruption is developing.
The rapporteur therefore rightly emphasises two issues: transparency and responsibility.
Transparency, in actual fact, is a crucial element if one is to have a precise and clear idea of the budgets that are used.
In this field, we must be far more enthusiastic in our support of a number of initiatives, such as âPublish What You Payâ or the initiative of the extractive industries, which nevertheless have the disadvantage of being based solely on voluntary participation.
We need to make progress in this area of legislation rather than merely to rely on the good will of economic or political actors to publish, if they so wish, the funds or loans that they give to the governments concerned.
The budgetisation of the revenue from oil and mining is also a crucial aspect of budgetary transparency but, as far as the European Union is concerned, this must be a requirement so that budgetary aid cannot be granted to a government that does not clearly publish the profits that it makes from the oil, mining or forestry industries.
Public opinion cannot understand why the European Union continues helping countries that should, by rights, have a sizeable budget and one that is able to finance the smooth running of a State.
Finally, the report points out that a governmentâs military expenditure must also be published.
The role of national parliaments and of civil society simply must be strengthened, in financial terms too, by means of increased support enabling both parliaments and civil society to play their role in this area.
My final point concerns transparency with regard to the various donors.
The governments of these countries are also helped by towns, regions or States, at all levels, and we lack a database that would indicate what is really paid by a given country to a given State, region or town.
We do not have access to that information today, and that also fuels corruption.
To conclude, I therefore believe that we need to put matters in order, as has been said, and that corruption cases, too, form part of the current issues facing the European Union.
The issue of exercising power and of funding political life is as relevant in the North as it is in the South.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr van den Berg made an excellent speech.
There is no doubt that rooting out corruption is a key objective if we want to ensure the effectiveness of aid, and Mr van den Berg has outlined the instruments needed to make that possible: transparency, participation and responsibility.
The role of parliaments and civil society is crucial, and more transparent procedures and the circulation of information are vital.
Furthermore, it is requested that all of the social actors become more involved in the process of defining anti-poverty strategies, which still attract little participation, even at national level.
Finally, specific funding is necessary in order to monitor the cooperation measures.
I believe that it is impossible to talk about corruption in developing countries without looking at the other side of the coin: to what extent are we, as developed countries, responsible for their corruption and what benefit do we derive from it?
MrÂ Matsakis gave some very precise examples; this in no way means easing the pressure on the actual corruption of many leaders and governments of developing countries and, at times, of NGOs too.
The fight against corruption in recipient countries must also be extended to corrupting companies belonging to industrialised countries, and the fight against âcorrupt corruptorsâ should be conducted as part of an effective and transparent partnership.
The institutions of donor countries located in recipient countries must commit themselves to fighting the phenomenon on the ground, by singling out corrupting companies and banishing them to whichever country they belong, as MrÂ van den Berg also said, and they must have the courage to act even when corruption is lurking in our own institutions on the ground.
In addition to being a moral matter, the cost of corruption is a cost that everyone must bear, including European taxpayers.
Untying aid is another crucial aspect of the relationship between corruption and aid effectiveness.
Untied aid â which is necessary for ethical reasons â guarantees greater transparency in relation to procedures and to the awarding and management of tenders, and would also increase the value of aid.
The figures are quite clear: tied aid causes an average increase in the cost of goods and services of between 15% and 30%, rising to as much as 40% for food aid.
It would be helpful if we could also come up with an appropriate definition of ODA.
I believe that official development aid, which is often swollen by massive sums for debt cancellation, for peace keeping, peace enforcing and conflict prevention efforts, for repatriating immigrants and for controlling borders, must not be changed.
In this kind of scenario, budget aid can become an important support channel to the poorest, most heavily indebted countries, for the purposes of eradicating poverty and of attaining the Millennium Development Goals.
Nevertheless, I believe that it is crucial â as, moreover, it is claimed in the tripartite document on the European consensus on development policy â that the governments of the Member States and the European institutions try to coordinate themselves and harmonise their own policies, including within international financial institutions, with a view to becoming not only the leading donors in the world, but also the most responsible of donors and the most incisive when it comes to drafting policies that put an end to the spiralling external debt in the South of the world, thus helping to eradicate poverty and, if I may be so bold, to eliminate a little injustice, too, and perhaps even wars.
Â Â  MrÂ President, international solidarity and, through it, the ability to help people in developing countries are very close to my heart.
I believe that aid is an important tool in this fight for a better world.
The EUâs aid policy is in itself very poor.
However, it is undermined by other policy areas too.
Firstly, the EU conducts an agricultural policy in which absurd subsidies are given to relatively rich farmers.
This, together with the duties that the EU imposes on agricultural products from poor countries, leads to a situation in which agricultural policy actively militates against aid.
Secondly, the EUâs trade policy leads to poor countries being deprived of the ability to enter our market with their competitive products.
A topical and instructive example of this type of damaging protectionism is the EUâs recent imposition of duties on shoes from, for example, Vietnam.
Thirdly and lastly, I believe that development cooperation should take place at Member State level.
If aid is to be as effective as possible, it is, of course, always crucially important that efforts be coordinated.
This coordination should, however, take place at UN level where donors from all over the world, and not only from the EU, work together in order to bring about effective aid which, as a matter of actual fact, leads to a reduction in poverty.
This process really would lead to the worldâs poor countries being given a better deal, an outcome that should be the main purpose of aid.
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much welcome Mr van den Bergâs report on aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries and I would like to congratulate him on it.
Corruption is the single biggest obstacle to the delivery of aid to the poor.
We have to ask why the EU continues to channel aid to corrupt regimes.
How can we stand by and watch starvation in many African countries, while the leaders are laden with the trappings of exceptional wealth?
The EU must take a firm stance against governments that are exercising blatantly corrupt methods of governance.
There is a need for more transparency.
The EU is the worldâs largest donor of aid.
The EU has a responsibility to monitor and approve the implementation of this aid.
More aid must be channelled directly into specific projects rather than a handover to recipient national coffers, so it is absolutely clear where the money is being spent.
The establishment of civil society watchdogs in developing countries must be seriously looked at and I call on the Commission to give the appropriate percentage of budget aid for such watchdogs.
Education and training needs to be improved and the number of women in higher level education needs to be increased in order to afford them the opportunity to become more involved in politics.
Anyone who has visited Africa knows the important role that women play.
They could play a far more important role if they were allowed to, so this needs to be looked at and encouraged.
A major question facing development countries is the illicit acquisition of public funds by government officials who store them in offshore accounts.
I call on the financial institutions that hold these stolen funds to freeze them or confiscate them.
They know where this money is coming from.
If I lodge EURÂ 10Â 000 in my bank account in Ireland, the bank manager is obliged to ask me where the money came from.
In these countries they put millions in and nobody asks them anything.
I call for corrupt regimes or individuals to be blacklisted, to prevent them from borrowing large sums of money from wealthy countries.
Only when they have made a noteworthy move towards democracy should they be removed from the list.
We also have to examine ourselves.
Take the case of Kenya and the Anglo Leasing scandal.
Mr John Githongo, who is the anti-corruption tsar, had to leave the country because of what he found and he has asked that British citizens be examined concerning this scandal.
People in Europe are involved in scams and bogus companies that are lending and giving money to Africa and they have to be stopped.
A number of years ago there was a campaign in all European countries.
In Ireland we brought in legislation that meant that people involved in sexual offences in Third World countries could be charged in their home country.
The same kind of legislation could be introduced in Europe with regard to corruption so that anybody in Europe involved in corruption or bribing officials in Africa or any other Third World country could and should be charged under legislation in their home country.
That is the sort of thing we have to look at if we are going to get rid of corruption.
We cannot just blame African people.
We have got to look at ourselves and how we are involved in schemes of this sort.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nearly all the ACP countries are to be found near the bottom of the latest edition of the âCorruption Perception Indexâ, that much-used yardstick produced by Transparency International, and we should not be surprised by that.
What really is disappointing is where the ACP countries stood on the index and stand now, for there has been scarcely any improvement over the past five years.
This is a fine report, and makes clear that the rooting out of corruption could result in a significant increase in Africaâs gross domestic product.
When one considers the fact that corruption primarily affects the poorest, it follows that, for many Africans, it makes the difference between life and death, and so it is a matter of life and death that the fight against corruption be pursued with adequate resources, rather than assuming that only a few prominent personalities are engaged in it, and that the fight against corruption is therefore of secondary importance.
What is equally important is that direct budget support be handled with care, for there is a risk of the EU writing out blank cheques to foreign bodies over which it has no control.
Let us prioritise the giving of aid to NGO projects that are not only capable of producing tangible results, but which can be required to guarantee them and also to apply quality standards
Â Â  â Mr President, I join with the previous speakers in expressing appreciation of Mr van den Berg and his outstanding report, which makes clear in how many and varied ways conditions can play their part in making our aid less effective while corrupt structures flourish.
It is of course mainly those who sit by the fleshpots in these countries who are criminally active, but it very rapidly becomes apparent that embezzled funds have to be deposited somewhere, and that is where we in Europe come into the picture very quickly.
It is often our banks that offer dictators accounts where they can stash their money, and it is often European businesses that collude with structures in their countries to the eventual detriment of the people who live there.
Let us then see to it that we check carefully to see where budget aid goes; I have my doubts as to whether we in the EU really can give budget aid to 28 countries, as to whether the structures in them are such that we do that with any confidence.
Let us use the legal means available to us to investigate banks in order to find where the dirty money has gone, and, for the good of the people who live in these countries, let us make sure it goes back there.
Let us amend our legislation to prevent businesses from deducting bribes from tax as operating expenditure, and let us publicly name and shame those in Europe who do that, for naming and shaming is a good way of draining the swamp of corruption.
Let us also use Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to take action against notoriously corrupt regimes.
I want to underline what Mrs Gomes had to say on this subject.
I would like to see all these people â and their spouses too â barred for good from getting visas to come to Europe on shopping trips, spending the money they stole from their own people.
Â Â  â Mr President, the effectiveness of aid and the fight against corruption runs like a scarlet thread through many debates, but particularly through those we have had since yesterday evening.
Today's order of business features MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Bergâs report on the effectiveness of aid and on combating corruption in developing countries, and I too would like to join in the congratulations and gratitude to him that have been expressed; his report and what he said by way of introduction to it show very well the need for corruption to be fought and prevented for hampering development any longer.
At a time when we need to get it into our heads that a significant increase in spending on development cooperation is needed, serious talking needs to be done about fighting corruption, so that corruption can no longer serve as an easy excuse.
Corruption, as a phenomenon, is both global and complex; it is not only in the developing countries that the causes of its occurrence there are to be sought.
The OECDâs Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials is an important means of addressing the connections between corruption on our own countries and corruption in the developing world.
I believe that we â that is, the European Union â must do everything possible to get Latvia, Lithuania and Malta â which are EU Member States â to ratify this convention as soon as possible.
I would like to say something else about direct budgetary support.
There is an increasing tendency in the European Union to opt for direct budgetary support rather than projects, and, basically understandable though that is, there are very many doubts about this, which have indeed been aired today.
There are doubts as to whether we have at our disposal sufficient capacity and sufficient personnel to guarantee the comprehensive monitoring that will be necessary.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too wish to congratulate Mr van den Berg on his report, which sees him picking up one of the hottest of hot potatoes in the field of development cooperation.
Just how necessary it is that action be taken to deal with this is spelled out by the African Unionâs estimates according to which corruption robs the African national economies of some USD 150 billion per annum, amounting to one-quarter of their gross domestic product.
I would like to start with the very same aspect to which Mr Gahler referred â the highlighting of the need for action on our part even when it hurts us the most.
Bribes to the tune of a billion are paid every year â by whom?
Who is it that regards the payment of this sort of money as an investment and remits it to closely-guarded accounts in the expectation of even greater profits?
Important though it is to urge our partners to combat corruption and support them in doing so, our primary task should be to take off the field those in our own countries who are capable of paying such massive sums in bribes in the first place and using them to ruin Africa and other parts of the world.
I want to explicitly highlight Article 15 of the UN Convention against Corruption, according to which the Member States of the European Union must make bribery a criminal offence.
In my own country, Germany, it was until recently the case that bribes could be set off against tax, and people can still not be punished for paying them.
We in this House should sweep away this foul-smelling filth from in front of our own front doors first.
Like you, like everyone on the Development Committee, I support the âpublish what you payâ campaign and would go as far as to demand that multinational companies be compelled to make public information on the payments they make to governments.
Among the others who profit from bribery and to whose activities we must put a stop are those banks that offer their services in completing such transactions and can rejoice in accounts full to overflowing with bribes.
This cannot be permitted within the EU, and so we should call on the EU and its Member States to cut off the channels for slush money outside its borders as well.
When we have criminalised bribery here at home, when our own standard of living is no longer financed even in part by the profits of corruption, when we no longer sing the praises of our banking houses for making profits from the management of corruption and when we equip our investigating agencies with the wherewithal to chase after those who pay bribes â then will we be able to stand tall before our partners and bid them make the same contribution towards combating corruption.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr van den Bergâs report certainly gets my backing.
Corruption prevents aid from being as effective as it might be, so it is desirable that it should continue to be tackled, and this report offers concrete and rational instruments for reinforcing the machinery of control, resulting in an improved legal framework for combating corruption.
The legal framework is not, however, the only factor.
Rejection of corruption as a social phenomenon has just as much to do with the values that prevail in a society.
It is, then, civil society organisations, and religious leaders in particular, who need to be challenged as to their role in promoting good governance and in fighting corruption.
What is needed is for this debate to become more than merely theoretical.
In any case, both countries and aid organisations that give aid must be able to have confidence that their money is being used efficiently and for its intended purpose.
An expert whose opinion I sought about the van den Berg report told me, the day before yesterday, that it was an outstanding one, and that he hoped the Dutch Government would adopt it without amendment.
I could give Mr van den Berg no better compliment.
Â Â  Mr President, the World Bank estimates that USD 1 billion is spent each year on bribes throughout the world. The African Union estimates that corruption costs the African economy over 25% of its GDP on an annual basis.
When debating corruption in developing countries, however, we should not forget about the shameful practice, used until recently by countries such as the United States, Denmark or Germany, of allowing companies to use bribes and then permitting these sums to be listed as tax deductible expenses.
This practice was also used in Central and Eastern European countries, including Poland.
Corruption is a serious threat to development.
In order to understand the problem and to find an effective solution, it is imperative to take decisive action, such as creating a black list which would prevent banks providing funding, in the form of loans, to corrupt governments or their representatives.
Â Â  Mr President, last night the word âcorruptionâ was mentioned several times in our debate on World Health Day 2006.
This morning we are debating the scale and extent of it. I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report.
Some Members have mentioned the global problem of corruption.
I think we are deluding ourselves if we say that it is just a problem for the developing world.
I would suggest that they have learned from the developed world: much to our shame, we have taught them some tricks.
We therefore owe it to them and to ourselves to clean up our own act.
I would support my colleague, MrÂ Ryan, who said that the banks and the financial institutions need to be looked at in this entire process, because if there were no home to put the money into perhaps they might not be so corrupt.
This morning I spoke to some aid agencies that have long experience in this area.
Their key message to us is that we must build up the capacity within the systems and the civil service of the developing world, and then build that into all our aid programmes.
They also said that this is a long-term process and we will not get results overnight.
I think a big part of our crackdown on the corrupt is to take them out within the developed world first and then perhaps assist the rooting-out of corruption in the developing world.
Whatever we do, we must not penalise those who most need our aid, money and assistance.
I always feel when we talk about tackling corruption that it is they who will again suffer.
That is the one message.
Let us build it into our programmes, but let us ensure that we keep up our aid work, that it gets to the right people and that they do not suffer.
Â Â  Mr President, in his opening remarks Mr van den Berg â and indeed others â picked up on the huge amounts of money we are talking about.
In this Parliament we have to be realistic about what we can do.
The report looks at some of the aspects where we can make a difference.
I would like to concentrate on the role of parliaments.
The European Parliament has well-established links with parliaments in many of the countries around the world, the countries with which we are concerned.
Sometimes parliaments are the problem. I accept that.
But in others, as the previous speaker has mentioned, national parliaments can be excluded; they can be bypassed in the process and corrupt officials can get hold of the aid without the involvement of government.
Therefore, I believe we should do more to support democratically elected governments and help them to reinforce the mechanisms in their countries for distributing the aid and making sure that the money donated is widely used.
MrÂ Ryan referred to a very interesting point in the report: that there is evidence that corruption falls as the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women rises.
We can encourage that.
We can do more in democracies to make sure that more and more women are elected.
I was very proud to be part of the European Parliamentâs delegation to Afghanistan to support their first parliamentary elections.
There we saw women voting to elect other women.
The more we can do to help women and parliaments to develop, the better.
Â Â  Corruption is the by-product of a weak system of government, but also arises from the absence of definite values.
It is therefore of great practical importance that a society should possess an ethical framework and good practices in order to solve this problem.
Weak moral principles promote both self-serving transactions and the concealment of those transactions.
Those who provide aid are tempted to believe that their money is used for the correct purpose.
Those who receive aid often succeed in making us believe that is the case.
The corruption that accompanies the granting of aid is especially drastic because the actual people who are in distress suffer doubly.
They not only lose the material assistance they should have received, but they are also robbed of the hope to improve their lives and of the hope for solidarity.
Therefore it is our obligation to consistently expose and, even more importantly, prevent corruption and the gullibility that accompanies it.
It is the opinion of the Court of Auditors that the European Commissionâs aid programmes do not sufficiently take into consideration the risks of corruption.
I would like to offer two examples.
Firstly, European Union aid to the Palestinian Self-Government. Today we must admit that one of the main reasons the extremist Hamas movement came to power was the previous administrationâs deeply rooted corruption.
Secondly, the Commission sends humanitarian aid to Chechnya. What has been done to determine whether those funds actually reach the local inhabitants who suffer from official corruption?
Finally, I would like to emphasise a couple of important points in this very good report.
Member States must ratify the UN anti-corruption convention.
Secondly, budget support should only be provided to governments which are clearly striving to raise standards for the administration of public finances.
I am glad the representative supports that course.
A certain percentage of the aid granted should be allocated to supporting organisations that monitor civil society.
And last of all, the main problem, which is to put pressure on countries housing financial centres to freeze and repatriate illegal funds deposited there by corrupt rulers.
This is a very difficult requirement, but its implementation is a test that will demonstrate whether or not we are serious about preventing corruption.
Â Â  â Mr President, the fight against corruption is indeed a fight for peace and democracy, a fight against poverty and a fight to consolidate civil society in developing countries; relations between democracy and economic development in the developing countries have proven this and Amartya Sen, an important intellectual and winner of the Nobel prize in economic sciences, has confirmed it in his work better than anyone else.
It is truly amazing that, often both in the international community and in the European Union, the question of combating corruption has been a taboo.
That is because political expediencies, the Member States' interest in exerting their influence and international customer relations were more important.
The implementation of the Millennium Development Goals has been assessed as a failure.
However, noÂ one spoke about what the role of corruption was in that failure.
I believe that the international community should set a new development goal: democratic governance and combating corruption.
To close, I should like to add that the European Union, and especially the European Commission, must lay down strict conditionality mechanisms in the new development strategy formulated for Africa.
The European Union needs to collaborate with the UN, with international financing organisations and with non-governmental organisations, so that we can jointly combat this phenomenon, by putting the emphasis on consolidating civil society and independent media.
Â Â  Mr President, according to World Bank estimates, USD 1 billion is spent each year on bribes.
Imagine how many excellent initiatives could be funded with that amount of money.
Every year USD 1 billion could be spent and used to help those who really need aid.
Corruption restricts the access of the poor to goods.
It decreases the effectiveness of public services and, most of all, leads citizens to lose confidence in centres of power.
The European Union, as the largest donor of aid to developing countries, should play a particularly active role in ensuring the transparency of aid programmes funded from the Community budget.
It is therefore not enough to create an international âblack listâ of corrupt governments.
Politicians, civil servants, NGOs, international corporations and the media should all become involved in the fight against corruption.
It is only by coordinating the activities of international donors that aid can be spent more effectively, thus preventing misspending or the appropriation of aid money by corrupt civil servants.
This is why the report drafted by Mr Van den Berg is so important and so timely.
I would like to congratulate him on an excellent text.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the debate that we have had here today.
I think it is important to underline that the problem of fraud can never be considered as solved.
Constant vigilance at all levels and in all circumstances is needed in the high-risk field of external actions.
These actions are carried out in poorly governed States, where countervailing powers and capacities at the level of civil society are lacking.
As corruption cannot be isolated within the governance agenda, the Commissionâs approach in preventing and fighting it is twofold.
It consists of mainstreaming good governance practices in all EU-funded programmes and projects on the one hand, and in the implementation of specific programme interventions on the other hand.
Country strategy papers and national indicative programmes between the European Union and beneficiary countries generally include specific interventions in the fields of rule of law, democratisation, public administration reform, public finance management and reinforcement of civil society.
I shall now make a few comments on some of the questions that have been raised today.
On the discussion on companies, we must make sure that companies do not benefit from corruption.
We must do the best we can.
We can exclude companies from participation in our tenders if they have been found guilty of fraud or corruption.
We can also suspend a project that has been financed if we discover fraud or corruption at some stage.
We once used that option on a project in Zimbabwe.
On support for national parliaments, the Commission sees the strengthening of the national parliamentsâ supervisory role as an important means of trying to improve the overall effectiveness and impact of our development effort in these countries.
For instance, through the EDF and the budget line for South Africa, the capacities of national parliaments of some 11 ACP countries have been strengthened to a total amount of EURÂ 35 million since 2000.
On the subject of watchdogs, it is true that we work with private sector organisations.
We would be worse off if we did not have these watchdogs.
Several Members raised the issue of transparency, and it is a key issue.
That is why we support several programmes in the field of budget supervisory functions.
The promotion of efficient and transparent budgeting and public spending is at the heart of our budget support programmes.
Finally, through its permanent dialogue with the partner governments and the various regions, the Commission encourages the broadest possible participation of institutions at various levels, particularly at parliamentary level.
I have noted the view on the positive influence of the participation of women.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I note that we finished 20Â minutes early today.
Perhaps I could make the suggestion that in future the President be given, or have at his disposal, the option to continue the debate on a catch-the-eye basis if we finish so early, so that we can make more efficient use of Parliamentâs time.
Â Â  I will be happy to pass on the suggestion you just made.
That could indeed be an efficient way of using our working time.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  . Mr President, yesterday, in the light of a unilateral declaration put on the record by the Commission during Tuesday nightâs plenary debate on the regulation on certain fluorinated gases, the text of which was not introduced during conciliation and which compromises the spirit of the conciliation agreement and shows great disrespect and disregard for the clear will of Parliament and Council, I requested a postponement of the vote on the two reports on fluorinated gases, at least until today, to allow time to explore with colleagues in all political groups the serious implications for us as legislators of what we consider to have been an abuse of Parliament because of an internal turf war between two DGs within the Commission.
The Commissionâs role as Guardian of the Treaty and initiator of legislation is fully respected by this House and does not need to be constantly reiterated.
Likewise, we as legislators demand full respect from all sections and services within the Commission for our role.
Hours spent discussing better regulation and relations between the Commission and the European Parliament come to nothing if they are disregarded in this House by the Commission and Commission spokespersons.
I would like to put on record a letter written yesterday by ProfessorÂ Trakatellis, Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, and by me as rapporteur to President Barroso:
âWe are writing to express our disappointment about the content of the Declaration on the final text of the Fluorinated Gas Regulation made unilaterally by the Commission in the course of the European Parliament plenary session of 4Â April 2006.
âAs you are aware, the Regulation is an important step towards the achievement of the objectives set out in the Kyoto Protocol and in line with the European Climate Change Action Programme.
We fear that the Commissionâs Declaration was an attempt to compromise the difficult political agreement reached between the European Parliament and Council and with the support of the Commission.
âOn 31Â January both the European Parliament and the Council demonstrated a clear will to find a political solution to the problem of national measures, already adopted by some Member States, to reduce F-gas emissions.
The Declaration was made at the last minute and cannot be considered a positive step in the process of adoption of Community legislation.
We sincerely hope that the Commission will consider carefully its next steps, not only from a purely legal point of view, but also in accordance with the spirit of the agreement reached in Conciliation.â
The letter is signed by my colleague ProfessorÂ Trakatellis and me.
I was assured personally last night by CommissionerÂ Verheugen, the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry and Vice-President of the Commission, that â and I quote him with his permission: âIf the new regulation enters into force, I will propose to the Commission to withdraw the infringement procedures against Austria and Denmark.â
In good faith, I would request Commissioner Kyprianou, who is in the House today representing the Commission, to respond on behalf of the Commission to the serious concerns that have been generated by the text of Tuesday nightâs declaration.
Â Â  â As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important matter.
We are now awaiting a statement from the Commission â that is to say, from Commissioner Kyprianou â and then we can decide how to proceed.
Â Â  . Mr President, I note the points raised by Mrs Doyle.
On behalf of the Commission, I would like to reassure the House that the Commission undertakes to evaluate the pending infringement procedures with regard to the use of f-gases in Denmark and Austria, taking into account the spirit in which the final agreement was reached during conciliation.
This vote can therefore take place today.
Â Â  As I see that the rapporteur is happy with the statements by Commissioners Verheugen and Kyprianou, we can now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  We now come to the elections in Belarus, or White Russia.
With the Houseâs permission, I beg leave to extend a warm welcome to the candidate who took part in this election and fought for democracy in Belarus, MrÂ Milinkevich, who is seated in the gallery.
A very warm welcome to you!
As you can see, Mr Milinkevich, we all, from whatever party, want to see democracy in our Belarussian neighbour, and that is what we wish for it.
We wish you all the best at home.
Â Â  There was an agreement on Tuesday night by all the political groups to change one word in paragraph 8 from âintegrationâ to âperspectiveâ, which brings it into line with the ENP Report, for which I was the rapporteur, and with MrÂ Brokâs report on enlargement.
Mysteriously, the sessional services, not realising perhaps the sensitivity of this, decided of their own volition to put the word âaspirationsâ instead, without any consultation with the political groups.
Can we amend the joint text to the agreed word âperspectiveâ?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will be very brief.
We have just adopted resolutions on the elections in Belarus and Ukraine.
I think that our Parliament should include on its agenda a resolution on the presidential election in France, because the last election in 2002 led to pressure on public opinion and to violent demonstrations.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . Under the rules currently in force, residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein cannot be recognised for the purposes of transit into, or short-term stay in, the Schengen area.
This means that third-country nationals obliged to have a visa to enter Schengen territory, even though they have such a residence permit, must apply for a visa.
Given the seasonal mobility of migrant workers and their families, especially at holiday periods â around half a million people from Switzerland in 2003 â consulates in some Member States are hugely overloaded, while these people themselves are faced with lengthy waits and burdensome formalities.
I therefore support the creation of a simplified regime for the transit of these people, firstly, because they do not present any risk of illegal immigration or threat to security, as they were subject to control by the Swiss and Liechtenstein authorities when the residence permits were authorised.
I also support it on the grounds of reciprocity, given that since 2000 there has been similar exemption by these countries for holders of residence permits issued by EU Member States.
Â Â  . I wish, by means of this statement of vote, to give my support to this proposal, which I believe makes it possible to bring about a substantial improvement in this process.
The consequence of the current situation is that there is an enormous amount of work to be done by the Member Statesâ consulates in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein, and costs are incurred by third-country nationals.
This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs and must be changed.
When issuing residence permits, both Switzerland and Liechtenstein carry out exact examinations and inquiries, paying careful attention to security.
I would also like to point out that both Switzerland and Liechtenstein apply in every case the same high-quality security standards as the other States, which belong to the EU.
It is important to me that this statement of vote should be supportive of Switzerland and of those in it who are working towards its accession to the European Union.
Were Switzerland to join the EU, that would be something I would very much welcome, since Switzerland is a byword for high standards and has distinguished itself, , by a transport policy that many Member States should take as an example of how these things are to be done.
Â Â  We observe that those countries that have robust animal protection legislation in order to guarantee good conditions for animals, to reduce the risk of infection spreading and thus also to reduce the risk of damage to peopleâs health have not been hit by reduced sales of chicken meat.
We wish therefore, in the situation that has arisen, to emphasise the need to strengthen animal protection and food safety so that food producers will legitimately be able to earn the confidence of consumers.
The EU should therefore take action to bring about this state of affairs.
We do not, however, wish, in this emergency situation, to bring about a scenario in which, for fear of being hit financially, breeders hide infection or otherwise increase the risk of infection spreading.
In the situation that has arisen we are, therefore, in favour of its being possible to provide financial compensation to affected breeders.
Â Â  . We are disappointed at the rejection of our proposals, which advocated that all Community financing for compensating market measures should be set at 100%, as was the case for swine fever and BSE, given the seriousness of the socio-economic situation in some countries and the difficulty of guaranteeing cofinancing.
We did, however, vote in favour of the amendments, because they propose support for producers and, although they propose 50% Community cofinancing for restrictions on free circulation that may arise from the implementation of measures aimed at fighting the spread of animal diseases, they do propose 100% Community funding for serious market disturbances directly related to a loss of consumer confidence in light of risks to public or animal health.
Accordingly, a fundamental part of what we were proposing has been safeguarded, and we therefore expect the Commission and the Council to endorse Parliament's decision.
Â Â  We are voting against the European Parliamentâs amendments.
We believe that it is too early to adopt a position on how badly the poultry meat industry would be hit by an avian flu pandemic.
It is typical of this Parliament that, as soon as something unexpected happens, there are calls for financial aid with a view to maintaining stocks, for financial compensation following the destruction of foodstuffs and for the funding of information campaigns designed to win back consumer confidence.
We see no reason at this time for meeting these demands.
For how long should the planned economy be allowed to continue within the food industry?
Consumers cannot manage without eating and, if they cannot eat poultry, other sectors of the food industry will benefit instead.
We believe that the market is perfectly capable of adjusting to the current situation.
The poultry sector will have less reason to take preventative measures if it is given promises of compensation in advance.
Â Â  â Mr President, speaking on behalf of the delegation of the Austrian Peopleâs Party, I should like to make a statement of vote in relation to the Doyle report.
The Austrian delegation's support for it is expressly subject to the condition enunciated by Mrs Doyle and given on the basis of Commissioner Kyprianouâs statement.
We denounce in the strongest terms the unilateral statement made by the Commission once the compromise was reached between the Council and Parliament, and, in the light of the statements made today, we presume that, as a consequence of the new legislation, a halt will be called to the infringement proceedings against Denmark and Austria.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I will say on the subject of the Doyle report is that it is very important to all of us that the Kyoto targets be achieved.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Doyle report on the joint text for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases, as it establishes a legal framework for such gases with high emission levels, some of which are more harmful than CO2, and could remain in the atmosphere within 50Â 000 years.
In order to meet the Kyoto objectives and to protect the environment, this regulation will guarantee recycling, the regeneration or destruction of equipment that uses fluorinated gases, and better information for European consumers on the global warming potential of these gases.
Â Â  . The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee is highly satisfactory and offers major improvements as regards gas emissions into the atmosphere.
The double legal basis laid down is appropriate for this kind of regulation, as it allows certain Member States to maintain tighter environmental legislation without upsetting the balance of the internal market in Europe.
Containing emissions and leaks strikes me as the right way of meeting the aim of reducing fluorinated gas emissions into the atmosphere.
The obligation to report the certification of personnel responsible to the Commission every year and the policy of recovery for recycling or recovery of equipment are measures that I warmly welcome.
I therefore agree with the decision taken by the Conciliation Committee.
Â Â  On behalf of the SPÃ delegation and as their representative on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to state that Austria and Denmark have imposed overall bans on the utilisation of fluorinated greenhouse gases.
This legislation must ensure the possibility of stricter regulations being retained.
The draft produced by the Conciliation Committee provides that Member States may retain stricter national requirements until the end of 2012.
This step is possible under Article 95(10) of the Treaty and ensures that Austria and Denmark can retain their stricter measures on a temporary basis.
It also means that the scientific evidence pursuant to Article 94(4) need not be provided.
Any restrictive interpretation of the safeguard clause must be rejected, since the Member Statesâ discretion must in no way be impaired.
Â Â  . A new recycling facility opened in Cork in January.
I passed it on Saturday evening and noticed an already impressive stack of refrigerators that had accumulated in less than ten weeks.
These mountains of ageing refrigerators, and in warmer climates air conditioners, are rusting in every population centre in the EU.
Strong fluorinated greenhouse gases legislation is long overdue to rectify the past and protect our climate into the future.
I congratulate all parties in this process in reaching agreement to protect stricter laws in countries like Denmark, and in issues of labelling.
Though I note that the Commission had second thoughts, I feel we must hold it to its word.
I look forward to the day when the EU will be compliant with its Kyoto obligation on f-gases.
Â Â  . The agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee is a satisfactory one and offers significant improvements as regards gas emissions into the atmosphere.
Restricting the use of HFC-134a and other gases with high greenhouse effect in new vehicles launched onto the market since 2011 and the extension to cover all vehicles as from 2017 are measures that will bring about a significant reduction in emissions.
As the alternatives to this gas are still at the development stage, the permission to use HFC-152a is appropriate, on the proviso that this is part of a gradual elimination.
I therefore agree with the decision taken by the Conciliation Committee.
Â Â  â Mr President, again and again, we are shocked by reports of tragedies involving refugees and by the accounts given by the victims of unscrupulous gangs of traffickers.
Many people have nothing left to lose other than their lives, and even those they very often lose as they journey towards the Europe that they regard as a land of milk and honey.
Even if they reach their destination, they are obliged to work endlessly to pay off their debts to the traffickers, under intolerable conditions, and as, among other things, prostitutes.
The only way we will break this vicious circle is by a restrictive common immigration policy.
For that, we do of course still need refugee camps outside Europe, since our own camps in Europe are often full to overflowing, with serious violence breaking out between inmates of different cultures.
For that reason among others, and also in order to rob refugees of the illusion that they can enter the EU illegally, I have voted against this resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly a positive development that Parliament has given its verdict on the subject of Maltaâs immigration centres and, what is more, only a few days after the visit by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which I was able to take part as a delegate.
The resolution adopted, which is the product of the invaluable contribution of all the groups, exposes the seriousness of the situation for the refugees living in inhuman conditions, with virtually no basic sanitation or personal care.
The resolution, however, makes it quite clear that Europe is highly responsible for what happens in Malta.
It goes without saying that the delegationâs visits to reception centres throughout Europe are not intended for the purposes of rating centres as good or bad.
However, the situation in Malta, although a far cry from that of Lampedusa in terms of the occupantsâ living conditions, does call to mind that Italian island in terms of its size and reception capacity.
I therefore urge the Council to adopt a clear and strong position so that, in line, of course, with the principle of solidarity, we arrive as quickly as possible at a common and fair immigration policy aimed at preventing the costs of these waves of illegal immigrants from burdening only the budgets of a few States on the periphery of southern Europe, which are totally unable to support themselves financially.
Â Â  The June List is opposed to a single common European policy on asylum and refugees.
We do not therefore believe that this is an issue for the European Parliament.
We believe that the Member States themselves should be free to decide what forms their immigration and asylum policies should take, as long as they are in accordance with current international law.
Human rights should not be infringed.
We defend a humane policy on refugees and are opposed to asylum seekers being placed in detention camps.
We are voting against the resolution in its entirety.
Â Â  The plenary discussion in the presence of Alexander Milinkevich has provided an expression of the European Parliamentâs solidarity with the Belarus people in their struggle against totalitarianism, for freedom and a new tomorrow.
In its resolution, the European Parliament speaks in no uncertain terms of the presidential elections having been manipulated.
It sounds an alarm bell over the dictatorâs armed suppression of a peaceful demonstration by the Belarus people.
These people have stopped being afraid, even though they do not know what awaits them.
The European Parliamentâs attention is focused on the arrested opposition leaders and we are demanding their immediate release.
The resolution acknowledges the immense enthusiasm of the young people who have now been thrown out of universities.
It is these young people who need a helping hand, as they will be shaping the future of their country.
Slovakia has already joined those countries that have pledged to help such students, and they will now be able to complete their studies in Slovakia.
In voting for this resolution, it was my wish also to focus attention on the need for new elections in Belarus as soon as possible.
Although Lukashenko has won the elections by rigging the vote, he has not beaten his opponents.
The isolation of Lukashenko as aÂ person will lead to his defeat.
In conclusion, I would like to express my conviction that the request I made in the plenary of the European Parliament â that we should light a candle at 4 p.m. on the 16th day of every month in a show of solidarity with the Belarus people â will be heeded, and that everybody will be happy to do this.
I believe that the flame of solidarity will never be extinguished in the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, point 2 of the resolution required us to vote on two separate issues.
I had no problem adopting and supporting the first, but the second was problematic and I abstained.
In my opinion, the Belarus elections were not free, but the results were not falsified.
On the other hand, the US presidential elections that preceded this â that is, not the most recent ones but the ones before â were free, but in that case the results were falsified.
Parliament took no stand on that.
I hope that Parliament will also take a stand on the presidential elections in the oil-producing countries of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, and other countries which are not free and where the results have been falsified.
Â Â  Ukraine had an Orange Revolution but life there remained grey.
Moscow had a White Revolution and the result is clear to see: a fall of 10 years in life expectancy, a declining population, crime, destruction of the healthcare systems and pillaging of the country's assets for the benefit of the oligarchs.
Just one more push and the crimes of liberalism will equal the crimes of communism.
We must not deprive Belarus of all the delights generated by the market.
Belarusians too are entitled to the freedom of the media/military/political oligarchy, with its entourage of unemployment, passive euthanasia of the elderly, cultural degradation, economic stagnation, brutal individualism and social isolation.
It is quite understandable that the European Parliament is delighted with the media-political democracy of the magnates Messrs Berlusconi, Bouygues, LagardÃšre and Murdoch.
Belarus too has a right to national liberal destitution and to degenerate, media-led democracy.
Â Â  . I represented my group in the negotiations on the compromise resolution on Belarus.
My advice to co-sign this resolution was not taken up in the end, and nor, in my opinion, was the wording of some sections of it ideal.
It remains of the essence, though, that the re-election of President Lukashenko, brought about by intimidation and deception, should not be recognised by the outside world; that opposition movements and publications deserve external support and that students who flee the country must be offered the option of studying in their own language.
I have upheld that position in this House before, as I have in demonstrations outside it.
Unfortunately, my group appears unable to give its unanimous backing to a resolution to this effect.
Those opposed to this resolution are probably right for the time being when they say that workers and retired people in Belarus enjoy a higher level of social security than do their counterparts in any other former Soviet republics.
That will only be the case, though, for as long as Russia thinks it can absorb that country by supplying it with cheap oil.
This social security does not justify dictatorships or election frauds.
My party, the Socialist Party, detests dictatorship.
Socialism only has a future as a democratic movement, in open competition with other opinions, and certainly not as a dictatorship.
I stand by my support for the resolution.
Â Â  . â The Kommounistiko Komma Elladas is voting against the joint motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and expresses its solidarity with the people of Belarus.
It is blatant intervention in the internal affairs of an independent country, it infringes every concept of international law and it is equivalent to a declaration of war against a people standing up against imperialist barbarity.
The European Parliament, elected by 30% of the citizens of the ÎU, is trying to give lessons in democracy to a people of whom 93% participated in the elections and 80% of whom elected the President.
The European Council is prohibiting entry to the elected President Lukashenko, the European Parliament is taking under its wing and lavishly financing Milinkevich, who is making out that he represents the people but who, despite the bundle of money which he received, mustered up a 'surprising' 6% in the elections and 2Â 000 paid 'demonstrators' in the 'impressive demonstrations'.
The rabid reactions of the political representatives of imperialism are understandable, because abundant financing and interventions failed to create 'orange', 'pink' or 'green and yellow revolutions'.
Following the proud response of the people of Belarus, they are trying with terrorism, slander and fascist-type sanctions to isolate the country and its people.
The workers and the grass-roots movement need to condemn the imperialist plans and stand side by side in their struggle and their right to decide on their future and choose their own destiny.
Â Â  The Left Partyâs delegation to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left firmly repudiates the Lukashenko regime and its crimes in violation of democratic and human rights.
We believe that the presidential election in Belarus infringed a number of fundamental principles underpinning democratic and fair elections.
We are therefore voting in favour of the resolution.
That does not mean that we support every single bit of wording in the resolution.
What, however, is crucial to us is to protest against the infringements of democratic and human rights in Belarus.
Â Â  . Mr President, the situation in Belarus becomes graver by the day, and we must continue to keep a close eye on developments there.
