This new structure will constitute a qualitative leap in the safety of European coasts and in the fight to prevent pollution caused by ships.
I voted in favour of Mr Goodwill's report on the basis that it will help to further protect the environment.
The proposal extends the scope of existing Directives 70/156/EEC and 80/1268 as regards the measurement of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption.
In other words new light goods vehicles will now have to respect requirements that are broadly similar to the ones that are already applied to passenger cars.
I hope that by measuring the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide in these vehicles we will be able to develop possible measures to improve vehicle performance in these areas.
In order to secure an EU type approval for light commercial vehicles, the Directive will include a requirement that in the future vehicles be tested for carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption.
Member States will not be able to allow the registration and entry into service of light commercial vehicles if they do not have a valid certificate of conformity for this type of approval after 1 January 2007.
Ultimately, both the environment and vehicle operators stand to gain from this proposal if carbon monoxide can be measured and then cut back and if vehicle performance can be improved.
The main message sent by the Kyoto Protocol is that of the internalisation of the environmental costs to the economy of the greenhouse effect.
This economic internalisation, which is already taking place in the industry and energy sectors, specifically under the European Directive on Emissions Trading (on the first reading of which this Parliament will shortly vote), must be extended to all economic sectors and to all activities.
I therefore welcome this proposal for a directive targeting N1 vehicles and I welcome Mr Goodwill's report.
In light of the major changes in tourism, the current VAT system applicable to European travel agencies is inappropriate, out of date and extremely anti-competitive.
I therefore support the European Commission initiative and the amendments by the rapporteur, Mrs Torres Marques, to make the system more straightforward and more competitive.
The very active tourism industry in the Algarve region can only benefit from such a change.
Travel agencies and tour operators outside the EU will have to pay VAT when they provide services to European customers, and conversely, European travel agencies will be exempt from VAT when they provide services to customers residing outside the EU, thereby re-establishing healthy and fair competition in the European internal market.
We voted against this report which again proposes, on the pretext of 'combating terrorism', to 'facilitate co-operation between the police and judicial authorities in the fight against terrorism'.
Stepping up repression wherever this may be (Ireland, the Basque Country, Corsica, etc) with contempt for the quest for a political solution, has not yet shown that it is the way to stamp out terrorism.
Repression has instead, in response, played a part in fuelling terrorism.
In reality, 'combating terrorism' is only being used here as a pretext to further strengthen Europe's security measures, whilst once again highlighting the fact that it is beyond the control of the population.
The fact that this proposal emanates from the Kingdom of Spain, whose security measures have retained many of the traits inherited from Francoism, does nothing to inspire confidence.
It is certainly not a lack of security measures that Europe is suffering from. It is, on the contrary, suffering from abuses of security, where migrant workers must, in addition to all their other problems, deal with the suspicion of being potential 'terrorists'.
I have voted in favour of these two proposals because they form part of a coherent set of horizontal measures that will ensure the correct and effective implementation of the measures that the EP has already adopted in the fight against terrorism (the framework decision on combating terrorism and the framework decision on the European arrest warrant).
Serious account must be taken of the terrorist threat, on both sides of the Atlantic, because it constitutes not only one of the greatest threats to democracy, the free exercise of human rights and free economic and social development; above all, it constitutes an attack on the most fundamental of human rights; the right to life.
I am, therefore, pleased to see that the European Union has made considerable progress since the terrible events of 11 September 2001, on exchanging information, on police and judicial coordination in the fight against terrorism and on its legislative framework.
I hope that the next step will be to reach agreement on the priority that must be attached to the issues of funding the fight against terrorism and of stepping up our dialogue with the United States (and the priority for the negotiations opened this summer and an agreement on judicial cooperation with the United States to be concluded).
The fight against terrorism must always be marked by the values of the democratic rule of law, by respect for citizens' rights and by common standards of justice.
Any fight that disregards these priorities would represent an unjustifiable concession to barbarity and an unacceptable rejection of the values of our civilisation.
This initiative by Spain, within the Council, is part of the process of strengthening supranational police and judicial mechanisms - specifically at EU level - in the name of the so-called 'fight against terrorism'.
Bodies which evade democratic and jurisdictional control (Europol and Eurojust), are being developed and strengthened, bypassing the guarantees for rights and freedoms laid down in national legislative and constitutional frameworks.
Cooperation between national States is bypassed with the creation of mechanisms for supranational control over these States.
It is worth emphasising that the proposal for the creation of a 'mechanism for evaluating the legal systems and their implementation at national level in the fight against terrorism' bypasses and breaches the legal base that currently exists in the Treaties.
Amongst other aspects, these initiatives are part of a security shift that increasingly threatens fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees.
Although the rapporteur has tabled proposals for amendments that seek to introduce assurances and safeguards for fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees - for example, for the transfer and management of personal information and data (it should be noted that Europol is bound by agreements with third countries, not least with the USA) - this does not change the general tenor of the initiatives that have been proposed.
Hence our vote against the report.
I have voted against the report by Mr Galeote in the conviction that the new Rules of this Parliament have been used in an improper manner by the big political groups of this House.
The Galeote report is best summed up in the words used yesterday by Mr Turco during the debate.
I would support his analysis as a whole.
While the British Conservative Delegation are determined to play a full part in the fight against terrorism and fully support enhanced cooperation between the police and other law enforcement organisations in the various Member States, we cannot support moves towards the extension of Eurojust.
The United Kingdom should not become a member of Eurojust and should retain its own strong resistance to terrorism.
The Delegation supports the initiatives in the recent Kirkhope report on the establishment of Joint Investigation teams in which police forces combine intelligence in the fight against major criminals.
This initiative has yet to be implemented in the Member States.
Eurojust is not the way forward and is unnecessary if cooperation is improved following the Kirkhope report.
For the reasons outlined above the British Conservative Delegation abstained on this report.
As today's debate has amply illustrated, the machinery for producing undemocratic, repressive legislation has gone into overdrive in the European Union.
The objective of the Spanish Government's initiatives (voted without debate under the new Rules of Procedure) is to strengthen and accelerate the decisions on collecting and exchanging information which have already been taken and to stifle the Member States with strict supervision to ensure they transpose the European terrorism law and the European arrest warrant into their legislation quickly and faithfully. Their fear appears to be that, with pressure from democratic grass-roots movements already voicing their opinion in numerous countries, the Member States may not fall into line with this dire legislation.
As part of improved coordination, Member States are obliged, contrary to all notions of national sovereignty, to collate a minimum number of facts on so-called terrorist-related crimes and pass them on to Europol and Eurojust.
Just what is meant by coordination and uniform police and judicial cooperation is perfectly clear from the confidential Europol document leaked recently which, under the telling title 'European Best Practices on Handling Information Sources', sanctions the use of grasses and sting operations by agents acting for the police who will go unpunished even if they help commit the crime!
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the texts in question.
.
(NL) Authoritarian governments have always been characterised by the notion that they can best survive criticism on their policy by restricting their citizens in their freedom of information exchange, opinion, organisation and travel.
The fear of terror attacks that has grown since last year has prompted a revival of plans to reinforce the army, police and secret services and to restrict civil liberties.
For a while, this fear makes these controversial plans more acceptable to a large proportion of the population than they would be at other times.
The public have since discovered the drawbacks of such a development.
In the Netherlands, a campaign among computer users against the requirement that electronic mail be stored, requested by the Council, gained 2500 supporters within the space of two days last week.
Quite apart from this breach of the mail's confidentiality, which has been in existence for more than a century, there have been attempts to deprive radical opposition movements of all prospects and cause them to resort to violence, upon which they can be declared illegal.
Political organisations in exile, based in Europe, are stripped of their right of residence and are cut off from the movement of payments.
Fortunately, this Parliament too is starting to realise that fear of terror should not be a reason for abolishing the democratic and tolerant character of our society.
I reject the proposal, but endorse the proposals to better protect personal data, inform Parliament and place reports in the public domain.
. (PT) My vote in favour of this report reflects my agreement with the two initiatives by Spain aimed at establishing measures to facilitate cooperation between the police and judicial authorities in the fight against terrorism.
My favourable vote also reflects my support for the main amendments tabled by the rapporteur: the stipulation that information transferred under this decision should be limited to criminal investigations of terrorist activities; the call for each Member State to appoint a Eurojust correspondent responsible for issues involving terrorism, rather than giving the Member States the option to appoint another competent authority and the call for Member States to set up joint investigation teams to combat terrorism whenever closer cooperation is needed and, specifically, for complex cases with transnational implications.
Mr President, I have to say, with regard to the Gebhardt report, that I could not prevent myself dreaming of Mr Antonio Di Pietro, our fellow Member, who is well-known in Italy and throughout Europe in circles where judicial networks are a topic of conversation.
On the subject of networks, I dreamt that Mr Di Pietro was a fisherman and that he was casting nets from his boat.
However, the net he was casting was a judicial net and it caught a lot of big fish, but the small fish managed to escape because, as you know, they want to become pensioners.
Well then, in my opinion, this dream means that we will have an excellent catch of European criminals in this judicial network, as I saw in my dream.
The British Conservative Delegation do not see any cause to introduce pan-European judicial training.
This is a matter for individual Member States and the present system of training the Judiciary is unique and particular to each of those States.
It should remain this way.
There are also implications for the budget of the European Union which are unacceptable and will be separately resisted in the budgetary process.
The British Conservatives cannot support the measures in this report.
. (PT) I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the French initiative under our consideration will improve our knowledge of the legal and judicial situation of the Member States and of the Community and, consequently, the performance of all members of the judiciary in the European Union and its Member States - judges, magistrates, lawyers and, possibly, police officers with duties similar to those of a magistrate.
This network, comprising national schools and institutions of the Member States responsible for further judicial training, has already existed informally since October 2000, but does not have legal personality.
This limitation means that it cannot receive funding from Community or Member States' budgets, which will change if this French initiative is adopted, as it will then be eligible for funding under the EU's general budget.
In short, this is yet another boost to improving our knowledge of the judicial and legal systems of the Member States and of the legal instruments on which judicial cooperation in the EU is based.
We have just received the enormous document (approximately 200 pages) of the draft regulation laying down health rules concerning products intended for animal feed.
In terms of content, the text is rather good, and we supported it, since it introduces strict rules, it bans the use, in animal feed, of substances that have been declared unfit for human consumption, and it bans 'animal cannibalism'.
It is, instead, the form of the text that is to be criticised; it is a regulation, to be directly applied in all Member States.
It is also extremely detailed.
And, lastly, it is forced to allow certain exemptions which further complicate its provisions, for example, for feeding animals with kitchen waste in Germany and in Austria.
We think that it would be wiser, in these cases, to provide - at European level only - framework texts laying down objectives, even if it means presenting, at the same time, an example model for a regulation that the Member States could transpose by amending it according to their specific national characteristics.
This formula would be much more flexible, and would leave the Member States much more room for manoeuvre.
It would probably please everyone, except for unification fanatics.
Mr President, if Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m will forgive me, last night, I dreamt of her too.
Why is that?
Because I had met a GMO who said to me - none of us know what GMOs look like - that he, in his turn, had dreamt he was Ulysses, tied up so as not to succumb to the temptation of the sirens, and that he had seen a beautiful GMO - resembling Mrs WallstrÃ¶m - which called to him: 'Follow me, follow me and you will be happy.'
But it was only a dream, Mr President: reality is different.
I therefore voted against the report, despite the fact that I was convinced in my dream that I should follow the recommendations of the siren, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
I am afraid Mrs WallstrÃ¶m seems to be paying more attention to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo than to you, Mr Fatuzzo.
The Commission proposal on the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms unfortunately does less than the Cartagena Protocol which it is supposed to apply.
The main shortcomings which need to be addressed are as follows:
One: the principle of prevention needs to be clearly stated in the Community text.
Two: the same weights and measures should apply to both the EU internal market and external trade.
If a product is not marketed on the internal market, it should be banned for export.
Three: full responsibility for the movement of banned genetically modified organisms should rest with the country of export; it should not be shifted on to the country of import.
Four: the public must be fully informed.
Five: everything should be done to ensure that large companies do not use their multinational structure to evade controls.
The amendments by the European Parliament Committee on the Environment are on the right track, which is why I support them.
We shall vote in favour of the amendments advocated by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on transboundary movements of GMOs.
The draft text presented by the Commission does not go as far as the Cartagena Protocol of 29 January 2000 on the prevention of biotechnology risks; it does not take sufficient account of the precautionary principle included in the Rio Declaration on the environment nor of current debates in Europe itself on these questions.
The Commission is making a superficial interpretation of the Cartagena Protocol (which was the result of a compromise) even though it is clear, however, that the latter is based primarily on the precautionary principle.
Such an approach can only serve to strip the Cartagena Protocol of its meaning, at the very time when its ratification by the Member States is underway.
This is a serious matter.
We have recently witnessed, once again, at the Johannesburg conference on sustainable development, held at the end of August and beginning of September, that in the absence of firmly declared political will, the specific interests of the agro-industry and the multinationals, as well as the purely commercial ways of reasoning, are given preference over the general interest of populations.
The European Union must use its influence at international level, not to dilute the dynamic released by Cartagena, but to strengthen it.
The same goes for its responsibility.
In May 2000, the European Union and its Member States signed the Cartagena Protocol on the prevention of biotechnological risks in the fields of the safe transfer, handling and use of GMOs.
This European Commission proposal for a regulation is extremely important because it boosts the practical implementation of the Cartagena Protocol in the European Union, thereby preventing situations of distortion of competition that could arise if these rules were defined at national level.
The rapporteur has improved the proposal for a regulation, and his proposal to ban GMO exports that have not been authorised in the European Union itself warrants particular applause.
It is crucial that we make ongoing efforts, also within the framework of transboundary movements, to ensure an adequate degree of protection for the safe transfer, manipulation and use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) created by modern biotechnology, which are likely to have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and thereby to prevent risks to human health.
This is the concern of this Regulation, now being studied at first reading, which seeks to establish the provisions necessary to the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol.
We fully support this because in this highly sensitive field, the Community Regulation is seeking to prevent disparities and the imposition of Member States' regulatory and administrative legal provisions and thereby to provide greater legal security and to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market.
In view of the potential risk that GMOs can constitute for the environment in general and biological diversity in particular, we Swedish Christian Democrats have chosen to support a restrictive policy.
With reference to the precautionary principle, we believe that the country of import's rules must be respected by the exporter.
We also believe it to be very important for common rules governing liability for damage to be drawn up at international level.
It should, moreover, go without saying that we must not export GMOs that we do not ourselves permit within the European Union.
The provisions of the regulation should be applied, irrespective of when the Cartagena Protocol comes into force.
Mr President, last Thursday, I was taking part in a television programme in Milan.
The Cardinal of Milan, His Excellency Dionigi Tettamanzi, from the city of Genoa, had stated the day before that we must open our arms to the immigrants who come to Europe, particularly, to Milan, and I am afraid that he received abusive telephone calls during the programme from disgruntled people who did not agree with this recommendation.
Therefore, voting for better immigration, I thought of what Mr Vatanen said to me, personally, a few days ago: 'What if we had been born in Senegal? What if we had been born in one of the countries from which these people are forced to emigrate to come to Europe and make a living?'.
We welcome the rejection, by a slim, right-wing majority, of the Evans report on asylum.
In paragraph 1 of the resolution, it called on 'the Commission and Member States to prioritise the construction of a common immigration policy in order to relieve pressure on the asylum system'.
Thus, the first solution proposed by the left-wing Members of the House to reduce the number of bogus asylum seekers was to open up our borders more, and to take in such people as legal immigrants!
The resolution continued in the same vein.
In paragraph 3, the Commission was called upon to ensure that the 'best practice' is followed in the field of asylum which 'will be based first and foremost and above all (take good note of that expression: above all) on ensuring Member States' fulfilment of their international protection obligations'.
Therefore, for the left-wing Members of this House, the main objective is to take in individuals who are persecuted, regardless of their numbers.
The Left is clearly and blatantly relegating to the background the objectives regarding domestic security and the balance of our societies.
.
(NL) During the Cold War, refugees from the East were very welcome in Western Europe.
Seeking refuge was praised as a freedom-loving act, which presupposed universal solidarity.
These days, refugees mostly hail from further afield, look different to western Europeans, and there is far less understanding for the situation from which they are fleeing.
Since the standard of living in the country they are leaving behind is always lower than ours, they are from the very start suspected of having economic motives for fleeing.
This situation has been exacerbated over the past year by the fear that refugees could be terrorist infiltrators.
EU Member States tend to prescribe upper limits to the number of refugees they will allow in their countries, and set their reception levels lower than those of the neighbouring states.
This is how we create a Fortress Europe, which denies access to people even in huge distress and in respect of whom international treaties are being violated.
The upshot is that, even more than before, families are being torn apart and that people are sent back to a country that is unsafe for them, where they head for disaster.
I reject the main idea, but support the proposals tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs not to extradite anyone to countries where capital punishment is a threat, possibly to deny refugee status only to war criminals, and to take account of the increasing number of female asylum seekers.
Mr President, Mrs Angelilli's report recommends - and I support this - providing compensation to crime victims.
I personally and the Pensioners Party which I represent, not least because many pensioners and elderly people are the victims of crimes, albeit minor crimes such as bag-snatching and burglary, believe that it is right that the state should provide compensation for the victims of crimes.
Indeed, it is not just the authors of the crimes who are guilty: the State which ought to be carrying out scrutinies and monitoring and guaranteeing that these crimes do not happen, preventing them, and which ought to be educating its citizens to respect the law, is guilty too.
I therefore call for this initiative to provide compensation for the victims of crimes to proceed and for public officials who do not do their job properly, especially the most influential, high-level politicians and administrators in our States, to receive heavy fines.
The report by Mrs Roberta Angelilli is an improvement on the Commission's Green Paper on a legislative framework for compensating victims of crime.
The basic idea put forward in the report, that all Member States should establish compensation schemes for victims of crime who cannot obtain compensation from the offenders responsible for the crime or through any means, including victims of terrorism, is a good one, because the European Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes, which has applied since 1988, has not been signed by all the Member States and, even where it has, it does not allow the victims of violent crimes to apply for state compensation.
The directive on best practices in the various Member States, which the Commission is also called on to introduce, is a good move and will help less-experienced Member States deal with these issues.
I have already said in my explanation of vote on the Evans report that, in the area of asylum, the primary duty of responsible governments today is to ensure that an influx of refugees does not upset the balance in our countries.
In this respect, and with the Angelilli report in mind, the most important and the easiest task would be to ensure that we ourselves do not make the provisions of the Geneva Convention worse.
For example, we learn that the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers who met on 13 September, in other words, just 10 days ago, agreed on a broad definition of the concept of refugee, by adopting broader criteria than those of the Geneva Convention.
In particular, according to their conclusions, the threat of persecution does not necessarily always come from State authorities, it could also come 'from non-State agents'.
Before extending definitions in this way, we would like our governments to consider carefully the millions of people who are likely to call on this new right, and to consider the financial and social costs that, in such cases, their initiatives could inflict on our countries.
In this area too, it would be better to give greater consideration straight away to alternative means of protection other than asylum.
My vote in favour of this report reflects first my applause for the Green Paper on 'Compensation to crime victims', presented in May of this year by the Commission, which has provided a considerable boost in this sensitive field, attempting to lay down minimum common standards for the compensation of victims, that are respected throughout EU territory and, whenever possible, in accordance with the principle of reciprocity where third countries are concerned.
Furthermore, my vote reflects my support for the magnificent report by Mrs Angelilli.
The report suggests specifically that the minimum standards must include a clear definition, agreed on by all the Member States, of the types of offence that could be liable to compensation, with the prior provision of some objective characteristics.
I also agree with the rapporteur's recommendation for the creation of a European victim support freephone line which would operate around the clock in all the official languages of the European Union.
Mr President, what purpose do the cosmetics with which many women beautify themselves serve?
One poor elderly pensioner said to me: 'I have beggared myself with these cosmetics which have made these women look so beautiful.
I have spent all my money.
Now I am penniless, a poor pensioner, but I am happy because I have enjoyed my life'.
Another pensioner, however, said to me: 'I, on the other hand, resisted the temptations of these women who use cosmetics and now I am a rich pensioner, but I regret the fact that I too did not have a happier, more enjoyable life with more contact with beautiful women who use cosmetics.'
I did not know what to do, so I looked at Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who I am sure uses cosmetics which have not been tested on animals.
What a beautiful lady Mrs Roth-Behrendt is!
It is patently obvious that the cosmetics she uses are useful, maybe even more so than those tested on animals.
Well then, we must follow the example of Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and so I voted for the motion.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
It is my sad duty to inform you of the murder, in a terrorist attack, of Don Juan Carlos Beira Montes, a Civil Guard, in Leiza, in Navarre, Spain.
Once again, the blind hatred of ETA terrorism has struck a citizen of the Union, a member of the police force of a democratic State.
As on previous occasions, I would like to express the European Parliament's total condemnation of this act and our complete solidarity with the family of the deceased, the citizens of Spain and the Spanish authorities.
Together we will win the battle against terrorism.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to observe a minute's silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr MacCormick has the floor.
Mr President, might I draw attention to Item 12 of the Minutes, dealing with one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
My name appears twice in that list, but Members present will recall that I specifically made a point of order, concerning rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure.
I therefore think that this should have been recorded as a point of order, while the point that I was making should be recorded in the Minutes.
Your comments will be taken into account and the Minutes will be duly corrected.
Are there any other comments, ladies and gentlemen?
(The Minutes were approved thus amended)
The next item is the debate on the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2003.
As you know, this is a new type of debate, so I would thank you for your patience and cooperation.
Mr Wynn, chairman of the Committee on Budgets, will open the debate.
Mr President, we have never done anything like this before and I welcome the opportunity to open this debate.
In normal, run-of-the-mill circumstances when we have the budget debate, we have already voted on first readings in committee, we come to the Chamber and most of us make a three-minute speech if we are lucky or, if not, a one and a half minute speech.
What is more, they are statements and nothing is really gained because the work has already been done.
What we are trying to gain from this session is a real dialogue, mainly with the Commission, but also with the Council, to seek guidance on how we should vote next week and to ask questions concerning events since the preliminary draft budget (PDB) was first presented.
Since the PDB several things have happened, including the Council's vote on its draft budget which is what we vote upon.
Our committees have been working with the rapporteurs to ensure that we can bring forward sensible amendments.
As always, the amendments in front of us always exceed the amount of money that is available.
It is the job of both our rapporteurs to assess those amendments.
No doubt during the debate you will be asked questions concerning what you think of some of those amendments.
We also have the situation of a more precise legislative programme since the PDB and we need to assess the changes.
We have had external events such as the floods and we want to know how these will affect next year's budget.
From our own perspective there are areas where we are unclear on how things will be funded.
For instance, we still have no agreement with the Council or the Commission on how the EUR 27 million in Category 2 for the fisheries reconstruction programme will be found.
Maybe someone will ask about that and if there are any ideas we will be grateful to hear them.
A prime objective of the Development Committee is to ensure that the Global Health Fund has a significant amount of money.
One of the reasons for this is that if we do not put in significant amounts the European Union may not have a seat at the table - a seat on the board.
Is that true?
What amounts do we need?
I would hope that this issue will also be raised with the Commission so we can have guidance on it.
With those few opening remarks, let me thank not only the Commission in general but also the individual Commissioners who are going to contribute to this debate.
I would also like to thank the President-in-Office for being here.
I hope the debate will be useful, fruitful and influence our votes next week in committee, because if it does not we will all have wasted four hours of our time.
Mr President, like the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, I am most grateful for this new debate.
We floated the idea as early as last spring, when we were extremely uncertain as to whether our efforts would come to anything.
For us, it has been the overarching objective to try to reform the European Parliament's budgetary work, especially with a view to next year's completely new method of 'Activity Based Budgeting'.
In this context, it has been important also to be able to renew the debate itself, which is perhaps the most visible part of Parliament's budgetary work.
This reform also means that we have endeavoured to increase the committees' participation in the work.
I have been round practically all the committees and discussed budget issues with them, and we are now also encouraging the committees to take an active part in today's debate.
By using working parties and different types of report to focus more sharply upon the degree of implementation and upon the major budgetary deficiencies we have in the area of implementation, we shall now tighten up our demands for Parliament's budgetary decisions actually to be put into practice.
Against this background, I welcome the way in which the Commission, the Council, a majority of Commissioners and the Danish Finance Minister in his Presidency role have taken part in the debate, and I hope that Parliament's own representatives will also make substantial efforts to ensure that we obtain a more exciting and constructive debate than has been provided by the fairly predictable monologues delivered up until now.
The EU's budgetary system suffers from serious defects, especially a lack of flexibility.
I believe that both Parliament and, certainly, the public have difficulty understanding why it is completely impossible to find resources for the proactive part of agricultural policy known as rural development, while billions are allocated to the other dimension of agricultural policy.
Knowing, as we did, that there were resources elsewhere that were not being used, it has also been difficult for us to refuse the administrative expenditure needed for enlargement and to try to find a way of funding this expenditure without making use of the flexibility instrument.
Consequently, one of this year's innovations is that we have tried more systematically to find and make use of unemployed resources and have contrived more systematically to bring expenditure forward in order to ease the pressure on a heavily burdened category over the next few years, something which might, for example, make it easier to meet the needs that exist prior to enlargement.
That is a temporary solution.
I really think we need a much more extensive budgetary reform.
I also think we should address this issue in the Convention.
The incredibly inflexible budget ceilings we live with at present should not be turned into permanent fixtures.
They should definitely not be enshrined in the Treaty, and Parliament should self-evidently have the same right of co-decision in agricultural policy as we have in other areas.
I should also like to thank the Danish Presidency for its extremely sober and constructive approach so far.
We reached some sound agreements in July, and we had a stimulating three-way meeting yesterday about how we might solve the problem of the floods.
I should like to round off this introduction by appealing for the same constructive approach when it comes to solving the major outstanding problems, above all in category 4, concerned with external expenditure.
We need much more flexibility.
Parliament will protest at the fact that, without new resources being supplied, we are constantly adding new expenditure in relation, for example, to Afghanistan and the Global AIDS and Health Fund, over and above the contributions we have already made in relation to the Balkans, Kosovo, Serbia etc.
That, I believe, will be one of the main points in Parliament's criticism of both the Commission's and the Council's handling of the budget.
Mr President, the EU's administrative budget has for a long time been one of the EU's major budgetary problems.
This year's work is aimed at trying to find long-term solutions to these problems.
At the beginning of the year, we were in a position to foresee a large budget deficit for 2003, indicated by all the estimates.
Now that we have reduced this deficit and in actual fact anticipate a slight surplus for next year, we note that, in a long-term perspective, it is, in all likelihood, specifically 2003 that will be the big problem.
In accordance with the European Council decision in Berlin in 1999, we have the opportunity of using the 'flexibility instrument' and in that way contributing extra funds.
In its preliminary draft budget, the Commission proposed this arrangement for category 5.
There were obviously reasons for this, not least the fact that time is short and that there is a huge amount to be done.
Allow me to emphasise that there are now only two and a half months left before the final decision is made on which countries are to become new Member States.
There are six months to go before it will be possible for 147 observers from future Member States to be present here in the European Parliament.
Only 15 months remain until the beginning of 2004.
This is the year when everything changes and when the EU becomes an organisation quite different from the one it has been until now. It is the year when, hopefully, ten new Member States will have taken their places, the year when we take decisive steps towards the reunification of a Europe that has always been divided into East and West.
It is a huge commitment, probably the biggest any of us will experience.
It is therefore gratifying to note that by far the majority of the pieces of the budgetary puzzle are beginning to fall into place.
Enlargement has the highest priority.
The necessary reforms, especially here in Parliament, are in full swing, and it will be possible for them to take place within the set budget framework and within the time we have available to us.
While the final countdown has begun and less and less time remains, there nonetheless remains a huge amount to be done, even where the budget prior to 2003 is concerned.
Against this background, there was of course a very great deal to be said for the Commission's proposal for using the 'flexibility instrument'.
Nonetheless, Parliament and the Council chose to go against the Commission's proposal.
As a first step in the right direction, Parliament and the Council have agreed on the broad lines of the administrative budget.
That is something which is completely new in the budget procedure but which is an advantage as the work continues.
The commitment that Parliament and the Council have made and that other institutions must now make is to facilitate the Commission's necessary investments and preparations.
That must take place with an underlying appreciation and understanding of the fact that enlargement is not something with which one institution can cope successfully. Rather, it is a commitment on the part of all of us.
Parliament has therefore tried to be especially creative with a view to making room for the required funding.
In short, it is a question of trying to get as much as possible done in this year's budget so as to be able to create as much scope as possible in the 2003 budget when enlargement is just one year ahead of us.
It must then be possible for the room for manoeuvre we in that way obtain to form the basis for being able successfully to establish the necessary priorities for 2003.
That is what we call frontloading.
All - and I emphasise all - the institutions, including Parliament and the Council, have been encouraged to take an active part in this area.
The reactions I have received have been positive so far.
I am convinced that we shall succeed and so create the financial room for manoeuvre that the Commission in particular requires if enlargement is to succeed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as President of the Council, I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to attend this debate, in which Commission representatives are taking part, on the European Parliament's 2003 budget.
I am convinced that today's debate will give Parliament and the Commission the opportunity to touch upon many important subjects relating to the 2003 budget.
I again have the pleasure today of meeting Mr Wynn and the two rapporteurs for the 2003 budget, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck.
I should like to begin by expressing my personal thanks for the constructive and focused dialogue on next year's budget that has been conducted by Parliament and the Council to date.
I also wish to take the opportunity of thanking the Budget Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, and the other Commissioners for their really helpful cooperation.
There is no doubt that the EU's 2003 budget is a major challenge.
The EU is to take up quite a few new tasks next year.
Allow me to mention just two. The EU institutions are to prepare themselves for enlargement, and the EU is to assume responsibility for the UN police force in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The Council, Parliament and the Commission are agreed that what is at issue here are political priorities to be adopted by the EU.
For that reason, the budget procedure has until now also been characterised by a desire to find practical solutions and reach compromises.
I am convinced that this fruitful cooperation can continue in the autumn, and I shall do everything in my power to help bring this about.
I want to conclude by wishing the Members of the European Parliament, together with the Commissioners, a constructive debate.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, the 2003 budget is probably the last budget to apply to 15 Member States of the EU.
We are, more or less, on the eve of enlargement.
The budget year 2003 will, then, have further challenges in store not only for the candidate states, but also for all the European institutions that need to prepare themselves.
These will be areas of major concern in 2003.
But, of course, we also have other priorities in addition to these.
I agree with all those who say that European politics must concentrate on stability and security.
These are also reflected in the 2003 budget, in Commissioner Vitorino's budget for measures in the areas of internal affairs and justice policy or - and in many and varied ways - in the budget for foreign policy measures.
Your House has tabled several motions relating to the security of our external representation, but of course also to all the aid given to Afghanistan.
Aid, the increased funds for the Mediterranean, and of course pre-accession aid as well, are, in the final analysis, expenditure on Europe's enhanced political stability.
The Commission has decided on sustainable development as the third focus of its attention.
This, too, touches on many specific budgets and programmes - the energy programme, the research programme, Mr Nielsen's programme or, to take another example, the rural development funds and the major Structural Funds for which my fellow Commissioners Mr Fischler and Mr Barnier are, respectively, responsible.
In this debate, we will probably have much to say about the state of the accounts, and the implementation, of the Structural Funds - but not to the exclusion of other funds.
The budget books for 2001 did indeed reveal a surplus of EUR 15 billion at year-end.
Parliament has had the consolidated revenue and expenditure accounts since 1 May.
That is a massive surplus, not a fictitious one as occurred in certain private firms' recent accounting scandals, but a real surplus.
The Finance Ministers were very happy to enter this real surplus in their books, although Parliament took a rather more critical view of it.
It is a fact that we must manage many programmes better in 2003.
The Member States also have their part to play in this, and there is a need for good cooperation in this area.
The Commission informs Parliament and the Council of the state of the accounts on a weekly basis.
I might mention that this demonstrates an openness not shown by any Member State's government in its relations with Parliament.
It goes without saying that such budget information is important in deciding on the best approach to the budget for the coming financial year.
For it is evident that funds are short in any budget, even if it is a relatively large one.
We have to face up to new challenges, for example when great and terrible catastrophes occur, in order to provide aid in a spirit of solidarity.
A new instrument has now been created for this.
I am very grateful for the speed with which agreement could be reached on the creation of such a new instrument.
It really does give expression to the fact that Europe is a community of solidarity.
Apart from that, though, the new programmes require us to do a lot of restructuring and free up funds elsewhere.
This should not be forgotten in today's debate, in which, no doubt, voice will be given to new desires and new proposals.
We should also bear in mind the subsidiarity issue, on which subject I have to say that the Commission cannot work miracles; if political objectives are to become reality, and of course if expenditure programmes are to be implemented, it needs the staff to do it.
I hope that Parliament will give its support to finding a solution to this question of the staff expenses for 2003.
Let me express my gratitude to Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck for what they have just said, and for the motions that have already been submitted.
Development shows how much is expected of Europe, and how much from European politics, and we should live up to these expectations.
I do think that today's debate will be an exciting and wholly innovative one, showing again that the European institutions are very much ready to innovate.
My group welcomes this new procedure.
It is rather an imaginative way of reshaping our political debate on the priorities for the budget for 2003.
My particular role in introducing it today is to look at our strategy as a group, one which we have accumulated over the past couple of years.
On this basis we have six particular points which we have put down as amendments which I wish to review briefly.
The first refers to how we handle outstanding budget commitments, which now amount to something around EUR 110 billion.
In a joint declaration which we signed with the Council on 14 December 2000 we wanted to see these commitments reduced to normal levels by, if I remember correctly, December 2003.
Therefore, the first of our amendments aims at getting clarification from the Commission as to exactly what its intentions are in trying to fulfil this commitment, how it is going to be done and how quickly it will be achieved.
Secondly, in terms of Commission reform, which was also included in this joint declaration back in December 2000, we wanted to have a range of knowledge about how to achieve the reform.
Some of us are in doubt about how far this reform has gone, how the rest of it is going to be achieved and when it will be implemented.
That is the reason we have put the five hundred posts in reserve, which we wish to see released in stages as and when we receive information about the completion and the effectiveness of the reform.
Thirdly, in relation to this there is the specific case concerning the Chief Accountant, where we have put a small amount of Commission travel expenses in reserve.
We want to get to the bottom of the situation.
We are seeking information and not the resignation of the Commission as some have rumoured.
Therefore, we want Mrs Andreasen to come and tell us exactly what her allegations are.
We also want to know exactly what the Commission's response to those allegations is.
Fourthly, we wish to deal with the Council in terms of foreign policy and security.
This is because we have had amounts put in the budget for 2003, but before approving them we want to enhance the position of the other institutions - Parliament as well as the Commission - in knowing how policies will be implemented.
We have an instinct that we do not like to see the Council spending large sums of money in managing foreign policy without proper accountability.
Fifthly, we have consistently said as a Parliament that we do not want to see expenditure on Afghanistan made to the detriment of other spending priorities in category 4.
We are therefore suggesting that the flexibility instrument could be used for this purpose as well as perhaps dealing with that commitment made in the 2002 budget to deal with the EUR 27 million on fleet restructuring.
Lastly, we have taken a slight departure from the norm and are recommending that the 220 Council posts are not approved until we have received a satisfactory explanation on a number of points which are listed in our amendment.
These include the implementation of the early retirement scheme.
We also need explanation, more particularly, on foreign policy so that we know what the projections are and how the Council thinks expenditure might be implemented over the next five years.
I conclude by saying that this has nothing to do with revolution or our socialist leader, who says that these are undercover censure motions.
This is about accountability and the proper functioning of democracy, where we as a Parliament are taking our responsibility in the budgetary process, using the reserve on a judicious basis to get the information that we need to be able to carry out our job effectively.
Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me also, on behalf of my group, in this new sort of debate - not indeed the only one, as we will be having another in October on the substantive votes - set before you our position, our approach and our concerns.
I wish to make reference to the great challenges before us, which have just been described.
I have great confidence in the work of our two general rapporteurs, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, who have previously shown their capacity for excellent work.
In managing the workload over the coming months and weeks, it is on their shoulders that we are standing.
The greatest challenge is enlargement, which has already been referred to many times, and which marks a fundamental change in this European Union of ours.
The European Union will, in two years' time, have an appearance quite different from any it has had before, which will not only have an effect on financial matters, but will also bring cultural changes in its wake.
All this will need proper preparation.
Here in Parliament, we will, whilst taking up our respective positions, have to show openness - freedom and openness to the acceptance of others, of new ideas and new impetus.
This must also show itself in the budget.
Secondly, we have experienced in recent weeks, which started with a vast catastrophe striking Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, followed by other regions of the European Union, that we are inadequately prepared for the disasters that can afflict our continent.
It is not enough to give assistance only in cases of emergency, although thank God this assistance will now be financially resourced in such a way that we are not only giving people the impression that we can help them, but are actually able to provide aid efficiently and effectively.
No, it is not enough to help only when something has happened; we have to take preventive action.
We have to work together on early warning systems, on research into environmental changes, in order to be able to prepare ourselves, rather than, like a rabbit fixated by a snake, waiting for the worst to happen, but getting to grips with it early on, in order to see what can be prevented right from the outset.
Thirdly, there is the issue of work creation.
This continent still has too many people unemployed.
Although this is one of the richest continents in the world, people are forced to remain unemployed even though we have vast amounts of money to use to counter unemployment.
I speak, of course, with particular reference to the Structural Funds, but I also have others in mind.
It must be possible to guarantee greater efficiency, and the faster and more efficient distribution of resources.
We have proposed an efficiency force to shed light on all the bureaucratic apparatus, enabling us to act quicker and get money to where it is really needed so that people gasping for breath in the tangled bureaucratic undergrowth do not sink back in despair and say they can do no more.
We also have to ensure that this EU of ours plans for the long term, with regard to staff expenses as much as to anything else.
Thank God our staff are relatively young, but we have to finance all their pensions out of the budget.
If we want to plan for the long term here, we have to make an early start on ensuring that funds are put by for this purpose so that we can give help in this area, or else we will run into major problems, at any rate further down the road.
There are initiatives that have been in place since 1996, but which have not to date been implemented.
That is something we have to get to grips with.
We must help small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union to have their share of economic development.
Success in this European Union of ours must not be the preserve of the big firms that can afford their own legal departments and tax departments; it must be put within the reach of small enterprises and micro-businesses.
We have submitted amendments on that subject.
In these discussions, you will find us to be willing to work constructively with you.
Other amendments have been tabled, but I wanted to set out the focal points of our approach.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, firstly I wish to thank the budget rapporteurs, Mr FÃ€rm and Mr Stenmarck, who have done some excellent work and aided the Committee on Budgets in its task.
European Union budgetary policy is overshadowed by the unsatisfactory way in which the budget itself has been implemented.
As Mr Elles stated in his speech just now, a good EUR 15 billion in budget commitments remained unspent last year, which is an inconceivably huge amount of money.
The Commission has suggested the blame lies with the Member States.
We must ask what the Commission intends to do in the area of legislation to eliminate this defect in the system.
I would similarly like to ask the Council what it intends to do to simplify the implementation of the Structural Funds, pre-accession aid and other long-term programmes, in order to avoid the build-up of such enormous outstanding sums in the future, and, indeed, reduce them.
The payment appropriations in next year's budget stand at just 1.01% of GNP, which is to say EUR 5.9 billion below the financial perspectives.
Such meagre sums will not help to reduce the arrears: they will, instead, pile up when the eastward enlargement of the EU has taken place and a lot of other problems lie ahead.
Our group supports preparations for enlargement to the east.
Next year is the last in which they can be carried out properly.
For this reason, the administrative process must be reformed and made more flexible, so that human resources may be deployed more swiftly and appropriately than is the case at present.
We support the reform of the Commission, but at the same time we insist on greater clarification in the areas of personal accountability and job descriptions.
Moreover, we believe it is important that administrative accountability is also reflected in greater efficiency in such areas as making payments.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the biggest problem with the budget is the outstanding RAL appropriations.
The problem is so huge that it cannot be seen.
It is good that an attempt is being made to reduce the scale of the RAL problem.
As a 'sunset clause' is being introduced to achieve this the Commission's inefficiency might fade from view as a result.
Today, however, that inefficiency is visible in the growth of RALs, as certain other groups have remarked here.
Our group agrees that enlargement should become the budget's main area of focus.
In that connection we must ensure that the European Union is able to function in all its official languages right from the outset.
We call on the Commission to reject any proposals that state that some languages should be accorded a position that is inferior to others with regard to interpreting.
If an interpreting facility cannot exist for all languages, let us draw lots to see which ones are not to enjoy that facility.
In July's conciliation process the Council promised to produce a legal basis for the early retirement of twenty or thirty officials on temporary contracts employed by Parliament's political groups.
In exchange it obtained provisional budgetary unity. It got a very good deal.
The spirit of budgetary unity allows certain Member States to obtain financial aid from the EU in exchange for scrapping their fishing fleets.
This has been agreed and we do not oppose it.
However, losses cannot be overcompensated for, and, for that reason, many members of our group feel it is important that the new fisheries programme proposed by the Commission be approved.
Nevertheless, there are forces at work to block it, in the same way as it is being reduced to what is just a new agricultural programme under the direction of a certain large Member State.
Some of our group wish the Commission every success in its reform of the fisheries and agricultural programmes, and some do not.
Opinions differ in our group on the question of whether it is necessary to support European-wide political parties out of the EU budget.
As there is no legal basis for supporting Europarties this way, we are proposing, as a technicality in the budget, that we should make a p.m. entry under the corresponding budget heading.
It should not be proposed that money be given away when it is not legal to do so.
I would like to say this to the President-in-Office of the Council: do please correct the regulations pertaining to the Members of the European Parliament so that a legal basis is achieved in respect of this issue too.
We are pleased, in the main, that the Commission has proposed reducing the amount spent on propaganda in the wake of the Prince programme.
The Commission's actions are evidently worse for the EU with propaganda than without it in terms of legitimacy.
We on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy were disappointed with the course of action the Council took when it made its funding decisions in respect of the Sixth Framework Programme for science and research.
The programme was agreed upon without any formal settlement.
We hope that the traditionally excellent spirit of cooperation that exists between Parliament and the Council can continue with regard to this issue also and that the Council will restore matters to what was originally agreed.
Mr President, the Commission formulated three priorities in its Annual Policy Strategy: enlargement, security and sustainable development.
The Commission has now requested 500 additional positions to guarantee the smooth running of the enlargement.
In principle, I can understand this, for if 10 new countries join, this will result in more work.
However, I do have a few questions in this respect.
Is it correct that you are now requesting staff for the priority of enlargement, while the priority of sustainable development is systematically being managed with too few officials?
If I understand the Commission 'Better Regulations' proposals correctly, the Commission even suggests passing the responsibility for notification mainly to the Member States from now on.
Is this because you really believe that Member States are better placed to comply with environmental legislation and to monitor it, or are there simply budgetary reasons for this, namely that you do not have enough officials to check whether the Member States indeed comply with this legislation?
If this is a budgetary issue, I do fear for the priority of sustainable development.
Another question concerns the 700 positions which we rubberstamped in previous years.
Am I right in thinking that these have been distributed reasonably evenly across the entire Commission and have not really been clustered according to certain priorities?
It would be regrettable if this were the case.
I should now like to turn to the enlargement and the EU budget.
If I understand it correctly, six candidate countries risk receiving less funding from Brussels in 2004 than they did in 2003, and four countries are even at risk of becoming net contributors.
It is fortunate that you are prepared to compensate for this, and it is, indeed, excellent, but the bill could still be higher than estimated in these candidate countries if their implementation of the Structural Funds is not as successful as you estimated.
Is it therefore possible - and this is a proposal on our part and I would appreciate a response - to see if these candidate countries could take their projects through the entire procedure as early as 2003?
In other words, if they could complete all the administrative formalities, so that they can start immediately with the real construction work on 1 January 2004?
Allow me to make one final point.
If this is also a debate on what Mr James Elles said in response to Mrs Andreasen, my group is also of the opinion that any problems in the accounting system must be closely examined after the Commission's and the Court of Auditors' hearing.
We would possibly need to invite Mrs Andreassen at that point.
It is up to us MEPs, though, to examine this.
As for the link with the Commissioners' wages, it is really beyond me how the PPE has worked this out.
Thank you, Mr President.
I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 23 years - the first 10 in the Committee on Budgets - and I am from time to time a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I was involved in putting Parliament's house in order following its scandalous dealings with taxpayers' money which have left us with the still unfinished business surrounding the issue of reimbursed travel expenses.
I have read the annual reports by the Court of Auditors. I was involved in dismissing the last Commission, and I have always been very critical of the lack of transparency in the Commission.
Not by any stretch of the imagination did I, however, at any time think that the Commission did its accounts on an Excel spreadsheet so that the figures could be adjusted without anyone's knowing.
If the owner of an ice-cream stall or hardware shop were to do his accounts in the same way, it would be unlawful and lead to legal action by the tax office.
In this case, we are talking about the Commission, but the legal action is being taken against the person who revealed the accounts scandal.
There is a desire to shoot the messenger for bringing bad news.
The Spanish Chief Accountant, Mrs Andreasen, deserves a lot of praise for having given Parliament the information we should have received from the Commission.
Mrs Andreasen initially went through the internal channels and passed her observations up the line to Mr Prodi, but to no avail so far as I understand.
The Commission wanted her to sign off an account that half the Directors-General had signed only with reservations.
Since 1994, the Court of Auditors has refused to vouch for the correctness of the underlying transactions.
For eight years, therefore, my web site, bonde.com, has contained a letter from an office in the Court of Auditors to the Commission, and it is the most alarming letter I have read in my 30 years in the EU.
The Commission's current practice of accounting on spreadsheets lends itself to poor administration and fraud.
Against that unfortunate background, SOS Democracy wishes to invite all adherents of ordinary accounting to meet Mrs Andreasen on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in conference room R3.1.
We should together discuss how we can deal with what, to me, looks like the worst scandal in the EU's history.
Now, we know a little about how matters stand. From now on, we all share the responsibility.
Thank you, Mr President and Mr Pedersen.
Mr President, previous speakers have already addressed many important items in the 2003 budget, but we have to take care not to focus on too few of its specific areas and end up trying to give everyone a slice of the cake.
Those who suffered flood damage must now get aid very quickly and without red tape, and it goes without saying that provision must now also be made for the future.
We must, though, take steps to deal with the constant increase in unemployment.
SMEs continue to gasp under the excessive burden of taxes and levies placed upon them, whilst, at the same time, investment activity in Europe is declining, and the unemployment rate is, as already mentioned, constantly rising.
The excessively high rate of unemployment among young people is a particular problem, and there is urgent need for special programmes to reduce it.
I hope that Members of this House will support the motions we have tabled on this subject, which seek to promote apprenticeships in SMEs.
Such action would strengthen SMEs and help those young people who, in Europe, have little or no chance of vocational training.
Next we will move on to the first of the sectoral debates.
The first debate will be on the Structural Funds, particularly with regard to the pre-accession phase and payments, including the ISPA.
The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Puerta, and the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Jensen, will speak first.
Then Mr Barnier will speak, on behalf of the Commission.
Next, the political groups and other Members will speak.
The Commission will close the debate on this first point.
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for this recent communication on the evolution until 31 August 2002 of the budgetary implementation of the Structural Funds and of the outstanding appropriations.
The fact that these same problems are being repeated calls into question once again the reliability of the budgetary forecasts.
With regard to the 2003 budget, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism proposes increasing the maximum limit for payment appropriations, because in accordance with the amount corresponding this year to the multi-annual programming - EUR 27.5 billion - EUR 8.1 billion must be used for the RALs accumulated between 1994 and 1995, which is EUR 2.9 billion more than was forecast.
We also ask that account be taken of the difficulties which will arise during the next financial year as a result of the application of the N+2 clause.
Great effort will be required in terms of cooperation and control between Parliament, the Commission and the Member States.
With regard to the pre-accession structural instrument, the ISPA, we must take up the Commission's proposal, which means increasing the appropriations for this programme during the 2003 financial year to EUR 1 117 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 750 million in payment appropriations.
It makes very little sense, when enlargement is about to take place, to weaken a useful and, above all, necessary instrument.
In the budget we oppose the reduction in payment appropriations which the Council has made in relation to the Commission's proposal on FEDER programmes and various Community initiatives.
We must prevent them being insufficient to cover the commitments in the near future.
It is better to anticipate these problems than to regret them at a later date.
I would also like to say that we are worried about the scant support, especially in the budget, we believe there is for transport safety systems.
Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner Barnier.
On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I must express our concerns regarding the implementation of the budget for the European Social Fund.
The Social Fund plays an important role, of course, in the development of poor regions and of the European Employment Strategy, and it will indeed also be very important in connection with the forthcoming enlargement.
In this area too, moreover, we see the build-up of outstanding commitments, something which we regard as a problem.
Now, Commissioner Barnier has just presented a communication on developments concerning the implementation of the Structural Funds, providing us with a number of explanations as to why larger outstanding commitments than expected are accumulating, and that is something for which we should thank the Commissioner.
There are of course new rules and procedures for the 2000-2006 programming which are to be incorporated, and the Member States have apparently overestimated the ability to implement the projects in the first few years.
What basis have we, however, for believing that things will be much better over the next few years, apart from the incentives contained in the 'N+2' rule (otherwise known as the 'sunset clause') according to which the money is lost if too long a period elapses before the payments are utilised?
As MEPs, we constantly hear complaints that this is an unwieldy system.
A good overdraft facility at the bank is needed if money from the Social Fund is to be received.
It is the long time it takes to make the payments that is a problem, and one that the Commission must do something about.
We are also told that the rules and procedures are too complicated, and it was agreed in July that Parliament and the Council should simplify matters in order to encourage utilisation of the funds.
You too, Mr Barnier, have put simplification on the agenda.
How quickly will it be possible, however, for the work on simplification to take effect?
Will it have done so by 2003?
What are the deadlines for this work?
Thank you, Mr President.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to say to Mr Puerta and to Mrs Jensen that I very much appreciate, as do all my colleagues, their thanks for our work to provide an objective explanation, particularly by means of the communication on budgetary implementation that Mrs Schreyer has just presented to you.
As you can imagine, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was out of a concern for transparency that I launched this new debate and it was out of the same concern that I appeared before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and before the Committee on Budgets.
On 17 July, the Committee on Budgets clarified the situation regarding management.
In the communication, we strived - and Mrs Jensen has just touched upon this - to realistically identify the causes of the under-implementation for 2000-2001 and the risks for 2002, and to explain the measures taken to rectify the backlog.
Simplification is another area on which we are about to set to work.
I proposed to all the Ministers, in the presence of the chairs of the parliamentary committees concerned, to begin working on this issue on 7 October, and we provided a working document for immediate simplification within the framework of the Berlin regulation and by using or seeking out all the possible ways to enable simplification.
I hope you will agree that making a policy even more simple after 2006 is a different matter altogether.
That is why, having carried out all this work to explain the situation, I do not agree with the term 'negligence' that Mr SeppÃ€nen used earlier.
If there had been negligence on the part of the Commission regarding the RALs, the extent of which I recognise since I mentioned this, how can you explain the fact, Mr SeppÃ€nen, that the results are so different from one country to another?
I said and I repeat that almost all of the RALs are a problem for four countries out of fifteen and I would hope that we expose where the responsibilities really lie.
I would like you to avoid using unfair terms to describe the Commission's work.
As for the 2003 budget, I am certain that the ceiling of the financial perspectives will not be exceeded.
I would therefore like to say to Mr Puerta, in an attempt to reassure him, that we did not believe it would now be necessary to go above this ceiling.
The Member States' requests will, without doubt, be higher than the appropriations provided by the Commission under the 2000-2006 Structural Funds, but we can learn lessons from the past.
In our communication, we analysed the problems which arose and we are therefore taking a slightly more cautious approach.
It is likely that we will be up to speed - with 27 to 30 billion payments per year - in 2004.
Until then, we shall remain slightly below the 25 billion that is required.
There is a risk that the needs for 2003 will be higher for two lines.
The first line is the completion of the 1994-1999 programmes.
This year, the Member States are taking their time in forwarding their requests for final payment.
It is likely therefore that we will have underspending in 2002 and an increased need in 2003, which should however be able to be covered by carrying sums over.
The second line which may require additional appropriations is the Cohesion Fund.
After two years of underspending in 2002 and 2001, the measures taken to speed up the programmes' closure are bearing fruit.
It is likely that more than 3 billion will be paid this year and if that is the case, the 2.5 billion that we requested in 2003 could turn out to be insufficient.
My personal view is that, if Parliament wished to increase this allocation by 500 million, this would not present a problem.
Lastly, Mr Virrankoski, Mrs Jensen herself and Mr Puerta mentioned the extremely strict rule that is known as N+2.
It is true that this rule enforces discipline and good management.
It was designed to do exactly that and was approved by Parliament.
But it also creates a gap: N+2 leaves two years between commitment and payment.
That is why the RALs are probably going to rise.
It also takes two years of programming in order to reach EUR 60 billion.
To be honest, when you see the quality of the projects concerned, the nature of this significant investment, two years of programming do not seem excessive.
I think that the N+2 discipline is certainly preferable to carrying over all the cancellations at the end of the period, which is what we should have done as part of the previous programming for 1994-1999.
These are the points that I wanted to clarify, Mr President, at the beginning of this discussion.
Mr President, what worries us most is the low degree of implementation of Structural Fund payments.
The worst thing that could happen would be for the contributions to lose support because they are not spent and that we should believe that our intended objectives do not correspond to the needs of those who have to spend them.
In the face of this political failing, we can only act by saying that the innocent must not pay for the sins of the guilty and that not all of the Structural Funds are badly managed.
I am pleased that the Community initiatives, either Objectives 1 and 2 or the Cohesion Fund, have seen a higher degree of implementation.
I am also pleased that the majority of countries do their duties properly, which demonstrates that the procedural measures are easy to comply with, although not all of the countries are as diligent in complying with them.
Therefore, the fact that the Structural Funds are not being implemented as we would have liked does not mean that we must spend on other headings, but that we must seriously apply the N+2 commitment.
It is obvious that if the countries or regions which have not fulfilled the N+2 clause see that the Funds are returned to them, they will have no incentive to change their attitude.
The States and regions which do not use the N+2 must definitively lose their contributions, in favour of those other bodies, regions or States which are going to use them.
Therefore, the figure for non-implementation is not serious; our aim must be for the responsibility for non-implementation to fall to those who have caused it.
In this respect, I welcome Commissioner Barnier's efforts to put things in order.
Mr President, for us the problem of implementation should be a shared problem, and I personally cannot accept what Commissioner Barnier has said, when he simply washes his hands of the problems of four or five Member States.
The problem is a shared one, the solution is a shared one.
The fact that we have EUR 100 billion of outstanding commitments should be a problem for all the Community's institutions.
We cannot accept the premise that it is the sole responsibility of those Member States.
We certainly want to see action by all the institutions, including the Commission, and this Parliament in particular, as a matter of urgency.
Turning to transport, we want to see action quickly here too.
In particular, we want to see a reinstatement of the cuts of EUR 1 million proposed by the Commission in overland transport safety.
It is absurd to propose to cut accidents on the roads by 50% in 8 years and yet cut the budget in that key area.
Thirdly, we want to see a reinstatement of the 20% reduction proposed by the Commission in sustainable mobility.
Again we talk a lot about the environment, but the very programmes that will help protect and preserve it will be cut if the Commissioner has his way.
Fourth and finally, I agree with the Commission on the need for more transparency.
At the moment my committee, which takes its job seriously in trying to scrutinise the budget, simply does not have the facts at its disposal to make a proper quantitative, as well as qualitative assessment, of what is happening to the budgets for transport and the Structural Funds.
I hope that after this debate we can work harder to make sure that we can demonstrate to the European taxpayer that value for money is being given.
Mr President, Commissioner, as many speakers have stated here already, the latest budget monitoring figures also show that the implementation of the Structural Fund programmes and payments made with regard to the programmes have progressed far too slowly.
On the other hand, regional differences have also grown.
It is therefore very clear that regional aid will be needed in the future too, as Mr Puerta suggested.
Delays in structural policy were largely due in the early stages to the slow preparatory work undertaken by the Commission and the Member States.
Now it is burdensome administration and complicated, rigid procedures that are causing the delays.
These are also causing problems in countries that have kept to the timetable.
The implementation thus far of both last year's and this year's budgets have led to a considerable increase in unpaid amounts of money.
Our group is very worried about the possible negative impact that will have on next year's budget and the Union's structural policy both later on and in general.
There should be compliance, however, with the N+2 rule, as it will help shore up implementation of the Structural Funds.
Now we are compelled to ask, despite this communication and Mr Barnier's fine words, what the Commission intends to do before this parliamentary term ends.
What concrete measures are there, whereby practices associated with the Structural Funds can be clarified, simplified, and speeded up?
This is a very tough question too because enlargement is just around the corner and we need to find remedies for these problems, with more in the way of results and less bureaucracy.
Mr President, whilst the Budget Memorandum for 2003 still leaves many questions open, the economic situation in 2002 is becoming clearer and it is easier to get an overall view of it.
I believe that it is not only in Germany that the goal of stabilising euroland by not exceeding a public debt of 3% of gross domestic product is in danger of being missed.
The absence of 2%-3% annual economic growth means that grossly excessive unemployment figures can no longer be artificially covered up.
This makes it all the more understandable that the backlog of Structural Funds is being treated as if the funds were not there.
The prospect of actually successfully solving the problem of mass unemployment in the coming fourth quarter is made fainter by mounting indirect labour costs and the failure of the European Union, among others, to solve the problems caused by distortions of competition.
I also believe that the days of public jubilation at the freedom apparently won through globalisation are over.
The 2003 budget will instead be measured against the yardstick of seriousness, transparency and honesty.
I can recall that Parliament was always more than merely critical of the annual accumulation of financial resources from the Structural Funds.
What is decisive for the public's sense of belonging is what goes down well with them.
The Commission's non-existent policy on non-existent Structural Funds does little to promote a feeling of belonging on the part of the European Union's citizens.
The winter months are going to be the most difficult in economic terms for a long time.
The many pledges made in the wake of the flood disaster must at last be worked off at a more rapid pace.
If they are not, there is a growing danger of those aspects of land use for which we have already accorded financial assistance from the sources available triggering substantial conflicts between business, transport, housing, leisure and tourism at the various structural levels.
The situation is grave, and I assume that it is known that the public are seeing the gap between income and expenditure narrowing still further.
They need the money that is kept in Brussels.
Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome Mrs Schreyer's statement to the effect that sustainable development is a focus of attention, and hope that it really will be possible to promote it even with these deficits, by which I mean the unused appropriations, which will, next year, be subject to the N+2 rule.
We know that the deficits are primarily the result of long drawn-out problems with approval, but also of the Member States' inability to really create proper programmes out of the reform measures contained in the last reform of the Structural Funds; this obliged the Commission to follow matters up any number of times.
Both, then, are to blame.
There is now the danger of big projects being supported because there is suddenly more money, and for that reason I warn the Commission against allowing that.
There are indications that projects will again be supported without their being either efficient or sustainable, and I would ask the Commission to exercise its monitoring functions and ensure that sustainable development becomes a reality in the budget.
Mr President, I do indeed believe that this debate is extremely useful inasmuch as it allows us to discuss a number of difficult issues, including funds, in a general context.
What some people seem to be suggesting is completely unfair, namely that fraud would be involved in funding that goes unspent, for that is the problem with commitments outstanding.
The problem lies in the very fact that it goes unspent, which is an entirely different issue.
I also think that too much blame is being apportioned to the Commission and not enough to the Member States.
I myself come from a Member State which is very much to blame for not spending the necessary resources properly and promptly, and I hope that this situation will improve in future.
This is a good example, though.
In my view, the system is flawed on two counts. Firstly, we have a new fund each time, which means that each time, we lose a year.
This is exactly what happened now and seems to be inevitable.
I would ask the Commission to examine whether this can really be done in this way, for this is an inherent problem.
Secondly, I wonder whether we will ever be free of these commitments outstanding.
Is it not possible, or conceivable, instead of simply leaving these, to conclude an agreement at a given point with a Member State that fails to manage to spend that money?
We could, for example, say that we will channel this money back to the general resources, and this Member State will receive a reduction on their contribution, which has to be paid anyway.
I think that this Member State could be very happy with this proposal, and indeed that everyone could be, as it allows money to become available for those who need it.
Needless to say, this should be done on a voluntary basis; if not, the system would never work and Member States would never agree to it.
Maybe, though, it is possible to solve this issue relatively quickly and pragmatically.
I fear that it might be too pragmatic, for everyone likes to claim that funds should be spent, only to place many obstacles along the way should this then appear necessary.
Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a number of budget lines that are dealt with in the Committee on Employment.
First of all the three lines dealing with social dialogue - B3-4002, B3-4003 and B3-4310.
The last one deals with the Trade Union Technical Bureau for Health and Safety.
We are looking to increase the amounts on each of these lines, largely because of enlargement.
It is very important that we get the basic building blocks of social dialogue in place in the applicant countries and we need to begin to channel resources in that direction.
Secondly, I should like to mention B3-4314.
This concerns health and safety improvements in small- and medium-sized enterprises.
We are looking to renew this line once again.
I very much hope that following the work we have done on the new European Health and Safety strategy here in Parliament - a report will shortly be appearing in my own name - on a proposal from the Commission for a multi-annual programme for high levels of health and safety in SMEs.
I hope that will come forward in the coming year and give us a permanent legal base.
My final point concerns B3-4106.
This is a proposal for a new budget line in the names of Mr Howitt and Mr Andersson, although it was endorsed by the Committee on Employment as well.
It seeks to give a solid base for support to social NGOs.
It is very important that we do this to underpin civil dialogue.
Mr President, Commissioner, there have recently been certain statements advocating the elimination of the Cohesion Fund.
The removal of this Fund would penalise the countries which have managed to comply with the requirements for joining the euro and would simply be intolerable.
Allow me to ask a few questions: why is there a desire to eliminate these cohesion funds in the future?
Why is there a desire to simplify the procedures for the Structural Funds?
What is the Commission's view of the future of the Cohesion Fund for the candidate countries and for the citizens of the Member States?
Mr President, we have already talked about the under-implementation of the Structural Funds, and the menacing shadow of the guillotine has already been invoked. I would now like to add that it is no coincidence that many are in danger of losing part of their entitlement too.
In other words, we risk suffering the blows of the stick without even tasting the carrot.
We must take action but, Mr Bonde, we must make sure we do not set our sights on the wrong target.
The European Commission is not the only one with responsibility in this area: a great deal of responsibility lies with the Member States too.
We must make sure that we do not prescribe ourselves the wrong medicine.
Personally, I am allergic to the reserves pill, which often does more harm than the original problem, and the idea that some political groups have of putting some of the Commissioners' expenditure in reserve is downright ridiculous.
The direction we must take is that of increasing payments and simplifying procedures.
Commissioner Barnier has already told us what he intends to do and we are waiting for further clarification.
Nevertheless, I would also like to hear what the Council has to say, if possible, and I call for greater attention to be paid to some of the Member States, who are sleeping the sleep of the unrighteous where this whole issue is concerned.
Mr President, I would like to take a few moments to confirm what I said earlier and provide some more detailed answers.
I would also like to thank the speakers who have clearly understood what I meant earlier, particularly Mr Pittella who pointed out just now that the Member States have some responsibilities.
But, to be very honest, Mr Watts must have misunderstood: the Commission is not shirking its responsibilities.
I myself am greatly concerned, Mr Watts, by the underspending.
I must simply reiterate that my work is based on estimates which are compiled by the Member States.
There are some details that I must give to you, or confirm for you, which have been in evidence for three years, in other words, since I took up this position.
For example, the Member States gave priority, at the beginning of this programming period, not to new programmes and to new projects, but to old programmes and to old projects which should have been completed.
They therefore concentrated their efforts on winding up old programmes and they took longer to prepare the new programmes.
This is one reason.
A new method of certification was also introduced, which caused some problems.
We should also mention the new payment system.
All sorts of rules were adopted in Berlin or after Berlin, which I am obliged to introduce.
I would also add that many Member States - and Mrs Fiebiger mentioned the crisis and the lack of growth earlier - must cope with relative budgetary difficulties.
I would point out that we are not funding the programmes 100%.
There is an additionality rule whereby the Member States must provide part of the funding and some of them probably found it necessary to stretch their budgetary expenditure further.
These are some of the details that you will find in the report and the communication that Mrs Schreyer and myself have given you.
With regard to the RALs, once again, I think that it is usual to have approximately two years of programming since this is in line with the N+2 rule - so that makes about seven years of programming and two additional years in total.
What would be unusual is for us to continue to support, through the RALs, very old programmes.
That is why my work seeks, as a matter of priority, as I said to you at the beginning, to withdraw the RALs from the old programmes, which has almost been achieved.
I would also warn you against drawing an assessment of the situation from one moment to the next.
When you look at the RALs, at the beginning of the year for example, you do not gain an accurate picture because, although almost 99% of expenditure was committed in April, the payments can be made up to the end of the year.
Therefore, at the beginning of the year, it looks as if the RALs are substantial.
That is how the figure of 100 billion may have been arrived at.
As I am speaking to you today, namely 24 September, the RALs for the old and new programmes amount to approximately 50 billion, which is an accurate reflection of these two years of programming.
Mrs Schroedter, whom I would like to thank, moreover, for the work that she has done - and I am thinking, in particular, of her excellent report on the second progress report on cohesion - emphasised the issue of sustainable development.
Mrs Schroedter, rest assured that I am keeping a very close eye on ensuring that the Structural Funds are implemented as per the regulation and in accordance with European directives on the environment.
For all sorts of political and personal reasons, I am working to ensure that the Member States, both present and future, use the Structural Funds in the appropriate manner, with respect for sustainable development.
That is why for example, Mrs Schroedter, I decided to propose, with regard to the consequences of the floods, that, in the future regional policy that I shall submit to you at the end of 2003, whilst consolidating what we have already done under these programmes, the prevention of natural risks is virtually a compulsory priority in all the regional programmes.
The N+2 rule is strict, but it is useful.
Once again, as for natural disasters, I have placed the emphasis on prevention.
Last November, I wrote to all the Prime Ministers, as did Mrs Schreyer.
Since prevention still costs less than restoration, we hope that this will enable us to reduce the risk, Mr Pittella, of appropriations being wasted.
At the end of the year, since it is the first meeting, the risks of wasting money under the N+2 rule will be very low.
The risks will probably be higher next year, because, since the programmes were signed in 2001, the effects will be felt in 2003 under the N+2 rule.
As far as the floods are concerned, Mrs Fiebeger, you urged us to act quickly.
To be very honest - and many German and Austrian leaders pointed this out to us - rarely has the Commission reacted quite so quickly to current events.
It took us less than four weeks to propose a flexible budgetary instrument, with Mrs Schreyer's leadership.
A few days later, I proposed the rules and arrangements for this fund to the Commission.
The ball is in the European Parliament's court.
Last night, the Council held a trialogue meeting.
I hope that we will be in a position, before the end of the year, before winter, in other words to grant the appropriations which are expected so that restoration, repair and even prevention work can begin.
Regarding the social dialogue, I listened carefully to the questions which have been put to us.
They concern, in the main, Heading 3, and Mrs Schreyer or Mrs Diamantopolou will answer them later.
Lastly, I would like to point out that, with regard to all these problems, and I am coming to my conclusion, Mr President, the Commission is not shirking its responsibilities.
I am trying to favour transparency, to explain the truth and to be proactive in terms of transparency, as I have just said, as well as in terms of simplification, as this is the purpose of the meeting on 5 October with the ministers.
I would also like to emphasise how the useful role played by the Structural Funds in improving governance on the ground, in the regions and in each country which is in need of them, including the oldest countries of the Union.
In the area of partnerships, assessments, discipline and planning, the role they fulfil is that of a lever. I would like to convince you of their importance.
The Structural Funds do not just represent money, they also represent real progress in terms of public administration, governance and, ultimately, democracy.
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my Committee has very carefully considered its amendments, and its vote to introduce them was unanimous.
As already set out in the guidelines, we put the emphasis on such things as the management of borders, an area in which the ARGO programme is of fundamental importance, contributing as much to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice as it does to preparations for enlargement.

Enlargement makes the topics of external border control, visas, asylum and immigration even more urgent.
Efficient cooperation by the Member States and the candidate countries in these areas, and especially in combating illegal immigration, is indispensable, and requires that the necessary resources be made available for it.
My Committee also supports efforts to integrate third-country nationals who are long-term residents here by establishing a pilot project.
This would serve to transmit the values underpinning our coexistence in Europe.
I am very glad that the Commission accepts this.
Security, freedom and justice are not, of course, to be had for free, but my Committee's present proposals do not represent any increase in the financial framework over against last year's budget.
What we are asking for is only 99.4% of last year's figures.
This is something I particularly want to underline, as we have greater responsibilities towards the EU's citizens in view of 11 September.
I would like to conclude by reminding you of the 21 September 2001 action plan to combat terrorism, which envisages joint action by all specialist units to prevent and combat terrorism, and requires that Europol and Eurojust be equipped for this purpose with special resources.
It is with this in mind that I hope that my Committee will be backed up by Parliament's, the Commission's and the Council's own proposals.
Mr President, the culture, education and information element of the budget accounts for barely half of 1% of the EU budget, compared with 50% of the budget that goes on agriculture.
So I will remind Parliament and the Commissioners, as culture spokesmen do every year, that perhaps we have not got our priorities quite right.
To turn to the issue of information: this should be a shared responsibility between the institutions and the Member States.
We wonder whether the Member States have got their responsibilities quite right in this respect.
Earlier this year the Culture Committee visited Copenhagen, and we would like to pay particular tribute to the Danish Government and Danish Parliament for the information they give to their citizens about the working of the European Union.
The EU has a responsibility to see that its citizens are well informed.
Certain members of staff make great efforts in this respect, and we would also pay tribute to Commissioner Vitorino for the work and the vision that he is putting into this.
However, we are not succeeding.
The citizens of the European Union do not have enough information.
We do not live in a neutral situation, we live in a situation where there is a great deal of disinformation and it is the responsibility of all concerned to see that is answered.
I therefore make no apology when I point out that the proposed budget for information policy on the various B3 lines is less than EUR 100 milion or less than 37 cents per citizen per annum.
That is a very small sum indeed.
As I speak, I know that Euronews - the television channel that seeks to give objective information about all European issues - is itself suffering very serious financial difficulties.
I hope the Commission and the budget rapporteur will look very closely at their pleas and make sure that Euronews is a success.
I will remind the House that the successful slogan for the Irish 'No' campagin was 'If you don't know, vote no.'
We must see that the European citizens do not vote no, because they understand what the European Union is about.
Mr President, I want first to congratulate both rapporteurs on the great and pioneering work they have done and are continuing to do.
The draft budget as it relates to the areas for which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is responsible is for the most part acceptable.
We are therefore proposing only a small number of changes to our opinion for submission to the Committee on Budgets.
When it comes to the provision of information on the common currency, this ought as far as possible to be focused on those countries that are members of the EU but that have still not introduced the euro.
The provision of information to the candidate countries should be financed via budget lines dedicated to enlargement.
In the case of the budget line which relates to the EU's industrial competitiveness and for which the Commission has proposed a twelve per cent increase in the appropriations, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes a change to the justification with a view to producing an assessment of the results generated by this budget line during the almost ten years of its existence.
Since I personally have grave doubts as to whether measures of this type really give value for money, I believe that an assessment is something to be welcomed.
Regarding programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, I note that the Commission's draft budget has included the change proposed last year by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs concerning access to venture capital.
No change is required this year, then.
I welcome the fact that the Council, unlike in previous years, has not proposed any cut-back in the appropriations for the development of the EU's internal market.
In this context, I want also to draw attention to the importance of having adequate resources for areas relating to the internal market, especially the implementation of the action plan for financial services.
Finally, I want to emphasise that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believes that the amount introduced into Parliament's own budget for studies and the provision of advice may be insufficient, given the expressed objective of using more external expertise in connection with complicated legislative matters.
Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the Parliament for its invitation to this debate today.
I tend to interpret your invitation as the recognition of the political importance of the areas of Justice and Home Affairs and Information Policy, and definitely not of its budgetary importance, because comparing my budget with those of my colleagues, I feel like a beggar who is invited to a Christmas party in Wall Street.
As far as budgetary issues are concerned, in order of presentation, I wish to thank the LIBE committee, Mr Ceyhun in particular, for the non-stop support this Commission has been given in establishing the area of freedom, security and justice.
Once again, the LIBE Committee proposes the increase of the budget lines thought to be politically more important.
The PDB was prepared by the Commission based not only on political considerations, but also on the financial framework approved for each of the programmes, or on past experience in the running of the preparatory actions or pilot projects.
Moreover, it presents a difficult balance between the human resources needed to ensure the correct management of the credits and those needed to ensure the creation of this area from a legal point of view.
For these reasons, the proposed amounts represent a certain stability concerning the total amount, but with a re-centring of activities, a recast of the cooperation programmes, and an intensification of the actions in the area of asylum and immigration, including the external border control and the establishment of Eurojust.
The Commission welcomes the very constructive opinion of the LIBE Committee, which brings into the PDB the major political developments which have occurred since its presentation - such as the conclusions of the European Council of Seville - which obviously could not have been considered at the time our PDB was presented.
Nevertheless, I will make a plea for careful examination, bearing in mind such difficulties as human resources.
I now turn to the Cultural Committee, Mr Perry in particular, and also to the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee, particularly Mr Bergman.
In terms of information and communication to the public in general, over the last few years we have seen great progress in cooperation between our institutions, in the provision of information to citizens, at political level between our relevant services and most importantly, on the ground, in the Member States.
Recognising that the challenge of communication with 370 million citizens is immense, and the means available are definitely limited, we are now working increasingly with the Member States so that they share the responsibility for informing their citizens, engaging them in a dialogue that is a prerequisite for good governance and increased public support.
The adoption by the Commission, in July, of the communication on an information and communication strategy for the European Union, and the warm welcome it received, both by the Culture Committee and the Interinstitutional Group on Information, provide tangible evidence of our shared political will to be proactive in generating awareness, combating ignorance and apathy and improving perceptions about the Union.
Returning to budgetary aspects, I must underline that, as in all other aspects of the budget, the Commission took a very realistic position in relation to information and communication.
We recognised that, whilst informing and communicating with citizens must be a priority, we have to ensure that we have the capacity, especially in terms of human resources, to manage the expenditure of the funds.
The PDB is therefore the firm basis for our consideration of amendments, with one exception that relates to the new priority topic proposed in the July communication mentioned above.
I am referring to the role of Europe in the world.
If the Interinstitutional Group on Information confirms this proposal at its meeting later today, we will suggest that an additional EUR 1.5 million should be committed for the PRINCE programme.
This will be for a campaign which specifically relates to the role of Europe in the world and our actions to regulate globalisation so that it can bring benefits to our citizens and the wider world.
The Commission welcomes the constructive opinions of the Culture Committee as well as the Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Constitutional Affairs Committee.
At the meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on Information later today, we must reflect on the amounts proposed in the amendments and the practical implications.
I will of course emphasise the need to ensure that we have the necessary human resources available to spend those amounts in an appropriate and proper way.
On the subject of expert assistance and the priority campaigns, we particularly welcome the specific proposal that the budget line for financing of PRINCE correspondents should also be increased.
Without such an increase, we will not be able to engage Member States in developing the priority PRINCE campaigns.
We also strongly support the amendment to restore a cut of EUR 500 000 made by the Council, in the line that provides for the use of information correspondents to work with the media in the Member States and for the use of Eurojust experts to answer citizens' questions relating to European law.
On the euro campaign, I must re-state what the Commission has already said in the past.
The information to the candidate countries on the euro is included in the enlargement campaign, and the Commission believes that, in the case of the countries which are not yet part of the euro, the necessary funds will be proposed the day that each of these countries decides to join the euro.
Finally, in the new basis of cooperation between the Parliament and the Commission and engaging the Member States, we will be able to improve our information and communication policy and therefore make better use of taxpayers' money.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a PPE member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, I would first of all like to express my regret, as has Mr Ceyhun, that the budget does not truly reflect the priority that the Commission and the Council claim to give to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice.
It is all well and good to affirm a priority, but this priority must also be followed up by concrete action.
Yet, the appropriations for the area of freedom, security and justice are increased by less than the average level of increase for internal policies.
Why is this, Commissioner?
I would like to say that the PPE Group supports the amendments by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms proposed by the rapporteur in the crucial area of immigration and asylum policy.
I would like to know if the Commission and the Council are prepared to support us in this direction.
It is the first time that all the instruments of an active and balanced policy for managing migratory flows have been identified and strengthened by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms.
We want to improve the ways of predicting migratory flows more accurately by providing increased subsidies for the European Migration Observatory.
We want to improve control at external borders.
We support the increase in resources for cooperation with third countries.
We support the increase in appropriations designed to support integration efforts for immigrants who have settled legally in Europe and we also support the increase in resources set aside for the European Refugee Fund, although we regret that, in the draft budget and preliminary draft budget, these resources have been reduced in comparison to last year.
I would like to know if the Commission and the Council are prepared, in these matters that are strategic not only from a point of view of the development of the European Union, but also from the point of view of the way in which our fellow citizens perceive them, to increase the resources set aside in these different areas.
I have one last question to put to the Commissioners and the Council.
Last year, the European Parliament put aside EUR 5 million in the budget for use by Europol in combating terrorism.
Why has the Commission waited nine months before proposing a legal basis?
Is the Council prepared - yes or no - to accept this legal basis and to ensure that these appropriations can be used effectively?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the European Union's information service has all too often seemed like propaganda passed down to the masses from above.
The language of communication is also often cumbersome and not enough attention is paid to cultural differences.
However, now it would appear that there is hope for better things to come.
In the plans drafted under the guidance of Commissioner Vitorino we can read of the aim to base communications on the public's need for information.
That is how it should be too.
The Commission's four priorities concerning information - enlargement, the future of the Union, establishing the area of freedom, security and justice, and the EU's role in the world, are absolutely crucial.
That is why it is unthinkable that the Council should make cuts in its own draft budget in the area of appropriations for the information service.
The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which supports Commissioner Vitorino's information policy, has unanimously proposed there should be additional resources for the budget headings concerned with information.
The social democrats in the Committee on Budgets adhere to the same policy.
We cannot ask the people to become interested in our work if they do not know what is going on here.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too would like to express some concerns regarding the preliminary draft budget, some of which relate to issues which have already been raised during this debate.
I would like to focus, in particular, on two issues. Firstly, security and enlargement.
It has already been stated that we need to be more aggressive with these active policies, but clearly, considering that we have not increased appropriations despite the fact that the concerns linked to terrorism and enlargement - including the extension of our borders with all the problems that will bring - are known to and in the minds of all, greater awareness and greater political aggressiveness should have been demonstrated with regard to these issues and a commitment should have been made to increase the budget.
Secondly, as regards information policy, I agree with Mr Perry, who pointed out that 30 cents per citizen is an absolutely ridiculous proposal if we are to achieve an effective European policy in this field.
Mr President, the debate on the flood disasters has shown Europe to the public in a new light - as a community of solidarity.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bonus that we should not carelessly fritter away.
Great changes and challenges are ahead of us.
The crucial issues are evident - to us, but not to the European public.
The man in the street in Vienna would say that there is something missing from our information policy.
It is precisely on this area that a large number of amendments have been submitted.
The pressure to inform is huge, and that information must be one-sided - glossy brochures, ivory-tower conferences and websites - no matter how inventive, brilliantly conceived and really informative.
It reminds me of something I frequently experienced in my professional life.
If the public don't come to the theatre, the theatre must go to the public.
We have to go out to people, to universities, into schools, and the Member States cannot be discharged from their obligations in this respect.
We are all open to that criticism.
We should inform each other better, as the lack of information gives rise to misunderstandings, and it is precisely those that we have least need of.
That brings me back to cultural policy.
You always hear it said, in a cynical tone, that in Brussels there is money lying all over the streets, and you just have to pick some up.
Well, when it comes to culture, you can't talk in terms of collecting money and certainly not of just picking it up - counting the pennies is more like it.
Bureaucracy in this area is simply unmanageable.
Although we have only limited competence in it, I wonder what became of the three institutions' will to do something about cultural policy.
It is far too weak.
Rather than promote European content in this globalised age in which we live, we are supporting the big boys - big countries, big co-productions.
That way, the little guys, the smaller countries, and the lesser-used languages lose out.
What I want to ask the Commission is this: a legal basis for the financing of the A-30 lines is being planned, but what conception does the Commission have of it?
Is there to be a multi-annual plan?
Is there to be an interinstitutional working party, in order that the criteria in the individual areas can be defined jointly and more exactly?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises - SMEs for short - has hitherto always been one of the European Union's major concerns.
I am, then, all the more astonished to note that, in the preliminary draft budget, the Commission is reducing the amounts for this over against last year and the years preceding it.
What it boils down to is that this programme has an implementation rate of between 97% and 100%.
The development of small and medium-sized enterprises is the cornerstone of the internal market, it being beyond dispute that this area accounts for over 90% of the workforce.
It is an area that we must promote and develop, especially as regards new technologies.
I would like to ask the Commission to support our motion that these amounts be augmented.
I would like to use my remaining speaking time to call on the Council to at last come up with a ruling on the seats of the new agencies, so that this House does not end up getting through the legislative procedures in no time, with the Council then needing years to come to any decision on the seat issue.
Mr President, having listened to Commissioner Vitorino and several of my fellow Members, I can see that we share a concern to provide information to our citizens, and I listened with great interest to the Commissioner asking us for more resources than those which were set aside in the preliminary draft budget and the budget.
We were, in fact, extremely surprised to see the reductions which had been made to these lines, at a time when so many doubts are being harboured by European citizens who still do not seem to be receiving the right information.
Commissioner, I would like to emphasise the fact that we tabled many amendments in order to give the Commission another chance to complete this essential task, namely the communication on the work of the European Union institutions.
But I would also like to stress the fact that this communication must be, as Mrs Iivari said, targeted towards the ordinary citizen, the average citizen, who, when working or going to the market, does not understand what the European Union is doing for the future.
We must undertake a thorough review of the strategy used by our institutions to communicate with the public.
Let us go to meet the inhabitants of our fifteen countries and try to understand them.
I believe that, as we did for economic measures, we must move from macrointervention towards closer intervention.
As we do for SMEs, let us go and look for the citizens one by one!
Mr President, I shall begin by responding to Mr Deprez, who is an expert in budgetary matters, justice and home affairs.
As far as Europol is concerned, Parliament did indeed set aside 5 million in the 2002 budget.
Yet, we came up against an issue that you are very familiar with, that of the legal basis, since Europol was set up by an intergovernmental convention, and the only funding available under this intergovernmental convention is that derived from Member States' contributions.
We began by asking Europol what it would do with this 5 million and, after some time, we finally received a response whereby Europol, realistically and pragmatically, told us that it wanted to use EUR 3 400 000 out of the 5 million in order, as part of the fight against terrorism, to create a database and improve the communication systems between the security forces and intelligence services.
Based on this information, we prepared what we believe to be a legal basis which is currently being examined by the Council.
I share your hope that the Council will find a solution to the issue of the legal basis so that the EUR 3 400 000 can be used before the end of the year.
As for the amount of time that has passed in between, I shall now explain the reason for this.
I mentioned the issue of the 5 million to illustrate that I do not fully agree with your comparison of the figures.
The 5 million was not proposed again this year.
This amount has not been reproduced in this year's budget.
We must compare the JHA budget less the 5 million from 2002, in other words EUR 114 million, with the EUR 119 million that we want to propose.
I understand that this may not seem very much to you, but I am speaking under the watchful eye of Mrs Schreyer, who will not allow me to agree with you.
As far as the budget for asylum and immigration is concerned, I think that the budgetary line for cooperation with third countries was devoted, in 2002, mainly to aid operations for Afghan refugees and to the return of Afghan refugees.
No one can question the priority given to Afghanistan.
My intention for the future is to grant the appropriations from this budgetary line, for which no increase is planned, primarily to third countries which are currently negotiating or have recently been negotiating readmission agreements with us.
This will allow us to finance measures to accompany the execution of readmission agreements.
That said, I support your idea that we should have at our disposal a general overview of the budgetary situation of funds that the European Union is already providing, at the current time, for cooperation with third countries in the area of asylum and immigration.
These funds do not only appear in the JHA budget; they also appear, and to a great extent, in the Relex budget, in the Country strategy papers, in the regional programmes such as MEDA or CARDS.
That is why the Seville Council asked us to draw up a report on the effectiveness of financial resources that we provide for cooperation with third countries.
We shall do this within the timeframe laid down by the Seville European Council and I shall take this opportunity to present to you the first mid-term assessment of the use of the European Refugee Fund over the period 2000-2002.
Regarding the issue of enlargement that Mrs Sbarbati has just raised, I must tell you that 60% of all funding granted in recent years from the justice and home affairs budget to candidate countries has been used to improve controls at the external borders of the candidate countries and that the programmes concerned, which are part of the PHARE initiative, will continue until 2006.
We have an assessment of the results of these programmes compared to the results obtained by the candidate countries each year.
I can tell you that this is the number one priority as far as the candidate countries are concerned.
Let us now move on from justice and home affairs and discuss information and communication.
I can only support the idea that an information and communication policy must be a policy of proximity.
That is why we proposed a new approach.
I cannot promise you that the new approach will succeed.
No one can.
But I can assure you that the only solution is to form an interinstitutional partnership and work very closely with the Member States.
If the Member States do not engage in an information and communication policy of proximity, we cannot do this from Brussels.
In my view, this evidence cannot be contested.
You also know that the commitment from the Member States is totally voluntary.
This means that the Commission and Parliament, in an interinstitutional framework, shall invite the Member States to become involved in this exercise, because we believe that, ultimately, it will be in everyone's interest, not only the interest of the European institutions, but also of the Member States' governments, to have a general public that is better informed of what is going on at European level.
But, to do this, we must have the necessary human resources.
That is why I called for the amounts which are included in the preliminary draft budget and which refer to the Prince and MEDIA correspondents working in the Member States' capitals to be retained.
Without these intruments, we will not be able to succeed in establishing this partnership with the Member States.
I would like to thank you for your support in this respect and I hope that we will be able to develop, on the basis of this partnership, a more proactive, clearer and better targeted information and communication policy.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
We will now have the debate on the areas of external action.
the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is of course interested in international development and especially the opportunity to play a part in shaping policy within the WTO.
We have two problems here. On the one hand, our Committee's resources do not permit us to monitor and influence the debate to the extent that would be genuinely useful.
On the other, we have many parliamentarians from other countries - primarily from developing countries - who cannot meet the costs, even for travel and accommodation, in order to attend these debates and play a role in this decision-making process.
Firstly, we want Europe to commit itself to playing a leading role in global affairs.
The WTO and the capacity to make decisions on matters of WTO policy are extremely important, especially for our small and medium enterprises.
Secondly, we want to press ahead with standardisation, because what we want to push for first and foremost, in terms of legislation, is mutual recognition, rather than harmonisation within the European internal market. In this context, standardisation is essential and fundamental.
Thirdly, in the energy field, we want to ensure that the intelligent energy programmes, but also the ALTENER, SAVE and SYNERGIE programmes, are used intensively and that the Commission sets priorities here, especially for our energy self-sufficiency, where the aim, after all, is to achieve an increase from 50% to 70%.
In this context, more intensive measures need to be adopted as a matter of urgency to safeguard and secure our energy supply.
Let me make one further point, which originates from Parliament alone: we want Basle II to have its own action programme.
We are concerned that the equity capital requirements for our SMEs will not be achievable by 2006, and that this will precipitate a massive number of foreclosures and bankruptcies.
So let's do our homework here first.
Mr President, once again this year the increase in funds committed to pre-accession in category 4 means an overall decline in Europe's external action devoted to development.
Sadly, the only real long-term solution to this problem lies in the revision of the financial perspective in 2006.
I shall concentrate today on two issues where we can make a real difference this year.
Firstly, the global health fund against AIDS, TB and malaria.
The Committee on Development has proposed that all regional budget lines contribute to achieving the sizeable recurrent contribution needed.
AIDS is a global problem.
India is the country with the second-highest level of infection after South Africa, and the biggest increase in infections is in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
Already the fund has committed 13% of its money to the Americas.
But if the Commission and Council disagree with this approach, let them tell us where the money will come from.
Let them admit that the EUR 35 million budgeted for does not achieve Mr Patten's own commitment made on 16 September in order to keep the Commission's own seat on the Global Health Fund board.
This is right for Europe as a leader and innovator in the field, and it is right for the 3 million people dying of AIDS worldwide to make sure that the money works.
I have been given a clear understanding that the Global Health Fund's transitional working group meeting in Brussels agreed USD 100 million for a board seat, that the Global Fund secretariat has already budgeted for a USD 120 million European Community contribution for next year, and that approved projects will be cut if we fail to match that figure.
I have given the Commissioner advance notice of these questions.
If I am wrong, let him put this on the record today, and if I am right let him support our amendments.
Secondly, the quality of aid.
It is regrettable that agreements made since the reform of external assistance still mean that three times as much European aid is spent on transport as on health and education, combined, for the poorest people in greatest need.
That is why Parliament this year is seeking to earmark this spending and promote it as part of the deconcentration of staff and in the new country strategy papers.
Commissioner Nielson will be aware that on 15 July his services promised a firm proposal on this point and that I received his reply by fax only at 3.40 p.m. this afternoon after this debate had begun.
I conclude by saying that I hope the Commissioner will therefore defer the proper concerns he may wish to raise in relation to Parliament's proposals this afternoon, and commit himself to the further discussions where I agree with his wish, and I quote 'to press ahead together in achieving our common goals'.
I look forward to hearing his response.
the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Titley, is unable to attend the debate and has asked me to make various comments on the Committee's behalf.
The Committee has set itself three objectives: firstly, to make clear which foreign policy priorities the European Union intends to set in the new financial year without wrecking the stipulated financial framework.
Secondly, we want more transparency.
A number of amendments to the budget's nomenclature are designed to increase the flow of resources.
These proposed amendments also have no financial implications, but will lead to more budget transparency and thus facilitate budgetary control.
The third issue, which is a particular priority for the draftsman of the opinion and the Committee, is to improve the security of our delegations around the world.
Remedial action needs to be taken here and we want to support this process.
Let me take each of these three points in turn.
On the first point, we are planning some increases in funding to reflect political priorities for the cross-border programmes under TACIS.
The European Union's new external borders require more funding for cooperation across these borders, which is why we have proposed a number of increases.
The second issue is nuclear safety.
This too is a priority for this House, and we want to see this reflected in the budget figures for next year.
Anti-personnel mines and the rapid reaction mechanism are also areas where we have proposed budget increases.
Then we have a scenario reminiscent of the film Dinner for One at New Year, with the 'same procedure as every year', when the Commission cuts the funding for human rights and democracy budget lines and the Parliament bumps it up again.
We intend to do so this year as well, and we would ask the Commission to take note for once next year that Parliament is setting these priorities and that this should be reflected in the draft budget.
In the interests of transparency, we would like Afghanistan to be a separate budget line, not a sub-item under Asia.
A great deal of money will flow to Afghanistan over the coming years, so this is very important.
Finally, the draftsman has also urged us to ensure that there is, in future, regular disclosure of the budget lines for Palestine so that it can be ascertained from the outset where the money is going.
In my view, better budgetary control is needed here.
These are our priorities.
Let me conclude by addressing a request to the Council.
This House asks to be involved more closely in future when making new political promises in the foreign policy field. Otherwise, if the Council continues to make a succession of new promises without the money to back them up, we will forfeit our credibility.
Since my colleague Chris Patten is attending two summits simultaneously today, I would like to respond to some of the points on his behalf.
Firstly, in the foreign policy field, we face, after all, the most substantial new requirements for many years, without any scope to expand the budget.
The Council and Parliament have already used the flexibility instrument several times here in order to meet the new requirements.
On the issue of Afghanistan, I would like to extend my thanks to the Council and especially, in advance, to this House for agreeing to the very rapid release at this time of EUR 70 million which are still in reserve for this year in order to provide assistance here, and especially also for granting the necessary direct subsidies to the transitional government.
On the issue raised by Mr Howitt, which also relates to the Global Health Fund, I would point out that we have earmarked EUR 35 million for the Fund in the budget.
After all, we have already contributed EUR 120 million to the Global Health Fund from the EU and EDF budgets.
The decision was only taken recently, so we assume that these funds are adequate.
My colleague Mr Nielson, in particular, has various budget lines available.
He will make a statement on this issue shortly.
As regards Mr RÃŒbig's question on energy, the Commission has proposed a new multi-annual programme for action in the field of intelligent energies, which also provides funding for these energies in third states.
I think the Johannesburg Summit made it very clear once again that we should be giving special priority to this area.
Let me first address the issue mentioned by Mr Howitt, of the amounts targeted towards health and education.
Most Members of Parliament will recognise that, since we have discussed this again and again, it is not easy to say anything new.
That is also the reason why Mr Howitt has not missed anything, even though I did not have the opportunity to reply to his last letter in time.
That does not, of course, prevent us from continuing to discuss the matter amicably.
The agreement last year on a 35% benchmark on health and education is an input indicator for our commitments to social infrastructure.
The Commission will provide the breakdown of figures against the various DAC codes from the OECD showing commitments in 2002 and 2003 for health and education.
The level of commitments will depend mainly on the results of the programming exercise in our partner countries.
There is no need to re-open the agreement of last year, and there is nothing to be gained by it in terms of additional information.
The systems of tracing and categorising more clearly what we do is under implementation - according to what we have promised Parliament - and that will create a basis for a more enlightened discussion on these issues.
On the funding of the Global Health Fund, as my colleague Mrs Schreyer has already said, the Commission will ensure that it will do what is expected.
This is all we really need to say at this point.
I agree very much with Mr Laschet that the increase in TACIS is important, inter alia for reasons of stepping up our presence in general in that region.
On what was said about involving Parliament more closely when making political promises, I understood that to mean that Parliament should be involved more before making political promises, otherwise I do not see why we need to discuss it.
This is certainly a good and correct way of working and, in general, I feel this is the way things are being done.
Remarks were made about staffing and security in delegations.
We welcome the amendment by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy underlining the difficult security situation of many of our delegations.
However, the Development Committee amendment relating to the recruitment of specialists - the other point raised by Mr Howitt - puts very rigid and complicated conditions on the release of EUR 10 million of these funds.
It would seriously undermine the deconcentration process, since we need to know the funds available in order to recruit and train staff.
It will also unnecessarily penalise some of the poorest beneficiaries, since the main impact will fall on delegations in 30 ACP countries.
What we do, and what we prefer to do, is to strengthen the handling of the different sectors by means of networks of specialists both in headquarters and out in delegations.
However, a very rigid system, as proposed by the Development Committee's amendment, will not help us in getting things done in an efficient manner, so we do not welcome that proposal.
Mr President, my point concerns the next four hours.
Commissioner Nielson was not here when I made my opening remarks but one of them concerned the Global Health Fund.
One question we need answering before we take a decision next week on category 4 is: what is the amount of money that the European Union has to pay to get a seat on the board of the Global Health Fund?
We are getting conflicting comments from the Commission and from our colleagues in the Committee on Development.
The Committee on Budgets needs to know a figure.
Mr President, my reluctance to answer is based on the fact that we do not have a figure.
If we look at what it took to get a seat in the first year, following the establishment of the Fund, the mathematics tell us that it was around EUR 84 million, but the United States says that it is paying for about four seats.
We would not like to see a larger Health Fund board. That would not be efficient.
Other actors are trying to get seats on that board, so there is some pressure.
As you know, we came up with EUR 120 million for the first year.
The actual use of that money and the overall availability of funds compared to the actual spending in the first year makes for a very open discussion as to the actual funding need for the coming year.
It is against this background that the Commission finds it advisable not to come up with a figure today.
We want to have a picture of what other donors are doing to make sure that we feed money into the fund in a prudent manner to make it work as expected, but also to maximise value for money whatever we do in this area as a whole.
We do not have a figure right now.
Also, we are not under pressure at this stage to clarify all the details of how we find the money, so we advise waiting a little.
That is why you do not have a clear answer.
Mr President, allow me to comment directly on Commissioner Nielson's speech.
Being able only to wait and see is not such a simple matter, at any rate for those of us in Parliament.
Alongside the budget, we are working - as you know, Commissioner Nielson - on the directive that you are responsible for and that is to lay down the rate for the next four years, for which the Commission has proposed a total amount of EUR 300 million.
According to the Committee on Development and Cooperation, this amount is altogether too little, not only for the purposes of obtaining the necessary flexibility and going in and supporting the Global AIDS and Health Fund, but also for ensuring that the EU's own work, via the resources of our own secretariat, is as ambitious as possible.
I think that both the Council and the Commission ought to welcome the fact that Parliament has this very ambitious attitude towards an issue and a problem that will dominate the discussions of development issues, not only in Africa but also in many other regions during the next few decades.
Alongside this issue, there are a further couple of factors that it is incredibly important to define when we discuss the part of the budget concerned with development cooperation.
Mr Howitt has already mentioned focusing on health, education and efforts to combat poverty.
I should like to say to Mr Nielson that one of the reasons why we are returning to these areas in order to clarify them is that the Commission's work in the field indicates that it is specifically health care and education that still receive an extremely small proportion of the aid, something we regard as being manifestly wrong and clearly not good enough.
Finally, it is incredibly important that we be more flexible within the European Union and ensure that needs that arise in connection with war and disasters are not constantly financed from long-term development programmes upon which they correspondingly place a burden.
That is why the proposal to fund aid to Afghanistan using the flexibility reserve is extremely interesting.
Mr President, I would just like to raise four points.
Firstly, the G8 recently reached agreement on the need to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy in developing countries.
Mrs Schreyer referred to this (to the intelligent energy programme) earlier.
My question to Mrs Schreyer is: Would she say that EUR 19 million over four years is adequate for preparatory work in over 80 - 90 countries?
My question to Mr Nielson is: It is recognised that energy is a factor in poverty for the developing countries, so could he tell us how he proposes to coordinate his work with other DGs to tackle this?
My second point is that Commission Patten has made statements that the EU should have a poverty focus in its development aid.
Therefore, would you agree that it is inconsistent to increase funding, as foreign affairs amendments have done, to Latin America and MEDA lines, and actually take away money from Asia lines?
What do you think of Mr. Elles' statement today that Afghanistan should be funded from the flexibility instrument?
I would like to return to the Global Health Fund.
I am not really satisfied with the response and the answer we have had from Commissioner Nielson.
What I want to know, with regard to the EUR 35 million that we are proposing, is whether that is enough to get us a seat on the board?
Is that adequate in terms of the EU leading the debate and fighting AIDS in the world?
Finally, I would like to ask the Council their opinion on the U-turn in the PPE position, and the proposal to break the gentleman's agreement.
In the July conciliation, the PPE agreed to the Council's budget, but this afternoon we were informed by Mr Elles that they will put EUR 6.3 million from their basics budget in the reserve.
They are breaking their word, and if this amendment is accepted, what would the Council's response be?
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that the budget should be a reflection of Parliament's political wishes.
This is mostly the case, but not always when the so-called special delegates are involved.
For example, the EU has one such delegate for the Middle East.
Parliament has repeatedly said that it would be desirable to have such a special delegate for the Southern Caucasus or Tibet, for example.
We are now facing the problem that the coffers are technically empty for this purpose, for these special delegates fall within the scope of the Council's budget.
This is not to our liking, but the agreement is that we are not to touch the Council's budget.
It now therefore looks like a widely shared political aspiration is set to wind up in the cogs of Parliament's budget machinery.
I should like to draw both the Council's and Commission's attention to this, with the very specific question to the Council whether it would be prepared to make room in its budget for a special deputy for the Southern Caucasus and Tibet and if not, to make this known promptly and clearly so that the Commission can plug this hole.
My question to the Commission is whether it is prepared to do that.
After all, it is unacceptable for European presence in crisis regions to be restricted simply because a widely shared political aspiration is at risk of falling between all the financial stools.
Mr President, when we talk about next year's budget, we should not overlook the fact that the budget's implementation, both now and in the past, has displayed worrying features.
Quite apart from improper tasks, it appears that the Commission is hardly able to handle real Community policy.
Just think of the gigantic discrepancies between commitments and payments.
In the area of external actions, we come across quite a few unprofitable proposals that have sprung up from the Commission's inflated ego.
This is true, for example, of the EU's position between Israel and the Palestinians.
The capital that flows to the Palestinian Authorities largely ends up in unknown pockets.
We will therefore endorse the PPE-DE's amendment to place at least a proportion of this capital in reserve, as long as the Palestinian Authority lacks an efficient control system.
There are some who want to place the budget for the Sixth Framework Programme in reserve too.
The report by the committee on human genetics foundered last year due to the great division in this Parliament concerning an ethical framework for biomedical developments.
This is why I consider it utterly despicable that a number of fellow MEPs from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy should put pressure on the Council to break through ethical boundaries.
This is about research into embryonic stem cells no less, which affects human life in its earliest form.
Fortunately, a number of Member States are enforcing the ban on the use of human embryos for research.
It would create a bizarre situation if we were to finance this kind of research from the Sixth Framework Programme.
Research that is punishable in one Member State would then receive funding from the European Union in another.
I truly hope that the Council does not get blackmailed, but shows respect for human life in its earliest form.
The aforementioned fellow MEPs who have negotiated with the Council on behalf of Parliament in this manner have gone beyond the boundaries of political decency.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the external actions contained in heading 4 clearly represent the display window of the European Union and the Commission - of our joint action in the context of our international relations.
It is a highly important chapter in which our credibility is at stake, not only with regard to the aspects already cited by my fellow Members - the RAL, occasional implementation problems - but also in terms of our public statements, our political and legal commitments, and important budget-related actions.
In his absence, I am addressing my comments to Commissioner Patten in particular, through the intermediary of Mrs Schreyer.
I am talking about the cooperation agreements we have concluded with many countries.
For a number of years, thanks to Parliament, these agreements have all contained what is called the 'human rights' clause.
This clause is so important that it should be read and kept in mind.
This clause states that the agreements shall in practice be suspended or considered suspended should the two parties fail to respect human rights as guaranteed by international conventions, and in particular the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
Well, despite the fact that Parliament has insisted on this aspect, despite the fact that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, including cooperation agreements, made a commitment to ensure that these agreements are respected to the letter, we still, as if nothing had happened, continue to conclude and maintain projects, programmes and funding in countries run by dictators.
Take Vietnam, for example.
Together with my colleagues in the radical party and hundreds, or even thousands, of people, and also many of my fellow Members, I called the Commission's attention to the human rights situation in Vietnam.
Well, in 2003 we are due to give Vietnam EUR 38 million.
We have tabled an amendment so that, at least at first reading, these agreements and funds may be set aside until the situation is resolved and both Vietnam and the Commission provide us with guarantees and explanations as to what is really going on there.
There are other countries in a similar situation.
We took Vietnam as an example because we think the Commission should really change its method of managing and implementing the budget with regard to these cooperation agreements.
Mr President, Commissioners. ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is just around the corner and we continually speak of finance and various programmes for the new Member States, but we forget that action is also needed in the border areas of our new neighbours and for these new neighbours themselves.
For that reason, my group and I want future border areas to receive more attention.
