Can you be frank enough to say which Member States are prepared to adopt a regulation of this kind and which are not?
I think that this could make for considerable democratic pressure on the Member States that are not prepared to do this and do not wish to be called to account for the funds they spend.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I do not actually know at the moment which Member States we are talking about.
I can assure the honourable Member, however, that it is the vast majority.
There is no point in cherry-picking at this time.
Other proposals have been put forward, however, including by the Commission, such as the creation of an integrated control framework.
The national declaration of assurance is also excluded here, however.
There are many other elements, including in the context of personal responsibility, that could help ensure that budgetary control is exercised properly at the end of the day.
In addition, irrespective of the question of political will, the EC Treaty does not provide for the field mentioned by the honourable Member.
I do believe, however, that the other possibilities I have just mentioned for simplifying procedures represent key elements.
Thank you, President-in-Office.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Situation in Darfur (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Darfur.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, we are confronted with a dramatic humanitarian, security and political problem in Darfur today.
The situation on the ground is deteriorating by the day.
The number of civilians affected by the conflict has risen to almost four million since 2003.
Throughout 2006 we saw an increase in the number of violent deaths in Darfur.
Attacks on humanitarian aid agencies also significantly increased and this has prompted some organisations to evacuate.
Continued violations of the ceasefire by both the Sudanese Government and the rebel factions deepen insecurity and instability.
Most recently, on Monday, Sudanese military forces bombarded Cariari and Bahai, two villages in north Darfur close to the Chad-Sudan border.
The African Union Mission to Sudan - established in 2004 to help prevent further conflict - continues to face resource constraints.
Despite its best efforts, it had some difficulty in providing effective protection to civilians or carrying out additional duties associated with the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement.
Politically, the situation is complicated by splits and regrouping among the non-signatory rebel movements as well as the Government's refusal to consider reopening the deadlocked Peace Agreement.
Darfur is not a simple issue.
The commitment of the European Union to alleviating such a dramatic situation has been reiterated on several occasions, most recently at the European Council last December, at the Council on 22 January and, just two days ago, through the General Affairs Council conclusions on Sudan of 12 February.
We must work to ensure the protection of non-combatants as well as of humanitarian aid workers.
We must seek the full implementation of the UN-AU three phase plan for Darfur, this being the most effective means at our disposal to support the African Union mission in Sudan and to protect civilians.
But our overriding objective in Darfur must be to achieve a durable peace through a political settlement agreed by all parties voluntarily and then implemented.
The strategy of Khartoum to negotiate individually with each rebel leader to buy their support will not create a cohesive and lasting peace.
The Council of the EU, in its latest conclusions on Sudan, has emphasised the need for an inclusive political process and confirmed its support for the joint initiative of the African Union and UN special envoys to start negotiations between the parties as soon as possible.
On several occasions and in various fora, the Commission has stressed the need for a political solution in Darfur based on the existing peace agreement and insisted that there is no military solution to the crisis.
In this context, the European Commission has strongly backed the African Union in the search for a political settlement in Darfur.
The Commission has been providing continued support to the African Union in political and financial terms.
With cofinancing from Belgium, the Commission stands behind any and all efforts to revive the peace agreement.
The European Commission has provided one and a half billion euros specifically for the Darfur crisis, covering security, humanitarian needs and peace efforts for Darfur.
The aim is to create the conditions to bring the non-signatory parties of the Darfur Peace Agreement back to the negotiating table and to start effective implementation of the Agreement.
Pending a lasting settlement, the Commission is also active in the political dÃ©marche intended to obtain the agreement of the Khartoum Government to a joint AU-UN force capable of providing effective protection of civilians.
In the margins of the African Union Summit on 28 January, Commissioner Michel met with the Sudanese President, Mr al-Bashir, as well as with the UN Secretary-General Mr Ban Ki-Moon.
The Commissioner was also in Ethiopia and in Eritrea where the Darfur issue was raised.
Just yesterday, the Darfur issue was discussed in Washington in a meeting between Commissioner Michel and the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.
This Parliament is right to debate the Darfur Peace Agreement and the critical situation in Darfur.
Yet we must not take the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for granted.
EU Heads of Mission in Khartoum report that this peace agreement, made in 2005 with the south, is in trouble.
After 20 years of civil war the comprehensive peace agreement may be the last chance for the Khartoum regime to show that the federal power-sharing form of government can work for this vast country.
If the Comprehensive Peace Agreement cannot work, then nor can the Darfur Peace Agreement.
It is important, I think, that the critical situation in Darfur does not divert our attention, or indeed the attention of the Sudanese regime, from the very real threat to the whole sub-region if both the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the Darfur Peace Agreement are not pursued with more vigour.
This is a message that the Commission will strive to communicate in the weeks ahead.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Council released its conclusions on Sudan on Monday, so it is appropriate that Parliament also speaks out strongly this week, further highlighting the humanitarian crisis and international scandal that is Darfur.
We are attempting to raise the political temperature on this issue to increase the pressure on those who can, if the will exists, make things happen on the ground to protect people.
We all know the figures and the scale of the humanitarian consequences of insufficient action by the international community.
It is estimated that up to 400 000 people have been killed and more than two and a half million people displaced or made homeless in the last three years due to conflict.
NGOs currently provide humanitarian relief for up to four million people. That is half of Darfur's entire population.
In recent months there have been repeated attacks on humanitarian convoys and twelve aid workers have been killed in Darfur in the last six months.
So NGOs are pulling their people out of Darfur while indiscriminate attacks continue on civilians.
So what can we do?
The main thrust of this resolution is to call on the UN to set a clear date for deployment of the planned UN-supported peacekeeping force, or hybrid force, into Darfur, even in the absence of agreement with the Sudanese Government, in order to secure humanitarian aid corridors to an increasingly isolated population in the region.
We are calling for this in the context of the UN's responsibility to protect, based on the failure of the Sudanese Government to protect its own population from war crimes and crimes against humanity, and a failure to provide humanitarian assistance to the population.
President al-Bashir continues to oppose Phase 3 of the present UN Plan which allows the AU mission to be bolstered by more than 20 000 UN peacekeeping troops.
The point is, diplomacy is failing.
People are dying in huge numbers and at some point the international community is obliged to act more firmly.
That is why the setting of a clear date for the deployment of troops will focus the attention on a tight timescale to find a diplomatic solution to get peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Darfur has been suffering under a regime of terror for four years now.
Hundreds of thousands of people there have lost their lives, two million have lost their homes, and rape, murder and pillaging are daily occurrences there.
It is nearly impossible to really grasp the extent of this suffering.
Meanwhile, despite all the fine agreements, human rights violations get increasingly out of hand.
Over the past few months, the situation has hit an all-time low for both the people and aid workers.
Despite the Peace Agreement concluded in early January, large parts of North Darfur were deliberately bombarded recently by the Sudanese air force.
Even the aid workers are no longer safe from violence, aid organisations increasingly feel it.
Last month, 15 UN organisations, including UNICEF, reported that they were no longer able to keep on providing aid to the people in Darfur in an adequate manner.
Two weeks ago, the aid organisation MÃ©dicins du Monde was the first to withdraw, and Oxfam and CARE International are at risk of having to follow suit, even though three and a half million Darfuris rely on humanitarian aid.
The Council is not present today.
How long do we intend to perpetuate this untenable situation?
The UN may be speaking with force in its resolution, but it has not done much in the way of action.
The peace force that was promised two months ago in Addis Ababa produced some 100 troops and very little else.
The UN Security Council authorised sanctions against four major perpetrators of atrocities, but nothing happened.
It is unacceptable for European Member States to be able to impose sanctions on war criminals in countries such as Belarus, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, North Korea, Burma and Zimbabwe and to fail to do so in Darfur, where the Council is neglecting its humanitarian duty.
The international community should no longer stand by helplessly while millions of innocent people are being driven away from their homes, murdered and raped.
Europe should take the lead and take urgent action in order to stop the humanitarian crisis in Darfur in its tracks.
The Sudanese Government will be prepared to conclude real peace agreements and adhere to them only if its own interests are affected, for the only language it understands is its own, that of the fist.
In southern Sudan, an oil boycott proved effective, and I would urge Members belonging to the other political parties to apply the same tactics if necessary.
I should like to ask the Council whether it is prepared, without delay, to declare sanctions against anyone who violates the ceasefire or who attacks citizens, peace keepers or aid workers.
Would it be prepared to do everything necessary to stop them getting away with it and, once and for all, to enforce and implement the sanctions agreed upon in the Security Council?
Is it prepared to enforce the presence of the hybrid peace force of African Union soldiers and blue helmets?
Would it, finally, be prepared to apply economic sanctions, including the introduction of an oil embargo?
We did not intervene when the genocide in Rwanda took place, and watched helplessly as the men in Srebrenica met their fate, even though the UN was set up in 1945 in order to reinforce our promise of 'never again'.
We should not leave the powerless to their fate.
I hope that Europe wants to make a difference.
I am, above all, addressing the Council, which is absent, and the Commissioner, whom I would like to urge to take action.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I speak on behalf of my colleague, Mr Morillon.
I must begin by highlighting the entirely surreal nature of our meeting this evening.
There are around ten of us Members present.
Commissioner, thank you for being here.
I know the reasons for the absence of Mr Michel, whom you are representing.
However, the most notable absentee is the Council, and in the meantime, I am afraid to say, people continue to die in Darfur.
I would remind you, as a numbers man, Mr Almunia, that fourteen or fifteen people die every hour in Darfur.
It was therefore high time we worried about a situation that no one believes is simple.
Yet, must we continue making fools of ourselves?
This resolution will be the fifth that we have adopted over many months on Darfur: we can see the extent to which they undermine the officials, not least the Sudanese officials received this evening in Paris.
I believe that we could actually finally assume our responsibilities.
I must alert you, Commissioner, to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this resolution.
As my fellow Member, Mr Coveney, pointed out, paragraph 2 emphasises the need for a precise date to be set by the UN.
However, paragraph 3, Commissioner, is an appeal launched at the European Union, with the aim of having it assume its responsibilities.
Its assuming its responsibilities will surely mean something in the future.
If not, one may wonder about the purpose of the European Union and of the values that we seek to uphold, faced with what is essentially an endless emergency humanitarian situation, something that no one denies.
My colleagues have nominated me as permanent rapporteur for humanitarian action.
But what should I report on?
The systematic withdrawal of all the NGOs, which are no longer allowed to work, the fourteen people who have been killed and the deaths day in, day out of people who have been abandoned and who, in addition to having been displaced, have lost all hope.
Commissioner, please speak with the Commission on our behalf; we will take care of the Council, politically, because, if we listened to them, we would have to wait a month before discussing this issue.
This message needs to be passed on: one day, the law, not to mention the duty to interfere, will be required, when it is clear that men and women are being abused to this extent.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can identify with this joint resolution about the international blot - and I should like to underline 'this international blot' - being Darfur, despite a few of the comments that have been made.
I should like to single out a few elements if I may.
In recital C, it is stated that the conflict in Darfur is increasingly destabilising the Central African region.
Less than a week ago, an analysis was published in my home country, the Netherlands, about this very disruptive situation under the telling heading 'The black hole'.
Indeed, there is a black hole at the heart of Africa, rudderless, violent and with a stream of refugees who are headed in all directions.
One immediate risk is that the conflict in Darfur, which is racist in that nomads of Arab origin are driving out and killing African farmers, will move to Chad and take the notorious and murderous Janjaweed militia with it.
Various paragraphs in the joint resolution urge the United Nations finally to face up to its responsibilities in Darfur.
Whilst I can fully endorse this parliamentary cry for help, I have to confess at the same time that I am extremely sceptical as to whether this distress signal will actually be heard in the UN Headquarters in New York.
Earlier this week, Jan Pronk, the former UN envoy to Sudan, gave a frank and honest interview to the Sudan Tribune.
He asserted, verbatim, that he accused New York of leaving its own mission in the lurch and, instead, of pandering to the elite in power in Khartoum.
It is awful - he said - if you send thousands of people to Sudan and then leave them to their own devices.
What we should, in any case, be doing is to ensure that Mr Pronk's indictment does not fall on deaf ears, but reaches our governments, the European Council and the UN Security Council, and results in action.
I also deem as completely appropriate the appeal of this House to the People's Republic of China to put its not insignificant political and economic weight into the balance in order to try to get the Sudanese leadership to actually enforce existing peace agreements on Khartoum.
Only a constructive international stance such as this one is in keeping with Peking's adage of harmonious external relations.
Moreover, that is also what we can expect of a strategic partner as a responsible member of the UN Security Council.
After all, as rapporteur for EU/China relations, I constantly reminded my esteemed Chinese interlocutors of this elementary constructive international role.
Finally, I would like to back the only amendment to the joint resolution - that tabled by Mrs Gomes - and back it all the way.
Sanctions against this shameless Sudanese regime should definitely involve an oil embargo, as some sort of acid test to check whether the United Nations, given the long suffering of the people in Darfur, still abides by its own political principles.
(DE) Mr President, the situation in Darfur remains shocking.
The response of the international community has been wholly inadequate.
The previous speakers have described the situation adequately: there is no improvement in sight for the people there.
Some necessary resolutions have been passed, such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706, but their implementation ultimately fails on account of the Government in Khartoum, most of whose leaders are no doubt listed in the files of the International Criminal Court - which launched an investigation into crimes in Darfur as early as June 2005.
We have a situation where the United Nations has to take action, in accordance with its responsibility for protecting human beings, since the Government of Sudan has not been protecting the people of Darfur against war crimes and crimes against humanity, nor has it lent them any assistance.
For this reason, Parliament calls on the United Nations to set a date for the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force pursuant to Article 7 of the Charter of the United Nations, even if this has not been approved by the Khartoum regime.
We call on the Council and the Commission to do everything in their power to put an end to this sustained humanitarian disaster.
Concrete action can be launched for the short term without great expense.
The EU should impose personal sanctions on representatives of the regime unilaterally rather than waiting for the rest of the international community.
I have always been in favour of this as a means of preventing family members going on shopping trips to Europe.
The Darfur regime has thus far been ignoring the no-fly zone imposed by Security Council Resolution 1591, and is continuing to bomb villages in Darfur.
We call for the use of capabilities available in the region to enforce this no-fly zone.
After all, we know which Member States have aircraft based in the region - not to say the immediate vicinity.
Why are these not being used in the services of the UN?
The EU must agree to this, at least.
We should also give those in power in Khartoum to understand that they should not rely overly on forces outside Africa.
The Sudanese Government is skating on very thin ice, and should not exhaust African solidarity.
Two warning shots have already been fired.
The ACP Summit in Khartoum was the summit attended by the fewest Heads of State or Government - a clear sign of displeasure.
The fact that the AU Summit opted for President Kufuor instead of the Sudanese President was a further clear indication of disapproval.
Mr President, as others have said, as General al-Bashir continues to prevaricate on the deployment of an AU-UN hybrid force in Darfur, we see the humanitarian crisis getting worse.
We see the number of internally displaced people increasing.
The ceasefire has collapsed.
The international community has and is continuing to fail to fulfil its responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Darfur.
This means that the European Union must act urgently to impose its own targeted and phased smart sanctions.
We do not have to wait for the UN Security Council to agree on essential new measures - as others have suggested - on an arms embargo covering all of Sudan, on asset-freezing of the wealthy people of Sudan, on travel bans and on consideration of an oil embargo.
Clearly, revenue flows to the south would need to be protected if we impose an oil embargo, and consideration would perhaps need to be given to compensating the south Sudanese for lost oil revenue.
But the least we can do is to put a bar on investments, on technical equipment and on expertise.
I also believe that there should be serious consideration of sports sanctions against Sudan, especially consideration of excluding Sudan from the 2010 World Cup.
This means that Europe has to put pressure on FIFA.
The EU position, frankly, is weak and untenable.
There is too much emphasis on carrots and not enough on sticks.
The German Presidency must take a lead and insist on a unified position from Member States.
Commissioner, you have described the position, and in the Council we hear the fine words, but nothing happens.
The question is: how does Europe put pressure on Khartoum?
There must be an urgent and detailed investigation of the personal finances of wealthy individuals in Sudan.
We have to prepare the arguments against those who claim that this would push Sudan closer towards Chinese business interests.
The truth is, frankly, that nothing is currently influencing Sudan.
It is virtually impossible to influence them, and so, if we remain supine, then we maintain the position where they can be as brutal as they like and Europe will continue to do nothing.
Millions of people in Darfur are paying for European broken promises and totally worthless commitments.
Khartoum knows that Europe is all bark and no bite and that is why today we are calling for new, strong, economic, legal and military measures.
Public condemnation is not enough.
We want solutions which reflect the tragedy.
Europe is shamefully weak and I have to say finally that if Darfur was, for example, Lebanon, then real sanctions would be getting a lot more discussion time in the Council, and President Barroso in the Commission and you, Commissioner, would put pressure on the Council to do more.
Mr President, the humanitarian crisis in Darfur is on a scale which is difficult to comprehend.
Two and a half million people have had to flee their homes. That is the equivalent of the entire population of north-east England.
The death toll among these displaced people is high and it would be higher by far if it were not for the humanitarian efforts on the ground.
But even humanitarian workers cannot operate on a battlefield and unless there is a lessening of hostilities in Darfur it can be expected that more of them will be evacuated.
The entire fragile, overstretched humanitarian effort in Darfur could very easily collapse, precipitating hunger and disease in the camps and a rocketing death toll.
That is why the stabilising influence of an international peace force is so urgently required.
It is also necessary in order to provide calmer conditions in which a political process can get under way, involving all parties and including local low-key intercommunity dialogue as well as high-level, high-profile political negotiation.
(PT) It is certainly significant and worrying that the German Presidency is not here today to represent the Council.
This says a great deal about levels of genuine interest and commitment in the new relationship with Africa and in working for development in Africa.
Three years ago, I was in Darfur with other MEPs who have spoken or who are about to speak.
Since then, the situation has worsened, as Mr Almunia said.
The Al-Bashir Government is toying with the international community, with the Security Council, with the European Union and with the African Union, and the EU makes fine statements and does nothing.
The time has come for the EU to take action and to exercise its responsibility to protect people.
The time has come to impose a no-fly-zone from Chad.
The EU can do this, alongside African countries with which it enjoys good relations, and can have an effect on the ground.
The time has come, among other things, to impose smart, phased sanctions, travel bans, visa restrictions, and the freezing of assets in banks and elsewhere, and to stop treating Omar Al-Bashir and the members of his government as responsible, respectable leaders.
The time has come to impose an effective arms embargo.
The time has come to impose other kinds of trade embargo and in particular an oil embargo and on this issue, Mr President, the EU must speak frankly with China, because China as we know is very much responsible for the Al-Bashir Government's attitude.
It is a pity that Europe waits for the United States, as Mr Almunia suggested, albeit in a roundabout way, because the EU should take action independently on this issue.
Let us take a look at what is happening not just in Darfur but throughout Sudan and the Horn of Africa.
The EU cannot be dependent on the worldview and disastrous policies of the US in respect of the Horn of Africa, as we have seen in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia.
The time has come for the EU to take action and I align myself with those MEPs who are calling on the Council and the President of the Commission to ensure that the EU does not wait any longer, and exerts the influence it actually has in Khartoum and in Africa to change the situation and to protect the people dying in Darfur.
Otherwise, three years hence I along with other MEPs will be joining Mr Almunia or some other Commissioner in bemoaning the fact that the situation has become worse and worse.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission shares the main concerns that you have expressed in this debate tonight.
We find the initiative of this debate particularly useful, given the situation and in particular given the latest developments in the region.
In our view, even with this extremely difficult situation, a negotiated way out of the crisis in Darfur is the most desirable alternative and the option most likely to be successful.
That being said, the Council already stated last Monday that it is ready to consider further measures, notably in the UN framework.
A lasting peace is Darfur can only be political and will require all parties to support the Darfur Peace Agreement and renounce the military option.
The Commission remains strongly committed to alleviating the plight of the three million civilian people affected by this terrible crisis.
As you all know, the Commission, and in particular my colleague Louis Michel - who cannot be here today because he is in Washington, discussing, among other things, this particular issue - is following the situation very closely and the Commission will not hesitate to call on all parties to respect human rights and international law as well as to remove all obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian aid.
To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for resolutionspursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) We are proud that the very fact that, as Europeans, we are compelled to condemn manifest evil in whichever part of our world it may affect human beings.
What is happening in Darfur is a manifest evil.
Accordingly, we are bound to express our opposition to those who perpetrate such evils.
Is it enough for us to simply express views that stem from a moral imperative and then rest in the knowledge of a job well done?
Obviously not.
We cannot rest as long as people continue to suffer.
We can only rest when we have put a stop to the evil.
Therefore, we are not entitled to rest simply because we have right on our side, but only when effective action has been taken.
We shall only be able to rest and be content when our words and actions have put a stop to the activities of those who kill, supply weapons and ideology, as well as those who permit, incite and inflict cruelty.
We will only be able to walk with our heads held high when our vision of a moral order becomes reality.
A person who did not commit a sin simply because he or she was not tempted to do so cannot be accused of sinning.
By the same token, one cannot praise a person who could have taken action to stem evil, but who was content to simply point it out.
We do not lack information about Darfur.
We do not lack experience or an ethical and political assessment of events.
What we are lack is effectiveness and, therefore, that is what we should focus on.
in writing. - (FR) Ever since the hostilities were launched in February 2003, Darfur, one of the poorest regions in Sudan, has been the scene of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
There have been four years of conflict and suffering for the people of Darfur, and four resolutions by our Parliament to show our indignation, but the situation remains extremely worrying.
Today, our Parliament is reiterating its concerns within the context of a joint resolution on Darfur and is urging the United Nations, the Member States, the Council and the Commission to assume their responsibilities and to clearly set a date for the deployment of a peacekeeping force, under UN control, with the aim of immediately making the humanitarian corridors more secure and of thus easing the immense distress faced by the people of Darfur.
I welcome this new initiative, but faced with the urgency of the situation, Europe can no longer just reiterate old requests.
Our responsibility and our credibility require us to provide a satisfactory solution to the suffering of millions of human victims whom Europe can no longer merely observe, and to adopt a resolution that finally matches our indignation.
Darfur has been a running sore for far too long.
A situation partly driven by climate change - what does that bode for the future - whereby desertification has driven pastoralists into direct conflict with settled farming communities and then exploited by a heartless Government in Sudan has gone on for far too long.
Hundreds of thousands are living in misery and threatened with worse.
I have been critical of China's reluctance to support UN action, it was claimed because of its oil interests in southern Sudan.
But now President Hu Jintao's direct intervention appears to have persuaded Sudan's President to agree a UN peacekeeping operation manned by troops from AU countries.
Whether Sudan's Government can be trusted is not clear.
But now, if China is betrayed, Sudan will no longer be able to rely on their reluctance to act in the UN Secretary Council.
This may be good news for refugees in Darfur and neighbouring countries.
Illegal fishing (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the implementation of the EU action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, illegal fishing is a trend that is developing extensively today and seriously harming the activities of European fisheries, local fishing communities and fisheries in developing countries, not least in those with which the European Community has concluded fishing agreements.
It is also an activity that, I am afraid to say, is extremely lucrative.
I would cite the example of bluefin tuna, particularly in the Mediterranean, specimens of which are sold at absolutely astronomical prices.
We therefore find ourselves in a vicious circle, which leads to the gradual, though accelerated, depletion of fishery resources.
Legal fisheries - those that comply with the regulations - are, for their part, very heavily penalised by these illegal activities, which can, in fact, be defined in fairly broad terms.
We are talking about illegal, unregulated, undeclared fishing.
That therefore relates to many activities: pirate fishing, the use of unauthorised fishing gear, the catching of unauthorised species, unlicensed fishing and the policy of transferring cargo at sea from one boat to another.
The scope of the illegal activities is extremely broad.
What, then, is the purpose of this own-initiative report?
In 2002, the FAO launched an international action plan against illegal fishing, which was subsequently replaced by a European Union action plan, which was adopted by the Council in 2002. The plan was unfortunately implemented in a variety of ways, at different levels, by the Member States.
At this very moment, the European Commission is working on evaluating the Member States' action plans on the fight against illegal fishing ahead of the meeting of the FAO - the FAO's Committee on Fisheries - which will be held in the first week of March, in Rome, and which will be an opportunity to re-launch the international action plan against illegal fishing.
The European Union has a huge responsibility in this area.
Why?
Firstly, because the European Union is ranked third in the world in terms of fishing activities, after China and Peru.
It has one of the world's largest fleets.
Moreover, it largely resorts to using flags of convenience, which cause a huge number of problems, not only for fishing, but also for maritime transport.
Finally, the EU is also one of the world's largest markets in fish.
The responsibilities are therefore many.
The Commission's response to us is that this whole business is complex, many parties come into play, nothing can be done by working alone, it is expensive, one cannot ask some Member States to comply with a number of rules and not ask the others to do the same, and so on. The pretexts and excuses for the lacklustre results are legion and, sadly, there have not been enough initiatives to fight effectively against this activity of illegal fishing which, once again, has developed at an extremely serious rate over the last few years.
The responsibilities are as much those of the port States, as they are called, as they are of the flag States or the States in which fishery products are marketed.
There are in fact many levels: that of the regional fisheries organisations, that of the Member States, the European level; it is at all these levels that action must be taken, across the board, with the involvement of the Directorate-General for Fisheries and the Directorate-General for the Environment, the Directorate-General for Development and the Directorate-General for Trade.
Hard work is therefore what is required here, but only action on the part of all these administrations and these political officials will prove truly effective.
What are the key measures in my report, which, I might add, has been unanimously adopted within the Committee on Fisheries, showing that this is indeed a concern shared by all of our Member States?
There is the traceability of fishery products and the introduction of blacklists, that is to say, of lists of boats that are not authorised to fish or that have already been punished for illegal fishing activities.
We should condemn today the lack of coordination and cooperation between the various sources of information regarding these boats, which are authorised or unauthorised to fish.
Among the important measures, I should also mention those that consist in preventing illegal fishing products from being landed and marketed on the European market, and then, finally, the actions to be carried out in the field of European and international law.
There are, in fact, legal vacuums today that prevent the crews of vessels carrying out illegal fishing activities from being challenged and punished.
To conclude, it is absolutely vital that we have a more integrated European policy, in terms both of control and monitoring and of penalties.
It is from this global perspective that the report outlines a number of initiatives and proposes a number of measures that we are discussing here, with a view to the FAO meeting, in March, within the context of which it is crucial for us to appear far more proactive and far more dynamic.
Member of the Commission. (ES) I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Aubert and all of the members of the Committee on Fisheries for their involvement in this truly exhaustive report on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
This initiative from Parliament comes at a time when the Commission is committed to a public consultation on the review and strengthening of the current European Community policy on tackling this kind of fishing.
I am particularly pleased to note Parliament's commitment on an issue which is of crucial importance to achieving the sustainable management of fisheries resources inside and outside of Community waters.
First of all, I am pleased that the report stresses that the fight against illegal fishing must begin in our waters and also involve our vessels.
Community waters are regulated, but that does not mean that illegal practices do not take place within them.
The report also acknowledges another extremely important aspect, namely how to prevent fisheries products from third countries that have been caught illegally from entering the Community.
As the main market and importer of fisheries products from all parts of the world, the Community has a special responsibility in terms of guaranteeing that products that end up on the tables of European consumers do not originate from illegal activities.
This means that a new approach must be taken with a view to properly controlling the legality of fisheries products imported into Community territory.
Another aspect that must be stressed is the need, indicated in the report, to create more synergies in order to improve the supervision, control and monitoring of fisheries activities.
Illegal operators usually employ clandestine and international methods in order to disguise their activities.
The success of investigation into these activities depends on cooperation amongst the different services involved in maritime monitoring at international level and also at Community level.
I cannot comment on all of the points of the report here, but I would like to stress, for example, the call for greater consistency in the sanctions imposed by the Member States for serious violations of fisheries laws, and the need to resolve the main problems caused by public fishing flags.
These points demonstrate that Parliament and the Commission are on the same wavelength in terms of priorities for future actions.
The Commission has not been inactive over recent years.
The European Community has made considerable progress since the adoption in 2002 of its action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
This progress can essentially be seen in the Community's activities, at international level, aimed at promoting measures to combat illegal fishing in all of the bodies competent in the field of fisheries and maritime law.
Nevertheless, the most significant progress in the fight against illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing has related to the regional fisheries organisations, the majority of which, thanks to the Community's efforts, have now adopted a wide range of measures against illegal fishing.
The Community has also improved the policy of assistance for coastal developing countries, which are the main victims of the kind of fishing we are debating today.
Strengthening those countries' capacity to adequately control the fisheries activities in their waters has been funded from the European Union's budget, thanks to an association agreement in the field of fisheries, both at national level and at regional level, on the model of the recently agreed regional plan for fisheries surveillance in the South-West Indian Ocean.
At Community level, the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002 also promoted the policy to combat illegal fishing through the adoption of provisions in the field of controlling compliance with Community rules and the creation of the Fisheries Control Agency.
However, despite the significant progress made in the fight against illegal fishing, it has still not been eradicated by any means, and it is still one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable management of fisheries resources and marine biodiversity.
Almost five years after the adoption of the 2002 action plan, therefore, the Commission believes that the time has come to draw up a new strategy to tackle this kind of fishing.
Within this context, the Commission has decided that this year illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing will be one of the main priorities of the common fisheries policy and of maritime policy.
The Commission will draw up proposals in this regard and present them to the Member States and to this Parliament during the second half of this year.
The report that we are debating today is a particularly timely contribution to the work on which the Commission will base its proposals.
Ladies and gentlemen, over recent years illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has been the subject of numerous debates and discussions and the time has now come for us to act at European level.
The report by Mrs Aubert and the Committee on Fisheries represents an extremely significant and encouraging step in that direction.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Aubert for her report, which reminds us of the problem of piracy at sea and the poor record in terms of what has been done to combat it.
I would also like to thank her for supporting the amendments that I believe have clarified her report, establishing the boundaries between unrecorded and unregulated illegal fishing and violations of the common agricultural policy in Community waters.
This is an important aspect because, although we need to put an end to both, completely different weapons are required for each.
One of the most important weapons is action by regional fisheries organisations, which are perhaps currently the only possible defence against illegal actions at sea in a battle which is, by definition, international and multilateral, and whose role has also been re-assessed as a result of the amendments presented.
At a time of such concern about the sustainability of the marine environment and when our own fishermen are gradually being denied access to resources, it is extremely worrying that we are even having to witness certain Member States taking steps backwards, including one that I know well.
And it is depressing that, last Tuesday, the Director for External Policies of the Directorate-General for Fisheries should have had to admit that the European Union had failed to slow down illegal fisheries.
And all at a time like this.
It was in Galicia last week that the fishing authorities of eighteen Member States began to debate the package of measures to combat illegal fishing, which will apparently not be presented to us before the middle of the year, according to the Commissioner.
With regard to this issue, the ball is more than ever in the Council's court, because, without genuine political will on the part of the Member States, without their firm commitment to harmonising actions, making them obligatory and making them a priority, things will carry on the same next year and the year after.
I hope that that does not happen and that we will have an effective policy soon.
Thank you very much, Mr President, and allow me to protest once again about the fact that a fisheries debate is taking place at night and that even a new report being newly included on the agenda is being put before it.
I would like to make a serious protest on behalf of my group and on my own behalf about the way fisheries is treated in this Parliament.
Your protest will be recorded.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Aubert on this report and on the way in which she has dealt with the numerous amendments that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament tabled.
The FAO has calculated that up to 30% of fish landed comes from illegal fishing.
The EU has signed up to the FAO's international action plan and in 2003 the Commission tabled proposals to transpose this action plan into the European acquis.
The Committee on Fisheries drew up this own-initiative report in preparation for the international forum on illegal fishing set to take place in Rome at the beginning of March, and in order that the Commission take account, in its new action plan, of Parliament's opinion.
Numerous amendments tabled by my group will be included and I believe that thanks to those amendments, we have achieved a better definition of illegal fishing.
Furthermore, we have included issues such as increased monitoring and the need for greater cooperation at international level.
Furthermore, although this is not so much a question of implementing tighter measures but rather of improving the implementation of existing measures, there is certainly a need for an effective control and inspection system within a common legal framework across the EU and if possible under the auspices of the Community Fisheries Control Agency based in Vigo.
Our amendments call for entry to European ports to be barred to vessels involved in illegal fishing, for Member States not to register such vessels, for Member States to discourage their nationals from flying flags of convenience, and for importers, transporters and other sectors concerned not to tranship or deal with fish caught by those vessels.
We also call for cooperation between the Member States to step up control of vessels.
We are aware that it is difficult to differentiate between legal and illegal catches, in particular when what is landed is not fresh fish but frozen or processed and where there are commercial networks with third countries and the fish has been processed before it reaches the European market.
Efforts are therefore required to identify the origin of fish, because millions of people around the world depend on fisheries resources and we must guarantee the availability of those resources for future generations.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President. I want to begin by complimenting Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Aubert on the quality of her report.
Her explanatory statement contains an excellent analysis of the problem and of the extent of progress made in relation to the EU Action Plan of 2002.
It makes ten very clear recommendations for a new Action Plan to start in 2007.
Five of these recommendations involve internal measures and five involve cooperation with other countries, both directly and through the medium of regional fisheries management organisations.
Central to the issue of combating IUU fishing are improvements in traceability, both of vessels and of the fish that they catch or transport.
This includes, amongst other things, insisting on the use of FAO identification standards for EU vessels and those entering EU ports, and on the development of proper catch documentation schemes.
But it also means better exchange of information between the parties concerned, so that blacklists of both fishing and fish transport vessels can be disseminated and the possibility of converting to a white list through reflagging can be avoided.
The establishment of blacklists is, however, only effective if there are serious consequences for the vessels concerned.
That is why we urge the Commission to take very seriously the recommendation in paragraph 18 of the resolution that consideration be given to extending the import controls relating to health and hygiene to cover the products of IUU fishing as well.
For this reason, the revival of the inter-services consultation group is particularly welcome.
Of course, there are many other steps that could be taken, which is why we are asking for the fight against illegal fishing to be one of the priorities of the annual work programme of the Community Fisheries Control Agency.
In this context too, we must be sure that our own house is fully in order, which is why we repeat Parliament's previous requests for common minimum penalties for serious infringements to be made applicable across all the Member States.
Equal treatment is a major factor in encouraging compliance.
The importance of assisting developing countries to monitor fishing activities in their own waters must also be stressed.
There is an additional responsibility in this regard where we have concluded fisheries partnership agreements with them.
The inclusion of IUU fishing in the Commission's work programme for this year is very welcome, but we need a clear timetable in this regard.
It is good to hear that the Commission will be presenting something to Parliament in the second half of the year, but we hope that it will be sooner rather than later, and comprehensive in its coverage.
Madam President, I too would like to thank Mrs Aubert and to commend her on her outstanding report, which I endorse.
Not only does illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing endanger biodiversity and the environment, leading to costs that in many cases may be impossible to recoup completely, but it also represents - as previous speakers have mentioned - a significant cost for many societies that currently live from fishing and that hope future generations can do likewise.
In this regard, I feel that the EU has a twofold responsibility.
First and foremost, it must set an example to the world and demonstrate by deed and in particular by willingness, that the fight against illegal fishing is one of its priorities.
Secondly, it must take the lead on the world stage in the fight against illegal fishing, which involves using existing EU mechanisms - be it via fishing agreements or via cooperation with third countries - and always to include some clauses leading to the prioritisation of this issue.
At the same time, however, given that one of the key problems in detecting and combating illegal fishing is - as previous speakers have also mentioned - the issues of traceability and of fisheries control is vital inasmuch as it is often impossible to know whether illegal fishing has taken place.
Mechanisms must therefore be established to enhance traceability.
To this end, I also wish to say that in December, this Chamber adopted a resolution on eco-labelling.
Many of the proposals in this resolution would help the fight against illegal fishing by means of much-needed traceability mechanisms.
I too welcome the report's call for the Commission to present its eco-labelling proposal by June.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) I too would like to congratulate Mrs Aubert on her report.
Large-scale illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significantly contributed to the difficulties with which the fisheries sector has to contend.
Large-scale illegal fishing damages marine ecosystems, increases the cost of fishing, and reduces the incomes of people who fish legally and who comply with the rules on preserving fisheries resources.
Large-scale illegal fishing, as the report says, undermines the incomes of communities who depend on fishing in different countries, and those least equipped to monitor their exclusive economic zones are the hardest hit.
Large-scale illegal fishing also contributes to the deterioration of on-board working conditions and hygiene, and undermines the labour rights of crews.
Accordingly, we feel that illegal fishing, which generates significant illicit profits for large-scale fleets working for the large economic and financial groups involved in fishing and even for organised crime networks, should not be confused with infringements of the common fisheries policy by parts of the small-scale traditional fleet, often committed because of the economic crisis that they face.
It is worrying that, despite the 2002 Food and Agriculture Organisation plan, which was rapidly transposed into the Community acquis and then implemented, large-scale illegal fishing continues to increase owing to loopholes or imprecision in the existing rules.
The fight against large-scale illegal fishing is hampered by the use of flags of convenience, by the lack of monitoring at sea, by transhipping on the high seas, by the lack of control at ports and by the lack of cooperation and coordination between the relevant authorities.
Given that illegal fishing has its biggest impact on those parts of the fleet operating on the high seas and on the continental shelf, especially in the least developed countries, cooperation among the Member States and among international fishing organisations is vital if this kind of fishing is to be combated.
To this end the necessary resources must be obtained, including financial resources for implementing the measures needed, such as the effective monitoring of fishing activities.
The strengthening of deterrents should be accompanied by enhanced traceability of fisheries products, as has been highlighted by previous speakers, with eco-labelling also worth mentioning in this regard.
Equally important, as the report states, is to intensify port state control of landings and transhipments from third country vessels.
We believe that the existing measures already cover the main issues and that what they lack is more rigorous and fairer implementation and greater international-level coordination.
This is not, therefore, simply a matter of creating more measures and more restrictive measures for the fisheries sector, especially if their impact or their unilateral nature has the perverse effect of benefiting the vessels operating illegally to an even greater extent.
Third country vessels operating in the exclusive economic zones of the Member States must be subject to the rules of the common fisheries policy and to existing national requirements.
Naturally, it is always possible to improve the rules in force and to plug any gaps.
In this regard, we feel that this report, which in spite of one or two reservations we generally support, makes a valuable contribution to the issue.
We feel, however, that it is, at the very least, premature to include combating illegal fishing in the framework of a future maritime policy for the Union, which we have only just begun to debate as part of the Green Paper put forward by the Commission.
We accept the idea of greater international and EU-level cooperation and coordination, but we must avoid situations that may lead to centralisation and must safeguard the Member States' exclusive monitoring powers, as it is the Member States that best know each of their exclusive economic zones.
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to protect all operators who carry out their activities within the context of sound fisheries management based on best practice and safeguarding the marine environment.
It is vitally important to clamp down on illegal fishing through surveillance and control measures, accompanied by sanctions for serious violations of Community legislation.
To combat illegal fishing, however, we cannot confine ourselves to repressive actions, but we must also promote strong preventive action through structural measures.
To this end, the report on which we are going to vote - for which I thank Mrs Aubert - very effectively identifies a number of strategic actions, from the promotion of commercial regulation measures that will make it possible to identify the origin of fish caught, to the proposal on eco-labelling, which would keep illegally caught fish off the European market, and to the study on tariffs and rules of origin.
These measures are essential to reduce, if not eliminate, illegal fishing by Community fishing boats in Community waters and to prevent the landing and marketing of fish caught illegally outside EU waters.
Equally significant is the call for a study on compliance with Community labour and health and safety legislation, on respect for the social rights of workers and on their living and working conditions on board.
Improving full traceability of fish all along the chain of custody, from net to plate, preventing the depletion of fish stocks and degradation of the environment, and enhancing the quality of life and work for the communities that depend on fishing for their livelihoods are forms of prevention and dissuasion that will make it possible to curb illegal fishing by structural means and make the Community fisheries sector the best in the world.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Morillon, of course we must all congratulate our rapporteur on her outstanding report.
We must also begin by noting that the situation as it stands is absolutely unacceptable.
It is unacceptable that the amount of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing of bluefin tuna, which is the species that has been the subject of most analysis in this connection, is 50% greater than the amount fished legally.
This has led to the total depletion of stocks, to the collapse of the value at which fish is sold and in turn to the ruin of the fishermen.
This is a situation that the Community cannot continue to tolerate.
Of all the measures put forward here as a means of addressing the problem, I should like to highlight traceability as a vital prerequisite to success.
This is the measure that we must ensure is adopted in the very short term and if it is tightly enforced I am sure that we will see a very different situation soon.
Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for this report, which continues the efforts of this Parliament to address the problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
The European Union's 2002 Action Plan to deal with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing includes four actions to be implemented at Community level.
One of these is to define the responsibility of Member States to prevent their nationals from engaging in IUU fishing.
Indeed, the related Council Regulation of 2002 requires Member States to take action against nationals that infringe the common fisheries policy.
We seem to be very efficient in tracking and taking action against our own fishermen for any transgression of European law, while we seem at the same time to have been rather less efficient at dealing with the much bigger problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
The problem of overfishing and illegal fishing is international.
It goes beyond the European Union waters, and yet the fishermen that I represent can with some justice complain that the Commission sometimes cannot see beyond our own waters.
There is clearly a lot still to be achieved to deal with this problem and I welcome the practical proposals such as the suggestion that vessels bringing fish into the European Union should be subject to the same documentation delivery requirement as vessels operating within the European Union.
Likewise I welcome the suggestion that the Commission should engage with developing countries to give them assistance in dealing with IUU fishing.
I understand that one of the vehicles for achieving this is through the various bilateral fisheries agreements with developing countries.
However, I would like to be sure that this represents a joined-up approach to the problem and that it is not merely ad hoc.
I note that some countries have not been cooperative.
Surely if we are making bilateral fisheries agreements with a country, we can force a higher degree of cooperation from them.
Otherwise cynics might suggest that we are more interested in getting the fish than stopping illegal fishing.
Madam President, many of our debates regarding fisheries have been centred around sustainability and the importance of finding the right equilibrium between the protection of the marine environment, the protection of fish stock and the viability of the activity.
Regulations have been set up and fishermen are obliged to abide by these regulations so that an optimum standard is achieved, a standard that would be beneficial to everyone.
These regulations have been based on specific statistics gathered from our seas and standards have been set on this information.
However, I feel that, unless we tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing with an iron fist, we would be doing a disservice to honest fishermen and restricting their activity to the benefit of others acting illegally.
The line between legal and illicit fishing is sometimes very fine and we need to have a clear-cut definition in this regard in order to avoid misunderstanding.
We need an effective control system and a management programme that will be more coherent and specific so as to apply the existing regulations with more accuracy.
We must also try to negotiate with our neighbouring states in order to adopt the same policies so that we would have a one-sea, one-policy system, which undoubtedly would be beneficial to all.
In order to do this, we must be willing to share our technology with these countries and encourage new partnership agreements.
Further to this, cooperation between us, the Member States, has to be strengthened.
Proof of the legal origin of fish catches should be compulsory before any content is offloaded in the EU.
This should include documents that show that fish have been caught in accordance with RFMO rules.
This will be a very important stepping stone in ensuring that our fishermen get the right dues, and that, furthermore, our seas are protected from overfishing.
When stocks were plentiful, we would often turn a blind eye to unregulated activity.
Now, I think, is the time to act before it is too late.
No regulation and no law will ever be effective or have any meaning if overfishing renders our seas barren.
(SV) Madam President, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am responsible for the subject of cod fishing in the Baltic Sea.
In my work on this matter, I have been able to observe that, despite reduced fishing quotas, parts of the cod stock are close to the biologically critical limit.
The threats to cod are many, but, despite everything, the greatest threat is illegal fishing.
As a basis for my report, I tried to get hold of the Commission's assessment of the extent of illegal fishing around the Baltic.
The information was kept secret, however, and it took me months to extract it.
Yesterday, I got hold of the report, however, and I now suddenly understand what all the secretiveness was about.
Illegal fishing in the Baltic is worse than we had all imagined.
I can only regret that Sweden is among the worst culprits.
The Commission states, however, that Poland is the worst culprit of all.
When the inspectors checked up on fishing in Poland, the actual figures were 48% larger than the catches reported.
This means, then, that something approaching a third of Polish fishing proves to be illegal.
The second worst culprit was Sweden.
In Sweden, the actual figures found when the checks were carried out were as much as 21% larger than the catches reported.
That is quite incomprehensible, because Swedish fishermen do not even fulfil their quotas.
The conclusion that I draw from the report I read is that we must find a new strategy.
We cannot pin our hopes on endless negotiations about reductions in fishing quotas.
The environmental movement should get around to withdrawing its demands for an end to fishing.
All those of us who would safeguard fishing in seas such as the Baltic should instead unite in the fight to stop illegal fishing.
I should therefore like to demand four things from the Commission.
Firstly, instead of protecting the culprits and keeping their identities secret, you should expose them by publishing the names of those countries that do not put an end to illegal fishing.
Secondly, you should ensure that electronic logbooks are required without delay for all fishing boats in the Baltic, irrespective of their size.
Thirdly, you should take Poland to court for breaching the fishing regulations; and fourthly you should immediately set up an inquiry into the possibility of introducing individual transferable fishing quotas that give individual professional fishermen an interest of their own in protecting fish stocks.
I would therefore ask today, in this House, if the Commission is prepared to do these things.
(EL) Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Aubert, on her report on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
The question we are debating here today is of particular interest if account is taken of the repercussions which it has both on the marine environment and on legal fishing.
Illegal fishing is one of the most fundamental reasons for the collapse of many fish stocks.
In reality it undermines all our efforts to exploit fishery resources rationally and to protect the marine environment.
Apart from the environmental impact, it also has adverse economic repercussions because it distorts competition between fishermen and affects the viability of those acting in accordance with the legislation enacted.
However, I shall also examine this issue from the point of view of the human factor: often illegal fishing has repercussions on the safety of crews, given that they only have minimal guarantees in respect of the terms of employment and safety of human life at sea.
Illegal fishing means illegal and uncontrolled employment.
As you know, this is not a new phenomenon.
However, the increased demand for fisheries products, in conjunction with a reduction in available resources has caused a burgeoning of this phenomenon, especially by vessels sailing under flags of convenience.
The report by Mrs Aubert covers the most important aspects of the problem which need to be examined, such as:
firstly, the responsibilities of the state under whose flag the vessel is sailing;
secondly, the responsibilities of the state in which the fish are landed;
thirdly, the responsibilities of the productive classes involved in transporting and marketing fisheries products until they reach the consumer.
I believe that more measures need to be taken to control and stamp out illegal fishing, both at European level and at the level of regional fisheries organisations.
We must act.
We must protect the environment, legal fishermen, consumers and the legal order.
We need to be decisive and strict.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon tomorrow.
Free movement of Roma within the EU borders (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the free movement of Roma within the EU borders.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Two weeks ago saw the start of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
Equal opportunities and the right to live without discrimination are among the key values on which the EU is based.
The Commission is well aware of the fact that the Roma are among the groups most at risk of discrimination and of being excluded from the labour market, from society, from involvement in drawing up policy and from cultural life.
Consequently, the Commission has undertaken to use all the instruments at its disposal to address the issue of the exclusion of the Roma minority.
I should like to mention two of these: firstly, the implementation of the 2000 Directive, which provides protection against discrimination on racial and ethnic grounds.
The Commission wishes to ensure that this Directive be incorporated into the legislation and to be implemented properly in all Member States.
Secondly, I wish to mention the use of financial instruments, specifically the Structural Funds and, most importantly, the European Social Fund.
The Commission has asked the Member States to incorporate the objective of including the Roma community when it draws up its operational plans for the financial perspective 2007-2013.
Major effort is required to increase awareness among the Roma and among the population as a whole of the right to live without discrimination and to enjoy the benefits of diversity.
In this regard, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and the ongoing information campaign entitled 'For Diversity, Against Discrimination' are, in our view, extremely useful instruments.
The Commission welcomes the achievements made so far during the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 in which nine governments from Central and Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans, including five EU Member States, are currently taking part.
For the first time, the national governments of these countries made a commitment to learn from each other and to exchange strategies on how to improve life for the Roma minority in areas such as employment, education, housing and healthcare.
The Commission welcomes the fact that all of this is taking place in close cooperation with the Roma community.
We also need policies geared toward the future.
The high level group for the social and labour market integration of ethnic minorities set up by the Commission is paying special attention to issues relating to the Roma community.
The group will publish its recommendations at the end of the year, which we are sure will provide extremely valuable information for future European policy on the inclusion of ethnic minorities, including the Roma.
Lastly, Madam President, I should like to point out that the Commissioners' Group on Fundamental Rights will deal with all of these issues in their meeting scheduled for July this year.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) We know that following enlargement in 2004, many Roma tried to come to Europe - Western Europe.
We also know that the actual figures were not very high, but they did call attention to the terrible and hopeless situation in which the Roma find themselves.
We knew that the Roma were not desirable guests in Europe.
Unsure already how to deal with Roma migration, most host countries responded by tightening their procedures for requesting asylum, which compelled many Roma to return to their home countries.
Since they had sold all their possessions, they returned to much worse circumstances than those they had left behind.
We also know that because of the exaggerated, hysterical and untrue statements of the media, the situation gave rise to fundamental fears in Western European countries.
The situation even spurred many countries to try to prevent further enlargement.
We now also know that this atypical tendency to migration among European Roma is in fact caused by the segregation in schools, the enormous unemployment rate, very strong prejudice, and limited access to health care services which they suffer in their home countries.
We also know that the Roma would like to live and thrive in their home countries.
In spite of the enormous sums of PHARE money, the ghettoisation, segregation, exclusion and anti-Roma feeling has continued to grow since enlargement, and in Western Europe as well.
The European Union has a great responsibility and interest in promoting the integration of the Roma.
Beyond ensuring the financial framework, the task of the European Commission must include promotion and monitoring as well.
Every instrument for influencing Member States must be used, and a European strategy needs to be developed.
We would like to see a Green Paper, and sanctions against countries that do not follow the Directives aimed at ending segregation, and those concerning employment, equal opportunities, and the equality of opportunity.
This should be done so that Europe and the home countries may make the most of Roma prosperity, especially in light of the foreseeable European demographic indicators, at a time when we are talking about a greying Europe.
The Roma are basically seeking to thrive in these countries, and do not wish to leave their countries behind.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, such is the way this place is organised, somehow I have more speaking time than Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka, which is hardly appropriate.
I agree with everything she has said and the reason for that is that the speakers here present feel united in asking the Commission exactly what free movement of the Roma within the EU borders actually means.
Our understanding is that such now is the level of discrimination - not only actual discrimination against the homogenous Roma population but also infringements on their ability to move, i.e. infringements on the ability of long-term-resident Roma in particular countries to move freely in reality.
This can be because of actual restrictions, for example through visas and actual practical restrictions, and it can also mean, as Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka was implying, restrictions through discrimination: when Roma move traditionally through countries and from one country to another they face discrimination.
What I would like to hear from the Commission in its statement is exactly what is its understanding of these infringements and restrictions.
What study has it undertaken of what these infringements are and what does it think it can do to ease these restrictions for the Roma community?
In addition, what is the Commission saying about the Year of Equal Opportunities 2007?
I have heard very little about the issue of the Roma within this context.
I have heard plenty on the issue of ageing, disability, race and religion. But specifically on the issue of the Roma, what is the programme of the Commission?
I know it is slightly unfair to ask you that, Mr Almunia.
It is not your area of expertise, so please do not think that I am getting at you.
However, please tell the Commissioners that we have not heard specifics.
Please take that message back.
What are you going to do this year?
What is the High Level Experts Group doing in terms of free movement?
What is in its pending tray on the Roma issue, i.e. actual discrimination issues, harassment issues?
How is money being spent?
Is it going to relieve poverty?
Is it going to educational programmes?
Those are all things that Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka, Mrs MohÃ¡csi and others have been struggling and fighting for for some time.
The PSE Group fully supports their approach in asking the Commission for answers, and I think this evening is a good time to get those answers.
If you cannot give them, Mr Almunia, please transmit this urgent message to your Commissioner colleagues, because it is about time we got some specific answers to these questions.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) First of all, I would like to clarify the following: the background to my remarks is not the desire to question the right to free movement by Europeans, and hence of the Roma, nor do we or I wish to request any extra rights for these people, for this minority group.
My original aim was that the European Union should examine how it might document - something that my fellow Member Mr Moraes has also mentioned - the number of forced migrants, those people who are forced to leave their homes because they are subject to ongoing discrimination.
The Commissioner mentioned that it is not enough for a country to take action against discrimination, but the EU Member State in question must also ensure that there is integration.
I think we have not yet reached this stage, nor even the stage where we might be able to monitor discrimination in each and every Member State, or to take appropriate steps against it.
In April 2005, Parliament adopted a resolution of which the first sentence states that there is discrimination against the Roma within the Member States of the European Union.
We do not know how many leave their homes because they are subject to ongoing discrimination and hope that their lives may be less troubled in a Western European country.
Next week, we will have the second opportunity, when the Hungarian court will hear the case involving children who have been placed in special schools without any justification.
Although they are of sound mind, they are compelled to attend educational institutions established for those with developmental handicaps.
I have personally taken on the cases of 12 such children because Hungarian special schools are generally full of Roma children, who make up at least 70% of the special student population in Hungary, and unfortunately there are not very many Member States where these figures show any striking difference.
A few months ago, several hundred Hungarian Roma sought asylum from the Swedish state, which naturally - as far as I know - rejected their request.
I do not know how many of those families have children who suffer discrimination in a similar situation.
This much is certain, if something like this were to happen to my children, I would seek asylum in another country.
The struggle to eliminate discrimination and to guarantee human rights within the frontiers of our Member States is our common responsibility.
We have the ability to take steps against discrimination, and we must do so.
Since 2000 we have spent EUR 750 million within the territory of the EU on the integration of the Roma, yet the proportion who are unemployed and the proportion of children declared to be developmentally handicapped have increased.
The time has come now for the European Commission, taking seriously the work it has done to date, to develop a strategy which - as my colleague Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka has also mentioned - will be able to put an end to discrimination and to call to account those countries that are lagging behind in terms of legislation.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I will start with a question.
When will the EU finally take seriously the situation of its largest minority?
Fifteen million people in Europe remain excluded from basic human rights, such as the right to education, employment or physical integrity, merely because they are Roma, or gypsies as most people still call them.
One month ago two more countries joined the EU.
The treatment given to Roma in these countries is far from fulfilling EU norms.
As we know from the latest report of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the situation is not better in many of the old Member States.
If we talk about the migration of Roma, most of us call to mind pictures of poor, hunger-ridden people who come to disturb us in our comfortable existence, rather than remembering that they have rights.
In 1999, under the Finnish Presidency, the EU adopted a recommendation to the Member States that specific attention should be given to the situation of minorities, in particular those who have no home country, meaning the Roma.
The Commission has spent tens of thousands of euros for the improvement of the situation of Roma without developing a clear strategy and targeted approach, following the model of other intergovernmental organisations.
Under these circumstances migration often becomes the last resort for Roma.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia recently gave us some worrying data that show that acts of racism and xenophobia against minorities are on the increase in Europe.
The Roma, who form the largest ethnic minority in the European Union, are particularly targeted.
A great deal of discrimination occurs in relation to work and the right to education, and the Roma often live in conditions of poverty, marginalised from society.
Sometimes discrimination comes from the very institutions that ought to safeguard people's rights.
In a recent case in Slovenia, an entire group that had been living in that country for many years was removed from the area where it had been living for so long.
I believe that we need to encourage the Roma to take part in social and political life, but for that to happen the Member States must first recognise them as an ethnic and linguistic minority.
It would be necessary to get rid of the campsite system in favour of types of housing that would facilitate integration, thus eliminating any form of segregation.
The Roma have inherited a centuries-old culture, and I believe that we should have great respect for nomadic cultures.
We owe to them the birth of what we call Western civilisation, which arose in Mesopotamia, now Iraq and under military occupation, inappropriately stirring up a war of civilisations.
We are in debt to the Roma, even though, in my view, civilised Europe has often mistreated and discriminated against them.
We must therefore support their social inclusion and freedom of movement.
That is why I join my other fellow Members in calling on the Commission to take a more proactive stance - although I realise that Mr Almunia will probably not be able to give us any exhaustive answers since this is not his area of expertise - but we believe that the Commission ought to be moving faster on these issues.
Madam President, the EU Race Directive is insufficiently effective in combating the multiple discrimination faced by Roma people.
Speaking personally - and not reflecting necessarily the view of my group, which I have not consulted - I have come round to the view, like the Network of Independent Experts in Fundamental Rights, that we need a legislative instrument specifically aimed at protecting and promoting the equality of the Roma community.
I do not say that lightly, because normally I am not keen on specific measures, but my understanding is that the European Commission is not keen on this idea, and in the absence of such a focused and targeted instrument, I think all we will ever do is talk.
The European Roma Rights Centre and the European Network against Racism pointed out recently, in a joint paper, that forced evictions, housing in extremely substandard conditions, denial of basic social and economic rights and school segregation are often instigated or condoned by local or regional government, and central governments have been ineffective in challenging them.
Early this evening I had a question to the Council about the position of Roma people, and the response from the Presidency was essentially that, while anti-discrimination laws were an EU responsibility, social inclusion was a matter for national governments - a question of subsidiarity.
Faced with that attitude, how will the Commission promote an effective pan-European programme of inclusion and equality of opportunity?
Madam President, I was hoping to get an answer from the Commissioner, but I see he is not scheduled to speak.
On the website he was scheduled to reply to the debate, but here he is not.
Are we getting a reply or not?
The Commissioner has indicated that he does not wish to reply, but I am sure that, in the light of the strong statements that have been made tonight, he will take a message back to his colleagues.
The debate is closed.

Shareholders' voting rights (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies - C6-0003/2006 -
(FR) Before we begin this debate, I should just like to say that I know there are no rules governing the order in which MEPs speak.
That being said, I should like to draw the Chamber's attention to a slightly odd situation whereby the rapporteur devoted all of his floor time to answer all of the speakers that had the floor, by way of a conclusion.
When the issue at hand is a legislative text, those speaking on behalf of groups do so, according to our well-established practice, in an order commensurate with the political weight of their group and not at the end of the debate.
It is for the Commission, which is well represented here, to respond.
I am astonished by what has gone on here today. If this is a new, innovative practice, then it should be explained to us.
The agenda has been drawn up with the agreement of the political groups and we must respect it.
These are issues we can look at when we examine our work.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, due to the late addition of this item to the agenda, my colleague Mr McCreevy is unable to be here today and I shall present his considerations.
I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, in particular, the two rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mr Klinz for their excellent work on this file.
The compromise package that is now on the table contains very effective solutions to the problems that we have identified, without imposing excessive burdens.
These problems, which led the Commission to submit its proposal, were in principle very simple: at the moment shareholders do not receive information on general meetings in time, they face restrictions on trading their shares for a certain time period ahead of the meeting if they want to vote and they often have to go in person to general meetings, even if those meetings take place in another Member State, as there are no effective rules on representation and distant voting.
Together with Parliament and the Council, we managed to find simple solutions to these simple problems.
However, we cannot stop there.
In particular, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs pointed out, in its opinion of November 2006, other issues that need to be addressed if we want to make the general meeting work efficiently and if we want to further improve the corporate governance of European companies.
We have already identified stock lending as something we should look at more closely in the context of the future Commission recommendation on shareholders' rights.
We agree that another important issue here is to clarify the role and the duties of financial intermediaries.
In today's financial world, investors depend heavily on intermediaries to provide them with information and voting services if they want to exercise their voting rights.
This point has also been stressed by delegations in the Council.
The Commission has already undertaken to examine this question thoroughly in the impact assessment to the future Commission recommendation.
I think all the parties involved agree that this issue is too important to address without having examined all available opinions and without having carried out a full assessment of the possible consequences.
You might ask why we are considering using only a recommendation in order to tackle these problems.
The reason is that the practical processes that are relevant in this context are constantly developing, also due to the constantly improving technology.
We do not want to set the current situation in stone, but wish to leave enough flexibility for adjustments.
The Commission recommendation will give us this flexibility.
My colleague Mr McCreevy therefore confirmed last month, in a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, our intention to address this issue, together with others, in the context of the work on the recommendation.
I hope you share our view that this is the right way to render the provisions of the draft directive even more effective in practice.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Almunia has already said, this is an extremely important project. It is concerned with deepening the European internal market, and one aspect of this is giving owners the opportunity to exercise their rights across borders in this internal market.
The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted this important project unanimously.
We have come to an agreement with the Council whereby, if this House follows the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs in plenary, the Council will do likewise, and thus we shall be able to achieve a result here at a single reading pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003.
The first crucial issue with which this Directive is concerned is that of the representation of shareholders at general meetings; that is, the exercise of voting rights not by the shareholders themselves but by intermediaries - representatives - or by means of proxy voting.
There are widely differing rules for this in the EU, some of them highly restrictive.
The compromise reached in the end makes representation possible in principle, but subject to a transparent procedure, and also gives the Member States the opportunity of prohibiting representation by national law in the event of conflicts of interest.
A second important area is the issue of the right to ask questions.
The problem here is that the traditions and, in particular, related legal consequences, rights of challenge and similar points vary greatly between Member States.
The scale ranges from Member States where questions can be asked but do not need to be answered, to Member States where questions have to be answered correctly and, if they are not, resolutions adopted at general meetings can be declared null and void.
A compromise has been reached on this that lays down the right of shareholders - owners - to ask questions in principle, but does enable Member States to make sensible adjustments and also limited restrictions to the right to ask questions in accordance with their own legal traditions, without calling this right into question in principle.
As Commissioner Almunia mentioned, a number of issues could not be resolved definitively with this Directive. This is partly owing to legal systems.
An example is the legal relationship between shareholder and representative.
Indeed, this has no place in a Directive concerned with company law, as matters such as this belong in contract law, which is why the Council and Parliament subsequently agreed to deal with it in a separate recommendation, a separate legal act.
The same goes for the subject of the languages used.
In this regard, the co-rapporteur Mr Klinz from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs had made the - undoubtedly constructive - suggestion of providing for similar rules to those in the Transparency Directive.
Here, too, however, we later decided - following the negotiations - that, in systematic terms, it would be better to regulate this within the framework of a recommendation than in this specific text.
Consequently, this issue, too, will have to be resolved in the separate legal act.
All in all, I should say that, from my point of view, we have managed to solve the multitude of problems that existed when we started dealing with this Directive.
It is true that they have not all been solved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, there is no question about that - this is normal when one has to reach compromises.
Ultimately, however, they have been solved in a way that enabled the solution to obtain unanimous support in both the Council and the Committee on Legal Affairs.
I should like to express the warmest of thanks to my co-rapporteur, Mr Klinz, to the shadow rapporteurs from the two committees concerned - but particularly to Mr Medina from the Committee on Legal Affairs, with whom I enjoyed close cooperation - to the two Chairs, Mr Gargani and Mrs BerÃšs, to the Austrian, Finnish and German Presidencies, which contributed significantly to the success of this project, and last but not least to the European Commission, whose help with overcoming the problems was very useful.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cross-border share ownership is on the increase, but attendance at general meetings across borders remains unsatisfactory.
That is what this Directive sets out to change and improve.
The objective is welcomed and shared by all parties, and so I had reckoned with relatively simple, short negotiations as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - but reality taught me otherwise.
Thanks to the peculiarities of the bodies of company and civil law of the 27 Member States, and also cultural differences - some of them major - the negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council were protracted and difficult and ultimately produced only minimum harmonisation.
Nevertheless, there has been some very tangible progress, as Mr Lehne has already said.
Share blocking is to be abolished, cross-border proxy voting liberalised and electronic means permitted.
These measures will undoubtedly make it easier in future for those with cross-border share ownership to cast their vote at general meetings.
Agreement has yet to be reached on a solution to some key problems, however, which the Commissioner has also mentioned.
I particularly regret the removal from the Directive of the definition of the shareholder and the role of intermediaries in cross-border depository chains.
The issues of stock lending, the language to be used and the special position of investment funds have also been left out.
These are fields where minimum harmonisation is particularly necessary if we are to really establish a genuine European share culture.
Nevertheless, I am pleased that the Commission intends to address and take up this subject specifically in the form of a recommendation.
The provisions agreed give the Member States broad scope for action, and so we shall probably have to live with different rules - some of them substantially so - in the individual Member States for many years to come.
I hope that the approach of minimum harmonisation that has been chosen does not risk diluting the whole project.
Only experience over the next few years will show whether attendance at general meetings actually increases perceptibly and thus the main objective of the Directive can be achieved.
That would certainly be of great benefit in terms of corporate governance.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I would firstly like to say that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is going to vote in favour of the proposal by Mr Lehne, as amended in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Secondly, while I am pleased that Commissioner Almunia is with us, I believe that this would have been a good opportunity to hold a personal exchange of views with Commissioner McCreevy, because, as has been highlighted in previous speeches, there are questions about the limitations of this proposal for a directive.
It is a minimal proposal for a directive, about which there are a series of question marks. For example, with regard to the issue of financial intermediaries, the legitimate rights of shareholders and the use of proxy, that is, the right to vote by means of a representative.
The text that Mr Almunia has read to us on behalf of Mr McCreevy talks about a future Commission recommendation.
The problem with recommendations is that they raise difficulties from the point of view of Community law.
Mr Lehne has said that we are talking about provisions of the Treaties, but at the moment we in the European Parliament are concerned about the over-use of the systems of so-called 'soft' law by the Community institutions, which raises questions about the reliability of the Law.
I have the feeling that this issue will have to be discussed.
I hope that, at meetings with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner McCreevy will clarify his ideas a little so that we can ascertain what we can do in order to reassure ourselves that progress is going to be made in a particular direction.
We Socialists are rather concerned about the protection of the rights of shareholders.
We are concerned about the possibility that, in a great European Union market, financial operators will act with total impunity and freedom, and I have the sense that this is an important issue for everybody, for investors and for savers, which should be subject to full consideration and discussion between Parliament and the Commission.
We will therefore vote in favour, but I would say once again that I hope Mr McCreevy can discuss the methods for making future changes in the legal field with us.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Lehne for all his work on a matter that is so important for the future of European integration and the growth of the single internal market.
At present, citizens of several Member States of the European Union who hold shares in companies quoted on the stock exchange, and whose registered office is located in another Member State, experience significant difficulties in exercising their voting rights.
As the process of European integration gathers momentum and the internal market grows, the amount of cross-border capital investment is increasing, which is a good sign.
It suggests that integrated financial markets are becoming established in Europe.
This process should be encouraged, which is why the Commission recommendation on the directive deserves our support today.
The document under debate contains many important proposals devised to make it easier for shareholders to exercise their rights.
I should perhaps mention the need to ensure that sufficient notice is given when convening all general meetings.
It is also important to ensure that interested parties have easy access to information announcing meetings and the results of votes taken in them.
Providing for proxy voting is another important issue, along with measures to make it easier for intermediaries to act for shareholders.
These are the kinds of solutions that will make it possible to restrict certain types of share blocking.
Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur for his report.
There are many essential elements concerning this report which we can all get behind, particularly in protecting the rights of shareholders and making the process transparent.
It is nice to hear the transparency directive mentioned - which I worked on before.
However, from a legal point of view its treatment is slightly different from the approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where strong opinion found in favour of certain key issues, in particular necessary distinctions required in dealing with intermediaries and stock lending when, in particular, shares were repatriated in order to allow for owners to vote.
The timing is vital and we are surprised, therefore, that Amendment 26 to Article 7 does nothing but confuse the situation.
What happens to these shares - are they to be deposited?
Transferred?
Registered?
What?
There seems to be nothing there which allows for specific requirements.
There are no specific requirements or references to them concerning the sale of transferred shares.
Might this not lead to certain further confusion?
There are also amendments from the ECON Committee which I have to say have been subject to what I deem the 'recital effect' by the Committee on Legal Affairs and to the 'letter effect' by Commissioner McCreevy, who suggested that later developments on these issues should be expected.
Let us be frank.
Nobody likes to be told that their amendments are reducible or that they can be ignored.
The ECON Committee is an equal player and its remit allows it to be so.
I can only say that the process has been unsatisfactory in that regard, which is partly the reason for this debate today.
I hope we can come back to these issues in the ECON Committee with the Commissioner to repair some of these problems mentioned in our ECON opinion.
Madam President, it is clear that our political group and particularly the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are pretty critical about the procedure.
I will not repeat what others have already said on this, but what I would like to stress here is that if as a parliament we have codecision rights on a dossier, we should take every opportunity to really assess what comes out of informal negotiations with the Council and Commission in a codecision procedure which is likely to go to a first reading agreement.
This is why we were a little upset that this dossier is already being dealt with in this sitting rather than in March as had been planned.
We would then have been able to discuss an oral question with Commissioner McCreevy about 'one share, one vote'.
I hope that we will still have this opportunity and that the Committee on Legal Affairs will also support us in having this further debate with Commissioner McCreevy.
On the content, the essential difference between a recommendation and a legislative text is precisely this codecision.
A letter from Commissioner McCreevy to Mr Gargani, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, announces that some of the issues we were concerned about will be dealt with in a recommendation.
The last line says, 'You will be informed about this one as a parliament'.
This is the exact point we are making.
We would like to be co-legislators on that type of issue as well.
This is the reason why we are not really happy that some of these issues could not be taken up in the agreement with the Council.
Maybe if we had had more time we could have also convinced the Council that this kind of issue, which is of major concern, could have been included in the first reading, second reading or conciliation agreements.
These are my comments on what happened today.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the Commission's initiative was what we were looking for, but the way in which the Commission set its objectives needed correction.
I believe that the work which we began in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and which, following many discussions, culminated in the agreement before us today, was worthwhile on two counts, first and foremost on the definition of the term shareholder, which, in the form proposed by the Commission, was too broad.
This led us to embark on a definition of securities law that was very close to the practice in force on the other side of the Atlantic, which does not correspond to our traditional notion of what is a shareholder.
I feel that a narrower, tighter definition, such as we are proposing today, is the right way forward.
The second point on which we have been led to amend the Commission's proposal is the issue of the process of reattaching voting mandates.
On this issue, too, I feel that, thanks to the work undertaken in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with our rapporteur, whom I wish to thank, we were able to emphasise the existence of compulsory instructions in the event of a mandate: an obligation to observe and retain these instructions.
To this end, I feel that in addition to the question of cross-border rights for shareholders in this report, the Commission would be better off looking equally closely at what is important in terms of employee share ownership or the stability of shareholders in certain industrial situations regarding which, from a European perspective, we would favour a coherent strategy.
I should like, if I may, to take this opportunity to ask you again, Commissioner, about the Commission's position on the Hague Convention.
This issue forms an integral part of this debate.
Parliament asked you to withdraw the Commission's signature under the Convention, and the debates in the Council have clearly not moved on very far.
I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to talk to Mr McCreevy again and to tell him that this House wants the Commission to rethink its position on this issue and to withdraw the European Union's signature from this Convention.
(DE) Madam President, I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to and supported this very difficult project.
Not everything has been resolved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, but that is inevitable with such a difficult compromise.
Nevertheless, we have taken a significant step towards making it easier for European shareholders to exercise their ownership rights.
In Europe, there are no large strides towards our ultimate goal, but only accumulations of small steps - and the issue of shareholders' rights is no exception.
I wish to conclude on this note, express my thanks and forgo the remainder of my speaking time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.

- After the vote on the motion for a resolution:
(NL) Mr President, you were actually going a little fast for me.
I would like to find out from the Commission whether it accepts the amendment that has been tabled.
As an exception, the Commission may take the floor again.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I think that the Commission is prepared to do all it can to consult throughout 2007/2008 year on the new guidelines for 2008 and 2010.
Whether this necessarily requires a minimum of five months or not, given Parliament's internal procedures, is not for the Commission to say.
(NL) Mr President, since it now transpires that the Commission is still uncertain as to how much time it is prepared to give Parliament, I would, given that we have not yet reached the final vote, like to ask you to refer the report back to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which will make some more consultation with the Commission possible.
It is usually up to the rapporteur to make such a request.
What is his position on this?
rapporteur. - (SV) No, I shall not arrange for the proposal to be referred back.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten should know that the economic guidelines cannot be adopted by the Council until Parliament has expressed its opinion.
That is the actual rule.
The Commission, and above all the Council, must take account of Parliament's points of view.
That is the case where the employment policy guidelines are concerned.
The economic guidelines are more of a problem because there is no such regulation in this area.

External dimension of the fight against terrorism (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, we are going to vote on a report on the external dimension of the fight against international terrorism on the day on which the trial relating to the biggest attack in the history of Europe begins in Madrid.
Four direct victims of that attack are with us today in the gallery, Mr President. JesÃºs RamÃ­rez Castanedo, who was seriously wounded in the attack; JesÃºs Abril Escusa, who lost his 19-year-old son; Isabel Casanova Ortega, who lost her 22-year-old son together with her father; and Euclides Antonio RÃ­o Grajales, who was seriously wounded in the attack.
For this two-fold reason, I would be grateful if this House could acknowledge them.
(The House rose and applauded the victims)
We should like to express our deepest sympathy with the victims, and we shall do everything possible within the rule of law to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice.
We stand in solidarity with the victims and their families.
We remember with profound compassion those who lost their lives.
(Applause)
- Before the vote on Amendment 19:
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose that after Amendment 19 we insert the text of this oral amendment, which I believe also has the agreement of the rapporteur: 'in view of the recent discoveries of extremely dangerous terrorist organisations in Italy and France'.

That concludes voting time.
Mr President, on a point of order, at the beginning of voting time we voted on two Esteves reports: the first on readmission, without a roll-call vote, and the second on short-stay visas, with a roll-call vote.
However, you announced the same title both times: 'the report on readmission'.
As a result, there was some confusion in the vote by the Verts/ALE Group.
I would like to ask the Secretariat and the President to check our vote.
Our group's position was in favour of the report on short-stay visas and against the report on readmission.
I am afraid that the whole group has voted otherwise because of the mistake made in the announcement of the title of the report.
Please take this into account.
If this was the case, Mrs Åœdanoka, it will be noted.
We shall look into it and make the appropriate note in the Minutes.

The next item is voting time.

Colleagues, you always insist that we start the vote on time, but it is in your hands!
Please settle down and take your seats.
Explanations of vote
I should like to take the opportunity of the vote on this report on the voting rights of shareholders, which is unfortunately taking place without prior debate, to draw the Chamber's attention to the Eurotunnel scandal, the utter daylight robbery backed by French governments, be they socialist or liberal, that has been going on for years.
800 000 small shareholders, still accounting for some 90% of the company's capital, believed the promises of the tunnel's designers, of the public authorities, the bankers and the manufacturers and invested some EUR 4.5 billion in the company.
They are now ruined, and will be damaged even further by a 'rescue' plan, which consists of selling the company to non-European shareholders at basement rates and reimbursing its creditors, which have already earned EUR 8.5 billion in interest.
This plan was drawn up without consulting the shareholders and has been imposed on them by the Paris Tribunal De Commerce (Court of Arbitration in Business Matters).
The only choice open to them is to respond or not to a takeover bid, which will keep them forever sidelined when it comes to capital and, by extension, to business decisions, at the very moment when the business is becoming extremely profitable.
This is a shameful episode, and the silence of the French authorities is scandalous.
All of this serves to dissuade people from investing in the economy, thereby leaving it to the mercy of the large, stateless, financial groups.
in writing. I voted for this report as budget support is a great tool for partnership with developing countries, allowing them to take ownership of the use of development funds.
But funds must be used in the right way and there is a need to guard against misuse of funds and I am glad that this report suggests clearly identified criteria.
in writing. - (FR) Fifty years!
Almost fifty years during which several European countries have made great efforts in the area of development aid and north-south cooperation.
Half a century, with mixed results.
Why?
For several reasons.
One reason is the lack of appropriate development strategies on the part of the countries receiving aid.
This is why I voted in favour of the report on budgetary aid for developing countries, that is to say, aid directly managed by the government of the benefiting country.
In this way, it is that government that will assume responsibility for its own development, following dialogue with the Union and the drafting of a strategy.

I am well aware that this instrument is a controversial one, especially when it is to be used in fragile countries with unstable economies, and of course when the countries concerned are undemocratic or corrupt.
It cannot therefore be used everywhere.
The success of budgetary support, however, is about breaking the vicious circle.
The conditions leave no room for doubt: no budgetary support without observing standards of governance and without fighting corruption; no budgetary support without measures aimed at cleaning up the economy.
The more points a government scores for good governance, the more aid it receives.
This is about creating a virtuous circle.
(ES) I would like to refer to the Community plan to eradicate illegal fishing, which, at international level, takes place above all in the waters of developing countries, which are too poor and lack the resources required to control fishing activities in the areas under their jurisdiction.
The fact that this illegal fishing cannot be prevented leads to losses and poverty for their coastal populations that depend on fishing for a living and for a secure source of food.
At the same time, these illegal practices lead to direct losses for legitimate fisheries operators as well.
In this regard, I would like to stress once again that one of the virtues of the association agreements in the fisheries sector between the European Union and other countries is that Community deep-sea fishing fleets have accepted the code of conduct for responsible fishing, promoted by the United Nations, and that their presence in those waters also means that other illegal vessels do not act with such impunity.
Therefore, being in favour of renewing all the fisheries agreements with third countries, since they offer significant mutual benefits for both parties, I have voted in favour of the plan to eradicate illegal fishing, because it poses a serious threat to the biological balance of the oceans, and that represents a great environmental risk that we cannot afford.
I voted in favour of the action plan against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, as this is a major problem around the world, causing considerable environmental degradation, contributing to the depletion of commercial and non-commercial fish stocks and other species and resulting in difficulties for communities dependent on fishing for their livelihoods in both developing and developed countries.
Furthermore, it constitutes unfair competition for those fishers and commercial players who abide by the rules laid down in law.
in writing.
I voted in favour of this report, which recommends several measures to tackle illegal fishing, such as urging the Commission to help developing countries, above all those with which it has fishing agreements, to comply fully with the commitments of the above international plan of action designed to prevent illegal fishing.
In particular I support the call for the Commission to carry out and submit a study on compliance with Community labour, health and safety legislation and on respect for the social rights of workers on this type of vessel, and on their living and working conditions on board.
The EU has on several occasions declared its willingness to develop and deepen relations with its neighbours.
One of the essential prerequisites for improving bilateral relations is to facilitate the legal movement of people.
At this point, I should like to point out that the Russian Federation proposed to the EU the bilateral lifting of visa requirements.
Following the rejection of that offer, an agreement was reached in complicated negotiations covering short-stay visas for citizens of the Russian Federation and the Community, except for citizens of three of the EU Member States.
This is something of a pilot agreement because negotiations are ongoing on a similar agreement with the Balkan countries, Ukraine, Morocco and China.
The agreement contains a number of positive points, such as visas to be provided free of charge for holders of diplomatic passports, multiple visas, timeframes for issuing visas and fees for visas.
Naturally, this agreement is a long way short of visa-free relations, and the quick and problem-free issuance of visas free of charge.
Some comments made in the debate in this Chamber indicate that there are a number of MEPs with vested interests in the issue.
Attempts are being made, on the one hand, to revive the corpse of the European Constitution and, on the other hand, to use the agreement to interfere in Russia's internal affairs.
These attempts were mostly repelled and were not included in the visa agreement.
We therefore support it in the belief that this is the first step on the road to visa-free relations with one of the EU's key partners.
in writing. The GUE/NGL Group welcomes all Agreements that promote bilateral travel arrangements between the EU and the Russian Federation.
These facilitate the travelling of Russian citizens to the EU and vice versa.
Moreover, such arrangements are considered to be an important step forward, aiming at establishing better communication ties and creating political dialogue on a cultural, economical and political level.
However the GUE/NGL Group is very much concerned about the EC-Russia Short-stay Visa Agreement because of its close political link to the EC-Russia readmission agreement, which seriously undermines the protection and rights of refugees and immigrants, as well as their fundamental rights.
The GUE/NGL Group is also strongly opposed to Article 11 of the joint declaration to the agreement which defines "biometric identifiers" in diplomatic passports as a priority for ensuring a high level of document security.
GUE/NGL is also opposed to the fact that certain provisions of the Agreement apply exclusively to certain categories or groups of people.
This is considered discriminatory and the GUE/NGL Group stresses that the facilitation procedure for access visas should apply and be guaranteed equally to all citizens of the EU Member States and citizens of the Russian Federation.
in writing. - (PT) We naturally welcome the bilateral agreements between the EU and the Russian Federation aimed at facilitating and promoting the movement of Russian citizens to the various countries of the EU and vice versa.
These agreements represent a stepping stone towards establishing closer cultural, social and economic ties, which would meet the legitimate aspirations of thousands and thousands of people for procedures that would effectively facilitate contact between family members living in the Russian Federation and in EU Member States.
That being said, this agreement contains obligations that we find unacceptable, for example Article 11 of the Joint Declaration, which states that the requirement of 'biometric identifiers' on diplomatic passports is a priority in order to ensure high levels of security.
We also object to the fact that some provisions in the agreement apply exclusively to certain 'categories' or 'groups' of people, as we feel that the process of facilitating the issuance of visas should apply and should be guaranteed to all citizens of EU countries and the Russian Federation.
The readmission agreement with Russia is one of the important documents through which the Commission is attempting to regulate immigration.
It actually forms part of the debate on the issues of democracy, equal rights, minority rights and the protection of cultural identity.
The issue goes beyond relations with Russia and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The key issue for EU Member States is mass immigration from Africa, Turkey, countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC), Indochina, China and Latin America.
The agreement with Russia should be a kind of model agreement, on the basis of which the Commission will clarify progress in the European economic area, and at the same time will gauge the extent to which it can interfere in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries.
Russia is a large and powerful partner on which the EU is dependent up to a point, and because of this the agreement avoids making criticisms under the heading of 'respect for the basic rights of the persons involved'.
It is only through the issues raised in the explanatory statement from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that we see an attempt to use the readmission agreement to interfere in Russia's internal affairs.
This trend is so disturbing that there is no way that I can support the agreement.
It runs counter to the security and humanitarian aspects of the agreement.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs is mostly interested, oddly enough, in 'the absence of a regulatory framework for implementing the agreement'.
I welcome the call for the Commission to help Russian institutions implement the agreement.
On the other hand, I object to the obfuscation of the concept of safe third countries.
I share the view that the agreement on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas and the readmission agreement between the European Community and Russia should help strengthen mutual relations and create a joint European area based on shared values and common interests.
I should like to remind the House that Russia was the first subject of the so-called joint strategy presented to the European Council in 1999.
Even at that time it was clearly stated that Russia should be firmly anchored in Europe and that Russia must not be viewed merely as a threat or as an inferior or troublesome partner.
Taking account of both this overview and of current events in Europe and around the world, I cannot accept the idea put forward in the report on the readmission agreement that relations between the EU and Russia are going through a critical phase and that the new partnership and cooperation agreement after 2007 will depend on the perceived human rights situation in Russia.
Russia is not a superpower which wages wars and tramples human rights underfoot across every continent.
Those who criticise human rights abuses wherever they occur, and not only in Russia, should first ensure that they themselves strictly uphold human rights.
The fact that this is not the case is evidenced by the situation of the Russian non-citizens living in the Baltic States.
in writing. - (FR) This resolution adopts the Commission's proposal concerning the Council's decision, which heaps praise on the Lisbon Strategy and asserts that unemployment has gone down in Europe.
The Lisbon Strategy, even in its revamped form, will remain a symbol of shallow populism and inefficiency, given that the Member States subject to the Brussels guidelines are having difficulty in toeing the pro-European line and fail on growth, employment and modernising their social security systems.
This reduction in unemployment, according to the Commission's positive assessment, is a delusion masking the reality of the figures.
This is very much a case of a 'Potemkin Village', because, in France alone, many poor people and people in insecure employment, not to mention the unemployed on training courses and many members of the active workforce who have been given early retirement, have been skilfully excluded from the statistics.
Lastly, the procedural amendment proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, wisely calling for Parliament to be given the necessary time to fulfil its consultative role on these social issues, demonstrates our institution's powerlessness in the face of pro-European absolutism.
The Employment Guidelines in the European Union, which were jointly drafted and decided both by the New Democracy government and the previous PASOK government within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, inextricably link employment policy to the core objective of maximising the plutocracy's profits, the necessary prerequisite to which is huge intensification of the exploitation of the working classes.
The pronouncements by the ÎU about allegedly reducing unemployment and so forth are aimed at deceiving the workers, given that it itself admits the failure of its policies, finding that the overall rate of employment was 63% in 2003, which is much lower than the agreed objective of 70%, despite the apportionment of unemployment with temporary and flexible forms of employment, which accounted for 60% of new jobs between 2000 and 2005.
The future being prepared by the ÎU for the workers on the basis of the axes of its policy is a future of 'de-employment' in which, even from preschool age, they will acquire fragmentary, opportunistic skills and training, drift from one form of semi-employment to another, with half or no employment, social, insurance or pension rights, travelling the length and breadth of their country and the EU in search of work, being constantly retrained to the requirements of capital with disposable knowledge, working into old age or until death producing incredible wealth which will be reaped and appropriated by the plutocracy.
in writing. - (SK) I have voted for this very important - though not legally binding - report by Katerina Batzeli, which is both consistent and well-balanced, presenting numerous essential suggestions from MEPs deeply knowledgeable of local traditions and customs in their regions.
Following the uproar caused by the Commission communication on a sustainable European wine industry, and in particular the decision to eradicate 400 000 ha of vineyards, it was necessary for the European Parliament to present its views of future reform of the wine sector in this report.
What is vital, in my opinion, is to preserve the budget of the Community, and not to shift any funds from the first to the second pillar of the common agricultural policy, which is devoted to rural development, as this might lead to resources being lost to the wine industry.
On the other hand, it is necessary to support the market position of wine and the wine industry by establishing a realistic advertising, communications and marketing policy based on joint organisation of the market.
I firmly believe that the Commission can devise efficient draft legislation only by making proper provision for the proposals from the European Parliament aimed at preserving the leading position worldwide of quality wines produced by the European wine industry, which is still a significant source of employment and prosperity in quite a few European regions, including Slovakia.
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on reforming the common market organisation for wine, because I believe it contains many positive proposals.
As this report was worked on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it was very obvious that the committee was divided into two camps. One comprised of the countries of northern and central Europe, and the other included southern European countries.
Nonetheless, I am sure everyone agrees that action must be taken to balance the situation on the market.
I also believe that the possibility of using sugar beet to enrich wine in wine-growing region A must be retained.
Failure to do so would amount to discrimination against the countries located in parts of the Union where the climate makes wine growing more difficult.
Those regions have never produced surpluses and should be exempt from the ban on certain plantings, which is aimed at limiting production.
In addition, I feel that the resources allocated to the emergency distillation of wine surpluses should be limited.
The additional wine alcohol produced in this way distorts the market in ethyl alcohol and is a burden on the Union's budget.
in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have voted against the report on the common organisation of the market in wine.
The report is characterised by a high degree of protectionism that might hamper economic development in both the EU and developing countries.
The report also contains a number of wordings to the effect that the wine sector should be encouraged with the help of subsidies for the production and marketing of wine.
For us, supporting this is unthinkable in terms both of public health and of the consequences it would have for the EU's budget.
A number of amendments deleting certain wordings in the report have been tabled by the xenophobic Integrity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group.
We Social Democrats have chosen to vote against the ITS Group's amendments.
We think it unacceptable to support this group.
We believe that we have rejected the report by voting against it in its entirety.
Wine, for those who have been making it for centuries, is not just a beverage like any other to be marketed solely with a view to profit: it is a choice based on history, culture, respect and a quest for quality - often a quest for excellence.
Italy, the number one wine exporter in the world, has made high quality its banner, together with respect for consumers and the traditions of wine-making.
This report is schizophrenic: on the one hand it talks about promoting quality, while on the other it comes down in favour of enrichment with sugar; on the one hand it talks about protecting geographical designations, while on the other it opens the door to new wine-making practices, such as wine with shavings.
The European Commission has, in any case, often taken a similar line; for years it has preferred brutal liberalisation and large-scale distribution, at the expense of quality, tradition and the protection of consumers and producers.
Just to give an example, I would like to point to Regulation (EC) No 316/2004 which liberalised 17 traditional designations, in reality opening up the market to wine-making piracy.
For all these reasons, while I voted in favour of the report, I would like to express great concern for the future of the high quality of the wine-making sector, particularly the Italian sector.
in writing. - (FR) I must congratulate Mrs Batzeli on her work in this field, of which the economic, social, environmental, territorial and cultural ramifications are enormous.
I feel that her own-initiative report is a well-balanced and ambitious one, which will enable Parliament to influence the major guidelines of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine drawn up by the Commission.
The European winemaking sector is in a difficult situation, facing fierce competition from wine from the New World. It should be highlighted, however, that the EU remains the biggest producer, the biggest consumer and the biggest exporter of wine in the world.
I strongly object to the Commission's first proposals, which would place production in the hands of a few major winemaking operations and would lead to a standardisation of wine and to crises in numerous European regions.
Permanent grubbing up would lead to the abandonment of production in the areas most cut off and in most difficulty, where there is no alternative form of production, and would serve to speed up the process of desertification.
We must respect the European winemaking tradition, the quality and authenticity of European wines and their ties with the soil.
It is not by adopting the corrective oenological practices used in other continents that we will become more competitive, but by favouring commercial investment and improving the promotion of our products.
in writing. - (FR) This report has gone completely against the Commission's proposals on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine and has made that organisation more respectful of the European wine tradition.
Speaking as a Socialist MEP, I feel that this report has struck the right balance in terms of the need to reform the sector and the interests of European winemakers.
Firstly, I welcome the implementation of structural measures aimed at restoring the balance of the market.
From now on, the cleaning up of the market will entail the gradual elimination of distillation arrangements and a targeted approach to grubbing up according to qualitative, geographical and environmental criteria.
Secondly, I welcome the implementation of regulatory measures on oenological practices, labelling - in order to meet the demand for transparency for the consumers - and the promotion of European wine in order to penetrate new markets around the world.
Lastly, as I am keen to protect traditional wine production in the face of wine subject to very little regulation, I welcome the ban on must imports.
I voted in favour of this report as I feel that reform of the winemaking sector must safeguard the specific characteristics of European wines, including Portuguese wines, the quality of which should be appreciated.
Given that the EU is the world's biggest producer and consumer of wine and that the sector accounts for 60% of the EU's exports, I feel that there should be far-reaching reform of the current common organisation of the market in wine, which would help consolidate traditional markets and develop expanding markets.
The EU wine sector needs policies that lead to the strengthening, improvement and promotion of the competitiveness of European wine on an increasingly demanding international stage.
I come from a country, Portugal, and more specifically from a region, Madeira, in which the wine sector plays a highly significant economic role.
Although I acknowledge the need for far-reaching and ambitious reform of the common organisation of the market in wine, in order to modernise it and to adapt it to the development of the Community market and to the pressure of international competition, some of the solutions put forward by the Commission in its Communication of 22 June 2006 - especially that of permanent abandonment - do not resolve the problem of surplus production and do not address the challenge of competitiveness that European winemaking faces on the world market.
Rather, they threaten European (quality) winemaking potential, hamper the sustainability of the Community winemaking sector and damage the stability of winemakers.
As Mrs Batzeli, whom I congratulate, says in her report, 'the issue of permanent abandonment of wine-growing must not be the centrepiece of the CMO reform'.
The report contains a sensible analysis of the Commission's proposals and presents a range of most timely suggestions.
I therefore voted in favour.
We are very disappointed that the various proposals that we tabled were rejected.
This led us to vote against the final report, although we agree with, and voted for, a number of the rapporteur's proposals.
We are dismayed that the main measure proposed in the Commission communication for regulating supply and demand in the winemaking sector is the grubbing up of 400 000 hectares of vine, which will reduce production and jobs will be lost.
This will in turn serve to exacerbate the desertification of vast areas, as has already happened in Portugal, and to place the wine and alcohol sector into the hands of a few major producers and large companies.
These are measures aimed at reducing the EU's vineyards, which would affect primarily the least developed regions, family holdings and farmers on low incomes, but they will have little impact on the rise in imports and the declining role of winemaking in the EU Member States.
We shall continue to defend our proposals and to combat the Commission's proposal to liberalise the sector.
What we are proposing is a different type of reform of the common organisation of the market in wine that values sustainable winemaking, the traditional characteristics of winemaking, small and medium-sized farming and family farming, the sector's social and cultural role, and its important contribution towards regional and national development.
in writing. - (FR) I wish to ask the Commission the following questions:
Assuming that there has been surplus wine production since the 1970s, following 20 years of under-production, which at world level is unclear, why, then, import 12 million hectolitres every year from countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina?
If, on the pretext of surplus production, my region of Languedoc-Roussillon has to carry out a programme of grubbing up, why import 12 million hectolitres - the exact equivalent of 15 million hectolitres produced in Languedoc-Roussillon - from countries outside the EU?
If there is surplus production, why does Brussels want to authorise must imports from third countries, in order to make flat-pack 'Ikea wines'?
If there is surplus production, why seek to authorise the US practice of adding 7% of water to wine?
Why seek to grub up vineyards on our territory when Chile, Australia and the vineyards of the 33rd parallel are planting?
'When China has drunk too much', who will give it wine to drink if we grub up vineyards?
Of the 400 000 hectares, or 4 billion m2, that have been grubbed up, does the Commission not envisage planting 4 million villas with a real estate value of EUR 100 billion?
The Commission proposal on the CMO for wine jeopardises the protection of European wine production.
The provision that it makes for the grubbing-up of vines is liable to affect entire areas devoted to this production and also to irremediably damage the growing of indigenous vines which, while not very widespread, nonetheless represent centuries-old history and traditions.
The constant increase in wine production and quality in the so-called 'New World' countries (South Africa, Australia and South America, where vines are, by contrast, being planted), the increasing presence of these wines on the European market and the fact that worldwide demand for wine is on the increase make the idea of grubbing-up all the more incomprehensible.
Europe needs to be able to compete with its competitors on equal terms.
With a view to optimising European wine production and wine-making, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that underlines the need to maintain the ban in Europe on using the new wine-making practices for ageing wine (such as the use of oak shavings instead of the traditional period spent in the barrel).
in writing. This report, whilst it had many good points, could have potentially affected UK wine production in the south-east in a disastrous manner.
The 'fructose' practice, whereby sugar is added to UK and other northern European wines, would have been banned if amendments urging this would have been passed and accepted by the House and the Commission.
This is a blatant attack from inside the wine-producing industry and should be forever rejected for future reports in this area.
in writing. (SV) The present report addresses a very important and topical issue, but its approach is quite wrong.
The European Parliament is again trying to boost its own importance, this time using the increase in terrorism and its victims as arguments.
The report is full of wordings involving small but nonetheless worrying steps in the direction of an EU state with a common foreign and security policy.
It also encroaches on countries' internal affairs, in certain cases in opposition to the Member States' fundamental laws.
We also note that it has the audacity to refer to a Constitution that has been rejected in referendums in Europe.
One of the most serious wordings concerns the desire to abolish the unanimity rule in as important an issue as police cooperation and cooperation on criminal law.
That is completely unacceptable.
We have consequently voted against the report, including most of the amendments tabled, and this in accordance with the mandate we have from our voters.
in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the majority of this report, particularly in underlining the vital role of respect for human rights and rule of law, the importance of upholding internationally-agreed values, the need to strengthen coordination of intelligence between Member States and the importance of examining the conditions that feed terrorism.
However, it is premature to link ESDP operations with counter terrorism, and the cost of any such ESDP operation would have to come from the CFSP budget not the EU budget, as stated.
In addition, abrogation of unanimity on police and judicial cooperation is not appropriate for this report as it is a much wider issue and is part of the broader 'Passerelle' argument.
in writing. I voted for this report as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must be the basis of the fight against terrorism.
I support a multiple approach, from prevention through the building of an alliance of civilizations, to joint police operations.
in writing. Among the reasons I cannot support this report are:
the reference to the use of combat units (battle groups) and enhanced cooperation with NATO;
the vague use of the term 'radicalisation' as an indicator for 'non-democratic actions';
the promotion of cooperation between security and intelligence services and police, judicial and customs authorities of the Member States and third countries, raising the issue of data protection and constituting a deterioration of civil liberties and respect for human rights;
the mixing of police, security and intelligence forces, which could lead to abuse of powers against the citizens, as has been seen recently in Ireland;
the interlinking of internal policies with terrorism results in the elimination of the inter-pillar structure, bringing forward the logic of the draft EU Constitution.
There is no mention of state terrorism.
Some of the root causes of violence (occupation, injustice, social and economic causes) are barely mentioned.
The report points the finger at Islam, fostering discrimination and undermining respect for different religions and cultures.
in writing. - (EL) Even before the ink of the European Parliament's supposed protest about the riot of CIA activities has dried on the resolutions by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and so forth, the report by the 'socialist' MEP Mr Garcia escalating the EU's terrorist policy over the entire planet is being approved.
With what is now the familiar plea of protection of human rights, the report proposes the application of measures in a more reactionary direction, such as:
â¢ stepping up militarisation and 'preventive' repression inside and outside the ÎU by strengthening and increasing resources for rapid intervention forces - battlegroups - and other repressive ÎU mechanisms such as Europol and Frontex;
â¢ even greater 'cooperation' with imperialist forces, such as the USA and Israel, and with organisations such as ÎÎÎ€Î, the OSCE and so forth in the military sector and in the exchange of information sector;
â¢ unprovoked intervention in the internal affairs of third countries with sanctions and coercive measures and the cutting of trade relations and the subsidies provided for in the various EU guiding financing mechanisms;
â¢ abolishing the right of veto in the sectors of policing and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
Conclusion for the peoples: the more the ÎU cites democratic rights, the more aggressive it becomes.
The more it appears to distance itself from the USA, the more closely it cooperates in order to strike countries and grassroots movements.
Time has told us in Europe that 11 September was not an isolated act and that the United States was not the only target of terrorism.
The fact that we have understood this, albeit as a result of tragic events, is a sign that we understand the world around us.
What needs to be done in external policy in order to enhance our security in the face of the terrorist threat is to promote not only peace but also economic development.
That alone is not enough, however.
The key issue is combating radicalism.
After all, it is not our freedom, economic development, modernity or the mere existence of Western culture that feeds terrorism; it is radicalism.
We must not let the 'white man's burden' obscure reality.
Radicalism must be combated by promoting women's rights, by increasing trade and economic relations, by developing the economy and by fostering democracy; in a nutshell, by promoting the presence around us of more liberal societies.
It is also necessary, at the same time, to invest immediately in security, including efficient intelligence services that are equipped to face the new realities, and to be prepared to use military means when this is useful, necessary and legitimate.
in writing. Conservatives strongly support robust counter-terrorism measures and the protection of genuine human rights, which should not be abused, as a first line of defence for terrorists.
The report contains some useful elements, calling for closer cooperation between EU Member States and external allies like the US, Japan and Australia, an investigation into charities linked to money laundering and terrorist financing, and universal ratification of the 16 UN instruments on combating terrorism.
However, too much of the report is devoted to extending the role and competences of the EU.
It not only refers to the draft European constitution but encourages the EU to implement more treaty provisions relating to the European Security and Defence Policy, which is seriously flawed.
We oppose proposals to remove the national veto in areas of police and judicial cooperation, a violation of national sovereignty that would leave the UK even less able to control its borders and defend its integrity.
The report makes only one mention of NATO, seemingly as an afterthought.
For all these reasons Conservatives abstained on this report.
(PL) Mr President, Europe's economy is experiencing a period of growth. This has led to lower unemployment, improved public finances and a reduction in the average budget deficit.
It should be emphasised that labour productivity has risen, and this has made us more competitive.
I believe it is appropriate to point out to the House that these positive economic trends emerged following the enlargement of the European Union.
Low economic development was a feature of all of the 10 new countries which joined the Union in May 2004.
A more detailed study reveals that economic growth was significantly higher in the countries which liberalised their labour market and opened it up to the flow of workers from the new countries.
It may therefore confidently be stated that enlargement of the Union benefited both the old Fifteen and the new Ten.
It is to be hoped that the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will prove a further positive stimulus to the Union's economic growth.
The purpose of the report before us is to square the circle - to tackle the economic and social problems faced by the Union whilst developing the existing economic policies and instruments that lie at the root of those problems.
The report does acknowledge that over the past six years, since the introduction of the euro and the Lisbon Strategy, there has been weak economic growth, stagnation and even recession in some Member States, including Portugal.
It recognises that economic recovery cannot be taken for granted, that unemployment remains high (17 million in the EU) and that poverty has gone up 2 percentage points.
It also considers it unacceptable that there are almost 80 million poor people in the EU.
Moreover, it acknowledges weak internal demand and the need for greater investment.
It contradicts itself, however, when it says that the euro and the internal market have been crucial victories for European progress, and promotes monetary policy (wage moderation), the deregulation of the labour market (flexicurity) and the Stability and Growth Pact.
Reading between the lines, we can see its true purpose - to create a climate that is most favourable to entrepreneurial activity.
The current economic and social policy guidelines pursued by the EU have been championed again and the contradictions of the social democrats and their role in liberal capitalism have been laid bare.
in writing. (SV) This report contains no analysis of what may need to be harmonised at EU level.
It is based on assumptions the truth of which needs to be demonstrated.
The objective is all but total control of economic policy at EU level.
It is asserted without a shred of evidence that EMU has strengthened the European economy.
Experience suggests, rather, that the single currency has been downright damaging in relation to stabilising the economy and has had few positive structural effects.
The rapporteur demands more money from the Community budget for the Lisbon Strategy.
That is absurd.
What is required is that the Member States in fact behave in accordance with what they properly understand to be their own interests.
There is no reason for trying to get other countries to fund them out of common budget resources.
The report shows no understanding at all of the value of the Member States having so far avoided control from above and therefore being able to look for new directions in economic policy.
