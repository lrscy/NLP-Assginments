The amendments on including synthetic alcohol in the article on market information can also be accepted.
Parliament initially proposed to extend the proposal to synthetic alcohol, which is not an Annex I product and therefore is not part of the common agricultural policy.
For most outlets except alcoholic beverages, both agricultural and synthetic alcohol can be used and therefore compete on the same market.
The suggestion in the Agriculture Committee's report that synthetic alcohol should be included in the article on data collection to establish a yearly market balance of the sector, and to have better market information and increased market transparency, is one which the Commission is willing to consider.
Amendments 7 and 19 concerning deletion of the state aids article are not acceptable.
The Commission is of the opinion that all provisions proposed are necessary to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector, including the provisions on application of the rules on state aids.
Without fair application of those rules, there would not be a real common set of rules for agricultural alcohol, and I would point out that those rules already apply to synthetic alcohol.
The Commission is well aware of the concern that the application of state aid rules may create a problem for the functioning of the German alcohol monopoly.
I would repeat that the purpose of this proposal on agricultural alcohol is not to put an end to that monopoly. If alcohol production by German farmers under monopoly rules, including federal payments, is necessary to maintain valuable eco-systems or to cover the extra costs of environment-friendly production methods, current state aid rules offer substantial scope to grant aids for those purposes or rural development aid schemes could be used.
On the other hand, small distillers producing not only alcohol but also spirits could benefit from the de minimis rule on state aid for non-agricultural products.
The Commission is willing to try and find a solution, but cannot accept the proposal to simply delete the related article on state aid from the draft text.
A solution should be found within the context of that article.
Amendment No 8, which refers to the declaration on rum under the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and asks for special treatment to rum producers affected by the application of EU policies is also difficult to accept.
By definition, the proposed regulation should comply with all bilateral and international agreements, as stated in Article 14.
It is neither necessary nor appropriate to grant special treatment to one category of partners within a specific agreement.
Amendment No 13 can be accepted except for the reference to CN code 3814 0090 in the definition of non-agricultural alcohol because that code covers mixtures of alcohol with solvents and is not limited to non-agricultural alcohol.
Adoption of Regulation No 142/2002 has solved the problem of imports of those mixtures.
Amendments Nos 14, 16, 17 and 18 are purely technical improvements to the text that have also been discussed in the Council, and there is no problem in accepting them.
Amendment No 20, however, is more difficult to accept.
The Commission does not want to create a specific working group on alcohol as part of the wine management committee.
The Commission's aim is the same as that in the amendment, that is, to bring together the real experts on alcohol.
For that reason, the Commission has already made a statement on organising the work of the wine management committee in such a way that all alcohol-related items are grouped together in order to permit Member States to send the real experts to the meeting.
Although Amendment No 21 is acceptable, I must point out that it limits the Commission's scope to take transitional measures more than the original proposal does.
This text appears in other regulations and is therefore acceptable.
As far as Amendments Nos 22 and 24 are concerned, the Commission of course agrees that the rules on state aid should be applied in this sector, too, and therefore should not be deleted.
I also recognise the value of existing aid systems in certain Member States, especially for small agricultural distilleries, and the need to find a solution for them.
The notion of a transitional measure is certainly one I must give thought to, but I am not yet in a position to indicate the specific nature of the solution.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 23, as indicated a short time ago.
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 13 and 15 on including synthetic alcohol in the proposal as far as the system of data collection is concerned.
According to the Court of Justice case law, it can be included without changing the legal basis of the proposal and therefore the Commission is of the opinion that the global alcohol market is satisfactorily addressed by this proposal.
I hope that my comments today have clarified the Commission's position on this proposal.
Moreover, I should like to thank Members of Parliament for their constructive suggestions, which we shall of course consider, and for the time they have devoted to this process, and in particular I would thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, for her contribution.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
. (PT) As we all know, the proposal for a regulation for the creation of the European Maritime Safety Agency is part of the second package of measures proposed by the Commission following the sinking of the oil tanker Erika.
The planned creation of the Agency is accompanied by other measures with which the Commission intends to ensure a more effective protection of European shipping against the risk of accidents and the protection of the seas against pollution.
We consider the new agency to be enormously important, because it will supply the Member States and the Commission with the necessary technical and scientific support for them effectively to implement Community legislation in the maritime safety sector and in preventing pollution from ships. The agency will monitor the implementation of all legislation; and will assess the effectiveness of the measures in force.
Incidentally, we hope - and believe we are justified in hoping - that due to Portugal's unique geographical position and to the extent of our maritime territory, that country will be selected as the seat of this future European Agency.
. (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Gil-Robles on his report on the election of representatives in the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage.
The participation of the Union's citizens in European elections is far from satisfactory.
The turnout rate has fallen from 63% in 1979 to 49.7% in 1999, whilst the powers of the European Parliament have increased substantially.
The European Parliament is gaining power but losing its legitimacy.
The steady decline in the turnout rate in European elections is a matter of concern to us.
In the next European elections in 2004, the Community institutions and Member States must adopt the necessary measures to make voters more aware of the importance of these elections.
The Member States must reach agreement on a date for the next European elections which does not coincide with national traditional events or public holidays, in order to optimise the conditions for the turnout in the elections.
The Member States must adopt all possible measures to ensure that there is greater participation in the European elections, including procedures for ensuring people are registered on the electoral rolls and for the use of direct voting.
I agree with the provisions laying down the incompatibility of the offices of Members of the European Parliament and members of a national parliament.
Portuguese law already contained such provisions, but this will now become a Community measure.
I must note that the Council has not accepted Parliament's proposal to reserve 10% of seats for the single European constituency.
It was right to reject this proposal.
This would do nothing to bring the citizens closer to their representatives and would only serve to take seats away from national representations and give them to a more distant set of 'European' personalities?
In order to increase the turnout in elections, we must close the information gap and work on developing an EU information and communication policy aimed at the European people.
- (PT) We regret the openly federalist tone of the report and, furthermore, the inconsistency that it stubbornly demonstrates by not adopting the creation of a new single constituency at European level.
It makes no sense at all to try to take this opportunity, in a roundabout way, to attempt to introduce amendments to the system that has been defined and to its balance, in areas or aspects which should only be dealt with in a revision of the Treaties.
Instead, we directly support the draft Council decision, which must, in its simplicity, confine itself to new practices which are consistent with the revisions of the Treaties that have taken place in the meantime and, furthermore, to other practical improvements arising from past experience.
An example of the latter would be to broaden the time-frame in which the elections to the European Parliament can be fixed, which would allow some Member States to pencil them in for May.
This would resolve, in particular, the chronic Portuguese problem resulting from the enormous inconvenience of these elections having to be scheduled for the June holidays, which, according to analysts, is a factor that increases abstention rates.
.
(PT) Our broadly favourable vote does not overlook the concern still felt by many of us, where the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned, to see that crucial ethical guarantee clauses are ensured in good time. We also feel that these should be definitively established and clarified when the Specific Programmes are finally approved.
Hence the way we have voted on certain amendments.
It is worth pointing out that we share the concerns that have been expressed on this matter, particularly by the governments of Germany, Austria, Ireland, Italy and Portugal.
Furthermore, we still feel it is unacceptable that monies from a certain country (and its taxpayers) in which various actions are illegal could, as a result of the European mechanism, ultimately be used to finance these same actions when undertaken in another Member State.
Let us remember the way in which we defended the principle of legislative unanimity in the Fiori and Caudron reports and we hope that the essence of this defence of basic ethical principles and of respect for the various national legal systems will prevail on the final decisions of the Council.
. (PT) I wish to make a brief comment to explain how our vote on this report clearly confirms that we are in no way opposed to the European Research Area, to extending and developing it or to the Sixth Framework Programme in general.
The fact is that since neither issues of a sensitive ethical nature nor the duty - which we should all fully understand - to fully respect the various national legal systems are being called into question, our support for this report, as for others in the same field, has been constant, cooperative and unreserved.
It is rather those people, including Mr Busquin, who persist in seeking to extend European research policies to areas which are deemed illegal in some Member States, who must be held responsible for the delays that have occurred and furthermore, for the fact that the definition and the entry into force of the Sixth Framework Programme are surrounded by quite unnecessary controversy.
. (PT) Now that we have completed the revision of the Rules of Procedure, which entailed extensive and protracted work, there is paradoxically now a feeling of great frustration that amendments to the most negative aspects of the functioning of this institution, which do serious damage to the genuine and full role of the democratic mandate of its Members have not been tabled.
We are left feeling that an opportunity has been missed and we will almost certainly end up with an excessively weighty institution which holds too many votes.
I am afraid that we will still have a European Parliament that is difficult for most of the European public to understand and which will still suffer from the unacceptable lack of transparency which is the indirect consequence of working at a break-neck pace, however widespread and common this practice is here.
Instead of attacking these genuinely serious aspects in a House that claims to be the seat of European democracy, the majority has preferred instead to join forces and fight to restrict the rights of the smaller political groups, which in terms of democracy and of basic respect for the principle of equality, is quite intolerable.
. (PT) We supported the text proposed in plenary and the various amendments tabled to it in order to thereby respond to the need, acknowledged by all the political groups, to improve the hybrid and discriminatory position of the Non-attached Members, whilst at the same time bearing in mind that, by insisting on the principle that political affinity remains the cornerstone of a parliamentary group's constitution, the competent committee will in fact block the way to the future reconstitution of a so-called technical group.
Pedestrian protection: Commitment by the European automobile industry
The next item is the report (A5-0154/2002) by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication 'Pedestrian protection: Commitment by the European automobile industry' [COM(2001) 389 - C5-0537/2001 - 2001/2216(COS)].
Mr President, every year, 42 000 people die on the EU's roads.
This is a very big political issue for people within the EU.
In the White Paper on Transport, the Commission writes that we must halve the number of people killed by 2010.
In that case, we must be active, not passive.
We must take all kinds of measures at all levels.
Everyone must help, especially industry, because we know that this is what consumers are demanding.
The case for safety is self-evident.
How, then, must cars be designed so that they cause as little harm as possible to unprotected road users?
The proposal for a voluntary agreement which we have obtained from the Commission and which the automobile industry has negotiated is inadequate.
It is amazing that the Commission has seen fit to accept it in its current form.
It is not always clear how it is to be implemented, and the EEVC tests are not taken seriously, in spite of the fact that they have been developed over a period of more than 22 years.
We are concerned here with survival on the roads and life in our society, and we must therefore be careful.
The subject has been difficult to deal with, and I wish to thank all the shadow rapporteurs in the committee for a very successful piece of work which has demanded a great deal from us all.
There have been many different opinions on the subject, many lobbyists and many points of view from the committees.
It is now important to proceed on the basis of road safety and consumer demands.
We had three alternative responses to the Commission. The first was to accept the voluntary agreement.
The second was to recommend a detailed directive, stating exactly how cars are to be designed. The third was to recommend a framework directive.
The committee does not believe that the voluntary agreement is sufficient.
It is not provide enough certainty and does not offer scope for any grassroots parliamentary supervision of how the automobile industry assumes its responsibility.
It is insufficiently binding, and its processes insufficiently transparent.
The committee therefore proposes a framework directive, as mentioned by the Commission too in its communication.
It means that we in the political assemblies establish the objectives, whereupon experts oversee the implementation under the supervision, and with the participation, of the Commission.
The framework directive we are now proposing and calling for has a number of components.
The objective is that, by 2010, all models of car should meet the requirements of the four EEVC documents.
This process must be initiated now.
The EEVC is the institution that has made the most progress in researching road safety throughout the world, especially in the area of pedestrian protection.
We are, however, able to envisage other methods of testing which provide at least the same level of protection for pedestrians.
There must of course be effective tests that influence car design.
We also want the process to be assessed regularly, with annual reports sent to the European Parliament.
In that way, we shall be part of the process and be able to check that the goals we have set are really being met.
We want the Member States, through their type approval authorities, to help assess how the framework directive is being implemented.
We also believe that the EEVC has made the most progress when it comes to methods of testing and that it can make further progress in this area.
These are the demands made by the committee.
We await confirmation from the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen that the latter will be tabling a proposal for a framework directive.
Within the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we should like to have gone still further in certain sections by, for example, placing significantly sharper emphasis upon the exclusive merits of the tests developed by the EEVC and by setting a clear subsidiary objective with a view to obtaining a straight line of development in pedestrian protection between now and 2010.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists also wants the Commission to table its framework directive immediately, and preferably before the end of the year.
That is important if the Commission wants to show that it is serious about the issue.
As I say, this is a very controversial matter.
We have now reached a compromise and shall therefore support this in order to obtain as much backing as possible for the demand for a framework directive as the best solution where the issue of road safety is concerned.
My group will therefore only support the committee's proposal in the report, and I would urge other MEPs to do the same.
We approve the compromise which, for the sake of road users, I am pleased that we were able to negotiate.
Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Hedkvist Petersen for putting together what is a balanced compromise that reflects interests across Parliament.
Speaking as the rapporteur for my own committee - the Legal Affairs Committee - I can say that we were in favour of the Commission's proposal for a voluntary agreement and felt that the overall package achieved what Mrs Hedkvist Petersen wanted.
It will save lives earlier than any other proposal.
It also takes very seriously the need to improve design standards for cars.
But - and this is a crucial issue she did not mention - it allows the industry, and everyone else involved, to tackle the issue on a broad front because we know that simply making the front end of cars more resilient in the event of a crash is a second option.
We want to avoid collisions with vulnerable road users altogether through accident avoidance measures within the vehicle itself.
Remember that anti-lock braking systems fitted as standard will be part of this package.
We also have to look at road design, user education and many other things.
This has to be a concerted effort.
I want to talk about design standards because this is important.
I am an automotive engineer by background; I have seen the test laboratories; I have talked to the engineers about the problems of achieving more pedestrian-friendly cars.
This is not a simple issue.
Some groups have been guilty of gross over-simplification about the problems involved.
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen implied that the industry was not taking it very seriously, but I know from my visits that it is.
Moving forward, she is right to say that we must look at a broad range of test measures.
I call upon the industry this morning to join with the Commission to put together a team of all the best talents in engineering and design, together with all other interested persons, to come up with the best tests possible, given today's technology and not the 1998 technology on which the current EEVC tests are based.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by very warmly thanking Commissioner Liikanen for the very important and forward-looking step the Commission has taken.
We are all aware that, when problems crop up, the simplest way to deal with them is by means of incentives and assistance.
The Sixth Framework Programme for Research, which we have adopted, contains many incentives to achieve improvements by the use of scientific methods.
My second point is that we have standards, whether national or European, which give pride of place to the principle of mutual recognition and thereby make competition in the market possible.
The next stage, which is new and in fact sensational, is a voluntary commitment, whereby very strong pressure is brought to bear by both parties.
An amicable settlement has to be reached, and additional criteria can be introduced in order to actually enforce such settlements.
On the one hand, we have a simple contract, as originally planned, which of course involves risks and obligations for all parties to the contract and creates a number of problems, and on the other, we have the very slimline directive we are working on now, which we will use to do nothing more than draw up a timetable and lay down methods of supervision and assessment so that Parliament and the Commission can keep an eye on the progress made.
What I would like, and I believe that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would like it as well, is for this directive to amount to no more than one page.
That would serve as an example of how we are constantly up to date in laying down principles and demonstrating how our work in lawmaking can also be slimline and forward-looking.
Thank you, Commissioner; you have done an excellent piece of work.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur and also the European Commission. The European Commission has had the courage to present self-regulatory measures in order to get industry and governments to commit to greater pedestrian safety, which is also necessary, in fact.
I come from a culture where self-regulation is very common.
I am very much in favour of it, because self-regulation invariably entails the latest state of the art technology on which industry too can agree.
Moreover, it can be a very quick process. The legislative process is always much more protracted.
There is always one condition, namely that these self-regulatory agreements are monitored effectively.
If you ask me for my personal opinion - and this is also what Mrs Petersen said -I would have been satisfied with sound self-regulatory measures, and legislation would not have been by definition necessary.
However, this is what Parliament has decided and I will have to reconcile myself to this decision.
A skeletal directive is what we will end up with, one that leaves open plenty of opportunities to repeatedly lay down further regulations according to the latest state of the art technology.
I am such a staunch supporter of self-regulation because in my view, a number of processes in the European Commission are too slow.
As a final point, I have stated in the recommendation by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that something needs to be done about whiplash, although this is not at all related to this issue, but rather to a safety issue which also robs a huge number of people of their health.
Moreover, it incurs a high level of costs in our society.
Not for nothing have I included this as my final point. I know, after all, that far too little is happening in this area.
I have also asked questions in writing, upon which I receive the response that something will indeed be done.
We have already discussed it in the context of the Fourth Framework Programme.
Why does the handling of all these issues that are related to preventing accidents and preventing extra expenses in this area take up so much time?
This has been going on since the Fourth Action Programme; we are meanwhile looking at the Sixth Research and Development Action Programme.
Surely, something else should replace it.
I would ask the Commissioner not only to enter into consultation with industry very promptly in order to do something about this pedestrian protection, possibly by means of self-regulation, I would also ask him to tackle these other problems too.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the Commission's draft and Mrs Petersen's report to have an important and twofold significance.
This has to do, on the one hand, with their subject matter - traffic safety, which is an important issue to the European public. It also, of course, has to do with this report's role in the overall discussion - of which there has been a great deal - of the documents on European democratic governments and better regulation.

I am most grateful to the rapporteur for taking an actual example to show how things could go and what roles are played by Parliament, the Commission and the interest groups - which some would call 'lobbies' - by industry and consumer protection groups, and so on. Surely it is right for MEPs to be suspicious of agreements such as these, as we are never quite certain how far the industry will go, and to what extent it will keep to what it has supposedly committed itself to?
It is also understandable that industry is sometimes suspicious of MEPs, whose wisdom and expertise in these different fields is called into question.
So I believe it to be right that we should try to go down the road of compromise - the way pointed, thankfully, by the rapporteur - not an empty compromise but one that really shows the way things can go.
Being members of this House, we are naturally torn between the obligations and tasks imposed on us by a parliamentary democracy and the knowledge that there are many details we really cannot get to grips with unless we are experts in a specific area.
We are torn between trust and mistrust of industry's knowledge and also its willingness to be decisive in making things happen that may only be burdens to it and do not do anything for industry's profits.
We are also torn between our responsibility in matters of principle and, at the end of the day, the responsibility many people see us as having for many of the details.
I therefore think it right to call for a framework directive in this case in particular.
I am all in favour of it being slimline, and we will certainly not argue about whether it should take up one page or one-and-a-half.
Mr RÃŒbig was so fulsome in his praise of the Commissioner that I do not know how to add to it, but I find it perfectly understandable that the Commissioner should use a commitment to perhaps get us MEPs to take the middle way that he, as a democrat, believes to be the right one, and to get this House to pass a framework directive.
I will conclude by emphasising that this is all the more the case as we are dealing here with the area of traffic safety, and, whilst there may well be a technical issue at the bottom of it, it is a technical issue that has an effect on human lives.
Any technical issue capable of making people's lives better or saving them is, after all, one on which we MEPs should at least lay down some principles.
I support the rapporteur's motion.
Thank you, Mr President.
I found it interesting to take part as a shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Liberals.
We succeeded in establishing fruitful cooperation with the other groups, and particularly the rapporteur, and reached a balanced report with sufficient support from Parliament and in which, therefore, a very clear signal is being given to the Commission.
Under normal circumstances, my line of approach would have been to try to persuade the various parties in the field to reach a covenant, a workable cooperation, with agreements and obligations, but in this case, it is right and proper, in my view, that Parliament should take the responsibility to fight the corner of the consumer.
We must not forget the past when we draft the report.
I therefore think it important to apply past efforts as a basis for a framework directive.
It would be excellent if we asked the Commissioner if he thought he would be able to draft a proposal for a framework directive in the shorter term after all.
Indeed, the framework directive has 22 years of research behind it. Also, there have been so many dialogues between the partners in society, between the automobile industry and the consumer organisations in the past.
It would, in itself, be a nice gesture to us to indicate that you on your part are also committed to a straightforward implementation.
Needless to say, every person who becomes a victim of a road accident is one too many.
This effort is therefore a welcome one.
The report has managed to strike the right balance in the descriptions of test methods and such like, and I am therefore pleased that the point of departure for the ETSC method is sound, but there should be scope for possible developments in the future.
It is, after all, a dynamic process.
Particularly in the technical and hi-tech industry, there are a whole host of options with which we may not be all that familiar yet.
This is why it is to be welcomed that the report offers scope for possible, even better, methods than we have at the moment.
It is also important to note that it is not only the European Parliament that prevents road victims.
The behaviour of road users is particularly important.
This also means, therefore, that it is an integral process in which others in society will also need to play a role, and this is why I am pleased with this contribution to establishing a safer and integral traffic policy to which consumers too can make a contribution.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for the work that she has done, despite all the pressure that we have all been under.
There is a common denominator: we all agree that the number of accidents, injuries and deaths on European roads is absolutely unacceptable; and we also agree that we need to find viable methods of considerably reducing this number of victims.
This report talks mainly about the most vulnerable road users; I would therefore have liked motorcyclists to have been explicitly mentioned as well as pedestrians and cyclists, since they are just as vulnerable.
Vehicles need to be designed and built to be safer both for their occupants and for those around them, such as pedestrians.
The problem is finding a legal, quick, effective and transparent way of doing it.
Front designs that are capable of absorbing the impact of a pedestrian who is hit are vital in quantifying how much harm accidents would cause if they happened.
We should not, however, forget that we need to take care of other aspects, such as promoting safer driving, maximum dissemination of road safety information and, essentially, as has rightly been said, designing and building road infrastructures that are safer for all users.
The black spots on European roads are also black spots for this group of most vulnerable users.
Metal barriers, inappropriate vertical signs and kerbs are among the causes behind an enormous number of victims.
From the start of the debate our Group has rejected the so-called 'voluntary agreements? with the automobile industry proposed by the Commission in order to improve the protection of the most vulnerable groups, as it is a system that could leave the way open for other extra-legislative agreements associated with transport and the environment, which concerns us given the lack of an interinstitutional agreement in that respect.
This would not happen with a legislative process, because, although it would take longer, it would maintain stricter parliamentary control.
It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that a voluntary agreement with industry would enable us to start sooner.
But it is also true that, according to all the data, it would save fewer lives.
We have tabled a series of amendments rejecting this voluntary agreement.
Amendment No 4 refers to the need for consumer and user organisations to continue to express their opinions, whatever the form of regulation; Amendment No 6 expresses our concern regarding the requirement to use Daytime Running Lights across the Union, as their current use by the most vulnerable users, motorcyclists and cyclists, would lose its value.
In any case, we ask that this should not be obligatory until the matter has been studied in detail, or that Member States who ban Daytime Running Lights should be allowed to have positive discrimination for cyclists and motorcyclists.
Mr President, we have tabled a series of amendments in this respect and we ask for them to be looked at or at least to be voted on.
By accepting the Commission's proposal, Parliament is explicitly accepting a loss of power over this important aspect, which concerns the safety and the lives of hundreds of European citizens, and we will be losing independence, judgment, transparency and control.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Petersen, Commissioner, to put it briefly and to bring matters down to a common denominator, I consider one single commitment by the automobile industry to the protection of pedestrians to be utterly inadequate. This is all the more the case in view of the dramatic incidence of serious traffic accidents which make it impossible to regard as appropriate the deadlines envisaged for implementing the recommendations regarding impacts involving the lower leg and head with the front or windscreen of the vehicle: 1 July 2005 for all new vehicle types, 1 July 2010 for 80% of new vehicles and 2012 for all new vehicles.
I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not, as a matter of principle, opposed to commitments in general, but in this specific case I see it as necessary to produce a binding framework directive.
That would be a preferable way of going about it.
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report reflects this problem.
Attempts have been made at negotiating a compromise, but, unfortunately and apart from any compromise, a whole array of shortcomings remain.
You, Mr Koch, looked only at the positive side of that; I am now considering it from another angle.
Excessive delays prior to the commitment's implementation, the reduction of tests from four to two, the commitment to equip vehicles with daytime running lights, the provision that the implementation of phase 2 should be subject to technical feasibility, which gives no guarantee that the objectives will actually be achieved, the failure to adopt a ban on fitting front and rear bullbars after a vehicle is purchased.
We of course support the equipping of all vehicles with ABS, as we do the introduction of a range of electronic active safety devices.
Making the first move is always better than doing nothing.
This one can help cut down on accidents.
So, despite all my reservations, I will vote for this report.
Mr President, the current number of fatalities which public roads claim annually calls for measures to be adopted. Measures that relate to both vehicles and to road user behaviour.
Everyone has his or her own responsibility to take.
In my opinion, the Community should not be able to shirk its responsibility too easily.
It has the task of protecting its people from the risks of public life, including the roads.
At the moment, the Community is prescribing requirements for the design of cars, which is good, in my view.
This power must not be relinquished.
This is why voluntary agreements with industry have to be treated with great care.
Industry is only secondary, and never able to adopt the role of legislator, simply because it always wants a compromise of criteria without any of the sharp edges.
The agreement with the automobile industry which we are discussing here is partly illustrating why that is.
Let me start by saying that the agreement offers more certainties than are currently laid down formally. That is to say, provided that all parties provide their cooperation to the letter and spirit of the agreement.
This does depend on the basic premise that is opted for: either an existing situation or a desirable one.
I would opt for the latter, namely the need for considerable improvement.
In this light, there are a few observations to be made about the agreement.
One point that deserves attention is the existence of two different test methods. One is related to industry and one is independent.
It goes without saying that the first one will not be as far-reaching as the second one, or at least not be as critical.
There is also a clear difference in the set-up of the test.
The EEVC goes considerably further and can ultimately guarantee a higher level of protection than the NCAP.
The timeframe plays an important role too.
Industry suggests that technical adjustments to models require more time.
This is also reflected in the voluntary agreement on the basis of which requirements for all new cars only start to apply after a very long time.
Practice has shown, however, that adjustments can be implemented remarkably faster, not in years but even in weeks, as long as the right incentives are in place.
As far as the specific content of this resolution is concerned, there is only one conclusion possible, in my view.
We believe that Community legislation is the only way in which the criteria for the safety tests can be established.
Accordingly, we warmly welcome the proposed legislative instrument, namely a framework directive.
As for its content, the four EEVC tests will need to occupy centre stage, because they prescribe higher requirements and, in so doing, offer a higher level of protection for weaker participants.
On the basis of information available to us, it is very feasible for the automobile industry to meet these standards.
There does not seem to be a problem there either.
The inclusion of alternative test methods is, in our view, superfluous.
It is claimed that this would be necessary in order to be able to incorporate progress in the test methods. However, the EEVC tests too are updated regularly.
Finally, the plea for the ban on bullbars both during and after production receives our support.
In short, with the exception of a few minor changes, we can endorse this resolution.
Mr President, the subject of today's debate is far more important than anyone who is not familiar with the figures might imagine.
By way of illustration, according to the statistics, there were 23 000 road traffic accidents in Greece alone in 2000, 3 900 of which involved pedestrians.
So you can see that we are talking numbers which are not easily disregarded.
As we all know, the Commission communication we are examining today is about a commitment by the European automobile industry designed to increase the chances of survival of pedestrians and cyclists involved in collisions with motor vehicles.
This particular commitment comes in two stages, one by 2005 and one with even more stringent measures by 2010.
The important thing is that, first, the industry itself is anxious to make a voluntary commitment, meaning that no direct legislative intervention is required in the first stage and, secondly, this commitment covers all the important manufacturers, European, Japanese and Korean alike.
The debate on this report in the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had what I consider to be a very satisfactory outcome, thanks to the efforts of the rapporteur, Mrs Petersen.
Of course, with it being a compromise, we are not overly excited about the result but, when all is said and done, it takes account of our group's concerns, which is why we voted for it in committee and shall do so in Plenary.
The fundamental elements in this agreement are paragraphs 6 and 14, so I shall just reiterate them if I may.
First, we consider that the voluntary commitment being negotiated with the automobile industry represents a first step towards improving road safety and, secondly, we are asking the Commission to come forward with a framework directive in which a clear, realistic time schedule is established for the intermediate and final goals to be reached, as well as methods for monitoring assessment.
Mr President, I too wish to thank my colleague, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, for drawing up her report with such a sense of purpose and also for her active involvement in the matter of road safety generally. Thanks also go to Commissioner Liikanen for his unbiased and fruitful endeavours.
The compromise that has been achieved represents the new decision-making culture and is a step forward for dealing with matters faster and more flexibly.
The voluntary agreement will allow us to adopt simple solutions to increase pedestrian safety more quickly.
However, Parliament must ensure that the car industry keeps its promises. For this reason a loose framework directive is appropriate.
At the same time it has to be remembered that this commitment is just a start.
As has been said here in several speeches, the targets for action might have been a lot more ambitious.
New technology makes it possible to improve road safety in general and hence also pedestrian safety.
Solutions already exist and more are on the way.
They must be speedily adopted.
It is now essential to monitor closely the implementation of the commitment and its results.
The experience gained will allow us to evaluate the benefits of a wider application of an equivalent procedure.
Thank you, Mr President.
First of all, I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the sound work she has done.
In the final analysis, the background to what we are discussing here is the fact that public roads claim forty thousand victims annually, including a number of vulnerable road users - as they are referred to - cyclists, pedestrians and also, of course, moped riders and motorbike riders to a certain extent.
These are the people around which everything ultimately revolves.
The agreement that is being discussed here is in the first instance voluntary.
To a certain degree, I can go along with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and others who would ideally like to see voluntary agreements concluded with industry.
However, this has already taken some time.
These tests have taken 22 to 24 years, although some adjustments are taking place.
I do, in fact, share the view of Mr Van Dam who claims that these adjustments can be made a great deal faster.
These days, consumer adjustments can be made very quickly thanks to technological connections between both the requesting parties and, ultimately, the implementing operative activities in industry itself.
Phase one is, in itself, a step forward in this procedure where, for example, the application of ABS is concerned.
We have some misgivings about daytime running lights, because it is, after all, the weak vulnerable users who end up being portrayed in a bad light.
We have tabled a few amendments on this score.
Ultimately, it is also about the front of the cars and what goes on around these.
I very much welcome phase one's implementation on a voluntary basis.
As for phase two, I go along with these four tests where it is clear which ones are the best, but this is, at the end of the day, about a framework directive.
This is what we should focus our attention on now.
I fully agree with the rapporteur on the scope and intention of this framework directive.
I also agree with her - this is also why we have tabled an amendment on this - to implement this framework directive, which should not be formulated in a technically complex manner, as soon as possible.
This is why we state in our amendment that we would ideally like to see this before the end of this year.
In the light of 24 years of history, this is certainly not asking too much.
Once again, I should like to ask a number of groups - for a number of those are agreed - to consider Amendment No 9, particularly part one, which is about submitting this relatively simple framework directive to us before the end of the year, and this according to the criteria that have been laid down in the low-key consultation between all of us.
Mr President, are the non-elected executives of industry the legislators, or is this the task of the elected representatives of the people?
Industry would like measures on a voluntary basis that only partly meet the public's expectations and that can easily be avoided by companies that stand to benefit from doing so.
It is sad that the European Commission wanted to meet this wish and that some of the Right-wingers in this Parliament were prepared to endorse this.
The argument in favour, namely faster results and more flexible adjustments, is largely cancelled out by the fact that the interested parties themselves have a huge bearing on the outcome.
They want to leave room for effects which may be harmful to others but beneficial to themselves.
Insofar as additional agreements with industry are meaningful, these can at most relate to the speeding up of the introduction of new rules and ways with a view to a prompt and goal-specific application.
I should like to finish off with a remark about the content of the covenant itself.
Compulsory daytime use of headlights is only safe in sparsely populated countries with a low sun position, few cyclists and without the need to make motorbike riders more visible, and there is a problem in this respect.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are trying by means of this instrument - which we must recognise deals with a technical field which we have to acknowledge overstretches our capacities as MEPs - to apply the law to technical matters. Commissioner, this new instrument presumes twofold legitimate expectations.
For a start, we are trusting the Commission, as, before the directive reaches us and is adopted by us, we have to expect that you will check to see that the Commission really will fulfil its obligation for the next two or three years from the word go, as it were.
It is, secondly, presupposed that you must, in theory at least, join us in trusting the industry to actually do what it has declared itself willing to do.
In so far, I call on the industry and the Commission to prove to us and to the citizens whom we represent, that legal undertakings are a good way of achieving rapid improvements, particularly in technical fields.
As has been said, though, we Members of this House are, as I see it, obliged to check up on the Commission and on the industry to see whether they actually merit our trust and whether they really are promptly and effectively putting their promises into practice.
I would like, Commissioner, to make another point.
I take the view that, should this directive and this system come to pass, we in this House must also be free not to insist on all the old technical standards.
That, Mr Bouwman, is why I cannot vote for your Amendment No 9, as item 14 of our motion for a resolution states that we expect the directive to take as standards either the four EEVC tests or other methods offering at least equal or possibly better safeguards.
This Parliament should not behave in 2002 as if it already knew what testing methods will be right in 2005 and 2010.
So, Mr President, as regards the question of which are the right tests for the framework directive, I ask the Commissioner to submit proposals founded on objective criteria and modern knowledge.
Mr President, I celebrate the fact that this report brings nearer the prospect of safer car fronts and therefore fewer pedestrian, cyclist and motorcyclist deaths.
Cars remain excessively and unnecessarily dangerous.
Safer car fronts could save 2 000 lives a year at a cost of only EUR 30 or GBP 20 a car.
I agree it should be possible to turn off daytime running lights.
Indeed, I would want them banned in the United Kingdom because I think they reduce the visibility of motorbikes and make motorists feel superior and invulnerable.
I am delighted at the ban on bullbars, not only when cars are sold, but also an as after-sales purchase.
May I congratulate not only the rapporteur, but also my own colleague, Hermann Vermeer, for his excellent work in leading the search for a compromise and breaking the early deadlock between the two sides of the House, one insisting that voluntary agreements should never have a role, and the other saying that legislation should never have a role.
I regret the attempt by the car industry lobby to discredit the EEVC tests.
The report properly reminds us that EEVC is the institution which is at the forefront of research in road safety, with wide experience in the field of pedestrian protection in particular.
While the EEVC and other test methods should continue to develop with new technologies, currently there are no equivalent tests, so those tests are for the moment standard.
Just as I do not think that it is useful to be theological about voluntary agreements or legislation, nor do I think that it is useful to be theological about a particular kind of test, but there are no different standards at the moment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's communication, which seeks to bring about a voluntary agreement between car manufacturers operating on the internal market in order to increase the protection afforded to pedestrians and other road users, is certainly a major step forwards in the area of road safety.
I believe it is also a good example of a non-legislative approach which can benefit the citizens quickly and strengthen the framework of the internal market.
The measures proposed by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association - introducing more pedestrian-friendly car fronts, fitting all new vehicles with ABS, installing daytime running lights in countries where this is permitted, and vehicle crash tests - should indeed make it possible to reduce the unacceptable number of people and pedestrians who, each year, lose their lives or are seriously or irreparably injured.
A negotiated agreement would therefore be an initial positive step towards improving road safety, and the commitment could still be improved in time and monitored.
In this context, it would appear fundamentally important for the European Parliament to call upon the Commission to guarantee the independence in both form and substance of the technical services certifying the conformity with the tests laid down of all new vehicle models that manufacturers intend to place on the market.
In this regard, the motion for a resolution to be put to the vote today quite rightly calls for the conformity inspection procedures to be set on the basis of guidelines established jointly with the Joint Research Centre and under its supervision.
Mr President, the non-binding motion for a resolution accepts for now the voluntary agreement by the European car industry.
But we are calling for EU legislation to take its place.
We welcome manufacturers' development of pedestrian-friendly car fronts, automatic braking systems and the use of daylight running lights, although obviously there is controversy on that particular topic.
We welcome this because we are assured that these measures can be implemented relatively quickly.
However, the motion for a resolution recognises that this agreement is not the best way to protect pedestrians in the long run.
What if one of the partners fails to act?
It is not as binding or as transparent as legislation, and there is a real lack of confidence expressed by the pedestrian protection bodies.
The car industry itself admits - and none of us can be happy about this - that it has not been proactive in the past 22 years.
Phase I will take five years to implement, with phase II in 2010 and a review in 2004.
We are taking only a first step.
The car industry states that the framework allows it to move forward more quickly, that a directive will slow down implementation.
But we ask the Commission to come forward with a framework directive that will lay down a clear timeframe and detailed monitoring methods because at the end of the day we must protect the most vulnerable and pedestrian safety in our communities is of the utmost importance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I found out about this speech only a couple of minutes ago, but this is a very serious matter. We are talking about human life.
For that reason I was happy to come and speak here at such very short notice.
It was a pity that the Committee headed off in the wrong direction right at the start.
We politicians wanted to leave our mark only because we were elected to this Parliament.
The issue is a lot more serious than that.
This is about saving human lives and finding the means of doing so as quickly as possible.
We must therefore forget the political approach; we have to support the Commission's very rational proposal and, likewise, the excellent work undertaken by the rapporteur, Mrs Petersen.
What is the way to implement those very technical changes - which are in fact huge in scale - as quickly as possible?
We must remember that we are elected just once every five years, but the car industry holds an election every day. Consumers vote with their wallet every day, and people's awareness of safety matters should not be underrated.
Today they are insisting on safe cars and also that cars should be safe for pedestrians.
We especially must not get ourselves caught up in an EEVC test, good though it may be in itself, because developments are happening very fast.
What will we have to offer in terms of technology in two, three or four years' time?
We should not let ourselves get bogged down in the framework defined today and I give my utmost support to the Commission's proposal, as well as Mrs Petersen's work to reach a compromise, and I would just briefly like to say this: even Olof Palme would have been satisfied with the work that we have done here.
Mr President, as mentioned here by many speakers, with 9 000 pedestrians and cyclists killed and a further 200 000 injured in accidents involving a car, pedestrian protection has become a pressing concern for civil society, which the Commission fully shares.
When considering which approach to take to this issue, the choice has been between a voluntary commitment from industry on the basis of agreed objectives and the traditional route of legislation.
After talks with the European Commission, European motor vehicle manufacturers, represented by ACEA, committed themselves in June last year to introducing a range of measures starting this year, actually in January 2002, leading to a high level of pedestrian protection.
Identical commitments have been entered into since then by the Japanese and Korean automobile manufacturers.
In a communication adopted in July last year, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council the main elements of the industry's commitment and invited both institutions to express their views on it.
The Commission would decide thereafter whether to accept the industry commitment or to propose legislation.
The commitment constitutes an innovative package that combines passive and active safety.
On the passive safety side, manufacturers have agreed to design cars according to a series of tests introduced in two phases, starting in 2005, aimed at verifying that the car design will minimise injuries to pedestrians involved in an accident.
Another important passive safety element of the commitment is the ban of rigid bullbars from new cars as from this year.
Regarding active safety, industry has taken three additional initiatives: firstly, to equip new vehicles with ABS from 2003 onwards, secondly, to introduce daytime running lights on all vehicles from 2002 (it should be noted that this refers only to the technical prescription of DRL, but it does not supersede national laws on the use of DRL), and, last but not least, industry is committed to progress and report systematically on the introduction of additional active safety devices to improve pedestrian protection, such as adaptive speed limiting devices.
The Commission would monitor the implementation of the commitment, on the basis of tests conducted by independent laboratories and possibly with the involvement of national type-approval authorities.
Since then, an intensive debate has taken place in the European Parliament and the Council in the past few months on the options presented by the Commission in its communication.
Last November the Council of Ministers approved the idea of an industry commitment in this area and its fundamental elements, subject to certain conditions on particular points.
Now it is the turn of the European Parliament to express its views.
I am grateful to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and in particular to the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, for her impressive work, and also to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mr Harbour and Mr RÃŒbig for their opinions.
I appreciate the efforts invested in this matter, which have shown exceptional commitment, professionalism and openmindedness.
The aim has been to seek a balance between a high level of protection, flexibility and efficiency in law-making on the one hand, and the preservation of legal certainty and transparency on the other.
Firstly, the Commission welcomes the support expressed by the Transport Committee for the objectives and timeframe proposed in the Commission communication for the introduction of pedestrian protection measures.
Secondly, the Commission welcomes the views expressed in the report regarding the legislative approach, suggesting the use of framework legislation in this area to ensure legal certainty on the fundamental goals.
It has been asked what the Commission will do if the report is accepted.
If a majority of the European Parliament agrees to this approach, the Commission is willing to put forward a proposal for framework legislation, based on the relevant measures of the commitment.
I believe that we can do this by the end of the year, this coming autumn.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0192/20002) by Mrs Vlasto, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Technology, on the Commission communication - sustaining the commitments, increasing the pace [COM(2001) 641 - C5-0075/2002 - 2002/2033(COS)].
Mr President, this report was originally limited to the Commission communication outlining the progress achieved by the Member States in the wake of the Lisbon European Council.
I thought that it would also be helpful for the report to cover the implementation of the European Charter for small enterprises.
I wanted to present a simple and specific report to you based on the work done by the Commission and the Member States over the last two years.
I share the Commission's concern about the slow pace of progress and about the downturn in the economic situation, which is not necessarily favourable to long-term reforms.
However, it is these structural reforms which we are being slow to implement, particularly as regards opening markets and reducing the tax burden.
One of the reasons for the slow pace of reform is the failure to comply with the method decided in Lisbon, which presupposes cooperation between the Member States and coordination by the Commission, with exchanges of information and an assessment of the measures adopted.
This is still lacking, and that is detracting from the coherence of enterprise policy.
That is why I am suggesting that the Commission should publish an enterprise policy scoreboard, just as it has done for employment policy, which should both prioritise actions to be taken and set out a timetable.
I am also calling on the Commission to provide us with better information on progress with structural reforms in the Member States.
Furthermore, I am asking the Commission to assess the effectiveness of initiatives taken by the Member States and effectively to disseminate best practice.
Small enterprises are a pillar of Europe's economy and a breeding ground for jobs that we should support and develop.
The regulatory and administrative environment in which our companies have to operate also has an impact on their competitiveness.
We need to bear in mind that small enterprises employing fewer than 50 people provide jobs for 65 million people in the European Union.
They account for 99% of all businesses and provide 53% of jobs.
In other words, it is better to legislate, taking account of small enterprises, which means serving 65 million people more effectively.
That is why I am calling on the Commission to step up consultation with bodies representing small enterprises and to help them to set themselves up as a network.
It is also the reason why I am stressing the need to differentiate more clearly between different types of company in legislative proposals.
And it is also why we should not make life difficult for our entrepreneurs by overburdening them with legislation.
The aim of the measures I am proposing is to support initiatives taken by the Commission and the Member States in favour of companies.
I wanted to emphasise the methodological problems that are impeding the Lisbon strategy while advancing some specific proposals likely to meet the expectations of entrepreneurs and applicable in the context of small enterprise.
I hope that this House will support this approach.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Vlasto, on her report.
The Lisbon agenda is an important one for the economy and future of Europe and the European Union.
A great deal of promise was held out at that time and there is a lot of very positive rhetoric about the process and the things that we want to do.
But there is a lot of talk and spin, rather than substance.
Many of the projects of substance in the process are a continuation of those schemes, such as liberalising the energy markets, which were in hand before.
I note with keen interest comments such as in paragraph 14, which calls on the Member States to reduce the tax burden on employment.
I wish that my own Member State had followed that advice instead of putting up the tax on employment in the last budget.
I support warmly the comments about stressing the importance for small businesses of a genuine opening of the markets in telecommunications, energy, postal services and transport.
This is a worthy aspiration.
We are working hard to do it but we are not making fast enough or satisfactory enough progress.
I also welcome the call from the Commission for a study on the impact on various kinds of enterprises for each legislative proposal.
The Commissioner knows well of my concern about business impact costs and the proposals.
That is why I am also concerned about Parliament and our propensity to put down amendments which add costs.
That is why my amendment is about examining the costs of our amendments.
Mr President, I add my congratulations to Mrs Vlasto for her report, which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
It deals with the issue of the Lisbon European Council which had the objective of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world and link that to the Feira Council which endorsed a European charter for small enterprises.
Clearly, as Mrs Vlasto said, small enterprises are one of the keys to success in the European economies.
I should like to make three points.
Firstly, the report details the very low levels of investment in research and development - 1.19% of GDP inside the European Union.
This is particularly acute in industrial sectors dominated by SMEs.
I would like us to look at the idea, at a European level, of research institutes paid for by a levy on the relevant industries, which the Japanese have used so successfully in getting innovation in research and development in such industrial sectors.
Secondly, we need to look at the issue of better regulation to simplify and streamline our regulations.
I have no problem with imposing burdens on business to improve, for example, the environment, but we need value for money.
One of the recent studies in the United Kingdom suggested that the end of vehicle life directive, for example, cost GBP 400 million a year and benefits the environment only to the tune of GBP 100 million a year.
If that is correct, that is something that should not have been adopted into law in the European Union.
So we need to be aware of the impact of our legislation on business and jobs.
Therefore we support the Chichester amendment in principle and will be voting in favour of it.
Thirdly, we must look more widely at whether SMEs that serve local markets only should have the same burdens imposed on them as large companies exporting around the European Union and outside.
In many cases local knowledge can suffice to protect consumers.
Regulations are needed when the goods and services from anonymous companies are remote from the consumer both geographically and in terms of local knowledge.
Mr President, Commissioner, at the European Council in Lisbon the desire was expressed to harmonise and standardise the capitalist format for all Member States of the EU.
The Lisbon method was the opening up of markets and only one way to act was proposed. It is the coordination of economic and social policy by placing special emphasis on the role of the private sector.
We might agree with the rapporteur that only an inadequate analysis of whether the same method suits all has been carried out.
Different countries have different public services and operate on different principles regarding social welfare.
In the Nordic welfare states public services are understood broadly to include pensions, healthcare, schools and childcare.
The Catholic countries, with their traditions of care within the family, should not come and tell us in the Nordic countries that our taxes are too high.
The privatisation method expounded at Lisbon is not going to provide better services in our part of the world.
EU declarations do not create socially secure life.
For that reason in the eyes of the rightist hegemony the free Member States might lack the desire - and, in fact, it is only right that they do - to act on declarations that would pulverise people's basic social security.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, whenever I hear the Lisbon objective of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world within ten years mentioned, I always wonder whether we actually think that, before the Lisbon Summit, the Heads of government were trying to advocate less competitive economies.
I believe that, instead of imposing and proposing grand objectives, it would be better to try to do some of the necessary, useful things that need doing, and this report rightly specifies some of the issues that need to be tackled such as market liberalisation, achieving a more integrated securities market and opening up the export markets for European businesses.
I feel that more could have been said, rapporteur, Mr President, Commissioner, about the tax and administrative burdens imposed as a result of employment regulation, which particularly affect small and medium-sized businesses in Europe and which are one of the reasons why a substantial part of European enterprise and microenterprise - and this is especially true of Italy although not confined to that country alone - is effectively a submerged economy, an economy which evades regulation, which evades legal constraints because of the excessive burdens imposed on it.
I would like to end by saying that it is right that we should concern ourselves with small and medium-sized businesses in Europe: in Italy, small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of the economy.
However, alongside this, we must bear two things in mind: firstly, Europe needs large competitive internationalised businesses; secondly, it needs small and medium-sized businesses to grow, to grow and expand continuously, first and foremost in Europe but then, if possible, to internationalise their operations.
Therefore, the phrase 'small is beautiful' is all very well, but we must not create the conditions for small-scale enterprise which we do not need.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mrs Vlasto on her report.
It is certainly clear that we all need to be aware that SMEs and SMIs play an important role not only in the economy, but also in society, by promoting economic and social cohesion.
However, the scope for modernising an economy and stabilising a society is very much dependent on institutional conditions and on having a clear, accessible and above all appropriate legal framework.
The single market and the total achievement of economic and monetary union, the enlargement of the European Union and the forthcoming establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean area will increase the size of this market and thus change the rules.
This globalisation of markets has a marked impact on the competitiveness of Europe's companies, which need to adapt their strategy by incorporating into their analytical data the strategic advances made by their competitors in third countries and competition from markets in third countries which they want access.
We have found that Europe's companies are not sufficiently internationalised, neither within the single market nor outside the European Union.
That is why companies need more favourable and above all more appropriate regulatory conditions to be put in place as soon as possible. In particular, these conditions need to improve market access and provide for additional measures for enterprise partnerships at international level.
SMEs also need to come up with new forms of work organisation, but these changes should in no case be at the expense of workers' needs in terms of security.
It is essential to encourage workers to adapt their skills to the needs of the company and to consider training as an investment for companies and an added value for employees.
Furthermore, SMEs make a contribution to Europe's cultural values and to increasing skill levels.
They are the section of our economy that we need to promote, as stated at the Lisbon Summit, but we need to act quickly, because our slowness is suffocating them. When confronted with economic reality, our companies need deeds more than words.
We need to be as efficient as they are.
This is already clear in the Sixth Framework Programme on Research.
We now need to pursue that coherence.
Mr President, I would just like to address this question of better regulation.
I congratulate the Commission on its proposals, particularly its recommendations on economic impact assessments.
The Commission's proposals will only be effective if the other two institutions - the Council and Parliament - follow suit.
Mr Chichester's amendment seeks to alter paragraph 25, which was my original amendment in committee, calling upon Parliament in essence to carry out its own economic impact assessments.
I believe that we should do this at second reading, once we have received the common position from the Council and we know what Parliament's amendments were at first reading.
We should have an independent unit seeking to assess exactly what the impact of the legislation is, with a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, as Mr Ford has said, albeit not to substitute for decision-making, but to ensure that all decisions taken by Parliament are informed.
It may well be that even if we recognise there are costs involved, we feel the legislation is very important.
But Parliament has to follow the example of the Commission on that, otherwise it will not work.
Indeed, so should the Council.
The Council is very good at adding amendments to legislation without actually working out how much they are going to cost.
That is a vital challenge to Parliament.
Finally, the Lisbon agenda will only work if we focus on the skills issue.
Lifelong learning has to be meaningful, not just a slogan.
We have to make sure our workforce has the proper skills to be able to develop our economy, because our competitive advantage is largely skills-based and that is where the future of the European economy lies.
Mr President, the European Council that convened in Lisbon in March 2000 made entrepreneurship the key issue in the achievement of the EU's strategic objectives.
Entrepreneurship can help to exploit economic opportunities, so creating a prosperity that makes it possible to achieve social objectives.
One result of the Lisbon meeting was that the European Charter for Small Enterprises was born.
The basic principle at work here was that small enterprises are an important source of dynamism, innovation and entrepreneurship.
We were worried last winter that the major importance that entrepreneurship had would be forgotten about.
It was not, however.
In March the European Council at Barcelona said again how important entrepreneurship was, reconfirmed the special status it had been accorded, and urged Member States to expedite the implementation of the charter on small enterprises.
At the same time the Commission published its report on competitiveness for 2002.
It shows what a long way EU productivity is from that in the United States of America.
For this reason, per capita GNP in the EU is only 65% of that in the United States.
There are various reasons for Europe's poor levels of competitiveness, but the report highlights the poor levels of investment in information technology and communications technology and poor levels of utilisation of investment.
The results of this are visible in industry, but also in services.
Utilisation of investment in information and communications technology furthermore helps prevent a situation where there is a shortage of skilled labour in the EU.
The worrying conclusion of the report on competitiveness for 2002 is also that, unless the EU removes all the barriers, it will not be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
Dominique Vlasto draws attention in her report to various courses of action to improve EU performance and avoid any such eventual situation.
Finally I would like to lay emphasis on five matters. Firstly, the Internal Market is the basis of competitiveness for EU companies.
There is still much to be done to establish the internal market in services.
Liberalisation of the finance markets would help to make funding available to business.
Secondly, the Charter for Small Enterprises must be implemented with a measure of determination.
There are signs of progress, but Member States should not waste time.
Thirdly, better regulation means that the effects of every legislative proposal must be examined.
Last week the Commission submitted a proposal on this and I am very pleased with the speeches the honourable Members Mr Chichester and Mr Titley have made here on this issue.
Fourthly, we must do everything possible to exploit information and communications technology properly.
It is not enough that information or communications technology is showing signs of speeding up the US economy; the necessary action has to be taken also.
Finally, we must first and foremost create a favourable climate for entrepreneurship.
We have to take risks and society must be encouraged to do so.
We shall return to this in the Green Paper.
These are all political measures.
We must concentrate on getting political action on the right track. That way the EU will be able to achieve the right kind of operational environment for companies - not so much by attaching too much importance to small-scale projects, as lucrative as they too may be in themselves.
As significant levels of funding are needed at EU level we already have the necessary tools at our disposal.
I wish to thank Mrs Dominique Vlasto for having indicated the very important areas of policy in which progress is needed.
In the final analysis we have to improve political action. That way we can bring the Lisbon objectives within achievable range.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0147/2002) by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication "eEurope 2002: Accessibility of Public Web Sites and their Content" [COM(2001) 529 - C5-0074/2002 - 2002/2032(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, in particular Mrs Read and Mr Harbour, and the Commission Secretariat, for their pleasant cooperation, and state that I, as the rapporteur, am delighted to have submitted this report.
It concerns the accessibility of government websites, especially to citizens with disabilities and to elderly people.
In this connection, our meetings with the European Commission have also been very fruitful.
The Commission communication aims to draw attention to the web accessibility section of the Lisbon strategy.
In order to make websites accessible to the equipment of people with disabilities, these websites need to be of a correct technical design.
For this purpose, the Worldwide W3C Consortium has drafted guidelines.
The Member States have committed themselves to applying these guidelines for government websites and the European Commission is monitoring the progress of this process.
Since all citizens need access to government information, the accessibility of public websites is clearly important.
Moreover, governments have a special responsibility towards the weaker members of society.
The European Parliament can, therefore, give its full support to this process.
It calls for greater efforts in the area of implementation.
Otherwise it will not be possible to realise the objective which the Commission mentions, namely to achieve accessibility of public websites by 2003, in time.
I hope that the user, for example a disabled worker in government service, will gain access to government sites without any problems within the foreseeable future.
In addition, it is essential for this official himself or herself to be able to place information on a website.
Consequently, the software required to place information on the web must also be accessible.
However, a final end goal is not conceivable.
Internet technology is developing fast.
I would therefore call for the guidelines to be developed hand in hand with this technical dynamic.
Governments will thus need to follow developments very closely.
Which brings us to the question what these guidelines actually mean for government institutions.
First of all, accessibility for all will need to be accommodated in the draft process right from the outset.
Secondly, for the sake of accessibility for all, it is necessary for governments to offer their information in a technologically neutral format. This means not exclusively via the Internet.
Subsequently, it is, of course, the question whether the guidelines will be formally complied with in an effective and practical format.
The report therefore asks Member States to set up information points where users can lodge their findings and complaints.
These signals from society will need to lead to improvements to the websites.
There has been discussion about the question of whether a more binding character of the guidelines would yield a better result.
This would not, however, get to the root of the current problem. The root of the problem lies in the lack of familiarity with the guidelines, and not in any potential unwillingness on the part of the web designers.
In my opinion, there is certainly no reason to draft legislation at European level at this stage.
The Commission does also want private sites, however, alongside government sites, to become accessible as soon as possible.
In the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, one of the points of discussion was which type of websites was most urgent.
Since the field is making different noises, it would be useful to grant priority to websites with most relevance for user groups.
This could be either commercial websites or websites of social importance.
Furthermore, these websites of social importance also encompass websites that are commercial in nature.
Shops, banks and public transport companies spring to mind.
The report also pays attention to the candidate countries.
The extent of the objective yet to be realised means that in those countries too, accessibility is worth a great effort.
Lastly, improvements in the field will also need to be measurable.
The report therefore supports further research into measurable criteria for compliance with the guidelines.
We have received encouraging signals from the field.
The Dutch Institute for the Blind, BartimÃ©us, which has given us excellent advice, has developed an initiative along these lines.
It hopes to be launching a website next week, on which it will be possible to register for a regular check of the website. In this way, a seal of accessibility can be obtained.
Although the site will start off in Dutch, the institute does not rule out the introduction of an English version, thus allowing non-Dutch-speakers to have their sites tested too.
On the whole, I look forward to a situation in which people with a disability, just like people without a disability, can have access to the medium of the Internet without any problems.
I hope that this report can make a contribution to this.
After all, the Internet is a source of information and, do not forget, a means of communicating which is playing an ever greater role in society as a whole.
Technological development should not exclude any groups, but rather help them in their social participation.
Indeed, effective technology is at the service of mankind.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Belder for his outstanding work on this report.
It is an extremely comprehensive document that involved a lot of research.
The task of the shadow rapporteurs has been relatively easy because we have agreed with a lot of the content and we have been looking for ways to further improve the direction of his text.
I want to pick up a few specific points in relation to issues that he has kindly incorporated in the final report.
Firstly, it is correct to emphasise, as he has done, the remarkable opportunities offered to disabled people in society.
The digital revolution will improve the quality of their lives and access to services.
That is something we need to try to exploit together in the most effective way possible.
Those of us who have sat with someone who is partially sighted and seen them use a website realise that there should be better design, and it would not cost anything.
It is a question of education, training and best practice.
That is something the Commission is working on, but we need to emphasise it.
It is something where public authorities can demonstrate best practice and set a lead for others.
As an integral part of that, it is crucial to ensure that we have the instruments in place to benchmark and give access ratings to websites, because public comparison and encouragement of best practice will stimulate everybody to move forward.
That is something the Commission is also working on, but we are right to emphasise that in our report.
That, of course, links in to the question of commercial services.
The users' groups I have talked to - in the United Kingdom in particular - have emphasised the importance of encouraging commercial operators and commercial providers of services to make their websites user-friendly for disabled people.
Those crucial commercial services - such as banks, home-shopping services, access to transport - being able to order transport and look at timetables - need to be made accessible to disabled users.
They will really help them engage with this new revolution.
Having those benchmarks and star ratings will encourage commercial firms to pick them up and to make their websites more accessible which will really deliver the sorts of benefits we are looking for.
I am keen to encourage both of those aspects, but overall this report is extremely worthwhile.
We will not support all the amendments on this side, but that is more an aspect of detail.
The overall thrust of this report is very commendable and I encourage the House to give it its full support.
Mr President, I want to echo Mr Harbour's congratulations to Mr Belder.
He really has worked not only very hard, but also in a very open, intelligent and approachable way.
I think we are seeing the fruits of that method of working in this report.
It has been a great privilege to be part of that.
Indeed, access at its best is the great equaliser, the great force for democracy.
That is why this report is so important: it is providing a mechanism in terms of active citizenship, which is becoming more and more important, for instance electronic democracy.
We are moving towards electronic voting; methods of being engaged as an active citizen more and more depend on access.
But the reason why I wanted to be shadow rapporteur on this report, and to support Mr Belder, was that, for disabled people, access to work depends more and more on access to the web.
Mr Harbour is quite right that much of this does not depend on money, or at least not on huge sums of money, and Mr Belder has been absolutely correct to enter into wide consultation with disabled people themselves.
They already are in a position over and over again to explain to us what is needed, what will work and what will help them.
I want to draw attention particularly to paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution, and I shall quote from it, because it says that disabled people not only should be able to read web pages, but also should be enabled to manage the content of web pages.
In other words, they are not only passive receivers of information, but also serious contributors.
That is absolutely important.
My final point is that this is all part of the Lisbon agenda, making Europe e-friendly and e-workable, and it is going to mean that if this principle is carried through into other areas of work, disabled European Union citizens will be able to participate on much more equal terms in this respect than we have seen to date.
Mr President, Commissioner, democracy must include the right to information; it is needed to improve how people manage their own lives.
Information must be available to all.
The public sector has a responsibility to ensure that the potentially excluded also have the chance to gain access to information.
The Commission's aim to bring the information society within everyone's reach is democracy.
There is no information without learning how to produce and use it oneself.
A connection to the Internet and other tools for accessing information are not enough. People have to be able to and want to use them.
The rapporteur draws attention to the availability and compatibility of special hardware and software.
As a separate issue, I wish to stress the importance of language. Machine language should be translated into human languages.
We need links between people and not just to machines.
In the shadow of privatisation we must not destroy the social institutions that democratise information.
Information services that everyone can use should be produced on television.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we see the Internet as an opportunity for everyone and not as a new source of inequality, exclusion or isolation.
This is why we will always support organisations dedicated not only to fighting 'info-exclusion', but also and principally, in a positive and pro-active way, to enabling the extraordinary resources offered by information technologies to best respond to the needs and aspirations of vulnerable and traditionally marginalised social groups, such as the disabled and the elderly.
We must consequently give this boost all the support we can.
It was during the last European presidency, held by my country, in June 2000, at the summit held in Santa Maria da Feira, that the 'eEurope 2002', action plan was officially adopted. One of its aims was to make the information society accessible to all the citizens of the European Union, focusing in particular on the disabled and on combating 'info-exclusion' in general.
We have kept extremely busy in this field.
The EIB and the Member States' adoption, in 2001, of the guidelines for Web sites was an extremely important development.
Against this background, we welcome the Commission communication and the extraordinary work carried out by the rapporteur.
Although we have doubts about the charitably generous view that the guidelines will be fully implemented by the end of 2003, we feel we must insist on this aim and make particular demands with regard to those public Web sites which, having a specific social function or being of particular importance for the disabled and the elderly, must be the first to fully meet this objective.
There is no logical reason why there should be a delay in this matter.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on focusing on the priority of accessibility, particularly accessibility for the elderly and people with disabilities.
As regards the priority of the accessibility of the content of sites, particularly for the elderly and people with disabilities, I feel that we must focus our attention on civil and political rights, on the accessibility of these rights through the Internet.
I believe that this is the priority as far as content is concerned.
There is an urgent need for on-line publishing of all the formally public parts of institutional life - not just the political process but the judicial and administrative processes too - if we are to recapture one of the basic principles of liberal democracy.
In this regard, I and another 62 Members - and I would point this out to Commissioner Liikanen too - have tabled a motion for a resolution on e-democracy, calling for European citizens to be able to fully enjoy the rights of citizenship guaranteed by the European Union Treaties through the Internet.
I feel that this applies to all levels of public administration: in other words, our priority must be precisely to make it possible for everybody, including, that is, those who have most difficulty, the most trouble in gaining access to the Internet, to be able to fully exercise their civil rights through the Internet, the civil rights of the publishing of information on the work of the institutions, of access to democratic rights, in other words, the civil rights which can be exercised through the Web.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Liikanen again for his excellent presentation, which was also socially sound, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Belder, for his sterling work.
On-line services for all is the European principle on which we compete with the Americans.
Unless everyone is involved our society will flag.
Numerous special groups, such as the disabled, the elderly, single parents, the poor, the unemployed, and so on, are in this position.
The number of old people is increasing.
Even we in the European Union may shortly be going around in blinkers.
Technical barriers must be removed.
That can be dealt with by the engineers, just as long as there is the political will.
Finances are not a barrier.
There exist different solutions, for example, in Sweden and Finland, but everyone, ourselves included, must aspire to the Liikanen objective.
It is important to make it easy to access the web.
Hard copy texts today are already too difficult so for many they will be too difficult on a screen too, but this is a measure of democracy, a measure of e-Europe, Europe's gauntlet of competition for others to pick up.
The extent to which our democracy has developed and matured will be measured by how democratic we are on the web.
Then it will not be a question of accessibility but whether we are included, whether we can participate actively, and whether we are able to bring our own input to the web.
Democracy is not a one-way process, as it can easily be on the web. The elderly, the disabled and all our citizens, the special groups in particular, all must be able to participate and bring their own input to the web.
We therefore have to aspire to that.
If that does not happen democracy will be distorted.
Mr President, my words are also addressed to the voters present, who have come here today in the expectation of an interesting debate, and to the Commissioner, who has just yawned. As yesterday we did not even manage to decide what minimum would make lively debates possible, I shall henceforth be taking the liberty of stating the number of members present when I address them, so I greet fifteen ladies and gentlemen.
This is about the Internet, that is to say the alternative to the performance laid on for you here, and about direct access for you to something that can constitute the democratic opinion-forming process.
We are talking about eEurope; have you tried it out yet?
Have you yet visited Parliament's website, or the Council's, or the Commission's?
If you did, did you feel the way I did?
You feel as if you are facing a wall full of binder files.
Some people get aroused by the binder files, but most do not.
It is children and young people who are looking for something different, seeking information and debate.
That is possible; Europe has the chance to make it so, but we - by which I mean also we in this House - have to work like crazy on the design of our websites and also on their subject matter.
The most important information is not there.
That having been said, the Internet is of real importance to democracy.
That brings me to my ceterum censeo: apart from that, there can be no democracy without transparency!
Mr President, I would just like to correct what Mr Hans-Peter Martin said: there were 18 Members listening to his speech!
Mr President, there are 37 million people with disabilities in the European Union, while the number of older Europeans is also steadily increasing.
Mr Belder was able to use much richer language here, but I share the same conclusion.
These groups risk severe social exclusion due to a range of technical barriers they face when using the Internet.
The Commission is fully committed to taking action to identify and remove these barriers at European level, in order to secure an inclusive society providing equal opportunities for all.
The Commission Communication on web accessibility is an integral part of the eEurope 2002 Action Plan adopted at the European Council of Feira in June 2000.
One of its specific aims is to ensure that people with disabilities benefit fully from new technologies and the Internet.
Representative organisations of disabled people such as the European Disability Forum have been widely consulted and we will pursue this consultation on issues such as eInclusion and eAccessibility when implementing the eEurope 2005 Action Plan to be adopted by the European Council in Seville next week.
All the areas where we propose new actions must be available to anyone with a disability.
The Commission is committed in particular to promoting the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines, which provide a voluntary mechanism for public information providers and website builders to conform to a set of informal rules on designing and structuring websites.
Many of the Member States have already taken steps towards this goal.
The Commission therefore welcomes the overall level of interest and satisfaction that this communication has received from the European Parliament.
I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, who drew up a very balanced and complete report on this issue.
As regard specific issues raised in his report, the Commission agrees with the encouragement to Member States to ensure that the underlying objectives of improved web accessibility are achieved, to raise awareness and speed up implementation of the Guidelines and to organise follow-up of the achievements in this field.
Most of these objectives are also set out in the Council of Telecommunications Ministers resolution on this subject.
The Commission has already taken steps systematically to monitor progress in adopting and implementing the guidelines at European level as part of the eEurope benchmarking effort.
We agree with the requirement that web sites developed by the Commission and other European institutions should follow these guidelines.
During the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003, the Commission will promote awareness of web accessibility and training initiatives for website builders and content providers.
The Commission will continue its fruitful dialogue with organisations representing people with special needs, including the disabled and the elderly, to have their experience and guidance in these matters.
I am convinced that the European Parliament resolution on this subject will be a significant milestone in understanding the role and importance of accessibility in the inclusive information society.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)
Mr President, we held an important vote on Strasbourg yesterday.
However, you do not need to have a particularly developed sense of smell to notice that something is rotten in Strasbourg!
I would like you to ask the relevant department to do something to get rid of these unpleasant smells.
Mr President, on a point of order on the same issue, there is a distinctly unpleasant odour permeating this building, not just in this Chamber, but outside as well.
Last month the Quaestors told us that the reason for this smell then was that an animal had died in one of the drains.
Are we expected to accept the same excuse this month?
It is not acceptable.
We should not be asked to work under these conditions.
Staff should not be asked to work under these conditions.
It is high time something was done.
We will refer the matter to the Quaestors.
Mr President, I just wish to declare that, due to a financial interest which has been registered with the parliamentary authorities, I will not be participating in this vote.
Would the Commission please inform us of its position regarding the amendments.
Mr President, I would like to endorse the thanks expressed by my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, to the European Parliament and especially the draftsman, Mr Berenguer Fuster, for their cooperation and efficient handling of this file.
As you know, the Commission supports the Council common position because it is fully consistent with the essential objectives pursued in the Commission proposal.
It also takes account of the most important amendments at first reading.
The Commission would like to confirm that it accepts Amendments Nos 1, 3 to 8, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 16.
With regard to Amendment No 17, the Commission can accept it, although it considers that a minor redrafting is needed to avoid any legal misinterpretation.
The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 13, 14 and 18, for the following reasons: Amendment No 2 excludes from the proposal a large number of insurance intermediaries, which minimises the scope of the directive.
It cannot therefore be accepted.
Amendment No 9 introduces transitional provisions to safeguard the acquired rights of existing insurance intermediaries.
The Commission has already accepted Amendment No 15, which expresses the same objective in better terms and, in addition, meets all the concerns of the directive.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 13, which introduces the principle of best possible advice.
It creates great legal uncertainty and would in practice be a source of legal conflict.
Amendment No 16, which the Commission accepts, goes in the same direction as the common position and improves it.
Amendments Nos 14 and 18 put in jeopardy the key objective of high consumer protection, something that the Commission cannot accept.
Indeed, if they were accepted they would deprive the customer of the basic information requirements.
Amendment No 18 in particular would leave the customer in a position of uncertainty, as he would not be provided with the written advice on the appropriate insurer's product recommended by the intermediary.
The objective of achieving a true single market with a high level of consumer protection would not be achieved.
The Commission strongly opposes this amendment.
I thank you for your rather limited attention.
(Laughter, applause)
I apologise for the noise.
Regarding Amendment No 17:
Mr President, in accordance with the Commission's comments, I would like to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 17 saying the same thing, but in a different place.
So instead of being at the end of the recital, the paragraph proposed in Amendment No 17 would be after 'other professional activity?, so that the amendment would read: 'This Directive should not be applied to persons who conduct another professional activity, for example, a tax expert or accountant who advises on insurance incidentally as part of that other professional activity", and here the paragraph proposed in the Amendment would be included, "or to those simply providing general information on insurance products?.
The rest of the recital would remain as it was drawn up in the common position.
We will ask the services responsible to examine all the translations.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0208/2002) by Mr Konrad K. Schwaiger, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal and amended proposal for a Council decision adopting a specific programme 2002-2006 for research and training to be carried out by the Joint Research Centre by means of direct actions for the European Atomic Energy Community [COM(2001) 279 - C5-0334/2001 + COM(2002) 43 - C5 -0216/ 2002 - 2001/0126(CNS)]
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0193/2002) by Mr SÃ©rgio Marques, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council decision on the arrangements concerning the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands [COM(2001) 732 - C5-0691/2001 - 2001/0284(CNS)]
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Mr President, in paragraph 47, the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to add the name, 'The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'.
The original version simply reads 'Macedonia'.
Obviously, that is not a linguistic mistake but a highly political issue.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party proposes that we vote on the original version.
If there are no objections, we will look into the matter at the appropriate moment.
Mr President, I too have something to say about paragraph 47, but it is something rather more important.
There is something wrong with it.
It contains the words: '? a treaty concluded last month between the Republic of Yugoslavia and Macedonia', but the treaty was concluded last year.
It sparked the crisis in Kosovo.
I ask that this serious mistake be corrected.
Mr President, in negotiations, we accepted the text in its original version.
We recognised the undoubted error of not calling a state by its name, and so the correction was made to its present form, 'The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', which is the state's official name.
We think Parliament would only be making itself ridiculous if it were, on the grounds of particular sentiments or political tendencies, to call a state by a name other than that which belongs to it.
Mr Sakellariou, it is very simple.
The House can decide whether to accept the variation proposed by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m.
Mr President, however we express ourselves privately or as a matter of personal preference - for my part, I always say 'Macedonia' - we have to use the official name in Parliamentary documents.
I therefore see this as being about the official use of language rather than about voting.
So we should not be having a vote on it at all.
(Applause)
Mr President, we have just voted on texts referring, for example, to 'India' rather than 'the Republic of India' or anything else of the sort, and so this text reads 'Macedonia'.
If somebody wants to change this for reasons that are recognisably political, that is an oral amendment, and has to be dealt with under the relevant procedure.
Mr President, what is ridiculous is that this Chamber, which is a political organisation, calls a state by an acronym.
However, it seems to me the existing text provides an interesting balance.
Certainly the title in the English version says "FYROM" and then the body of the paragraph sensibly says "Macedonia".
Surely we can satisfy everybody with this text.
Let us stick to this text.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
As a coordinator and negotiator, I have to say that it is true that we always refer to the official name for official documents.
However much I would like to use the word Macedonia on its own, it still appears purer to me to use the official name that is internationally accepted in this official text.
The fact is that this is FYROM, and let us adhere to this.
On the basis of Mr Oostlander's explanation, would the House please decide whether the term FYROM should be used.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0190/2002) by Mr Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, on the state of enlargement negotiations [COM(2001) 700 - C5-0024/2002 - 2002/2023(COS)]
Before the vote:
Mr President, contrary to the assertion that has just been made, the present report, from beginning to end, refers to 'Cyprus', 'Slovenia' and 'Slovakia'.
I ask that these should be replaced by the states' official names in all instances where they occur.
Mr President, before we vote on Amendment No 88, I should like to draw the attention of my fellow MEPs to a mistake that has crept into the translation of Amendment No 91.
In this Amendment, it is stated that if Amendment No 88 is adopted, No 91 will lapse, but there is a crucial difference.
Amendment No 88 contains the word 'prostitution, and the fight against prostitution'. In No 91, the word is deleted from the English translation.
All other translations are incorrect.
Amendment No 91 therefore states that opposition is being expressed in respect of human trafficking and prostitution of minors, but not to prostitution itself.
This is the key difference between Amendments Nos 88 and 91.
Mr President, there is a mistake in the Swedish text.
It reads, 'increased access for the Mediterranean countries?, when it should read 'developing countries'.
I hope that other language versions are correct.
We will refer the matter to the linguistic services.
Regarding paragraphs 33 and 34:
Mr President, I wish to present to the House an oral amendment on paragraphs 33 and 34 to reflect the fact that at the beginning of the week Cyprus closed the competition policy chapter.
Paragraph 33 therefore needs to be updated to say that 28 negotiating chapters have so far been provisionally closed rather than 27.
The start of paragraph 34 also needs to be corrected to read as follows: 'Notes that the only remaining chapters are those which will be dealt with on a horizontal basis for all candidate countries, namely agriculture, financial and budgetary provisions.?
The remainder of this paragraph would then lapse.
Mr President, there is an error in Amendment No 1 in the Swedish text.
The correct version states that the 'increase? in the total EU quota is kept within the limits proposed by the Commission, but the Swedish text reads 'reduction?.
We will carry out the necessary check.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I know that there is a match, Mr Ebner, but we must press on.
Report (A5-0154/2002) by Mrs Ewa Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication 'Pedestrian protection: Commitment by the European automobile industry' [COM(2001) 389 - C5-0537/2001 - 2001/2216(COS)]
Before the vote:
Mr President, according to the German version of paragraph 18, the pedestrian casualties are to be pursued.
Perhaps the drivers should be pursued, but certainly not the victims of the accidents.
This should therefore be corrected.
In order to improve the operation of taxation systems in the internal market, the Garcia-Margallo y Marfil report wishes in particular to 'support the VAT strategy adopted by the Commission in 2000?.
The rapporteur says that he is? convinced? that 'the EU must continue to strive towards the definitive VAT system?.
We voted against this report because we do not see why we should spend European taxpayers' money on training officials so as to impose a uniform tax system that is one of the most inequitable in existence.
In fact, whether rich or poor, consumers pay an identical amount of tax on products they buy - nearly 20% of the price of most products in France.
This tax is therefore heavier in relative terms for those with more modest incomes.
The predominant role of VAT in the budget income of a country like France, and more generally in Europe, reflects the fact that it is the working class that finances the majority of state expenditure.
Only by abolishing indirect taxation can we serve the interests of the majority of the population.
State expenditure should by financed by heavy taxation of company profits and by direct income tax based on a single and highly progressive scale weighted chiefly towards higher tax brackets.
. (PT) Although we agree with much of the report and broadly support it, our votes reflect the considerable care we always take when dealing with these matters and the permanent vigilance that must be maintained with regard to any changes to the status quo which explicitly or implicitly point towards a communitarisation of fiscal policy, something we are not in favour of.
. (FR) We are voting against Konstantinos Alyssandrakis's report on the programme for research and training on nuclear energy.
This report in fact supports the Commission's position in this field and is very much in the spirit of the Euratom Treaty, an outdated treaty with the very much official objective of promoting the use of nuclear energy, which is in itself highly questionable.
Financing is accordingly chiefly directed towards research on nuclear fusion, which the industrial establishment claims the same virtues for now that it once attributed to nuclear fission - and we all know what that led to!
It goes without saying that funds will have to continue to be committed to research on radioactive waste, given that such large quantities of this waste have been generated in such an irresponsible way.
However, they will not be managed in the same way given the political approach that has been adopted.
By emphasising deep geological disposal, the programme before us seeks to make nuclear generation socially acceptable by evading the most contentious aspect.
If we are really to tackle the problem we are faced with, the first step we need to take, as a matter of urgency, is to stop producing such waste, and then to steer research towards in situ waste management as part of a strategy of abandoning nuclear power.
.
(DE) As long as nuclear power stations are operated in Europe, the highest priority should be given to protecting the health of EU citizens and their environment.
We have, by adopting Mr Schwaiger's report, made an essential contribution to nuclear safety being able to be researched in even greater depth in the future.
I have in mind especially the safety of existing reactors in Europe and in the candidate countries.
Even before enlargement, there is a need for Europe-wide safety standards to be created for nuclear power stations, so that we can provide the citizens of an enlarged EU with a high degree of safety in this area.
I see it as a task for the Joint Research Centre to lay the foundations for common safety standards of this kind.
It is for this reason that the delegation of the Austrian Freedom Party has voted in favour of this report and of Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 in particular.
Mr President, although I did not vote against the report on the arrangements concerning the AIEM tax applicable in the Canary Islands, that was because I did not want simply to follow the example of Commissioner Bolkestein and our rapporteur by accepting the entire 'Spanish connection' which has been set up in such a way as to totally violate the principles of the single market and the free movement of goods.
I am in favour of adopting special measures for the peripheral regions under Article 299 of the Treaty.
However, the tricks that the Spanish authorities are getting up to for certain products, in terms of incongruity, discrimination and distortion of competition, have nothing to do with protecting local production, although they would certainly ensure full employment for lawyers, because the victims, such as producers of rum, gin and vodka in Spain itself, will not take this lying down.
What is more, it really is extraordinary that the Commissioner, who, when it comes to other dossiers, is so resolute about safeguarding the free movement of products within the single market, is willing to present a proposal as discriminatory as this, which is to apply retroactively and for a period of ten years, up to December 2011. I think that this is over the top.
Moreover, this is all without any reference to the economic and social development of the Islands or to the promotion of local activities. I would like to warn the Commission and the Member States, who in the Council have given way to real blackmail by the presidency, against the dangerous precedent that they are in the process of setting.
The Council would do better not to approve Article 1 of this decision in view of the Parliament's opinion. This House would have been better advised to follow the opinion of its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which should ultimately have been responsible here.
On the pretext of preserving fish stocks in EU waters, the Commission wants to reducing fishing capacity with the loss of 28 000 direct jobs by 2006.
This report emphasises that the studies the Commission has based its proposals on are not very reliable.
However, it in no way questions a process under which the biggest polluters are not paying. By that I mean pollutant waste from industry and large industrial fishing units, which nevertheless cause more damage to the sea than small-scale fishing.
Although we voted for the handful of timid support measures for wage-earners in the fisheries sector and for crew safety, we abstained on the report as a whole.
We accept that it is in our own future interest to safeguard the planet's fish resources.
However, by refusing to deal with those who are really responsible for this threat, and furthermore by failing to tackle an anarchic economic system, under which competition and the pursuit of private profit mean that any attempt at rational planning is purely illusory, we are not dealing with the problem and are content to make small-scale fishermen foot the bill, which is unacceptable.
Although it is clear to me that there is a need to reform the common fisheries policy as quickly as possible, and although I recognise that the stocks covered by this proposal for a regulation have been weakened, I nevertheless consider that this reform, as envisaged here, is unbalanced and could make us forget that the protection of fish resources, while necessary, should in no way be at the expense of fishermen.
It seems to me that this report does not devote enough attention to the men and women who, aware that the very survival of their livelihood depends above all on the management and preservation of fish stocks, have already undertaken to make enormous efforts in that direction.
This report seems to me to be a kind of Trojan horse in terms of the future common fisheries policy as presented now by the Commissioner responsible, Mr Fischler.
I shall therefore be voting against this motion for a resolution, which I regard as a motion that ignores human beings and proposes measures with traumatic and brutal consequences for the fisheries chain.
We voted 'no' in the final vote on this report, in spite of there being certain parts of it which improved the Commission proposal, including the new chapter on the important socio-economic impact assessments and the somewhat larger reduction in fishing effort with regard to sand eel and whiting.
We nonetheless believe, however, particularly against the background of the very necessary programme, recently presented by the Commission, for reforming the common fisheries policy, that, on quite a few points, this report is unfortunate in the way it forestalls the overall view of this reform that is required.
On this basis, we think it particularly unfortunate that the report states that the compensation to be paid to those fishermen and ship owners hit by a temporary cessation of activity 'shall be fully paid by the EU?.
That is inappropriate in the way it sets in stone a certain approach when it comes to structural measures, and we believe that the Commission proposal, which recommends the co-funding of such compensation, is quite clearly to be preferred.
.
(PT) With regard to hake, given the current relative level of exploitation, regardless of the reliability or the limitations of the basic information, the level of fishing is too high, and so temporary reductions in fishing would be beneficial and a reduction for the 2002-2006 period seems to be essential if we are to achieve an appropriate exploitation of these stocks.
We can, therefore, accept the Commission's concern to reduce fishing efforts, but under no circumstances can we accept that this reduction should be undertaken by reducing vessel numbers, entailing the definitive loss of fishing licences.
There are other, equally effective means of managing fisheries so as to ensure appropriate fishing levels, such as, for example, reducing the amount of days per year on which fishing can take place until stocks recover to acceptable numbers.
This would significantly reduce the socio-economic problems of businesses currently holding fishing rights.
Where cod is concerned, the stock situation appears to be more serious, requiring rather more severe measures than those proposed for hake, although they could vary according to the species.
In any event, these measures must also be temporary and must never involve vessel reductions or the definitive loss of fishing licences.
We regret that the distinction between the two cases, hake and cod, should not have been accepted and this is another reason for our vote against the report.
The way the dossier on the recovery of cod and hake stocks has been handled is typical of an inward-looking approach by the Commission which misdiagnoses the situation because it is cut off from reality and thus makes poor decisions.
The misdiagnosis is this: it is true that in certain fishing areas stocks of cod are in a perilous state, but this cannot simply be attributed to overfishing: there are also many other factors that come into play here.
As for hake, the situation is specific and quite different: the biological cycles are much shorter and recovery has already started, so that the measures proposed by the Commission will come totally at the wrong point in the cycle.
As for poor decisions, managing the total allowable catch on a multiannual basis is a good measure, and one for which we have been calling for years, but it should be implemented by means of annual variations limited to rates which the professions involved can cope with.
With regard to the structural measures proposed, they do not take account of the economic and social consequences for the various professions concerned and reflect the same Malthusian spirit as the proposed reform of the CFP. They are totally unacceptable.
. (ES) Amendment No 1 having been rejected by the plenary (the Varela Amendment, adopted in the Committee on Fisheries), Article 1 of the Commission's proposal is fully retained, which includes hake and also a precautionary biomass target of 165 000 tonnes.
Taking into account that this target was questioned by the most recent scientific recommendations, reducing it to 145 000 tonnes, and that the Commission itself said in meetings of the Northern hake workshop that a target of 120 000 tonnes could be acceptable, we cannot vote in favour of a Proposal that includes hake and that sets the target at 165 000 tonnes.
There is also a contradiction in the Stihler report, as in her explanatory statement the rapporteur herself recognises this quantity of 165 000 tonnes as being 'too high" (Biomass Targets) and in her conclusions she says that "a relaxation in the targets for hake [?] should be allowed".
The plenary has also adopted amendments that improve the Commission's proposal, which we have supported, so neither can we reject those improvements which, although they are inadequate, do, however, prevent us from voting against the report, which is why we have abstained in the final vote on it.
.
(DE) Mrs Ayuso, the rapporteur, has drafted a text that is much closer to the proposal for a compromise between the Council and the Commission on ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin.
Treating this matter as an urgent subject of major importance in Strasbourg now opens up the possibility of our vote being followed by an agreement at last.
Only thus can we give our farmers and traditional small-scale distilleries the security that they so urgently need in order to be able to plan ahead.
There is no sense in discriminating against the producers of agricultural alcohol while leaving synthetic alcohol unaffected.
It is for that reason that we referred this matter back to the Agriculture Committee weeks ago.
The changed language in the new Commission proposal at last allows the Member States to enact their own supplementary regulations at national level.
Only this will make it possible for small distilleries in the EU to survive.
The cultivation of potatoes and cereals for the purpose of extracting alcohol and the utilisation of fruit from flourishing fruit meadows ensures the continued existence of these valued cultural landscapes, which, without national supplementary regulations, will be in extreme danger.
.
(DE) Parliament's Agricultural Committee voted unanimously on the CMO for ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin.
I reject any COM in agricultural alcohol and call for a 'lenient regulation'.
I therefore support, on the whole, the proposed compromise brought in by the Spanish presidency of the Council, that is, without the articles on subsidies.
If the present German regulations were to lapse and new promotional opportunities to be created by granting area payments, that would constitute a completely new approach, one that would be neither of equal financial value nor capable of being an effective promotional instrument.
The production of agricultural alcohol currently provides an additional income for many family-run farms, which thus see it as a secondary means of support.
This is indeed about fruit and caring for cultural landscapes - it is also about the many small and medium-sized enterprises that need the distillery on the family farm for the important additional income it provides as a secondary means of support.
I therefore ask the Commission to take on board the Spanish proposal for a compromise and Parliament's position.
I voted for the joint resolution although there has not yet been ratification of the Nice Treaty in Ireland.
Until or unless another referendum is passed, this remains the legal position.
In its resolution on preparations for the Seville European Council to be held on 21-22 June 2002, the European Parliament has made an appeal for a 'communitarised' European immigration policy based on the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
There is a serious misunderstanding on this point.
The immigration situation may be getting out of control in Europe, but it is not because there is no supranational policy.
It is because for a long time neither the Member States nor the Commission have wanted to give absolute priority to the safety of the public and to controlling immigration, which inevitably means combating clandestine immigration and regulating legal migration flows.
Just the opposite has happened in fact. Both the Member States and the Commission have given priority to uncontrolled freedom of movement, to dismantling internal borders, to a benevolent attitude toward asylum-seekers - even those who are clearly abusing the system - and to the belief that massive immigration would solve our demographic problems and lack of dynamism.
The result is now clear for all to see.
But the solution is not supranational integration of immigration policy based on false priorities.
The first part of the solution is to change those priorities, but we are still a long way from doing that today.
The joint resolution on the Seville European Council once again calls on major international institutions like the UN and NATO to play a fire-fighting role in various conflicts, ranging from the crisis in the Middle East to the border conflict between India and Pakistan.
Unfortunately, in all these recent conflicts, without going back any further in time, these international institutions have acted as instruments of the major powers and have served the policies of those powers, which first and foremost still means maintaining their total world domination.
Fire-fighters who indulge in arson do not deserve our trust.
The remaining possibilities set out in this resolution on the future of Europe are totally at odds with what the people of this continent consider desirable.
The social part of this resolution at best rings hollow, and is limited to lifelong learning, whereas what Europe's workers would like to be assured of is a lifelong job, that is to say employment throughout their working life.
Even worse, the resolution is full of new threats to the workforce, given that it advocates the idea of opening the market in public services and exposing it to the clutches of the private sector.
We will certainly not find a humane solution to the problems of immigration by closing access to Europe, for example by creating additional European border guards as proposed here.
We did not take part in the vote on this resolution.
.
(PT) We are voting against the joint resolution because unacceptable positions have been adopted, particularly given the pressure still being put on the people of Ireland to ratify the Treaty of Nice by making an inappropriate link between its ratification and enlargement. Or given the insistence on an EU-NATO agreement on the use of resources and on the operational arrangements of the ESDP.
It is also unacceptable that attempts are being made to make more rapid progress on Community policies in the field of immigration and asylum that are even more restrictive than current legislation in some Member States.
What was needed, as proposed in the GUE/NGL motion, which was not approved, was for greater attention to have been paid to economic and social cohesion in the Member States, conducting a review of economic and monetary policies, specifically those of the Stability Pact, and stopping the process of liberalisation and deregulation. Particular care also needed to be taken with the social dimension of enlargement of the European Union and greater firmness and determination needed to be shown in producing initiatives for the developing countries and for promoting peace, with a particular emphasis on protecting the Palestinian people.
- (FR) The European Council in Seville, which marks the end of a very positive Spanish Presidency, will focus on the fight against illegal immigration, enlargement and the future of the European Union, including a presentation by President ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing on progress with the work of the Convention.
The General Affairs Council, which met yesterday in Luxembourg, demonstrated the widespread confusion about the proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy in all the countries where this sector is of economic, social and cultural importance.
We expect the Community to advocate reason, moderation and cooperation.
The European Council should approach the problem of illegal immigration in the wider context of a common policy on asylum and immigration.
It should concentrate on the common administration of the external borders of the Community of Fifteen and on integrating migration policy in the EU's external relations.
It should address the public's expectations without resorting to populism but with all the firmness that this very worrying situation demands.
The enlargement negotiations have made good progress under the Spanish Presidency.
However, the concerns of the agricultural and rural world which were demonstrated in Strasbourg on Tuesday indicate the vital importance of entering into dialogue before taking decisions affecting millions of Europeans.

Discussions of European summits are so much hot air, for it is of course at these ritual gatherings - to which representatives elected by universal suffrage are not invited, still less ordinary citizens - that the future of 380 million people is discussed in the greatest secrecy.
The Seville Summit, like those of Genoa, Nice and Brussels, is a new and sad illustration of the democratic bankruptcy that characterises the construction of Europe.
This summit will be marked politically and ideologically by the liberal right and the extreme right.
The latter, buoyed up by its recent electoral successes in France and the Netherlands, has been able to impose its populism and xenophobic demagoguery upon the Fifteen, notably on issues of immigration and the right to asylum.
All that will be at stake is strengthening Fortress Europe, whereas it is urgently necessary to combat trafficking, mafias and secrecy through a policy of opening up frontiers, normalising the status of those without papers and giving nationals and foreigners equal civic and social rights.
Immigrants and asylum seekers easily serve as scapegoats for societies that have become the victims of economic liberalism and capitalist globalisation.
The anti-immigrant hysteria organised by the heads of government ends up by disguising the real agendas of the Seville Summit, the anti-social Barcelona Summit and the neo-colonial Madrid Summit.
The joint resolution is part and parcel of this trend.
I am delighted that Parliament has overwhelmingly approved paragraph 49 regretting the passing by the US Senate of a bill which would allow for the use of force by the US to prevent its citizens from being tried by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The overwhelming support for that paragraph (385 Members in favour) indicates that D66 was right to raise this issue in Parliament because the success of the ICC is a European issue.
Despite these and other important positions I subscribe to, I hesitated to vote in favour because of the following passage: "6.
Stresses that the ratification of the Nice Treaty by all Member States will facilitate a successful enlargement process".
It is factually incorrect to suggest that ratification of the Treaty of Nice facilitates the enlargement process.
During the Nice summit, our governments' leaders chose to make Europe slightly less democratic and less efficient.
Moreover, by going further down the road of intergovernmentalism (and consequently less transparency) the Treaty of Nice leads Europe in the opposite direction to where we need to go.

Mr President, I have naturally voted in favour of the Brok report, but I regret that the results and the recommendations of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have not been incorporated in the report itself but have merely crept in via amendments.
We should realise that half of the people in the candidate countries are women.
We have little or nothing to offer to those countries: no money, no immediate prospects of many jobs or anything else.
What do we have to offer?
The acquis communautaire and the equal opportunities policy for women, and I regret that this has not been sufficiently highlighted.
This is a sine qua non.
We simply have to include this; I cannot express it in any other way.
I hope that today's results and the amendments in the debate on enlargement will be taken into consideration and that the debate on equal opportunities for women will be continued.
Mr President, I have restricted myself to a single explanation of vote, and I hope the Presidency will, at least, allow me that one!
I voted for the Brok report and, as representative of the Delegation to the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee, I would like to point something out.
There is a translation error in the French version of the explanatory statement.
Indeed, 'Bulgaria continues to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria?, as stated in the original English version, as opposed to 'is striving to fulfil? them.
Moreover, I feel that it is important to stress that, from the political point of view, we should provide for all the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe to become Members of the European Union en bloc and for those countries which are economically behind to receive help once they have entered the Union.
I feel that it is a political error not to accept all these candidate countries together.
In particular, as regards Bulgaria, I am concerned that the closure of units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy power station will affect the Bulgarian people badly, especially the elderly, the unemployed and young people in search of employment.
. (EL) The Communist Party of Greece has stressed repeatedly that the so-called enlargement of the ?U is motivated neither by charity towards the nations involved nor historical necessity.
It is a classic example of imperialist expansionism which has found fertile ground following the collapse of the Socialist system in Europe and the break up of the USSR.
The aim is to bring small, weak countries under the umbrella of the western European wing of the international imperialist system.
As the European Parliament's resolution reveals, enlargement goes hand in glove with the eastward expansion of NATO.
The entire accession process reminds me of colonial-type dependencies.
Its sole purpose to is hand the national wealth of these countries over to western European capital and bring them into line with capitalist restructuring (the famous "acquis communautaire"), grab their public property and wipe out everything Socialism achieved, in collusion with the local Mafia.
The consequences for the multitude of small and medium-sized farmers in the candidate countries will be devastating.
As regards the accession of Cyprus, our party warned a long time ago that the Helsinki decision would make it easier to impose a solution which maintained the partition.
Unfortunately, events over recent months have proven us right.
Candidate status had a coercive effect on Cyprus and encouraged Turkish intransigence, with the complicity of the ?U. And the welcome reference in the report to a single sovereign Cypriot state does nothing to change this.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
The Brok report urges Member States and candidate countries to make the effort required to conclude the accession negotiations at the end of this year so that the accession treaties might be signed in about April 2003 with a view to ten new countries' joining in 2004.
We heartily approve of such a move.
At the Berlin Council in 1999, six candidate countries had in fact been expected to join the EU in 2002.
Well, here we are in 2002, and no country has joined.
We cannot continue like this.
As I shall state in my explanation of vote on the BÃ¶ge report, we have to break down the last barriers while retaining a sense of what is realistic.
In any case, there is at least one problem that is not really a problem: the non-ratification of the Treaty of Nice by the Irish people.
If, by chance they were again to reject this faulty treaty in a second referendum (despite the blandishments of the Seville Council, with its teasing declaration of respect for Irish military neutrality), enlargement would not be compromised for all that. It would be enough to include the relevant parts of the Treaty of Nice in the future accession treaty.
Moreover, the opportunity could be taken to revise them, which would be no bad thing.
The dismantling of public services; industrial restructuring, leading to an explosion in unemployment, particularly in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania and Poland; the actual or planned closing-down of energy sources in Lithuania, Estonia and Bulgaria, with dramatic social and economic repercussions; the planned elimination of millions of smallholdings in Poland, Slovenia and Hungary and the dismissal of those for whom they provide a living, albeit a meagre one; and the policy for reducing agricultural production, which the European authorities want to emphasise everywhere.
It is a disastrous state of affairs for these countries and, more so, for those of their inhabitants who work in the towns and in the countryside.
It is a state of affairs on which, however, the EU authorities congratulate themselves, since the main European tobacco producer, Bulgartabak, is to be privatised and since the privatisation of the banks, insurance companies, telecommunications companies and other industries is progressing at the same time as direct foreign investment is increasing.
To put it another way, here we go again with the systematic bleeding of Central and Eastern European countries by big investors, particularly from Western Europe.
What, then, motivates the consortium of affluent countries constituted by the EU is, first of all, widening the scope for profit offered to their industrial and financial trusts.
Our vote is not a vote against the entry of these countries into the European Union, but a protest against the way in which their entry is being managed, that is to say under the aegis of big investors.
We have voted against the Brok report on enlargement.
Quite obviously, we are not opposed to integrating new countries into the EU.
Nonetheless, we have reservations about the way in which the negotiations are currently proceeding.
We are also concerned about the burden faced by the candidate countries in transposing the 'acquis communautaire', which varies between 70 000 and 90 000 pages of text, depending upon the translation.
Where agricultural, health and environmental matters are concerned, the challenges are enormous.
Moreover, making the entry of these countries conditional upon their strict observance of the legislation on the protection of biodiversity is unfair. Let us not forget that these countries are coming to us to consolidate peace on the continent of Europe, develop their infrastructures and make up for having been behind economically because of their insufficiently developed infrastructures.
Let us not forget this.
I welcome Mr Brok's report, which shows that real progress has been made in the enlargement process.
There is now a real possibility of ten new Member States joining in 2004 and taking part in that year's European elections.
It now also looks possible that Romania and Bulgaria could join in 2007.
What is now required is a display of real political will and compromise on all sides to ensure that the momentum is sustained.
Copenhagen has the potential to be a truly historic summit.
.
(NL) Enlargement is not progressing as successfully as its staunchest supporters in the East and West had hoped.
Four Member States, namely Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden, want the agricultural funds and regional funds to be reorganised first.
Germany and Austria are making demands on behalf of the German speakers who were driven away from the Czech Republic and Poland, and are taking measures against the influx of migrants from the east.
Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria want to use EU money to build motorways right across areas of outstanding natural beauty.
Rumour has it that an election victory for the former Prime Minister, Mr Meciar, in Slovakia will exclude that country from the first wave of accession countries.
Dangerous nuclear plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria will only close if this is paid for by the EU.
The East remains poor because it exports cheap agricultural products and mining products, and has to import expensive technology.
In the existing EU area, political parties that are not so keen on solidarity with economically weaker states and that associate the enlargement to include new Member States mainly with higher costs and the influx of migrants, receive the support of a large proportion of the electorate.
A large accession wave in 2004 is therefore becoming increasingly less likely.
On account of a few positive points, I would nevertheless have been able to vote for this report, but the added plea for enlargement of NATO made it ultimately unacceptable to me.
.
(PT) WE frequently hear one another talking in the name of Europe. Nevertheless, this common platitude is actually a perversion of the truth: there are only 15 of us in the EU; Europe has many more States, peoples and nations than only we 15.
We are mentioning this in order to get across our basic viewpoint in this debate: enlargement is essential and is a political development of enormous significance, from which we cannot shy away.
Enlargement does, admittedly, pose challenges and difficulties, but we shall have to face them and overcome them, because this is our fate and in order for the European project, of which the Union is a part, to have real meaning.
We feel that that most important thing is for Europeans to be united, and that this should take precedence over all other political agendas.
For this reason we also reject the stubborn institutional fantasies of those Members who have turned the federalist credo into a religion and who worship the power of Brussels, believing it to be divine and interfere in everything and wish to regulate everything - future events and even those in the past.
By acting in this way, they are only creating unnecessary resistance and dangerous tensions.
The Union - it is time this were pointed out - was not established so that we could interfere in each other's business, but so that we could cooperate in mutual respect and gain as much as possible from pooling our common energies.
.
(DE) Preparation for enlargement does not need to be as rapid as possible, but it does need to be done as well as possible.
The report is defective in essential areas, and we have therefore voted against it, although it also contains proposals that correspond to our positions.
Paragraph 50 does not address the Czech Amnesty Law of 1946, the repeal of which was determinedly demanded by Parliament in 1999 in relation to the Bene? decrees.
The present text thus constitutes a retrograde step.
It is, however, gratifying that the report gives dates for closure of the Ignalina, Bohunice and Kozloduy power stations.
As regards Temelin, the report is disappointing when one considers that Parliament, as recently as last year, called for an international conference on phasing it out.
Amendment No 45 deals with reform of the CAP, and does so in a way that the Freedom Party delegation has been advocating for many years.
The amendment takes a positive line on the programme of support for border regions.
All the reasons stated mean that we have been unable to vote in favour of the report.
As we are in favour of the enlargement of the EU, with the populations of the applicant countries ultimately deciding on a membership, we have voted in favour of the report.
However, we cannot support certain parts of the report.
Firstly, the general support for the applicant states' rapprochement with NATO and the reference to NATO as an important element in the security and stability structure of Europe.
We see NATO's role as far more complicated than that.
We would therefore have found it wiser to keep this discussion out of this report.
Secondly, we voted against all the amendments in paragraph 50, because the Bene? decrees are a translation of the Allies' Potsdam decisions.
They ensured the exiling of those Germans who had always wanted to live in Germany and therefore sought to oppress the non-German population.
This exiling should be supported even if, and particularly because, it still has legal repercussions today.
As an avid but critical supporter of the enlargement process, I felt the need to vote against the Brok report on the progress of the applicant countries.
Firstly, the Brok report incorrectly states that the applicant countries continue to fulfil the political criteria set in Copenhagen in 1993.
That is incorrect.
If Parliament took the Commission's country reports seriously, we could not ignore the numerous examples of corruption, discrimination against minorities, lack of human rights protection and weak judicial systems in some applicant countries.
I believe that human rights and the rule of law need to be the top priority for Parliament in the enlargement debate.
Therefore I regard the report, which explicitly denies the problems that still exist in this area, as unacceptable.
I am delighted that amendments underlining the absolute priority of the political criteria have been adopted along the lines of my own amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to its opinion.
Parliament must now take its own words seriously and look in detail at the human rights situation in the applicant countries.
