This means that we need to stir up a debate in workplaces, in schools, at the dinner table and even amongst the peace-keeping soldiers we send abroad in the name of the UN.
Those countries with which we have agreements need support.
I was speaking about this very subject with women in Kyiv in Ukraine just last Saturday.
I have also discussed this a great deal with womenâs groups from Turkey.
There is much to do in this field.
Many of the proposals in this report today are very constructive.
We also need to review the scale of punishments.
In Sweden, for example, the maximum punishment for grievous sexual attacks on children is the same as that for serious fraud.
There is room for thought on this matter.
In New York they have successfully reduced crime perpetrated against women and violence against women.
I see this as a first step towards being able to achieve the same in Europe, but to do so requires us to agree on just how unacceptable and heinous this situation is.
Â Â  â Madam President, the mere fact that we are talking about violence against women in 2006 shows that we are in decline.
Two and a half thousand years ago, in the Republic of Athens, in the time of Socrates, there was no crime, there was no violence against women.
It was considered unacceptable while, two and a half thousand years later, we have this violence, this unchecked violence, against women.
We must therefore take measures.
I do not know if the Daphne programme suffices or if something more is required.
Penalties must suddenly get stricter.
Penalties against someone who rapes a woman are not strict.
Today, in 2006, we have more prostitution of women than we did 50 years ago, after the war.
Today, of all the women who come to our country, to Greece â which is not a rich country â from the former east bloc countries, half are extradited.
This is a crime.
In order for us to fight violence against women, therefore, we need first of all to fight the poverty that leads to violence.
We need to fight drugs effectively.
My country has more heroin-related deaths than anywhere else and it is the poorest country in the eurozone.
We must therefore look effectively at prevention and at effective penalties for the guilty.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, as we have already heard said today, Daphne is the most important programme aimed against violence, and so it is all the more important that it should be kept separate from the anti-drug programme.
Putting the two together in this way would certainly have resulted in even more misunderstandings and in incomprehension of what the European Union was up to, particularly among the persons affected by them, and I am glad that this is not going to happen.
This programme is a successful one, and must be continued, as visibly and comprehensibly as possible, as a response to increasing violence, and this separation is helpful to this end.
I am sure, too, that the doubling of its budget is not only encouraging but also necessary, constituting as it does a broadening of the range of goals and actions.
I would particularly like to highlight the campaign against people-trafficking, in particular against the trafficking of women and children, which calls for a high degree of vigilance and a great deal of work in view of the need for extended networks and for the financial resources required to that end.
I would like, then, to give my forthright support to MrsÂ GrÃ¶nerâs proposal that cooperation projects to combat people-trafficking be extended to include third countries, since cooperation with countries of origin is vital.
Despite all this, Daphne is no more than a drop in the ocean.
It is particularly in the Member States that the campaign against violence must be continued with greater vigour, and must also be enshrined in law.
I would refer in this regard to the eviction law, which has been implemented for some considerable time in Austria, and also in many other countries, the effect of which is that those who commit acts of violence are required to leave the home.
I would also like to mention the anti-stalking law that is now in place in Austria, the object of which is to address the issue of psychological violence, something that is not yet taken seriously.
Â Â  â Today, we are once more discussing the fight against violence.
It may seem unnecessary to discuss this issue again.
However, nothing could be further from the truth.
Every year, thousands of women and children are trafficked within the borders of the European Union to become the objects of sexual exploitation. There is much talk of prevention and of providing support for the victims.
However, where are the actions of the services responsible for dealing with this phenomenon?
Of course, there is action taken simply for show.
It yields little in the way of results other than generating media hype.
What about the fact that there are labour camps in a large European Union Member State on the Mediterranean coast where, according to the press, 20Â 000 people from other Member States worked?
They worked fifteen hours a day.
The barracks in which they lived were surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by guards armed with firearms.
People who did not want to work were even murdered.
Rape, in full view of spouses, was a common occurrence.
In spite of intervention by diplomatic services and pleas from escapees, the police only intervened after a few months.
Yet the enlightened citizens of the European Union benefited from this slave labour.
Is it possible that the local authorities did not know about it?
After all, the matter affected thousands of people.
These events took place a few weeks ago.
Thus, we are debating important matters which should have been resolved long ago.
Some people, like the leader of the Socialists, create international uproar about controversial demonstrations not being permitted, yet we are turning a blind eye to the emergence of a new formÂ ...
Â Â  It is a shameful thing that violence against women has become a worldwide phenomenon today, in the face of which national borders are of no significance.
Such violence causes great suffering and destroys the lives of millions of women and thereby of entire families.
In Europe alone, every fifth woman is a victim of violence, the consequences of which can be measured in the damage done to their physical and mental health and to that of their children and family members.
For violence may lurk in seemingly peaceful family homes as well as in intimacy in the workplace, in the increasingly harsh modes of behaviour between the sexes, in sexual harassment, and in its harshest form it manifests itself in enforced prostitution, which is the contemporary worldâs version of slavery.
We cannot ignore the fact that the countless forms of violent and sexually degrading behaviour arise from certain social customs and traditions that are unacceptable to Europeans. These include enforced genital mutilation and the institution of forced marriage.
Sadly, these unacceptable forms of behaviour have also made their appearance within the EU.
All of these phenomena fundamentally violate human rights, which constitute one of the cornerstones of the European Communities and of the Union.
The defence of these rights require the cooperation of law enforcement and judicial authorities as well as the joint action of Member States and of the European institutions.
The Daphne III Programme can count on widespread public support, for during the World Cup championships alone, our campaign against forced prostitution was able to garner 100Â 000 signatures and the assistance of CommissionerÂ Frattini, as well as the voluntary collaboration of the police forces of the countries concerned.
If we were able to keep sport clean, we should also strive to preserve the peace and cleanliness of family life and find the strength necessary for community action.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner, for her outstanding report on the Daphne III programme.
Violence against women is a large and growing problem within the countries of the EU.
Many women and their children have their lives ruined as a result of violence and, especially, threats of violence.
Every year, hundreds of women die in Europe as a result of domestic violence, with a large number of attempted murder cases being reported on top of that.
It is therefore of extraordinary significance that violence against women and children be made a distinct point on the EU agenda.
Violence against women and children is a special problem that requires special initiatives and special solutions.
Parliamentâs proposal focuses on the outrages that take place day in and day out in domestic settings and on changes that will force the national parliaments to take a stand on these serious issues.
There is a need for a programme that focuses solely on violence and that can contribute to publicising this problem whilst at the same time helping to promote a public debate about violence.
The taboo and silence around violence must be fought, and the Member States ought to be making a massive effort to inform people â both the victims and perpetrators of violence â of how to get help.
The taboo is also a great obstacle in the way of preventative work, and we need to open the eyes of EU citizens to the many victims who live in daily fear of attack.
Violence is not a private matter, irrespective of the area of life in which it occurs and of who perpetrates it and regardless of whether it takes place within a family or in public life or whether it be a case of violence by the state.
Violence against women takes many forms â physical, psychological and sexual violence, enforced prostitution and the trafficking of women.
The principal objective of the EUâs activities to counter violence is to prevent and combat all forms of violence in order to completely eliminate this form of crime that is also a serious violation of human rights.
The fight against violence should be recognised as being part of the protection of our basic rights and freedoms.
Â Â  Madam President, we must firstly welcome the proposal presented on the initiative of MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner and the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, which promotes this specific programme, since in this way the scale of the problem is being acknowledged and specific measures to prevent and combat gender violence are being proposed.
We must provide women with the means and resources required to escape a reality which, year after year, kills hundreds of women from all countries of the Union.
Violence against women and children is a violation of basic fundamental rights and, furthermore, we must not forget that this violation is all the more serious when it affects certain groups, such as minorities and people living in poverty or the disabled.
Given the alarming statistics on the victims of this violence, we must carry out a genuine social revolution, since we cannot forget that, behind the statistics and the numbers, there lies the history of thousands of women who every day have to suffer at the hands of those who abuse them merely because they are women.
We must therefore strongly defend a specific programme which makes progress towards resolving a social problem with regard to which all public powers must act to promote a change that leads to a more egalitarian society.
The Spanish Government has implemented a law against gender violence, with a clear commitment to combat this social scourge.
Though it is true that that law cannot put an end overnight to the reality suffered by women, it offers significant support.
This is the direction that the rest of the Union must take, making decisive commitments in the conviction that to do nothing at this point would mean turning our backs on thousands of women who are expecting us to respond.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to make a point of order about working to the agenda.
I contacted the Sittings Secretariat at approximately 11.15 this morning. I was told that my speaking time would be postponed until 9.00 this evening.
As soon as I found out that my name had appeared on the list, I printed out my speech, ran to the elevators and came here, because I noticed that I needed to be here before 9 p.m.!
Of course I understand that I cannot use my speaking time now, but I really regret that the Sittings Secretariat informed Members so late that the debate would continue and not end at 11.30, as it was supposed to.
That is not the way to treat colleagues in this House.
Â Â  Mrs Kauppi, I am a long-standing Member of this House.
I know that it is difficult to know exactly when your speaking time will be, but I say again, and with all due humility, that I personally â you may think differently â find it polite to listen to the debate, to be here before your speaking time.
If that was the case each time then this could not happen.
Your name came up on the screen, as did other Membersâ names â such as that of Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, for example.
They were surprised that some colleagues were not here, so their speaking time was brought forward by five minutes.
I cannot help that.
I can only invite everyone who speaks in a debate to be here from the beginning of the debate.
If that were the case then this would not happen to you again.
That applies to everyone who was absent from the Chamber when I called their names.
I called five or six people who were not here today and so they could not speak.
Normally, when we have a lot of time, I am very happy, as every Vice-President is, to add names at the end of a debate.
However, we cannot do that today as we have to vote on the report.
I should now like to give the floor to Commissioner Frattini.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise to you all for the late arrival of my flight to Strasbourg this morning, which prevented me from hearing the first part of the debate; my colleague MrÂ KovÃ¡cs, however, was here.
In general, I sincerely appreciate the way in which Parliament and the Commission have worked on the Daphne programme in recent months.
I also heartily thank the rapporteur and the chairman of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
They are well aware that about a year ago I said right from the beginning that I supported the idea of separating the Daphne part dealing with violence towards women and children from the part dealing with drugs prevention, so as to avoid inappropriately confusing the issues.
I am very pleased that there is general agreement today in that respect and that it will be possible to focus more seriously and more emphatically, with about twice as much funding as was provided in the past, on the issue of preventing and reacting to all kinds of violence that affect children and women.
In particular, I believe that the Commission is not only ready, but also very happy to continue cooperating closely with Parliament on implementation measures, in the sense of keeping Parliament continually informed about how the Daphne programmes are being allocated and about the concrete results of the programmes and projects that are actually financed.
There is an important topic that I heard mentioned by a few Members during the latter part of the debate, which is the role of the Member States and the role of Europe.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this subject seems particularly important to me because we cannot just underline the role of the Member States, the police forces and the courts in pursuing and punishing acts of violence at a national level.
There is a need for Europe to speak out loudly against any form of violence that increasingly affects women and children.
That is why the Daphne programme is necessary, and that is how it provides added value.
It does not detract from the duty of the national police forces or courts to pursue and punish individual cases of violence at a national level.
It is our duty, however, to make Europe speak out against crime, which is increasingly transnational and directed against women â for instance, all the kinds of traffic aimed at forced prostitution â and against children â as in everything concerning the horrendous crime of paedophilia, which is more and more becoming a transnational crime.
Anyone who still has any doubts needs to be assured that the value added by European action in this area is quite obvious.
I shall now make just a very few comments on certain amendments highlighting some particular kinds of violence.
We must be careful not to exclude other kinds of violence, but in what sense?
In the sense that, if the draft text makes reference just to certain kinds of actions for which Daphne may grant funding, we risk excluding other forms of violence for which Daphne should also provide funding.
I would prefer a more general wording, which covers prevention and reaction to all kinds of violence, without specifying some and therefore without the risk of excluding others.
One particular amendment concerns the European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children.
A proposed compromise amendment, AmendmentÂ 72, confirms the possibility of funding this federation, but it adds another organisation called ENOC.
I support the compromise amendment in that, on the one hand, it enables us to grant funding to very specific organisations that are already operational, but with this second organisation, on the other hand, the range of potential funding beneficiaries is made a little broader.
Two final remarks: the first is that much has been said about a European telephone helpline to help children in difficulties.
The initiative is extremely important, and I can tell you now that we are already preparing a draft framework decision.
We were working on it â I was working on it â when I presented the communication on childrenâs rights to you in June.
I can now tell you that preparations for the framework decision on the single European helpline are under way and we shall actually submit it very soon.
It is an initiative that will really help a great deal, and so I also thank those who referred to it during the debate.
The final issue has been touched upon by some Members: the idea of having a European directive against violence towards women.
I very much like the idea and it is a very interesting one, but I have one concern: finding an appropriate legal basis.
We should find one: I do not know whether there is a suitable legal basis in the Treaties for a directive against violence towards women, but if we succeed in resolving this aspect of the legal basis then I shall be politically very much in favour of the idea of harmonising at least the European guidelines for severely punishing cases of criminal violence against women.
This is the beginning of a thought process that we can take up again later.
I am grateful to everyone who has taken part in this debate, and I am ready to continue to cooperate with you on these issues.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Colleagues, I should just like to remind those who were not here earlier why we have had problems today with the timing of the debate.
Commissioner Mandelson decided to speak for 28 minutes instead of the 12 or 15 minutes maximum.
We must clarify such things in the relationship between Parliament and the Commission.
We cannot solve it today, but that is what causes the problems.
I apologise for the fact that voting time has had to be delayed.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I would like, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, to thank you and seriously urge you to do what you have just been talking about by drafting a legal instrument to actively combat violence against children, women and young people.
Today, there was support for this proposal from almost all the groups in this House.
I ask you to take up this debate now in order that we may achieve a result without delay.
You can rely on our cooperation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The Daphne Programme has delivered considerable progress in the fight against violence against women, young people and children.
A vital instrument for raising awareness and for introducing good practice, Daphne has made it possible to enlist the help of NGOs while raising public awareness of forms of violence long considered taboo.
Quite apart from these results, which must be consolidated and boosted by increased funding, this is concrete proof of the added value of action taken at European level, which reminds us that the original idea of Europe is that of a political group founded on fundamental values such as the protection of vulnerable people.
This, rather than economic power, is the main thrust of European commitment today.
Apart from the stated âobjectives of ambitious resultsâ, we wish to point out the need for clear, credible objectives to reduce violence still further, because much remains to be done.
Accordingly, we can welcome the helpdesk services provided to the organisations involved, and the extension of aid to a broader range of NGOs, which has become necessary due to the international proliferation of organised crime.
We should like to point out that the success of the Daphne-funded programmes is down to the involvement of the actors carrying out the vital outreach and follow-up work.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  . Mr President, in 2002, Parliament and the Council agreed to change the legal basis of the regulation on the transfer of hazardous chemicals and pesticides, a follow-on from the Rotterdam Convention.
An overwhelming majority in this House was in favour of the change, and even the Council agreed to it without dissent.
The Commission, however, went to the Court of Justice to fight this change, resulting in years of uncertainty for the sector, with the Courtâs ruling only complicating matters even further.
Parliament and the Council had selected ArticleÂ 175 as the legal basis, while the Commission had opted for ArticleÂ 133.
The Court decided, much to the surprise of all parties involved, to adopt both articles as the legal basis.
This course of affairs is not unique, unfortunately.
The Commission, Parliament and Council have failed to agree on the legal basis in various areas.
Recently, there was the example of the dossier on the transport of waste substances, for which I happen to be the rapporteur.
I should like to urge the three parties to desist, in future, from thrashing these choices out in court, but instead to arrive at a solution together.
The main thing is that clear policy is adopted on the choice of legal basis.
We have now had three comparable cases before the Court, which have all led to different rulings.
That is hardly conducive to the consistency of legislation, and also leads to a whole procedure of repair legislation such as that on which we are about to vote.
I should therefore like to call on the Commission and Council, together with this House, to arrive at a clear procedure for selecting legal bases.
That is something that can only benefit the quality of legislation.
Â Â  Madam President of the Republic of Finland, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, the European Parliament, which always advocates that there should be more women in politics, is delighted to be able to welcome you to this House today.
We welcome the first woman elected â and indeed re-elected â to occupy the highest post in the Republic of Finland.
Your re-election at the beginning of this year, Madam President, was a significant way to mark the centenary of womenâs suffrage in Finland, the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote.
Perhaps that is one of the reasons why, a century later, a woman is now the President of the country.
On behalf of all of the Members of this House, I would like to pay tribute to your personal commitment in many international fora, to which you have contributed with your experience and influence in the service of causes that are of the greatest possible importance to us Members of the European Parliament.
I would like to point out that in 2000 you took on the joint presidency of the Millennium Summit and that you subsequently chaired the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation, something which is now highly topical â the social dimension of globalisation â something which is having an increasingly significant impact on Europe.
You have also done a lot of work on sustainable development and on respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, something which is also highly topical in certain countries of the Union today, unfortunately.
There is no question: you are a woman who is committed to her time, to her world, to a more humane world and to European integration.
Furthermore, your country holds the Presidency of the Union.
At the beginning of this Presidency, many commentators predicted that it would be a Presidency of âtransitionâ, while we awaited events that would break the deadlock in the debate on the Constitution.
History does not allow for transitions, however, and nor does it let us stop the clock or allow us to wait for other things to happen.
History is presenting us with a very full programme for the coming months.
History has brought us responsibilities in the Middle East, a region that has suffered another war and a region in which our Union is going to try to restore peace.
I would like to acknowledge that, when the hostilities broke out, the Finnish Presidency reacted quickly and vigorously.
I was delighted by the attitude of its Foreign Affairs Minister, who spoke frankly and directly and who inspired the European Union to show the will that fortunately led to a courageous decision: to deploy stabilisation forces on the ground.
Your country was the first to talk about a European immigration policy.
Tampere entered the history books as the place where, seven years ago, Europe began to deal with the problem of immigration.
At that time, we probably could not have imagined that the problem would become as serious as it is today, with waves of desperate people trying to reach the part of Europe closest to them, with hundreds of bodies being washed up on the beaches.
Urgent European action is required in this regard as well.
In Tampere, you introduced a political will that has unfortunately progressed little.
Even in the case of illegal immigration, where we had actually made some progress, new reservations are now being expressed.
History has presented another Finnish Presidency with the opportunity to give new impetus to a policy that is no longer an emergency response to an exceptional situation, but rather an everyday and permanent response to a structural problem that will become increasingly serious.
Furthermore, you in Finland are in the vanguard of research and innovation: you have been able to transform your production structure in order to move on from old industries to new pioneering activities in the field of communication and knowledge.
You have also taken decisions in the field of energy policy: you have decided democratically to opt for nuclear energy, for reasons of security and diversification.
This is a live and controversial issue within European debate, and I have no doubt that Parliament will have much to say about it.
For all of these reasons, and given the question of Bulgaria and Romania, which are about to join us, and legislative issues such as REACH or the services directive, this will not be a Presidency of âtransitionâ.
It is facing too many issues in need of solutions for us to allow ourselves to take a nap while we wait for others to decide for us.
We therefore welcome you to this Parliament, Madam President, as the Head of State of the country holding the Presidency, and we are sure that much of what you say will guide us in our actions.
Please rest assured that Parliament is receiving you with great affection and optimism.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, President of the Commission, Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you warmly for your invitation to come and speak here in the European Parliament.
I also thank you, too, MrÂ President, for your kind words of introduction.
We last met during your visit to Finland in early June, and you are welcome to our country at any time.
The directly elected Members represent an important part of the democratic process both in the European Union and in its Member States.
Your powers of influence are considerable: you have a chance effectively to promote the aims of the entire Union in your day-to-day work.
The Finnish Presidency wants to work very closely with the European Parliament.
This week several of the ministers in our Government will be here, ready and willing to engage in debate with you, and I believe that the discussions will be very useful.
The importance of European cooperation and integration to promote peace, stability and prosperity in our continent is obvious, and the results are striking.
Our efforts are based on a common set of values. They are freedom, democracy, a respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and a commitment to the principles of the rule of law.
Each Member State must implement these values in its own way, but together we often achieve better results.
A united European Union is also a much stronger player internationally than any one single Member State.
The European Unionâs international role has strengthened significantly in recent years.
The EU is a visible and important actor in matters ranging from development to crisis management.
More and more, global threats to security are not of a military nature.
Climate change, pollution, natural disasters, contagious diseases and economic uncertainty are threats which we cannot prepare for using military means.
That is why we try to promote multilateralism and reach international agreements to combat the threats and dangers that are common to all of us.
International crime is a great concern to us all.
Close cooperation between Member States to combat the threat of terrorism is vitally important, as is effective cooperation with third countries.
If there is to be security on a broad scale and if it is to be endorsed globally, it needs to be linked to human rights and development.
The European Unionâs security strategy is based on this premise, which has been adopted by the United Nations.
We can have an influence on the creation of a more just world and the realisation of the UNâs objectives for the millennium.
It is one of the strengths of the Union that it has at its disposal a wide range of resources, from humanitarian aid to its policies on agriculture, trade, development and the environment.
The EUâs development policy can also be seen as part of its security policy.
The EU is the developing countriesâ biggest development cooperation and trading partner, and is the worldâs biggest contributor of development aid.
I hope and believe that the EU institutions work together closely to reach a decision on financing for development in order to guarantee an uninterrupted flow of EU financing and, in particular, diverse action on the part of the EU from the start of 2007 also.
There is a link between development and trade.
It is not always an automatically positive one: it requires political will and know-how. This way trade can be made to boost economic growth, the reduction in poverty and social development in the developing countries.
The developing countries themselves, however, must also be prepared to implement national reforms, promote good government and eradicate corruption.
Access to markets alone will not necessarily be enough for fairer globalisation: special action will also be needed to support the poorest countries in order to help them to function more successfully.
In October a joint sitting will be held for both Ministers for Trade and Ministers for Development with the aim of achieving a strong commitment on the part of the EU to the World Trade Organisationâs âaid for tradeâ recommendations and their speedy application in practice.
The matter of the cross-border movement of people also needs to be addressed with exactly the same wide-ranging approach.
I believe that this issue is being discussed in Finland at the Lahti Summit.
I also believe that we will be ready to go forward with decision-making in December.
Questions of human rights are a delicate issue.
We have agreed that they need to be legally and ethically binding, but it is a very challenging task to endorse them with practical policies.
The European Unionâs human rights policy must nevertheless be founded on exactly the same rules in different parts of the world.
Fortunately, we also have good partners, mainly, of course, in the shape of the United Nations.
In Europe, an important partner for us is the Council of Europe, whose expertise we should be able to exploit more effectively.
It is still an important objective for the EU to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.
A report by Luxembourgâs Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, contains excellent proposals for closer cooperation between the two organisations, but we have to work to implement the contents of this report.
Both acting to prevent conflict and crisis management itself have become more important than ever for the Union.
Allow me to wax nostalgic for a moment.
When I was Foreign Affairs Minister for Finland, my Swedish colleague, Lena HjelmÂ WallÃ©n, and I launched an initiative to develop the EUâs crisis management capability, though we certainly did not dare to hope for such a speedy development.
Things turned out otherwise, however.
The initiative was adopted with the Treaty of Amsterdam and today the cornerstone of the Unionâs fast evolving crisis management policy is military and civil development and their successful coordination.
Having wide-ranging influence is the surest path to the settlement of conflicts.
For example, sending an EU crisis management contingent to the Democratic Republic of Congo to support the UN has already proven necessary, as when the results of the first round of the elections were made known violent clashes erupted.
Hopefully, the situation will now remain stable, so that the campaigning and second round of elections can proceed peacefully and in a way that respects the democratic process.
After the elections, the country must quickly move on to the reconstruction and development phase.
The EU is already now working to reform the countryâs security sector.
The European Union is also working hard to resolve the difficult situation in Darfur.
The Union is the biggest supporter of the African Unionâs African Mission in Sudan peacekeeping operation.
Decisions regarding the reinforcement of the peacekeeping operation and transitioning it to one under the control of the UN need to be implemented fast, because the human suffering in the region must not be allowed to continue any longer.
There are thus ever-growing expectations with regard to international action on the part of the European Union.
A unified Union is a strong player, as the situation in Lebanon has demonstrated.
The EU has been active in endeavouring to find a political solution, first in establishing UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and now in its comprehensive implementation.
It is, however, vital that the parties involved will show commitment to its implementation.
The Unionâs determined action has strengthened confidence in the EU as a peace-broker in the region.
We obviously cannot succeed in this alone, but the European Unionâs role may be highly significant.
The Member States of the European Union have taken a major role in the UNâs extended UNIFIL operation, which lends support to the frail ceasefire and attempts at establishing lasting peace in the region as a whole.
The decision to take a responsible role at the extraordinary General Affairs and External Relations Council on 25Â August was a turning point in reinforcing the role of UNIFIL.
The Member States were able to take some decisions that were very tough in the international context.
They are committed to sending approximately 7Â 000 peacekeeping troops to support the UNIFIL operation.
The entire UN operation is being headed by us Europeans, first by France and then by Italy.
It is important, however, that the countries that send troops to support the operation are not just countries in the European Union.
This way the parties involved will have much greater confidence in the operationâs success.
The situation in Lebanon is complex, and is not one that just concerns security policy: it is also a political, an economic and a social problem.
We have to support the Lebanese Government, both with regard to extending its authority throughout Lebanon and its taking responsibility for the reconstruction process.
To improve the countryâs difficult humanitarian situation, the total amount in aid granted by the European Commission and the Member States is now more than EUR 300Â million.
The conference in Stockholm late last week on the humanitarian situation in Lebanon, and in the Palestinian territories too, was a real success.
The amount of aid given and the number of new aid commitments have been substantial.
In addition to granting direct humanitarian aid, the Union must play a major role in the reconstruction work and in repairing the damage done to the environment.
Lasting peace in the Middle East will require a solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The EU had a central role in establishing the road map, and now too the Union must show initiative in promoting a comprehensive plan for peace.
Everyone has to commit to the existence of two secure and viable countries.
Trust also needs to be built at the level of civil society and not just between governments, which in itself is obviously important.
I believe that if women are closely involved in the peace process, the chances for a lasting solution will increase.
I have already worked with the UNâs womenâs organisation UNIFEM, which supports dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian women.
We will also be raising this issue during the forthcoming UN General Assembly session.
Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow you will be discussing the Middle East in depth in plenary.
It is vitally important that in the future the European Union shows determination in establishing stability and security throughout the Middle East.
The Middle East is our neighbour.
Representatives of the EU have demonstrated initiative in the negotiations on Iranâs nuclear programme.
Iran must comply with the UN Security Councilâs resolution and now actually seize the opportunity for genuine dialogue.
In the weeks and months to come, the EU must persist with its programme of active and wide-ranging diplomacy.
The United States of America will be a key partner for the EU in this, not forgetting the other permanent members of the Security Council.
The fate of Russia and that of the rest of Europe have been interwoven for centuries.
Today, Russia is a strategic partner of the EU.
The Russian leadership has repeatedly stated that its European choice is an irrevocable one.
Broadly-based cooperation, ranging from trade to human rights, will benefit both parties and will also lend support to Russiaâs democratic development and stability.
Prominent on the agenda in recent times have been questions of energy.
It is good that the EU should be aiming for a common view on energy, even if choice of energy sources is the business of the individual nation.
Most of the issues, however, are the sort where cooperation is vitally important.
Energy policy and the EUâs external policy need to be more tightly interwoven, so that the Unionâs external relations can help guarantee reliability of supply.
In my opinion, it is in this area that the Union and Russia can very clearly establish a positive interdependency.
This energy dialogue between the EU and Russia must be built on trust.
We need to try and identify common interests.
We must all, furthermore, strive to combat climate change by cutting emissions, saving energy, developing cleaner technologies and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.
After all, we know that current energy resources are not limitless.
The EU must also aspire to broadly based cooperation with Russia in the area of the environment.
There is a comprehensive Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the Union and Russia and additional roadmaps covering four jointly agreed areas.
These are the economy, freedom, justice and security, external security, and research, education and culture.
The last of these is by no means a less important area of cooperation, even though these issues are not very often in the public eye.
For example, student exchange programmes and learning about each otherâs culture are very practical ways of getting to know one another better.
The term of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the Union and Russia expires at the end of next year.
It will be our aim at the EU-Russia Summit in November to agree with Russia on the start of talks to renew the agreement arrangements.
I also believe that when the Northern Dimension is reorganised as a joint policy between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland it will make for closer relations between us and these partner countries.
The Northern Dimensionâs main focus is on environmental cooperation and social and health issues.
Union enlargement has enhanced stability and security in Europe and has benefited all the Member States economically, the old ones as well as the new.
Successful enlargement also reinforces the EUâs international role.
I think that the European Union must be open in the future to all European countries that meet the conditions of membership.
Developments in the countries of Central Europe, in Turkey, in Croatia and in the Western Balkans are a clear indication of the power of the EU membership perspective as an incentive for reform, although, of course, the fundamental aim of the changes must be each countryâs desire to improve the ordinary lives and security of its own people.
The people will value membership on the basis of their everyday experiences.
At the European Council in December there will be a general debate on enlargement.
It is then that together we will look at how the enlargement process should be taken forward.
You know very well that in June the European Council held a debate on the Unionâs absorption capacity.
The result in the end was that no new membership criteria should be set, but the existing criteria should be strictly adhered to.
It is in the interests of both the European Union and the countries that aspire to membership that accession to the Union should only occur when the applicant country can assume responsibility for the obligations that come with membership and fulfil the conditions of membership.
We, on the other hand, must respect the promises which we have made to the applicant countries and ensure that we are able to absorb new Member States.
We should also remember what the list of requirements does not contain.
We have common values, but we are not aiming at establishing one culture.
On the contrary, cultural diversity is a source of Europeâs richness and strength.
Varying political views are a natural part of Europe.
You and your political groups are a unique example of political party cooperation that extends across national borders.
A multiform Union needs multidimensional parliamentarism.
This has been a long speech, and I know that we all have a busy autumn ahead, both you in Parliament and us in the country to hold the presidency and the other Member States too.
This week Finland is hosting the ASEM Summit between the EU and Asian countries.
ASEM has already in practice developed into a form of cooperation between two regional groups and working with an integrated Union has also encouraged countries in Asia to engage in the closer two-way coordination of preparation for issues to be discussed.
I believe that it has become clear to all of us that âGlobal Challenges â Joint Responsesâ is a principle and objective that we all share, and it is also ASEMâs motto.
To conclude, I would like say that there were two good reasons for my journey here to Strasbourg.
You are one of them: the first reason why I am here.
I will confess to you the other reason: I also intend to pay a visit to the Council of Europe.
I hope by doing this I will be lending practical support to that notion of broadly based European cooperation that I myself have proposed here to you.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you all and take up your valuable time, and I sincerely wish you the very best during this autumnâs parliamentary term and a successful outcome to your endeavours.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your words, Madam President.
From the applause you have received, you will see that Parliament has listened to your speech with great interest.
I must tell you that I have rarely seen the Chamber as full as today, and that too is a sign of the European Parliamentâs interest in the work facing the Finnish Presidency.
We wish your government the best of luck and we thank you once again for visiting us.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  We will now continue with voting time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, what is at issue here is the funding of the programme.
When we vote on AmendmentÂ 74, which has been tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we will be voting on the sum of EURÂ 125 million, and so I ask that we vote on this amendment first.
If it is adopted, then AmendmentÂ 71 â which refers to the sum of EURÂ 120 million â will lapse.
Â Â  That is in fact how they are arranged in the voting list.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as I see it, this amendment is actually superfluous on the grounds that we rejected taxation on the basis of use when we voted on AmendmentÂ 11.
Â Â  That will be reviewed.
It may well be the case.
I would not venture to make an decision now, but that will be noted in the Minutes and reviewed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I do think it makes sense that we should vote on this amendment.
Â Â  . Mr President, excuse me but I think we have voted on it already, so we can move on to the next amendment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, before we proceed to the final vote, I would like to ask the rapporteur to say something.
To judge by what I have taken note of, this vote has been utterly chaotic.
At one moment we are in favour of taxing pollutants, the next we are against.
At one moment we are in favour of taxation on the basis of fuel consumption, the next we are against it.
At one moment we are in favour of taking efficiency into account, the next we decide not to.
In the space of a moment we go from wanting to retain registration taxes to wanting to do away with them.
Perhaps you could tell me what to do now we have come to the final vote; I really have no idea what I am supposed to do.
Â Â  That would be an unusual course of action, since it is often, unfortunately, the case that votes are not totally consistent, but if the rapporteur were to give her opinion on the matter, I am sure we would all be much obliged to her.
Â Â  . Mr President, I agree that it has been chaotic, both thanks to us and perhaps some other people here in the Chamber.
However, when I look at the end result, I would propose that we vote for it, because the key issues for me have been voted through.
I am sure that when we go through it with the administration here we can check some of it and make it better.
The main items for me are important.
I think we should vote for it in order to give the signal to the Commission so that we can make progress in changing this tax system.
Â Â  We have chosen to abstain.
This is because, in our judgment, the proposed aid should not be funded as part of the agricultural budget since it does not have the character of an agricultural subsidy but, rather, constitutes regional aid.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many positive aspects in the Stubb report on multilingualism in our institutions.
MrÂ Stubb is absolutely right to emphasise that multilingualism, of which the cost is naturally an important factor, is a political choice to preserve the characteristics of each of our particular identities and to prevent cultural uniformity, which would be the inevitable outcome were one language to dominate.
He should apply the same logic to the slightly higher cost of interpreting in Strasbourg, because the choice of Strasbourg is also a political choice, symbolic of German-French reconciliation.
I should like to take this opportunity to protest once again against the scandal of which non-attached MEPs are the victims. Non-attached MEPs are not afforded the same interpreting and translation resources as MEPs belonging to a group, which is at variance with the Court of Justice ruling.
The Bureau has looked into this matter but, almost two years on, has yet to reach any solution.
This discriminatory situation must stop.
Â Â  . Although respect for the official languages of all Member States is enshrined in the Treaties, repeated attempts have been made to restrict the number of working languages in the EU, with bias always shown towards the languages of the countries with largest populations.
Take, for example, the recent case of the âEuropean indicator of language competenceâ, which comprises only English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.
Although this report considers âmultilingualismâ a âkey featureâ of the EU, its overarching perspective is one of budgetary restriction, argued on administrative grounds, which may undermine this right enshrined in the Treaties.
We therefore reiterate that we staunchly oppose any attempt to restrict the use of any official (and working) language in the EU based on the idea that spending on interpreting is high.
We also criticise the criteria for deciding the languages to be used in the EU-ACP parliamentary assemblies, which obviate the use of Portuguese.
This is discrimination.
Furthermore, we are opposed to the way in which, on the pretext of reducing the budget, the number of interpreters in Parliament, the Commission and the Council is being reduced, attempts are being made to create a single interpreting service and interpretersâ rights in respect of contractual obligations, timetables and working conditions are coming under attack.
Â Â  . Mr President, I support the broad thrust of this report and criticism of inefficiency, though would stress my own commitment to multilingualism in our workings.
Yes, it costs money to translate our workings, but it is a crucial component of mutual respect that each language has equal dignity to all others.
Of course, it remains open to groups of MEPs to find other ways of working, this already happens and I would expect that process to continue and expand.
As an institution we must maintain equal access for all, to do otherwise would undermine our democratic foundations.
Â Â  . Parliament is right in reiterating today that multilingualism reflects the cultural and linguistic diversity within the Union, which must be retained.
It is also right to state that citizens are entitled to communicate with the European institutions in all the official languages of the Union.
It also underlines that those elected are entitled to speak in their own language during all official EP meetings.
After all, linguistic expertise could never be an additional election criterion.
I would take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many hundreds of interpreters who, day in and day out, do an excellent and high-quality job.
The fact that all of this costs money is a normal price to pay for European democracy to function properly.
I support the proposals, where possible, to cut down on costs by discouraging very late cancellations and applications.
Moreover, the fact that the average interpreting cost in the EP is higher than that in the Council or the Commission is also attributable to our forced monthly move to Strasbourg, where local resources are limited, so that Parliamentâs interpreting costs in Strasbourg rise by 13%.
We could therefore save money by calling a halt to this absurd monthly relocation.
Â Â  . Multilingualism is an essential part of being able to communicate in the EU institutions.
The cost of being able to do this increases because of Strasbourg.
To avoid this cost there should be one seat for the European Parliament and that should be in Brussels.
The European Parliament is the only parliament in the world which has no say over where it sits.
This has to change once and for all.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mr de Grandes Pascual on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a seven-year multiannual funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency, providing it with substantial financial resources for carrying out its new duties, which involve: combating accidental or deliberate pollution caused by ships.
The Agencyâs idea of chartering commercial ships, known as âstand-by shipsâ, which would interrupt their commercial activities in order to be used in the area of an accident, deserves to be tested.
Nevertheless, we should carefully examine the interim reports on this system since I wonder whether it might be more effective simply to outsource this security service, which, by nature, will only be needed for one-off incidents.
The sums in question are not inconsiderable. The cost of these âstand-by shipsâ for 2007-2013 represents EUR 134Â million of the 154Â million granted to the agency.
Finally, I unreservedly support the appropriations proposed for the establishment of a satellite imaging service which must support the Member States in their fight against illegal dumping and accidental oil spills.
Â Â  The June List supports EU cooperation when it comes to cross-border environmental issues.
However, we do not believe that additional resources should be allocated to the Maritime Safety Agency.
The important activities that the rapporteur proposes be allocated to the Agency can better be taken care of outside the framework of the Agency.
The June List is critical of the huge number of agencies, authorities and decentralised bodies that have been set up within the EU.
I have thus voted against this report.
Â Â  . This report places the activities of the Lisbon-based European Maritime Safety Agency within the context of actions aimed at improving maritime safety and preventing pollution caused by ships in the waters of EU Member States.
These activities are defined as being additional to, and in support of, the work done by coastal countries in the fight against, and prevention of, marine pollution.
They help to improve the early detection of pollution and to identify the vessels responsible.
The better the public resources given to the different coastal countries for appropriate, rapid and effective intervention, the more effective will be the prevention and combating of marine pollution.
Aside from the other important factors that must be assessed, this report proposes to broaden the scope of the regulation to include not only oil maritime pollution but also any kind of pollution caused by vessels including liquid noxious substances, and this is something we welcome.
The report proposes what it refers to as âminimum fundingâ for this agency, and the fulfilment of the objectives for which it was set up would be hampered â still further, we would add â if this minimum funding were not forthcoming.
Â Â  . Given the recent environmental disasters caused by vessel spills, the proposal on which we voted just now is of particular importance.
The measures proposed by the report strike me as the most appropriate way of improving the functioning of the European Maritime Safety Agency.
They introduce a new, long-term vision afforded by the fact that the budget is defined for a seven-year period (2007-2013), and provide for the contracting of stand-by ships for combating spills.
Of similar importance is the creation of a new imagery centre, proposed by Parliament, to help identify illegal spills and discharges, which will improve the speed and effectiveness of the response.
This proposal is of particular importance to Portugal, a country with a large Exclusive Economic Area, which hundreds of vessels pass through every day and which has previously suffered from accidental spills and environmental disasters.
Â Â  . Pollution caused by ships is extremely concerning.
The proposal to allow ship-to-ship oil transfers in the Firth of Forth is something I have been campaigning strongly against.
I have been in constant communication with the European Commission regarding these controversial transfers and it is aware of the strength of local feeling in Fife, as well as the very grave risks to the local environment.
They have told me that the transfer of oil between vessels entails a considerable risk of oil being spilt into the sea.
We cannot allow ship-to-ship oil transfers to go ahead.
I urge the rapporteur and the Commission to press for an early conclusion to be reached by the sub-committee assessing the risks attached to pollution from hydrocarbons.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wanted to explain that our objection to AmendmentÂ 68 on street children was not to this category per se, but to the categorisation of victims, which is something that the Commissioner emphasised.
Similarly, as regards AmendmentÂ 70, we want a 'hotline', not a 'help line'.
As this is not clear, we opposed it, even though we agree with the idea of the European telephone line.
What I have just said concerns the amendments to the GrÃ¶ner report.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner, on the draft legislative resolution, at first reading, of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme âFight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and informationâ.
I support Parliamentâs initiatives aimed at separating the problem of violence from that of drug use.
The European Union must, in a politically visible manner, improve the way it fights all forms of violence, particularly against women, children and adolescents.
In the humanist civilisation that we are building, physical, sexual or psychological violence, including the threat of such acts, and the arbitrary deprivation or restriction of freedom, in public or private life, are a violation of the fundamental values of the Union, which include the right to life, to security, to freedom, to dignity and to physical and emotional integrity.
It represents an obstacle to the safe, free and fair exercise of citizenship.
With regard to the scourge of drugs, if we are not able to prohibit it effectively, I support any programme of prevention and increasing public awareness of this painful problem, particularly amongst the young.
Â Â  . â I abstained in the final vote because of the approval of AmendmentÂ 67.
Otherwise, the document is acceptable and in many respects excellent, but I cannot consent that the fight against violence towards children be carried out partly through âthe inclusion of new family modelsâ, or that the European Union should âbring added valueâ to the actions undertaken by the Member States partly by promoting new family models.
In fact, everyday experience and a great deal of psychological and sociological research prove that the greatest violence perpetrated against children is the break-up of their parents' emotional relationships, the stability and certainty of which are assured â I mean to the greatest possible extent â by marriage.
It is also well known that children need both a male and a female reference figure.
The idea that encouraging homosexual unions and devaluing marriage means fighting to protect children from violence is therefore unacceptable.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the GrÃ¶ner report on âThe fight against violence (Daphne)â (2007/2013), given the need to provide continuity for this successful project in the fight against violence, which continues to affect children, young people and women in Europe and around the world, and to protect the fundamental rights enshrined in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Preventing and combating violence against children, young people and women, and protecting victims and groups at risk (Daphne III) require a separate programme.
It is necessary to inform, and raise awareness among, the citizens regarding the problem of violence, for example by promoting the European Year against violence against women in 2007.
The programme must be given the necessary mechanisms and must work closely with the various NGOs, which have an important role in society in this area.
Â Â  . We welcome the adoption of our amendment aimed at strengthening the Daphne Programme.
With the adoption of this proposal by our group, which I undersigned, the budget for implementing this instrument will rise to EURÂ 125Â million for 2007-2013, from the EURÂ 116Â 850Â 000 provided for in the GrÃ¶ner report.
The rapporteur had proposed that this figure be increased to EURÂ 120Â million, although she also voted in favour of our proposal, which led to its adoption.
Accordingly, the Daphne III programme has a better chance of helping to prevent and combat violence perpetrated against children, young people and women, and to protect victims.
Zero tolerance of violence entails greater political involvement, constant endeavour and consistent action in all Member States.
Â Â  . All violence, whether physical, psychological or sexual, is a serious infringement of a human beingâs right to life, security, freedom and dignity.
When directed against the weak, namely children, young people or women, violence is also a serious threat to their physical and mental health.
These actions also have very serious consequences for the psychological and social development of whole families and communities.
Unfortunately, violence is still an everyday occurrence in all the Member States of the European Union.
So far, the joint action taken to prevent and to speak out about this problem, which has often been marginalised or viewed as shameful, has merely been the first timid step in the fight against violence.
A further programme, Daphne III, with a budget of 115Â million euros, aims to prevent and combat violence in all its forms, both in the public and the private sphere.
It aims to protect children, young people and women from violence through preventative measures and to provide support and protection for potential victims.
In order for the Daphne programme to be successful, it must be visible to the citizens.
In addition to actions such as providing support and assistance to non-governmental organisations, institutions, organisations and associations, we also need to conduct effective campaigns to sensitise public opinion to the problem of violence and in particular to the problem of human trafficking involving women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
Aid does not simply mean short-term actions, but also helping the victims of violence to gain access to the job market, for example, thereby facilitating their efficient integration into society.
With this in mind, the initiative for a European Year of Combating Violence Against Women deserves our strong support.
Â Â  Naturally, the June List wants to play its part in the fight against violence against women, but this report would mean that the EU would have a legal basis from which to interfere in the Member Statesâ most sensitive areas, namely legislation and preventative measures against violence.
The current Member States do not share a common point of view in these areas, while their legal cultures also differ.
What is more, this report has been drawn up in a vague way.
Parliamentâs proposals contain too many unclear terms whilst at the same time explaining to the Member States how they are to conduct the fight against violence and the oppression of women.
A clear example of this is AmendmentÂ 14, which would tacitly recognise that certain male groups are more inclined to violent behaviour towards their women than other, prosperous men of different ethnicity.
This claim is not backed up either by statistics or references to scientific studies.
Parliamentâs proposals also fail to take account of the cultural and legal problems that they would cause the Member States.
The June List has thus voted against the report.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the successful amendments which call for the setting-up of a Europe-wide child helpline, and to continue the helpdesk service to NGOs.
I also voted in favour of the amendment which includes the fight against domestic violence in the Daphne programme.
I welcome the overwhelming vote in favour of the report, and hope that the programme will succeed in strengthening the ongoing fight against violence.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues abhor all violence perpetrated against women and children.
National programmes in this regard should be the primary means of countering this important social problem as national governments and parliaments and local agencies are best placed to have knowledge and understanding of the issues at stake.
While we support many of the sentiments and specific collaborative ideas in this report, we have decided to abstain on the final vote as it calls for the âidentification of a legal basis for combating violence ... under current European legislationâ.
This statement and others in the report point to increasing communitarisation, which we do not believe is necessary or desirable as it risks undermining national and local counter-violence strategies.
Â Â  . First of all I would like to express my support for the position that the struggle on behalf of vulnerable groups continues to require separate consideration and a separate EU programme in the next budget cycle.
I fear that combining this problem â which in itself calls for joint and differentiated treatment â with other areas may endanger concerted and effective action on the part of Europe.
At the same time â partly as a result of past expansion and partly in view of the expansion still to come â one of Europeâs least often addressed social crises is the social protection and integration of the Roma.
These groups as a whole already suffer from considerable oppression, but it is the Roma women and children who are particularly in danger, for they are daily exposed to the threat of violence.
The same may be said regarding refugee and migrant women and children, who are also visibly subjected to both external and internal oppression.
To illustrate the humanitarian catastrophe linked to illegal migration, it should suffice to say that over a good decade and a half more than 5Â 000 people lost their lives in the Mediterranean migratory wave, within which, of course, the weakest groups are once again at greatest risk.
I should add that among societyâs most marginalised members, the gravest danger is the horror of forced prostitution and sexual coercion, which are often linked to various forms of organised crime such as human trafficking and drug trade.
I am convinced that these various problems can be resolved only through long-term and complex plans of action and European-wide cooperation.
I truly believe that the European Parliament will be at the vanguard of such efforts.
Â Â  . I welcome this report, which introduces a programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk.
Physical, sexual and psychological violence against children, young people and women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life, should not be tolerated throughout the EU and should be seen as constituting a breach of their right to life, safety, freedom, dignity and physical and emotional integrity.
Member States also need to recognise that genital mutilation constitutes a particular form of violence against women with short-term and long-term detrimental effects on their health, and that the main victims are members of minority communities.
In order to achieve the objectives of this report, I agree that clear and credible targets are required, such as halving the number of people who fall victim to violence and human trafficking over the next ten years.
I welcome the establishment of a think-tank to provide guidelines to the Commission on the social, cultural and political context as regards the selection of projects and complementary actions which will aid the Daphne II programme significantly.
Â Â  . Violence against women, children and young people is an ever-increasing phenomenon and a fundamental breach of the human rights of some of the most vulnerable sections of our society.
I particularly welcome the emphasis in the report on tacklingÂ the trafficking of people. Approximately 80% of the victims of such trafficking are women and girls, and up to 50% are minors.
My hope is that this strategy at European level can help assist and support those most at risk from violence.
Â Â  The GrÃ¶ner report and the amendments tabled to it, which pinpoint the need for the fight against violence towards women and children to be more effective, certainly deserves our support and we shall vote for it.
On this occasion, however, MrÂ President, we want to emphasise that the issue cannot be addressed merely in terms of making funding available for projects designed to combat this enormous problem, but that a culture of respect for the weaker sections of society needs to be developed.
That can only be achieved by means of an ongoing, effective information campaign, as well as regulation of the Internet to protect children from the risk of paedophilic and pornographic violence spread through sites that disseminate violent messages and images without any restriction or control.
In this context, I have tabled a written statement (39/2006) to illustrate a new system, based on a differentiated Childkey SIM card, designed to protect children who use the Internet and mobile telephones, because it allows providers to determine whether the user is a minor or an adult and to filter calls, blocking any that are anonymous or undesirable.
Â Â  â Daphne is a nice name for the European programme aimed at combating violence against women and children.
It is a programme that will soon be ten years old and that has enjoyed some success, with more than 350 projects funded, mainly through NGOs involved in this field.
Violence against women is a terrible blight.
It is alarming that in 2006 adult women still come into the âvulnerable people' category.
Around the world, one woman in three has been victim of one of the numerous forms of violence.
There are a number of weapons at our disposal in the fight against these barbarous acts: draconian legislative measures, zero tolerance, listening to the victims and awareness-raising campaigns.
Children are also affected.
The appearance of the PNVD alone, a Dutch political party in favour of child pornography and sexual relations between adults and children, is testimony to the failures of our system and speaks volumes about the reforms that need to be carried out.
In ten years, the Daphne budget has increased fivefold and now totals EURÂ 25Â million per year.
This is still not enough in my view to combat this kind of violence, which is all too often trivialised and which affects the most vulnerable, namely women and children.
Â Â  . This proposal for the reinforcement of the Daphne Programme for 2007-2013 deserves our unqualified support.
In my own country, we have in recent years, had to deal with many instances of unacceptable physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated against children, young people and women.
The recent killing of two innocent young children in LiÃšge turns oneâs stomach when one considers those perfidious acts.
Organisations such as Child Focus, the European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children, the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children (ENOC) and the countless national and operational NGOs are doing a great job.
Authors such as Chris De Stoop have shown us the coarse reality of human trafficking and forced prostitution.
Despite the efforts made, a great deal remains to be done.
It is also becoming increasingly clear that more attention will need to go to the situation of street children who not only become the victim of drug and human traffickers, but also suffer from violence and sexual abuse.
Accordingly, the Daphne Programme ensures that Europe is not a far-flung event, but offers concrete help to the weakest in our society.
Everyone must continue to fight those who, lacking in any moral scruple, exploit, humiliate and even kill those who are least able to defend themselves.
Human dignity must come first.
Â Â  . I would like to praise the rapportuer for her unstinting commitment to campaigning against violence affecting women and children.
The Daphne programme provides an important tool in fighting against violence.
In Scotland the âzero toleranceâ campaign highlighted that as many as one in three women had been affected by domestic violence.
We have to do all that we can to condemn violence against women and children.
Only by working together can we achieve an end to these crimes.
Â Â  . â By mistake and inadvertently, I pressed the wrong button of my voting machine.
This is why I immediately corrected my final vote in the roll-call on the legislative resolution, using the procedure intended for this purpose.
Indeed, it is impossible to vote against a programme which combats violence against woman and children and which promotes the dignity of every human being.
From the start, I have fought in favour of the Commissionâs initial proposal being separated into two headings: âdrug addictionâ and âviolence against womenâ.
All of us within the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality have every reason to be proud of our work and to congratulate ourselves on our close cooperation on such an essential issue.
Â Â  The aim of the proposed directive on passenger car taxes presented by the European Commission is to address the significant disparities in car taxation in the EU Member States and the environmental pollution caused by emissions from personal motor vehicles.
The European Commission proposes to lift registration fees for passenger cars and replace them with taxes, which would include a CO2 tax element in the tax base.
In Slovakia, however, we do not apply registration fees or annual operating taxes to passenger vehicles.
Introduction of the new tax would increase the tax burden on private individuals, besides which the calculation of an annual operating tax on passenger cars based on the level of CO2 emissions may not automatically lead to the purchasing of new, more environmentally friendly cars.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Member States have exclusive competence over tax issues, in line with the subsidiarity principle â which should be observed, I believe, in this case.
For this reason, and also because the proposal would introduce a new tax in Slovakia, thereby increasing the tax burden on Slovak citizens, I have abstained from voting on the proposal.
Â Â  In matters relating to decisions on taxes, the Member States of the EU have the right of veto.
We would see it as a positive thing if the Member States of the EU were able to agree on cooperation in relation to taxation on vehicles that minimises the impact that transport has on the climate and leads to a more efficient internal market.
It may be possible for us to accept registration taxes in the future if they are designed in such a way as to result in clear benefits for the environment.
Â Â  . I voted in accordance with the PSE Groupâs guidelines except for those amendments on which we, the Malta Labour Party MEPs, agreed to vote otherwise.
I want to record the following in explanation.
Carbon dioxide emissions by cars are more likely to be less voluminous in new cars.
Car makers are now conscious of the need to reduce emissions and use the latest technologies.
Registration tax when abused by government raises the price of cars exorbitantly.
In Malta and Gozo, with the exception of Denmark, car prices are the highest in the EU.
Car registration tax should be removed and until such time agreement should be reached on uniformity within the different states.
The fee for the annual car licence should be based on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions.
Revenues from car-related taxes should be used to improve and sustain car-related infrastructures, mainly road construction, maintenance, parking areas, safety measures and landscaping.
Income from car registration in Malta and Gozo is comparatively very high whilst the road infrastructure is the worst in the EU.
The problem of carbon dioxide emissions is especially acute in commercial and public transport vehicles.
Â Â  I have voted in favour of the report in order to send out an important signal concerning the reorganisation of taxes for the benefit of the environment.
Taxes should continue to fall within the national competence, and it is fortunate that a decision concerning MrsÂ Riis-JÃžrgensenâs desire to limit tax revenues for welfare services cannot lawfully be taken at EU level.
Â Â  . VRT for Ireland is a national tax and setting the rate ofÂ taxation is therefore a national competence.
The Irish rate of VRT has been sanctioned under EU law.
It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State or indeed the Commission to decide upon the tax policy of Member States.
This report suggests that the abolition of VRT will be good for the Irish consumer.
This is not strictly true.
Ireland gains EUR 1.15 billion from VRT.
If it abolished VRT Irish motorists would have to bear the costs of its abolition by paying a 20 cent increase inÂ the price of petrol or diesel, or an increase from EUR 400 to EUR 900 in their annual motor tax.
I do not believe this would be in the interest of Irish motorists.
I can see the benefits of introducing tax incentives to motorists to purchase vehicles with reduced CO2 emissions and improved fuel efficiency.
However, it should be up to each Member State to decide how this should be done.
Preserving the flexibility of Member States to decide what taxes to apply and at what rates is vital in achieving the social and economic objective of a country.
Â Â  . I support both objectives of this proposal for a directive: to improve the functioning of the internal market while also taking the opportunity to achieve dramatic reduction in CO2 emissions.
I also believe that the proposals could lead to significant improvement in road safety in that by providing motorists with an opportunity to pay less for new, more environmentally friendly cars, we would encourage the gradual replacement of the car fleet with safer vehicles.
In voting for the Riis-Jorgensen report today I also fully support the much more imaginative environmental demands made in this report.
Whereas the European Commission has called for graduated taxes designed to penalise carbon dioxide emissions, the European Parliament calls for the focus to cover all pollutants and fuel efficiency.
We need imaginative steps like this if we are to stand any chance of reducing the threat of global warming.
Â Â  . British Conservative MEPs strongly support the objective of improving the natural environment in which we live.
In addition to the environmental aspects of the report that we support, we also support the avoidance of British citizens being taxed double when they move abroad and the rights of consumers to benefit from an enhanced single market.
Our decision to abstain on the final vote does not imply that we are opposed to the requirement for urgent measures to improve the environment.
Many of the measures in the report can be supported, but we are opposed to passing new and additional powers to the European Commission and other European institutions when the same objectives can be achieved at national level.
Importantly, we cannot support the call in this report to give the European Commission tax powers at the expense of national governments and, for this reason, as well as our general opposition to handing more powers to the Commission, we abstained on the final vote.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs strategy to harmonise taxes on passenger cars dates back to 2002.
The central idea is to abolish vehicle registration tax â known as IA in Portugal â and gradually to replace it with a higher circulation tax, or stamp duty, binding the amount to the CO2 emission.
The purpose of this is to penalise car use and to promote free movement in the internal market, encouraging the sale of cars and the replacement of used cars.
We agree that special measures need to be put in place for citizens who move from one Member State to another, but we do not accept the proposed tax harmonisation.
Firstly, because of the federal question; this harmonisation undermines the tax sovereignty of the Member States and their political power in the area of transport.
Secondly, the binding of the value to CO2 does not take account of the car's cylinder capacity and value.
As well as penalising circulation, the tax will ultimately be regressive and will penalise commercial vehicles.
Lastly, this strategy affects the value of used cars and the increased competition may have economic and social repercussions.
We cannot therefore accept the objectives contained in this directive.
Â Â  . I abstained in the final vote because the votes have not produced a coherent result.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Riis-JÃžrgensenâs report on car taxation claims to impose a circulation tax based on emissions of pollutants from cars in order to encourage car users to use less polluting vehicles, while ensuring a market for manufacturers that is both more homogeneous and more transparent.
However, this tax only concerns private cars, which represent less than half of the CO2 emissions which are attributable to transport vehicles.
Furthermore, the fiscal method does not seem to be the best solution to this problem of pollution, in the light of the prospects for technological development and the option of using standards.
To crown everything, this directive will impose new taxes in countries like France, where taxation is already so crushing that car users feel like they are being milked like dairy cows, and also that they are being made into scapegoats.
This Europe, so ingenious at reducing its inhabitants to paupers by means of ultraliberal policies, must avoid multiplying the costs of acquiring and using a private car, since this is a direct attack on the free movement of people â something, incidentally, that it claims to protect.
Quite aside from the fact that we contest the right of the Europe of Brussels to any fiscal competence whatsoever, these considerations lead us to vote against this report.
Â Â  .
I abstained on all of the votes on amendments, and voted against the report in the final vote. I did so because I strongly believe that all powers over taxation, which are currently Member State competences, should remain with Member States.
Specifically, I look forward to the day when an independent Scottish government has the power over revenue-raising through taxation, including car taxation which, in Scotland, must take due account of the fact that car transport is absolutely essential to residents throughout our rural areas.
Â Â  . Some governments worry about vehicle tax; others worry about maintaining a taxation system full of irregularities.
As regards this draft directive, I would like to emphasise the importance of encouraging a proactive approach.
Is it necessary to debate the constricting measures to be adopted in order to slow down climate change?
To make progress, what is needed is to sweep aside the reluctance of the car and petrol lobbies.
Environmental tax is a means to help both citizens and the planet itself.
If implemented correctly, it will encourage innovation in the transport sectors and it will promote energy economies.
We must also stop the paralysis of our governments.
Taxation cannot be the only solution.
We must also develop regulations to reduce greenhouse gases.
It is essential to make citizens responsible and to develop tools to evaluate our effect on the environment.
The Greens have voted for this project as the first step towards a CO2 tax.
This could lead to the construction of an environmental taxation system on a sufficient scale to meet the challenges we face.
The Greens want registration tax to be maintained.
In Denmark, it has led to the reduction of the car park.
The Greens remain sceptical about âbudget neutralityâ and fear other impositions.
We regret that the European Parliament has not followed the Greensâ amendments requiring Member States to reduce their transport-related CO2 emissions.
Â Â  . The EPLP is, in principle, in favour of a link between levels of taxation and our commitments to reducing environmental pollution.
Whilst the EPLP believes that this is an extremely important opinion that raises many relevant points in trying to develop a Europe-wide solution linking to pollution to consumption, the EPLP believes that taxation is a matter of national competence and therefore cannot support aims at harmonising taxation at an EU level to reach these aims without full unanimity.
Therefore, the EPLP has abstained from the final vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, as a proud Scottish European I believe passionately that we should work together across our continent where it makes sense, though do not believe it to be the case on matters to do with tax.
Where I have much sympathy with the ideas in this report, it is important to consider also whether they should be dealt with at EU level.
I believe they should not, so have accordingly abstained on the key provisions of this report which suggest otherwise.
Â Â  . There are a number of points which I disagree with and therefore I had to abstain on this report.
Although I agree that we must reduce environmental pollution, I believe that taxation should be dealt with at Member State level.
Â Â  The Commission proposal to abolish passenger car registration taxes and replace them with enhanced annual circulation taxes is to the detriment of the working and grassroots classes and solely serves the interests and to increase the profits of the automobile industry and of the uniform internal market and to increase the anti-grassroots, indirect taxes levied by the European Union and governments on the pretext of emissions and the Kyoto Protocol.
The so-called reduction in initial prices will be cancelled out by a differentiated pricing policy on the part of the automobile industry and fluctuations in VAT.
At the same time, the Member States will replace their revenue from registration taxes with increased annual circulation taxes.
The new underhand tax measure to the detriment of the workers will at the same time impose the principle of pollution tax, given that the criterion for annual passenger car taxes will be their emissions.
This measure, which will obviously be ineffective in combating atmospheric pollution, will lead directly to an increase in tax revenue and sales of new cars to replace old cars, thereby putting an even greater burden on the family purse.
We voted against the report because, instead of protecting consumers, the proposed measures strengthen the profits of the automobile industry; instead of protecting the environment, they will put a greater burden on it, with increased numbers of cars, and instead of protecting grassroots income, they will help to fleece it in the name of the stability pact.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with reference to RuleÂ 2 of the Rules of Procedure, according to which Members are bound by their own conscience, I find it absolutely incomprehensible that you, in the Chair, should have given the floor for so long to a lady Member â of your own group, no less â who, wringing her hands all the while, was seeking a common position.
It is not one of the functions of this House to facilitate group consultations between a vote and a final vote, particularly not when they involve Members who are obviously incapable of making their own minds up.
While I am not familiar with the relevant Rule, I am sure you will be able to find out which one it is, but I have to say that I also think it unprecedented that you should then decline to permit a point of order to be made about this.
I would like to point out that what you said, and what MrsÂ Sommer said, will be recorded at length in the Minutes.
I would also like to say that your conduct of the vote has been highly partisan and unworthy of a President of this House, and that, too, should be noted in the Minutes.
I believe that your actions show that this House resembles more than anything a karaoke parliament, in which the pretence is maintained of adherence to democratic rules, whilst not every Member, contrary to what is written, is equal before the law or treated equally in this House.
The fact is that, if the Member had been someone else or from a different group, I know full well that you, MrÂ Friedrich, would, in your capacity as president, have stopped them speaking, just as you did not even allow me to speak in the first place.
Â Â  The next item is the Council presentation of the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, I have the honour to present to you the draft general budget of the European Communities for the financial year 2007, which the Council adopted on 17Â July 2006.
This is the first budgetary procedure under the new financial framework.
The transition to the new financial year should be smooth and at the same time continuity and consistency must be ensured.
In this respect I believe that cooperation between both arms of the budgetary authorities, the European Parliament and the Council, will continue.
I am convinced that both institutions share the same objective â to agree on the 2007 budget by the end of the year.
Before I present the draft budget adopted by the Council in more detail, I would like to recall the main principles that guided the Councilâs decision-making.
Firstly, I would stress that the Council complied with the new interinstitutional agreement of 17Â May 2006 in all respects.
The Council thereby reconfirmed its belief that it is very important for general budgetary discipline to be observed at EU level in the way it is at national level.
Special attention was paid to the fact that the annual ceilings for expenditure endorsed in the new financial framework were to be adhered to, and that sufficient leeway was to be left for maximum expenditure under the different headings for unpredictable situations.
In dealing with the budget, the main principle we employed was close assessment of specified and real expenditure needs.
Although there needs to be adequate and timely financing of all the European Unionâs priority areas, this does not mean that appropriations should be overestimated.
In its efforts to exercise impeccable and disciplined financial management, the Council has made a detailed analysis of the needs in all policy areas.
Having taken stock of previous budgets, and having thoroughly examined selected activity-related reports, absorption capacity and the real requirements for 2007, the Council finally decided on a controlled increase in payment appropriations in the draft budget.
It is the Councilâs opinion that this level of payment appropriations is adequate and not too low.
I would like to focus attention on the fact that the Council has consistently adhered to a bottom-up approach.
Thus, the final figures in our draft budget are the result of targeted action based on objective factors.
The Councilâs first reading is thus in no way based on cuts made across the board.
The same is also true for administration.
Secondly, we adopted a comprehensive approach.
In fact, we examined a number of activity-related reports by the Commission, which covered all areas of policy in the budget.
Thirdly, the EUâs budgetary procedure is in need of innovation.
That would be best accomplished by equal and proactive scrutiny on the part of the budgetary authorities.
Without innovative budgetary solutions, we cannot enhance the Unionâs competitiveness or improve administrative efficiency within the institutions.
Commitment appropriations in this draft budget total EUR 125.8Â billion. This is 3.7% up on the budget for 2006.
Payment appropriations total EUR 114.6Â billion, which is 2.3% more than in the 2006 budget.
The commitment appropriations under subheading 1a have barely been cut, as the Council believes that competitiveness and responding to global challenges is very important.
The Council also proposed two new pilot projects under this subheading, one of which concerns the learning triangle, and the other of which concerns the reliability of the supply of energy to the Union.
The Council will also approve the statement on pilot projects and preparatory action.
Under the new interinstitutional agreement, both budgetary authorities must state their intentions regarding the pilot projects or preparatory action.
The Councilâs draft states that there are four special areas for priority action in the European Union in which the Council believes pilot projects or preparatory action should be implemented.
Hopefully, we will achieve consensus through cooperation.
With regard to subheading 1b, the Council adopted the commitment appropriations in the preliminary draft budget.
The Council cut payment appropriations by EUR 425Â million in those budget lines that relate to the completion of the programmes that were begun prior to the year 2000 and the programmes for the period 2000â2006, taking account of the current rate of implementation for them.
With respect to the new programming period, the Council did not make any reductions and, furthermore, issued a statement saying that it thought it was important that the Commission should quickly approve the action programmes and projects proposed by the Member States.
Under heading 2, the Council effected a limited reduction of EUR 365Â million for budget lines relating to interventions in respect of all agricultural markets, except for those budget lines where the same size special deduction had already been made.
There was a general principle obtaining here, which took account of former implementation rates and estimates of real needs.
The Council, however, stated that agricultural expenditure and expenditure relating to international fishing agreements should be re-examined in the autumn on the basis of the Commissionâs revised communication.
The Council left room for EUR 75Â million for commitment appropriations under subheadingÂ 3a.
The Council nevertheless increased appropriations in the External Borders Fund, because it regards this as a major political priority.
The Council raised payment appropriations under heading 4 for cross-border cooperation and reconstruction in Iraq because of their political importance.
In accordance with the interinstitutional agreement, the Council left room for EUR 220Â million in commitment appropriations in case of unexpected circumstances.
It approved the amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which also meets the stipulations in the interinstitutional agreement.
With regard to headingÂ 5, administrative expenditure, the Council adopted an overall view.
It very carefully examined the appropriation needs of each institution.
Administrative expenditure is nevertheless 3.4% up on the figure in the 2006 budget.
The increase in the Councilâs administrative expenditure was limited to 0.3%, which is worthy of note.
The Council believes that it is very important to recruit new staff, in consideration of enlargement in 2004 and future enlargement too.
For that reason it has approved all the newly requested measures for enlargement for the year 2007.
One of the Councilâs main aims has been to ensure that there is a genuine increase in productivity in the administration of the EU during the period covered by the new financial framework.
To this end, the Council issued a statement on a comprehensive programme of growth in productivity in administration for the period 2007â2013.
You are very well aware of the different components of the administration package.
I would stress that this is an objective of the Council and not of a single Member State or the Finnish Presidency alone.
In connection with headingÂ 5, I would also like to remind everyone of another statement by the Council, which concerns the recruitment process connected with the 2004 round of enlargement.
The Council is especially concerned about the way recruitment has slowed down this year.
We expect there to be significant progress made in the recruitment process in order to achieve the greatest possible geographical balance as soon as possible.
I hope that Parliament will support our intentions here and thus also our statement.
My assumption is that these latest demands made in respect of administration must also be capable of being applied to the Unionâs institutions.
The EU institutions are no different from other organisations.
The EU needs to do its work as efficiently as possible.
In this way we can show the public that we produce a real return for their money: value added.
This requires an ability on the part of the budgetary authorities to prioritise resources.
At the same time, more efficient administration increases public confidence in the work of the Union.
In the months to come, we will have to deal comprehensively with the crisis in the Middle East and the necessary EU action.
Nor should we ignore the fact that the European Parliament and the Council need to think about the future and examine the Unionâs global challenges in the budgetary procedure in 2007.
Finally, I want to say that I am confident that our main objectives will be realised, that we will finalise the budget for the financial year 2007 in good time and that it will be adequate though not excessive.
We know that this is only the first phase of the budgetary procedure, and that there is still a long way to go before the 2007 budget is finally adopted.
I am confident, however, that we will be able to look at the matter from all angles so as to reach a final agreement, one that is acceptable to all parties and, above all, to the public.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, the work on the 2007 budget confirms the old adage that, while procedures may be repeated, there is no such thing as a routine budget.
In order to round off what our rapporteur, MrÂ Elles, has said, I would like to mention a few of the problems which we will face in 2007.
The first is not the most important, as it is a technical, analytical problem.
Once again, it is basically the problem of the comparability of annual budgets.
This is a budget for 27 Member States.
This problem of comparability became acute when the geography of the European Union changed in 2004/2005.
However, it still exists and I agree with the view that if spending on Bulgaria and Romania is not separated, a full comparison between the annual budgets will not be possible.
The second issue, which is the most serious, was highlighted by MrÂ Elles, and is as follows: to what extent should the first year of the new financial perspective encourage us to not reflect so much on the form of the budget but on the budget priorities, namely how much continuity and how much change there should be in this first year of the new financial perspective?
I note a certain amount of continuity on the part of the Council, including continuing horizontal cuts, this time supported more by the so-called activity statements.
I note the traditionally privileged status of the Common Foreign and Security Policy However, I would like to clearly highlight the fact that the European Parliament rapporteur has a very strong mandate, from both the Commission and the whole European Parliament, to examine individual budget lines and check them from the point of view of what is known as cost-benefit analysis.
This is a very strong mandate and a very strong principle which will inform the first reading of the 2007 budget in the European Parliament.
This round of talks will begin tomorrow, after agreement with other committees, of course.
2007 is a problem in terms of implementing a new generation of multi-annual programmes based on new regulations and a new set of instruments for foreign trade.
The question remains: to what extent does a potential slip-up justify the careful budgeting for 2007, something that is very visible in terms of expenditure?
That was likely to have been the main reason for the point of departure being so low this time around.
Spending was already below 1% of GDP in the initial draft by the Commission.
The Council made further cuts of the order of 1 billion 757 million euro, which creates an extraordinary gap between the 2007 budget and the limits defined in the financial perspective for that year.
In our opinion, this is not enough to fund the aims of the European Union.
The European Unionâs ambitions as an international player, that is, on the international arena, in terms of funding research and development make this fact clear.
The implementation of next yearâs budget is also a matter of quality and motivation in terms of administrative procedures, and in this respect we are very rigorously examining and analysing the Councilâs approach to the issue of employment and salaries in the European Commission.
We accept the European Commissionâs warning that the cuts in salaries which amount to over EUR 50Â million will make recruitment, particularly from the new Member States, virtually impossible.
The Council has not denied this strongly enough, and therefore the problem will be raised in the first reading in Parliament, as it is not only a question of proportionality in terms of employment, but also a problem of efficiency and motivation for the administration which is facing new challenges.
The differences over the approach to the 2007 budget became very clear, albeit in a friendly atmosphere, during the conciliation procedure on 14Â July.
A sign of these differences was, for example, the fact that no common statements were made by Parliament and Council.
Of course, we also have time to agree the 2007 budget.
For me, and this is my final point, it was very important to receive Minister Wideroosâ assurance which, while only verbal, is based on what was jointly included in the interinstitutional agreement, that is, that she will undertake to do all that lies within her power to ensure that the new financial regime will come into force on 1Â January 2007.
It is clear that the efficient implementation of the budget for 2007 depends on whether there is a new financial regime to accompany it.
Â Â  . Mr President, on 17Â May the Commission presented the draft budget.
I am not going to repeat our position.
Today I should like to concentrate on presenting to Parliament the Commissionâs evaluation of the Councilâs first reading.
I should like to confirm that we very much appreciate Parliamentâs attitude and the way it has worked on the 2007 budget, especially the method which is to be used by the rapporteur in respect of cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments of all proposals from the Council and the Commission.
We support this.
That means any proposal on radical reforms in any area.
We would be happy to have a consistent approach with respect to cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments on any policies, including the recruitment of administrative staff and administrative expenditure.
Therefore, today I should like to say that we are still sticking with our proposal. We think it is realistic and grounded.
We have evaluated the requirements for the 2007 budget as far as realistically possible.
However, to our surprise, the Council has made disproportionately large cuts in administration at all the European institutions, including the Commission.
From this point of view, there are two elements and two separate problems.
Mr Lewandowski has mentioned that in the 2007 budget the new Member States have been given 800 posts, but the EUR 56 million for salaries has been reduced.
That means that the Commission will not be able to recruit anyone at all.
The Council would like to speed up recruitment at the Commission, yet recruitment at the Commission will not be speeded up at all; the Commission will not recruit at all in 2007 if this proposal is maintained.
That means somebody here is not telling the truth.
The second element of the budget which completely surprised the Commission was that the Council intervened in the annual budget procedure by coming forward with a multiannual approach, practically politically reopening the interinstitutional agreement which all three institutions signed in May.
It is a seven-year approach to administrative costs and expenditure â a period of time which will cause the Commission to lose a minimum of three directorates-general, and will upset the geographical balance which, in line with the wishes of the Council and Parliament, the institution is supposed to keep in mind.
The balance in the linguistic approach will also be upset.
In addition, the structures and human resources necessary for achieving the new policies that the Council and Parliament have called for, including the new financial perspective, will not be forthcoming.
We were therefore surprised by the Councilâs attitude, which is not based on impact assessments or cost-benefit analyses: it is based solely on arithmetic.
This goes against what we are trying to achieve here at the very beginning of the new financial perspective, i.e. how we are looking at the budget and how we are looking at the efficiency of the ways we use money in the European Union.
I should like to point out to Parliament today that we are promising to cooperate openly and fully with Parliament in preparing its opinion for first reading.
In July I promised to provide you with technical information on the proposal, which I shall do this week, hopefully by Friday.
You will receive two notes on the 2007 budget and on the proposal for 2007-2013.
I hope that will help all of us to achieve the final results.
I should like to call on all those involved to be prudent, to make significant progress in respect of impact assessments, and to achieve whatever is necessary for all Community programmes to be fulfilled.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mr Proinsias De Rossa and Mr JosÃ© Albino Silva Peneda, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on a European Social Model for the future [2005/2248(INI)] (A6-0238/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, this own-initiative report, prepared jointly by myself and Mr Silva Peneda, with the essential support of our respective staffs, is a very important contribution to the ongoing debate about the future of Europe and the role that Europeâs social model can play in re-energising the unification of our continent.
There are no doubts these days that the creation of the European Union has been a very effective and successful peace process.
What is not so readily acknowledged is that it has also been a successful prosperity process.
In his book, âThe European Dreamâ, Jeremy Rifkin comments on the remarkable recovery of European countries following the Second World War.
The fact that Europe outstripped the United States in growth terms for half a century up to the mid-1990s, by developing and putting into place a remarkable social infrastructure which ensured that prosperity could be shared, was a remarkable achievement.
This success was not based on a dog-eat-dog approach, but on a social contract which ensured that working people would share in the wealth created, and their dependence on society generally would also benefit through the provision of universal public services.
We are now into a new period â an unprecedented revolution in technology, in the age structure of our population, and in the globalisation of capital, where there is a growing need to create a transnational democracy that is capable of effective governance of those new phenomena.
This report recognises that the challenges we face cannot be addressed by reheated dogmas, whether of the left or the right.
That is not to say that there are no philosophical differences anymore, but it is to argue that these differences are being redefined by the objective conditions of the modern world we live in.
This report is a restatement that Europeâs core values of equality, solidarity, redistribution and anti-discrimination, care for the young, the old and the sick through universal public provision must be defended in the necessary reforms already under way; that our social model is not an obstacle to competitiveness and growth but is, in fact, a necessary ingredient if we are to deliver the kind of decent European society that our citizens clearly desire; and that the concept of âflexicurityâ, pioneered by my colleague Mr Rasmussen in Denmark, can help facilitate reforms by preventing people from tumbling into poverty as a result and can, if properly tailored to each Member Stateâs needs, be an important tool in the process.
Â Â  . â I should like to begin by saying that the EU that we know today was founded on an ideal, the main objective of which was winning and maintaining peace.
In half a century, Europe has, on the world stage, become a byword for peace, democracy, freedom, solidarity, prosperity and development.
Peace, this prime objective of the European project, has manifestly been achieved, to the extent that we now take the true value of this major victory for granted, so normal has it become to live in peace for over six decades.
We are talking about peace that is rooted in freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law.
Let us compare the European social model with other situations: an example close to home was the great swindle of the totalitarian Communist experiments, which for decades deprived many Europeans of their right to freedom, for most now happily regained.
The brutal reality of Islamic fundamentalism today is a further example of a movement far removed from the core values on which the European social model is based.
This report deals essentially with values.
The way in which these values are implemented varies from country to country, and we therefore stress the idea that while the European social model is a unity of values, that unity is implemented in a number of different ways.
Globalisation, technological development and demographic change are the main factors behind the difficulties faced, to a greater or lesser extent, by the social protection systems in the different European countries.
Hence the need for timely reforms; either the European social model will survive if we take action, or will die if we do nothing.
We know that if there is weak economic growth any structural reform will be doomed from the outset.
This is why we have placed major emphasis in the report on the Member States implementing the Lisbon Strategy and on the need to complete the internal market.
The following are the areas to be prioritised in the reforms to be undertaken: greater flexibility in the labour market, lifelong learning, more time to pursue an active life, the work-family life balance, changes in sources of funding, and combating poverty and social exclusion.
In the area of competitiveness, we recommend that greater attention be paid to SMEs and to innovation.
The general guidelines of the reforms that must be implemented and that have been highlighted in our report are indicative of reformist thinking firmly rooted in the core values of the European social model.
As elements that inform all political action, these values are needed now more than ever.
It is therefore important to us that Parliament affirm that the reforms that need to be carried out to the different social protection systems must not under any circumstances affect the core values on which the European social model is based.
Parliamentâs decision on the content of this report will thus be of relevance beyond the Union because it will be a political affirmation of the defence of values that are important not only to Europe but also to the world.
In this regard, I shall quote the International Labour Organisation, which explicitly referred to the European social model as a possible source of inspiration for emerging new powers.
I should finally like to mention my fellow rapporteur, MrÂ DeÂ Rossa, and to thank him for the excellent spirit of cooperation that we enjoyed, which enabled us to work in a way that was both stimulating and pleasant.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda and MrÂ DeÂ Rossa for their report on the European social model for the future.
The report makes a useful and thought-provoking contribution to the debate launched at the Hampton Court European Council in October 2005.
Most importantly, though, it once again emphasises the significance of social Europe and the need to protect and develop the European social model.
Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the European social model is, by nature, a complex one, which can be approached from a number of different perspectives.
I feel that Parliamentâs report in its original form takes a wide-ranging approach and conveys the most important points.
I should like, if I may, to share a few thoughts with you.
Firstly, the report ultimately states that the European social model was built on a specific set of values.
The technical implementation of those values may vary, of course.
When we speak of values, we speak of something worthwhile; in other words, if we are convinced that there are values at the heart of the European model we are saying that we are willing to channel our efforts into protecting and developing those values.
When we speak about the European social model, one of the adjectives we use is European.
I feel that the European social model is clearly based on European integration, without which there would be no hope of progress on the world stage, regardless of which Member States we are talking about.
Accordingly, European integration is a cornerstone of the European social model, and, as the other side of that coin, the European social model is one of the cornerstones of European integration.
Given that, from a geographical point of view, European integration is a complex concept, we could hold a series of wide-ranging debates, although in principle where we find the European social model, there we also find the boundaries of European integration.
It exists where we have a set of values that have been adopted by the individual Member States.
There are, of course, other values that one could add, and this is clearly a question that would provoke a great deal of lively discussion.
In my view, these are the core elements of this debate in Parliament, and the main reasons why it is so important.
I share the view expressed by the rapporteurs that it is important not to regard social politics or policies as a burden, but rather as a positive, proactive factor in creating jobs, in supporting growth and in strengthening social cohesion.
Europe cannot be competitive without being socially strong.
It cannot be competitive without a social policy.
It is mistaken to think that if we throw away this core idea, we will gain some kind of wonderful advantage.
This opinion has, in my view, been expressed very clearly, which I am pleased to see.
I am also pleased that the positions of Parliament and the Commission coincide on a great many points, for example in their assessment of the situation.
Europe must reform its policies if it wants to protect its values.
Preserving the status quo is not a solution; preserving the status quo is in the long run simply a waste.
We must also realise that besides an innovative and open Europe we also have a Europe with almost 20Â million unemployed.
The situation in the labour market is gradually improving, and recently the figure was more in the region of 18Â million, a 2Â million improvement, which is not inconsiderable.
We have a Europe in which there is poverty; we have a Europe in which there is child poverty; we have stagnating growth and a Europe with too much social exclusion.
If the EU is to remain active and economically strong, the challenges that must be tackled head-on also include the ageing population, which threatens the financial viability of our social systems, and globalisation, which is a source of fear mainly for countries with high unemployment and which at the same time confirms how indispensable it is to launch the structural reforms.
I should like to thank Parliament for its proposals, which I wish to sum up in one word: modernisation, or perhaps a better word would be improvement.
We need to modernise in order to be able to preserve high-quality education and health systems, and to deliver decent employment and decent pensions for all.
The Commission and the Member States have launched the process of modernisation and the reforms as part of the re-launched Lisbon Strategy.
I wish to thank the rapporteurs, in this regard, for highlighting the importance of striking a balance between the economic dimension, on the one hand, and employment and social protection on the other.
The EU has at its disposal a range of individual instruments that will help the Member States to press ahead with modernisation.
This legislation will support economic change and the implementation of measures to protect our values and quality of life, conferring the authority to monitor compliance with Community rights and providing a budget which is vital for supporting the Unionâs economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Most of the proposals in the report bear a striking similarity to the Commissionâs current activities.
These include activities relating to demographic change, which will be addressed in the proposals contained in the Green Paper on demography that I should like to introduce in October.
They also include activities relating to what is known as flex-security, that is, flexibility with security, regarding which the Commission has begun to negotiate with the interested parties, and these negotiations are due to culminate in the adoption of joint principles by the end of 2007.
Additionally, we have activities relating to services of general interest, which the Commission will address in a communication to be completed by the end of this year on the basis of Parliament's report.
There is also similarity in the activities arising from the Commission communication of June 2006 entitled âA citizensâ agenda delivering results for Europeâ, in which the Commission undertook to carry out, in 2007, a thorough assessment of the reality of the European Community and to launch a programme geared towards an approach to rights and solidarity, which will also examine the possibility of establishing a list of rights for Europe's citizens.
Lastly, I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs for their report, which looks to the future and which makes some useful proposals.
The Commission will respond to it in the coming months in the context of the main initiatives to which I have alluded.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like if I may to return to the very beginning.
The European social model is founded on the idea that it is possible to link up political democracy, economic efficiency, economic effectiveness and solidarity.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, previously the entire sector of social expenditure was viewed as an incidental matter, as a matter of redistribution.
I believe that the experience of recent years has shown that this is not a matter of expenditure but rather one of investment, and I am pleased that we are discussing this report during the Finnish Presidency.
The Finnish crises of the early 1990s were overcome by investing in people, in a similar fashion to the Danes during the time of BishopÂ Grundtvig.
Recently, the work of the US economist Richard Florida has drawn attention to the creative class and the economics of creativity.
We need to create a network capable of harnessing all kinds of talent in European society and of driving development forward.
We must, in my view, regard the European social model as an area of choice and not as a unification issue.
Lifestyles should diversify, because where we gamble on cheap labour, such as in the Asian economies, there is dwindling choice and the range of opportunities for economic growth also diminishes.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I am grateful to MrÂ DeÂ Rossa and MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda for their work and the report on the European social model.
I am pleased that the input of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality has been taken seriously and is also reflected in the report.
Women are indispensable in the social model, just as they are indispensable in the labour market.
Not for nothing did we in Europe plan to enhance the labour participation of women.
Despite this, women are often still absent from the labour market, and, for that matter, feature far too infrequently in the social model.
Women are often the first victims of a badly-functioning social system.
If there are no funds for day-nursery facilities or for sick, elderly or disabled people, it is often the women, wives and mothers who stay at home to look after them.
That is why I am in favour of a model which takes women into consideration, one in which the government helps where needed in an affordable manner.
I am against a model thought out in Brussels that must, by hook or by crook, be implemented across Europe.
What I am in favour of, though, is social solidarity in Europe under the motto âOne for all and all for oneâ.
That is also reflected in the report we are discussing today, and that is why I am in favour of the report by MrÂ DeÂ Rossa and MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda.
Â Â  . â Mr President, when you look around in society and talk to people, you can tell they are worried about the consequences of globalisation and about globalisation itself, and that there are concerns, due to persistent unemployment in some Member States, about being affected.
They can see the adverse effects the demographic development has, and that makes people, also in the discussion about the European social model, very reticent.
They wonder how sustainable are all the things we have at present.
Can we maintain the pensions, the unemployment benefits, if need be, or this welfare level as it is at the moment?
That is the sort of caution I am talking about.
The central question is whether the social security systems, which are very different but are all based on certain values, can deliver what was promised when they were first set up.
I am very glad that two fellow Members, MrÂ DeÂ Rossa and MrÂ SilvaÂ Peneda, have, despite their different political backgrounds, managed to draft an excellent report which can serve as a basis for future discussion.
I am extremely grateful to them for this.
At the heart of the European social model is the need for economic development, for without that we cannot give, or guarantee, social security.
We want to be able to guarantee people basic social requirements, but we must also acquire the funds to do so, of course.
That involves a continuous process, whereby social security is reorganised so that the citizens receive what they can expect.
There are different models and our model is different from the others in that it is based on a social market economy and, in fact, also on Christian social teaching.
I am grateful for the many sound recommendations in this report.
Â Â  , . â Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs, who have worked very well together.
The report they have produced is a good one.
I am often asked, when back home in Sweden, whether there really is a European social model or whether what we really have is a collection of different models.
My response is that, while it is true that our social systems are different, they also have a great deal in common and it is that commonality which constitutes the European social model.
We all have systems that build on solidarity with those who are unemployed or sick or who have suffered industrial injuries.
We all have a public sector through which we pay for what is common, to somewhat differing degrees.
We also have the social partners and civil society, which play a large part in the process whereby we shape our societies.
These are the common distinguishing characteristics.
If the social model is based on common values within different systems, this means that we can learn from one another in the course of the process that we now find ourselves in.
It is, of course, not the case that the social model or the various social systems cannot be changed.
As so many speakers in this debate have said, they must be constantly amended - the systems themselves, that is to say, rather than the values underpinning them.
The two great challenges today are demographic change and globalisation.
In view of the demographic change, we must also show solidarity with the next generation.
Thus, the next generation must not have to spend an unreasonable amount of what it produces on those of us retiring and requiring large amounts of medical care.
We therefore have to create sustainable pension systems.
We must, however, also ensure that we create a working environment that makes it possible for people to remain in the job market for longer.
Amongst other things, this means having reasonable working hours.
We must have skills development whereby the older section of the workforce is also able to be involved in the changes in skills development and other such matters and whereby such workers are thus able to carry on working.
This would mean that we would have more workers in the labour market.
Perhaps we will also need to accept more people from countries outside Europe in the future, which in all likelihood will be the case.
As far as globalisation is concerned, there are two ways to go.
The first of these is to copy the economies of our competitors, China and India, namely in terms of wages, labour market conditions and the like.
The second way is for us to attempt to compete, in fact, by having well-trained staff and by engaging in research and development and so on, which would mean that our workers and the products they produce would be the best in the world.
This does, however, require security in the labour market, since it involves change and restructuring.
People involved in a changing labour market need to feel secure.
I know that the Finnish Presidency is referring to this as âsecurity in the midst of changeâ rather than as âflexicurityâ, but it amounts to the same thing.
If you feel secure, you are also able to participate in the work of bringing about change and the development of Europe.
Then we can develop our social systems in such a way that they become a productive factor in the work of bringing about change.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate in recent months on the growing political integration of Europe, with its ups and downs, we have often said that Europe needs to give people a better idea of its project, its purpose and, I would say, its indispensability: the Europe of results, conceived by us specifically to give people a real key to understanding its .
Now, however, its social dimension needs to be promoted as well, alongside the dimensions of growth and knowledge, the objectives that we are always proclaiming.
This must be accompanied by research into what Europe must become, so that we can tell Europeâs people clearly whether the future of Europe â and not just its past history and that of the 20th century, which we all know and have lived through â will still have this priority, this distinguishing mark that has characterised the diverse models and systems in the various Member States.
It is precisely at a European level that we need to make this leap: the progress made so far in the various countries and Member States is now confronted by challenges that isolated responses alone are unlikely to overcome.
Clearly â I must say this to those who fear that Brussels will decide everything: what, how, and with a single model â clearly, evidently and indisputably, the competence and responsibility for social policies lie with the Member States, and decisions on how much and what kind of revenue to spend on our social systems, depending on whether the emphasis is more on social security or education or reparation, must be made at a national level.
That these are national decisions is beyond doubt, and I too uphold the idea that my country should decide what kind of welfare state to create, but I also consider it necessary to adopt a common approach at European level regarding certain fundamental rights that must be safeguarded: social rights that, I would remind you, we included in the rights section of our draft Constitution.
We have to start here, with a common approach to lay down certain guidelines, precisely because our national social systems are faced with the worst challenge of all: economic and financial compatibility.
Indeed, we want competitiveness and social cohesion to go hand in hand as the two sides of the same coin of integrated development of a society.
That is why I think todayâs debate is important; that is why I think it should be part of the European agenda, even though some may perhaps question it because it is just an own-initiative report on this subject.
It is not enough to talk about institutional models; it is not enough to talk about what kind of governance is necessary; it is essential to debate the competitive model for our free economy.
The citizens also want to know this, when they make their political choice, when they also make, or refuse to make, the economic choices that we shall ask them to make for the sake of higher employment or some other reason: they will ask whether these social rights are in any case a distinguishing mark of all the welfare systems that the various countries will be implementing.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I am sure that everyone, in principle, is in agreement with the European social model, even if they only pay lip-service to it.
Who can have any objection to a shared scheme of values, or have anything against peace, social justice, freedom, equality and so on?
While EU politics is far from lacking in fine principles and guidelines, in the day-to-day life that goes on in parallel with it there prevails a raw reality, with, among other things, the pursuit of short-term profit and often unscrupulous exploitation and competition.
Many watch passively, or look away, while the few become richer and more and more people become poorer and poorer.
This document makes only passing reference to the most serious social problems, such as extreme poverty, discrimination against immigrants, the grim lot of the long-term unemployed; it is insufficiently rigorous in highlighting inequality and injustice, and the blame for this must lie with the subsidiarity principle â good thing though that is in itself.
If what is termed harmonisation in the economy is to be regarded as the most obvious thing in the world, then the EU ought also to say âyesâ to harmonisation measures in the social sphere, starting by bringing taxes into line and then moving on to debate minimum and basic incomes and the citizen's wage, and then saying 'yes' in particular to the harmonisation of the pension system.
Justice can only be a valid principle in the EU if the law, throughout Europe, accords full protection to the weakest members of society.
Â Â  . â This debate is extremely important given the serious nature of the issue, the so-called âEuropean social modelâ, that is to say, the economic, social and labour rights that have been gained by the workers and the people over dozens of years, a fact not taken into account by the Commission or by this report.
Far from it, in fact.
The underlying thrust of the report is that social security systems hamper economic development and are unsustainable given the demographic challenges posed by globalisation and world competition.
The report emphasises deep structural reforms that in practice will lead to the collapse of public social security systems, thereby casting aside the main weapon at our disposal for protecting social inclusion, for combating poverty, unequal distribution of income, job insecurity and unemployment, and for promoting the dignity of those in work.
In this way, the rapporteurs of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are seeking to continue the policy of pandering to Europeâs captains of industry and the interests of the large economic and financial groups, opening up new business areas and placing a significant proportion of pension system funding in the hands of private profit.
The trend is therefore towards the increasingly neoliberal path of the so-called âLisbon Strategy' and âStability Pactâ.
This is not what the 72Â million-plus people living in poverty and the 18Â million-plus unemployed had been hoping for.
What is needed is a change in these policies.
This is what we had in mind with the proposals we put forward, which we hope will be adopted.
Â Â  . Mr President, I, too, would like to join my colleagues in thanking the joint rapporteurs for their work on this very important report.
I welcome the Commissioner to the House also, because eventually the Commission will have to start implementing some of the things that we are talking about here.
One of the key elements arising from the debate is the recognition at last that, unless the economic wealth can be created, together with the employment terms to guarantee jobs and security within those jobs and rights after those jobs, then the European social model is non-existent.
As my colleague, MrÂ Andersson, rightly pointed out, there is not just one single model, but a variety of different ones.
The one thing they all share is the necessity for solidarity between all peoples within the individual countries and across the European Union.
The idea of protection for those who are most vulnerable within our society is at the very core of what the European social model should be about.
When you look down through the list of issues and areas that need to be covered, of course there are always difficulties that will arise, whether it is with regard to long-term unemployment, youth unemployment, female unemployment, social welfare provision, protection with regard to access to housing, access to education and training, or more recently the demographic situation and the pensions crisis that is looming before us.
No matter how you try and come up with solutions to deal with the problems that are there, the one thing we should learn from the practical experience we now have of a number of these various social models is that one size does not fit all.
There is a need to allow for flexibility within those models, to guarantee that the core values of putting the human being at the very centre of what the social model is about remain paramount.
But, also, when we speak about harmonisation of taxation or harmonisation of the minimum wage, this obviously militates against creating equality, because countries that at present have lower wages and a high level of social protection could be made uncompetitive, with business and companies being attracted elsewhere and jobs lost.
That is why this flexibility must be there.
I give my support to the report in general and I am delighted with the comments it makes.
One area of ongoing concern is the need to ensure the link between economic performance and the generation of wealth, which must then be utilised for social protection.
You cannot have one without the other and when we speak about raising taxes, you can have the highest taxes in the world, but if you do not have companies employing people and paying taxes, then you cannot provide social protection afterwards.
Â Â  . â Mr President, this report covers ten diverse fields, practically all EU areas, from peace and security to human rights and from Lisbon to Laeken.
It is, then, an aspiration, an attempt at founding an embryonic culture.
When I was younger I played rugby and I recall a match that was not going well.
The captain gathered us together imploring us to have more team spirit.
An empty gesture, because team spirit cannot be manufactured: it arises from the gameâs culture of combining various skills, of playing for each other, of covering each otherâs mistakes and of the post-match social atmosphere.
By the same token, it is no use the rapporteurs gathering us together to vote for a European social model.
If all its various parts, reports, treaties, rules and regulations, etc. are worthwhile and are put into practice by all this team of nations, then the European social model will emerge of its own volition.
Therefore, this report is irrelevant!
Recital O of the report specifies that the Constitution should reflect the concept of the social model â covering the same ground.
It follows that the European Constitution is also irrelevant, as well as dead!
This report emphasises the role of the Member States and their competences, especially their role in securing jobs leading to economic growth and prosperity.
It comments on the diversity of the European Member States and says that we must respect their traditions, all of which was endorsed this morning by the Finnish President.
However, this will all be swept aside and lost if the EU embarks on the madness of a Constitution.
In conclusion, you may gather that I doubt the sincerity of this report, which includes the statement: ârecommends that Member States deepen cooperation and exchange of best practiceâ.
One year ago I remarked in this House that one of the central features of the EU was that each Member State could bring to the table its best practice to share with all the others.
However, when I said this in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs during the working time directive debate and tried to contribute some best practice from a Member State â the UK â I was firmly told by that rapporteur: âWe donât want you dumping your ideas on usâ.
Â Â  Mr President, a year ago British Prime Minister Tony Blair addressed this House and asked a vital question: what sort of social model is it that delivers 20 million unemployed across the EU?
It was a good question, and so far I have not heard the answer.
The European social model is well meaning, it is compassionate, it is meant to do good and yet it has created a regulatory and fiscal climate which is deterring enterprise, destroying wealth and undermining competitiveness.
It is time to face reality: one manâs job protection is another manâs unemployment.
The social model is profoundly discriminatory.
It discriminates in favour of people in work and against the unemployed.
If we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, if we want to face up to the challenges of globalisation, if we want growth and jobs and competitiveness and prosperity, then we have to start to dismantle the European social model.
Â Â  The European social model faces significant challenges, related primarily to the changes in the economic environment and social transformation.
Several elements of these changes have already been mentioned here today.
In my view, a key question is the need to create ever more jobs.
For this purpose, and in relation to the social model, it is important to stress: only more jobs, and therefore, obviously, support for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector can make it possible even to speak of elements of change within the social model.
I am delighted to hear what CommissionerÂ Spidla has also said, that this is a question of preserving European values.
In order to succeed in doing so, it is clear that structural changes within the European social model are also necessary.
The main question is through what EU strategy and at what rate of change can this be achieved?
In this regard, I am of the opinion that we need to harmonise EU policies, and I especially welcome the aim set out in the report: a strengthened, open method of coordination so that national parliaments and the European Parliament can play a more active role in this.
I am convinced that greater cooperation and joint European consensual positions are necessary on the major political questions.
Therefore, common European statements, and policies tailored to each Member State, are the approach we must follow.
As regards future prospects, this declaration is sufficiently pragmatic and clearly shows that we must work together.
Problems can only be solved by joining our forces, not by fragmenting them.
I consider this to be a good, defensible report and I ask that the greatest possible number of Members, preferably from the widest possible political spectrum, lend it their support.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs, who have done excellent work.
Last autumn, during the British Presidency and in the run-up to the extraordinary summit at Hampton Court, members of my own government were saying two contradictory things about the idea of the European social model.
On the one hand they said there was no such thing as a European social model â we have 25 different national social models â while on the other they said that if there was such a thing as a European social model then it was a continental phenomenon and a millstone around the necks of a number of Member State economies.
Mr Helmer has reminded us of what Mr Blair said in this House.
In fact, a number of ministers have said the same thing, and are obviously reading from the same script - i.e. do we really want a social model that throws 20 million into unemployment?
If Mr Helmer was listening to the debate then he would have heard an answer to that assertion from Mr Blair, because this report nails those lies.
The very first substantive paragraph underlines the point that we indeed have a European social model which reflects a common set of values based on the preservation of peace, social justice, equality, solidarity, the promotion of freedom and democracy and respect for human rights.
The report makes the point that far from the model being a burden or a millstone, social policy should be seen as a positive factor in the European Unionâs economic growth, not only by increasing productivity and competitiveness but also by generating social cohesion, raising living standards for citizens and ensuring access to fundamental rights and freedoms.
That is absolutely correct, and if we see it in that sense, social policy becomes a productive factor â the theme of a Dutch Presidency some years ago.
The report also recognises what a number of people have said, which is that there is a clear need to modernise and adapt the model to respond to the wide range of challenges we face: demographic and technological change, globalisation and so on. The rapporteurs also stress that reform and modernisation of the model must preserve and enhance the values associated with it.
That is of vital importance.
In Britain a number of people engage in headshaking about what they see as the over-slow progress in modernisation and reform in a number of continental European countries.
What they tend to forget is the brutal, inhumane and destructive way in which reform was managed during the Thatcher years in Britain.
What a number of continental countries are trying to do is to engage in that reform process through consensus, while preserving the underlying values of the European social model.
That is the way to do it, and it is one I very much admire.
One final point: I regret that the PPE-DE Group has tabled an amendment to paragraph 23 aimed at removing a specific reference to the need for the Commission to bring forward a framework on services of general interest.
I very much hope that amendment falls, because had we had that framework the Services Directive itself would have had a far easier passage.
We still need it and I hope the Commission will heed the call for it made in the report.
Â Â  â Mr President, intervention by the European Union is too often experienced by our fellow citizens as an intrusion into their daily lives.
Moreover, sometimes they are correct.
However, those who did not want the Constitution refused to see that this text could have clarified the powers of the Union and those of the Member States.
In fact, our fellow citizens demand a Europe which responds to their urgent and practical concerns, but only when it is the institution which is best placed to do this.
In this sense, a social Europe is one priority among many.
Our duty is to set out a framework which â you said it yourself, Commissioner â is modern and balanced, and which guarantees a high level of social standards, while still leaving the Member States sufficient room to manoeuvre.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us stop these sterile debates between those for whom the word âsocialâ is a synonym for the resurgence of state control and those who, in lengthy reports, propose unworkable and counter-productive measures.
As we already did with the Services Directive, all of us have to work together, and as urgently as possible, in order to define this framework, starting for example with the adoption of texts on working hours, on services of general interest and on the status of European mutuality.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is a pity that this report on a European Social Model for the future does not get us much further on.
None of the social models existing within the EU have, to date, even begun to do as they have claimed to do and create the conditions under which every human being really can live a self-determined life in dignity within the EU.
As I see it, the main challenges, not least for the EUâs internal market, are the abolition of poverty, the removal of social divisions, and energetic action to protect the climate.
I therefore believe that the Economic and Monetary Union needs to be supplemented by a European Social Union, action to establish which could be taken, for example, firstly, by creating the machinery to combat social dumping; secondly, by laying down minimum social standards across Europe, and, thirdly, by creating European social security systems that make poverty impossible.
It is regrettable that the report before us on a European Social Model for the future contains no proposals of any substance for a truly social Europe characterised by solidarity.
Â Â  â Mr President, we must admit that we really have messed up on the question of the welfare state.
The truth is that, a few years ago, we laid down a great deal without having the intuition to see that people's life expectancy is increasing.
At that time, forty years ago, an infarct meant death; now an infarct is dealt with in a routine operation.
Similarly, we did not think a few years ago, ten years ago when we signed the world trade agreement, that our products are encumbered by the cost of welfare, while the products produced by the Indians and Chinese, who account for half the planet's workforce, have no such cost.
As a result, Chinese products are flooding Europe, our companies are closing and tomorrow we shall be unable to offer this welfare state.
The truth is that either we shall go bankrupt or we shall not be as secure as citizens.
These are the facts. We must therefore see how we can realistically deal with the situation.
We are pulling the wool over people's eyes.
We shall be unable to keep our word.
Now we say let us get funds from employers, while employers have already been brought to their knees by Chinese and Indian products.
We therefore need to look facts in the face.
Technology should show us the way.
Forty years ago, when I was a child, we went to work in the fields in the summer and there were 50 people for two decares.
