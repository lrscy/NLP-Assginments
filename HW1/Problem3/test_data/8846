The system envisaged for the staff of the European Union institutions largely replicates the system currently employed in the OECD.
To obtain access to certain basic social rights under the Staff Regulations, non-married heterosexual partners must, as indicated, have documentary proof that their partnership is recognised in a Member State, they must not be married or in a non-marital partnership with another person and they must have no blood relationship with their partner.
In addition to these two categories of partnerships, where the partners have chosen to be officially registered, there are also a limited number of cohabiting partnerships that are not recognised by any Member State since the people involved have chosen not to seek the legal recognition open to them.
In such cases, the Commission proposes that the existing purely administrative recognition of certain partnerships should be maintained.
This would, however, be of minor importance and the resulting rights would be limited.
For example, partners would continue to have access to established language courses where places are available.
In its reform package of 30 October, the Commission approved the principles outlined above.
We also decided to intensify discussions with other EU institutions and with other international public sector organisations in order to develop these proposals further.
Finally, we reserved the right to make supplementary proposals after the outcome of the interinstitutional discussions which will commence formally in the early months of next year.
The issue of recognised partnerships will be discussed at the next meeting of the heads of administration of all EU institutions.
A working group will then further develop the Commission proposal, taking into account the additional information on the situation in other international organisations which is currently being collected.
We naturally wish to pursue best practice wherever that is feasible and gains the endorsement of the legislatures, including this House.
At the end of this process, we will transmit our proposals for amendments to the Staff Regulations to the Council and to this House.
We hope to be able to do that in the spring of 2002.
The date of implementation of these new arrangements, and indeed much else, will therefore depend to a very significant extent on the speed at which they are handled in this House and in the Council.
As for the Council, there is nothing to suggest that Member States will raise problems with this approach, particularly since it gives full recognition to the competence of Member States to regulate of marital law.
It does not introduce a separate regime for the institutions - indeed, it cannot.
This does not preclude the possibility, of course, that critical questions may be raised by Member States in the Council.
We shall simply have to wait to see what views are actually expressed.
Finally, a word on costs.
For obvious reasons we do not yet know the exact number of recognised partnerships amongst the staff of the institutions or the numbers involved.
We can, however, make a reasonable estimate, and on that basis, we can forecast that the budgetary impact of the above measures will be modest.
Two hundred and fifty fully recognised partnerships and 250 partnerships with a limited range of statutory benefits would, for instance, generate total annual costs of under EUR 3 million.
When implemented, the measures we propose will recognise and respect certain basic civil liberties.
They will foster enlightened attitudes and they will improve the morale and living conditions of many of the valued staff who work for the European Union in the different institutions.
I hope that this House will continue to support these reasonable social innovations and I look forward to further constructive discussions.
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his characteristically full discourse and discussion on this subject, and also for the very comprehensive material he makes available to us on the staff reform issues.
We will have a chance to return to this subject, as he says, when we get the detailed proposal for the Staff Regulations.
The issues that he raised were covered very briefly in the report that I prepared for Parliament back in 2000, where we indicated that we were looking for a best-practice approach.
The summary he has given us certainly indicates the amount of work that has been done on that.
Given that it is a highly sensitive issue and Member States will certainly be looking at it closely, the sort of balance he has achieved is going to be very much the right one.
It is very important that we see this in the broad framework of recognising stable partnerships as he described it in the November 2000 discussion paper.
That is really what we are discussing here.
We are not talking about any particular type of partnership - that in itself would be discrimination - but recognising stable partnerships.
One of the points I particularly want to raise with him is the question of children from partnerships.
There have been well-publicised cases recently in the United Kingdom about the British forces.
A soldier who very sadly was killed while on active service, had a stable partnership and a child from that partnership, but was not actually covered in the UK situation.
That is an important point.
The other point I want to raise is in connection with pension provisions and about the rights and abilities of staff to be able to decide to whom their pension should be paid and what flexibility they have in making that decision or in opting for whom their payment and benefit provision should be made in the event of their death.
Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his detailed reply. I would like to encourage him further.
He is absolutely right that we should look at the best practices available.
We in this House must remind ourselves that we cannot be selective in the application of principle.
We look towards enlargement and encourage good practice, yet here in our institutions we still continue to discriminate.
But I welcome the signs of change.
I hope that these will have the full support of this House and that we will begin to end the 'ping pong' game that we play with the human rights and civil liberties of ordinary men and women.
For that is exactly what lesbians and gay men are.
They are ordinary men and women made extraordinary by society's preoccupation with their sex lives.
Let me also say on a personal matter that in my own Member State, my partner of 18 years, cannot possibly inherit my pension.
That is discrimination.
We must end it both within and outside the institutions.
Finally, I should like to raise one very important issue, namely recognition by an EU Member State of a legal document.
Such a legal document is certainly not available in the United Kingdom.
I look forward to Commissioner Kinnock's replies.
Thank you, Mr President. Giving concrete form to the equal rights of homosexual employees of the European institutions appears to be turning into a never-ending story.
Nevertheless, this House wishes to see European institutions playing an exemplary role in equal treatment, with no distinction made as to the sexual orientation of staff.
The European Parliament has twice pronounced in favour of establishing the same conditions of employment in the case of lasting relationships between people of the same sex as for married couples.
Yet adequate arrangements for this have still not been made.
My group cannot help feeling that within the hierarchy of the institutions, including those of this House, barriers are still being created against the introduction of equal conditions of employment for lesbians and gay men.
We therefore eagerly await the wind of change brought by the reorganisation, now entering its final phase, which will need to clear out the old dust traps from this area too.
My group is glad that, immediately after the Dutch Homosexual Marriage Act came into force, the responsible secretariat in the Commission recognised such marriages where civil servants employed by the Commission are concerned.
Member States where Dutch officials may be posted who are married under Dutch law to a same-sex partner must not of course obstruct the issue of residence permits, not even if it involves subjects of third countries.
My fellow MEP Mrs Buitenweg has asked questions on this matter.
Your Commission should make sure that such obstruction does not occur.
As yet we have had no answer from you.
Can you, Commissioner, give us one today?
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his extremely detailed report.
Mr Kinnock, I really did try to keep up with what was going on here.
If I understand the matter correctly, the fact is that the partners of homosexuals who are not Swedish, Finnish or Dutch citizens seeking posts within the institutions of the EU are not recognised by these institutions if, as Mr Cashman says, they do not have documentation.
Perhaps the latter could in those circumstances go on language courses at some stage.
Against that background, I personally do not, unlike certain others in this House, think that we have come a particularly long way.
I appreciate, Commissioner Kinnock, that it is very difficult indeed to make progress in this area because we have a lot of strange prejudices about people of the same sex who love each other in the same way as heterosexuals.
Nor can I quite understand why the institutions of the EU should in this case treat employees on a national basis.
If that reasoning were to be followed through, it would mean that people employed within the EU' s institutions could have their wages set on a national basis, but that does not happen.
I understand, Commissioner Kinnock, that the situation is very difficult in view of the prejudices that exist, but I cannot agree that things are developing particularly quickly in this area.
Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his very clear reply to the oral question.
My point directly follows on from Mrs Eriksson's.
It is clear that, in many Member States, homosexual couples do not have any rights and there are grave injustices within Member States.
The only light at the end of the tunnel as regards my own country, Ireland, is that our Law Reform Commission announced yesterday - and I suspect it is because they saw something coming down the line from the Commissioner - that they were going to make that part of their research programme for the next year.
Hopefully that will result in the justice that is clearly the right of stable couples, whether they be homosexual or heterosexual.
We have had situations where, because of the lack of rights for homosexual couples, people have been evicted from local authority housing on the death of the other partner who was the named tenant.
We also see that huge death duties accrue to partners who have bought houses together where, on the death of one partner, the other is faced with a massive tax bill, very often resulting in that person having to sell what was, in the truest sense of the word, a family home.
I know you will be addressing some of the anomalies that exist in this but, as Mrs Eriksson has rightly said, they exist in a significant number of Member States and it could cause serious problems in terms of discrimination when we come to implement charges.
I wish you every success and I am extremely glad that we have had an opportunity to raise the issue within this House because there is widespread support for it.
It is not all that often, Commissioner, that we hear good news and I should like to thank you for it on this occasion; it really is very important to us for you to have answered our question both precisely and positively.
Why should this be the case? It is because we are at an historic turning point, one where the issue is no longer solely that of combating discrimination against homosexual people but that of asserting the rights of homosexuals.
At this pivotal point between fighting against and fighting for, I think that you have given us some very positive answers and that we need to continue in this direction.
But why should I attach so much importance to this?
Because I think that in our question we pointed out that some private companies had, after all, resolved the problem more quickly than the public institutions.
We know how important it is for public institutions to set an example.
I well remember the huge uproar in France when the French railways (the SNCF) decided to offer their 'couples' fares to homosexual couples.
I do not think that you have had such good fortune in the United Kingdom, but we in France do, and it is the exemplary conduct of the French railways that I should like to highlight today, because this gives us some idea of what the European Commission can now achieve.
That is why all of this is along the right lines, and why it is extremely important.
I would add, however, that for all this the fight against discrimination is not over, and I should like the Commission to also be aware of this struggle, in particular in the light of the fact that it has a Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
Why could we not enlarge this to include other forms of discrimination under Article 13?
We must not forget that there are candidate countries for accession, countries which will be included in the enlargement programme - I think you know the countries I am talking about - where homosexuality is still a crime.
We must therefore be very vigilant; this is the 'fight against'.
I am quite aware that this was not exactly the question you were asked, but nevertheless it seems to me to be important, if we are making progress on the social rights of homosexuals in the European institutions, for us to ensure that the current policies of all of the European institutions are consistent with this.
Mr President, I should like to begin with the points made by Mrs Fraisse.
She is absolutely right that we are at a turning point.
There has been extensive evidence for this over a considerable period of time.
Mrs Banotti's speech this morning is further evidence that even in countries where there has been a deep-rooted reluctance to change the social and legal conventions, there is movement in the direction of logic, rationality and civil rights.
Things are starting to move, but everyone here is impatient for that movement to be much more positive and much more rapid.
The interesting point raised by Mrs Fraisse about the activity of SNCF permits me to underline a distinction that we still, unfortunately, have to draw about the legal nature, status and powers of the European institutions as employer organisations.
SNCF is an example of a public corporation with its own statute and considerable internal autonomy.
Therefore it could make its own decision in relation to the treatment of homosexual couples.
The same would apply to a private company that is, in this respect, literally a law unto itself.
Unfortunately, that means that company could show a severe degree of prejudice but it could also show a very positive degree of enlightenment.
We are not in either of those categories.
Nor are we in the category of a Member State which has passed a law which is positive about the treatment of stable homosexual relationships.
Consequently, we are faced with a limitation because we are a public institution.
Parliament, Council, Commission, Court of Justice, Court of Auditors - the whole panoply of European Union institutions - have a statute that does not permit us to exercise the degree of autonomy which is the basis for many of the arguments correctly put forward this morning.
I include the arguments put by Mrs Erikkson for which I have a substantial degree of sympathy.
I should like to answer very quickly the other questions, starting with Mr Lund.
I would repeat the point I made earlier.
Once a partnership is recognised under a Member State's recognition of partnership arrangements, we will give equal rights to everybody regardless of the benefit level applied under national legislation in the national context.
Once the key is turned, we will accord the best treatment within our power.
Secondly, on the timetable.
Together with the rest of the proposed changes in the Staff Regulations, we will submit a proposal to this House and the Council in spring of next year.
It will then be in the hands of you legislators and the legislators in the Council to decide the speed of passage and - I hope - the early date of implementation of this and other necessary changes.
I would also like to make a point that relates to material that people in the House may want to get access to.
A positive attitude was expressed in the Council towards our undertaking to make a survey of arrangements throughout all 15 Member States.
We received answers from 13 of the Member States, so it is quite a comprehensive, if informal, survey.
If Members want, on application, to gain access to that information DG Admin. will happily respond.
The information we have collected shows that there is considerable diversity of arrangements.
But - and here is the good news - as I said earlier, there is a gradual but definite tide of change.
Mr Harbour's question about children of stable partnerships is absolutely vital.
The only answer I can give is that if a Member State recognises that the children produced by a stable relationship qualify for the variety of benefits, we will fully recognise that.
Unfortunately, at this juncture we cannot go beyond that undertaking because of the limitations on our legal rights.
When Mr Cashman asks us to pursue best practice, he knows he is pushing at an open door.
But Member States determine the practices, and we have to try to encourage adoption of the best practices amongst them.
We will happily consider, however, any proposal that stable recognised partnerships qualify if home countries recognise or if a country of employment recognises them.
We do not have that second part of the proposal before us at the moment, but we will happily give consideration to such a proposal and investigate its feasibility.
If it is feasible to establish practices in the European institutions on the basis of practices in the country in which an EU official is employed, we will try to introduce that change which could extend certain rights of registered couples, whether homosexual or heterosexual.
I would like to say to Mr de Roo that no barrier is being put in the way of the advancement of gays and lesbians who are officials by the hierarchy of institutions.
That is not the case.
It is the Member States who must determine what our treatment of gays and lesbians in relationships must be.
So far as employment rights are concerned, rights of assessment and promotion, rights of appointment to management, there is no barrier and no hierarchy has expressed any direct or indirect desire to install such a barrier.
We will not install barriers but we cannot guarantee that existing cultural or legal inhibitions can automatically be dismantled.
We do not have the power to do it in the Commission.
I wish we could in many ways, but I would be misleading the House if I suggested that we have, or are likely to get, that kind of massive power for change.
Finally, to clarify a point that Mrs Eriksson made, the reference I made to very limited rights, such as the right to attend language courses, relates only to people who have the right to marry, or the right to have their partnership recognised but choose, for whatever reason, not to exercise that right.
The access people have to various nominal social opportunities that exist now under the Staff Regulations will simply continue in those cases.
Our action, as she was good enough to acknowledge, owes nothing to prejudice.
Our intention is to try to defeat prejudice because it is irrational and frequently brings brutal consequences.
What we cannot defeat is not the prejudice but the laws that exist and are exercised in sovereign power by Member States.
Not until we can secure changes in those laws - and this is gradually occurring - can we take substantial further steps beyond the significant steps that we are seeking to take in the course of this reform and which honourable Members have been good enough to acknowledge.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Flags of convenience in fisheries
The next item is the report (A5-0405/2001) by Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the role of flags of convenience in the fisheries sector [2000/2302(INI)].
This report deals with a serious issue and that is fishing under flags of convenience.
Vessels that fish under flags of convenience ignore all the rules, they exploit the best fishing grounds and they wreak havoc.
In recent times, as fleets continue to increase and resource abundance plummets, flags of convenience are increasingly used as a means of avoiding measures taken by countries or regional fisheries organisations to manage fisheries and conserve stocks.
Pirate fishing can be seen as a undesirable consequence of states at last attempting to improve the management of fisheries.
The environmental impact of pirate fishing vessels is virtually impossible to evaluate as by definition data on catches are non-existent or, at the very best, unreliable.
The impact is known to be severe, even if undocumented, as pirate vessels target mainly high-value species such as tuna, shrimp, toothfish etc.. There are also serious social problems.
Ship-owners take advantage of the lack of controls to reduce training safety standards, pay minimal wages, and lower standards of living and working conditions.
They require long working periods without proper rest and they provide completely inadequate medical attention. They are responsible for many other offences.
Fishing is now a global industry. Fleets from the EU cover all the oceans of the world, as do those of several other distant water-nations.
Markets are also global.
One-third of the total fish production that entered international trade in 1998 was worth over USD 50 billion.
Capital is perhaps the most global commodity of all. EU fisheries investments can be found in many countries.
As a result, a concerted international effort is needed to eliminate fishing under flags of convenience. This will involve the countries issuing the flags or whose citizens work on the fishing vessels, the ports into which they come for re-supply or off-loading, the markets in which the fish is consumed or the home of the capital which finances this destructive phenomenon.
As the EU has both one of the largest fishing fleets and one of the largest markets for fish, it can play a particularly important role in regard to flags of convenience fishing.
Many EU-owned vessels use flags of convenience.
Some may even have had FIFG money to transfer to those countries and I am pleased to see that the Commission has now proposed regulations to prevent public funding being used to transfer to flags-of-convenience countries.
I would call upon the Council to adopt them this week.
In contrast, I should mention Japan and Taiwan, who have recognised the extent to which their longline industries use flags of convenience and they have taken corrective measures by launching programmes to repatriate or to scrap a large number of tuna longliners.
At least 62 Japanese-built flags-of-convenience longliners will be scrapped by the end of 2002.
A further 67 FOC longliners built in Taiwan will be repatriated to replace older vessels, with no overall increase in fleet capacity.
It is expected that this will reduce the FOC tuna longline fleet by about half.
These programmes are funded by both government and industry.
I believe these moves should be highly praised and that this is the way we should proceed as well.
Spain is proposing a law to list certain flags-of-convenience countries and we welcome that.
Regarding market state responsibility, the EU is a large market and so it must improve control measures.
For instance, currently it only wants to ensure that fish are caught according to rules of regional fisheries organisations which the EU belongs to.
This needs to be extended to ensure that fish are caught according to the rules of all regional organisations.
It must also be made illegal for EU citizens or companies to trade in fish caught by flags-of-convenience vessels.
This is called for in the FOA plan of action on illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.
We should go in that direction also.
The campaign that must be waged against pirate fishing is a global and multifaceted one.
All countries with any involvement in the fishing industry - such as catching the fish, owning or crewing vessels, providing harbours, buying the final product - must participate.
The EU, as one of the most important regions from all these points of view, clearly has a special responsibility.
I can only hope that the Commission and the Spanish presidency acting together will begin to tackle this very important matter in the months ahead.
It is in the interests of all EU fishing industries to ensure that this is done.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should firstly acknowledge how appropriate it was for the Committee on Fisheries to produce an own-initiative report on this subject.
I believe that the European Parliament is thereby heading in the right direction in terms of unravelling an issue which is complicated but crucial to the future of fishing in the world and to fisheries resources.
Secondly, I believe it was also appropriate that it should be produced by Mrs McKenna, with whom I disagree on so many fisheries issues, but not on this report, which has been unanimously approved by our committee, despite the difficulty of this issue, and furthermore with no amendments from the House.
I therefore congratulate the Committee on Fisheries and our rapporteur.
There is still no doubt much to do, but, in this report, the European Parliament supports the condemnation and prosecution of flags of convenience in fishing and in marketing.
Certain Member States of the Union - such as my own, Spain, as the rapporteur has mentioned here and in the report - are promoting innovative legislative proposals in this field, which is no easy task, as has been said before.
We in the Committee on Fisheries are going to closely monitor the objectives and proposals in this report, aimed at dealing with the serious problem of illegal fishing.
By fighting it, and eventually eradicating it, we will have taken an enormous step towards sustainable worldwide fishing.
Some regional fisheries organisations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), say that 50% of catches of species such as the swordfish originate from illegal fishing under flags of convenience.
If this percentage of illegal fishing were to be controlled, it would lead to an unquestionable improvement in the fish stock and would therefore clearly benefit legal fishermen, who have so much need for these catches and who behave in a totally controlled, and therefore responsible, manner.
The marketing of these fish and landings in European Union ports - as has been said here - are key issues in this process, as is the definition of flags of convenience and clearly identifying the countries which permit them and tolerate them.
All of these issues are in the report.
I would once again like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, and simply point out that I believe the European Parliament has today taken a very important step towards responsible fishing in the world.
Having congratulated everybody, it only remains for me to ask the Commissioner - whose presence I appreciate - for the Commission' s support for the proposals in this report, because it is a very positive step, and that he take account, of course, of the fact that it has the unanimous approval of the Committee on Fisheries, and I hope that the vote for Mrs McKenna' s report will also be unanimous this afternoon.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs McKenna on behalf of my group, the Socialist Group, on this wonderful report which has allowed us to strengthen the legislation on the practice of fishing under flags of convenience, which in particular harms the professionals in the sector and the image they project.
The Socialist Group is in total agreement with the conclusions of this report, above all with those which demonstrate the bad treatment received by the workers on these types of ships, in terms of working conditions, wages, safety and hygiene on board.
We believe that it is necessary to encourage the governments which have not yet done so to sign up to the United Nations agreement on fish stocks, which is directly aimed at combating this kind of fishing.
The control Regulation must be rigorously applied by all Member States and by the Commission, so that the landing in ports of this type of catch is not permitted.
We also agree absolutely with the rapporteur when he asks the Commission to seal off the markets of all Member States against the products of illegal fishing, by adopting effective Community commercial and customs legislation.
We believe that we will have to combat this type of fishing in ports and in terms of the marketing of products obtained from it.
We believe that we will have to adopt as many measures as possible in order to eradicate illegal fishing.
Mr President, Commissioner, if I were to ask you which is the odd word out in the following sequence - piracy, poaching, unsafe and fishing - you would no doubt answer that fishing is the word that does not belong.
Quite right: evading management measures, plundering the riches of the sea and the maltreatment of crew members have no place in fishing.
Unfortunately, this type of fishing does exist in the shape of fishing vessels sailing under flags of convenience.
I agree completely with the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna and would like to add the following comment.
We must involve the countries that issue those flags of convenience in an effort to put an end to these practices.
Should these countries comply only by striking ships off their registers without tightening controls, we must consider economic sanctions against them.
The fishing agreements that the European Union enters into with third countries could also play a part.
We should exclude countries that allow fishing vessels under flags of convenience and their accompanying transport and refrigeration vessels into their harbours from fishing agreements with the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, pirate fleets - it is hard not to think of the Hollywood adventure films with piracy depicted as heroism and romance in equal measure or the exciting books one read as a child.
However, there is nothing heroic or romantic about the background to my thoughts on piracy now, as I speak to you here, and there is quite definitely nothing to get excited about.
On the contrary, all we have here is a destructive fisheries practice and flags of convenience.
We should not see these modern pirates who sail the seven seas as tough old characters with wooden legs and eye patches; no, these pirates operate on powerful trawlers, often owned by nationals of Member States of the EU.
So exactly what havoc do these ships and flags of convenience wreak?
This House has always battled for sustainable fisheries and tried to ensure that working conditions meet minimum standards.
The parlous state of fish stocks and the economic recession tell us that a great deal still needs to be done, and we are addressing these problems in our debate on the Green Paper.
However, regulations and stock management measures have to be complied with and this compliance can only be achieved with controls which actually work and effective sanctions - including political sanctions.
This is the huge attraction of flags of convenience to shipowners, because the countries which generously include them in their registers are not exactly known for their controls and sense of responsibility.
The consequences are catastrophic, to both fish and man.
Regional stock management measures are ignored, stocks which are already endangered are depleted without a second thought and conventions to protect employees are simply ignored.
But there is no point in lamenting what is an obvious situation any further, so my proposal is that we should keep trying to influence flag-of-convenience states and remind them of their international obligations.
Even in Europe we can and must act.
The port state controls adopted in the Erika I package must also be applied to pirate activities, and we must close our markets to the catches landed by these fleets.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, and the Committee on Fisheries and its chairman, Mr Varela, for having taken on such an important problem.
Like the European Parliament, the Commission is also extremely concerned about these international fishing pirates and the use of so-called flags of convenience.
One thing is clear: anyone fishing under a flag of convenience is flouting maritime law and resolutions and the resolutions of regional fisheries organisations and ruining all our efforts at sustainable stock management in the process.
Plus, it is not only unfair to honest fishermen, it is outright unfair competition and may indeed, as Mrs McKenna said, cause social problems.
The Commission has not been sitting on its hands.
We have proposed an amendment to the FIFG regulation so as to prevent ships from transferring to flag-of-convenience states.
This proposal is still before the Council, awaiting its decision.
Taking the FAO's international plan of action to combat pirate fisheries as our starting point, we also intend to work out a Community action plan to deal with these practices during the course of our reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.
What will this entail?
First, we need a definition of the concept of the actual link between ship and flag state and we then need to anchor this definition in international law.
Secondly, we need to draw up a list of the supervision and control duties incumbent upon each country for every ship berthed in its ports, in order to avoid so-called ports of convenience.
Thirdly, we need to strengthen the fisheries control regulation in general.
Now, if I may, I should like to comment briefly on your specific proposals.
As far as No 6 is concerned, there is already a fleet register at Community level and we therefore feel this paragraph is superfluous.
I fully share the concerns set out in No 9.
No new Member State can accede unless it transposes the acquis communautaire into its national legislation.
We also concur on Nos 15, 19 and 22.
As you know, we are already in the process of drafting proposals for reforming the Common Fisheries Policy, which we shall submit to Parliament as soon as we receive your opinion on the Green Paper, taking account, needless to say, of the proposals on control policy which you have made in this context.
As for No 16, we too subscribe to the principle that we need a list of countries which offer flags of convenience.
Finally, some of your demands on this point were met when we proposed that the FIFG rules be revised.
Parts of No 17 are already included in the control regulation.
The Member States are required to keep a tally of imports in order to ensure that the catch quotas of the regional fisheries organisations are not exceeded.
As for No 18, as I have already said, first we need a legal definition of flag-of-convenience states.
Finally, as regards No 21, the Commission has already submitted a proposal to the Member States suggesting that GSP status be withdrawn from Belize, Honduras and Equatorial Guinea because they have violated the UN Fish Stocks Agreement.
So you can see that we too are genuinely concerned.
I should like to close by reiterating that the guidelines which you have submitted are extremely useful to us and will give us good food for thought when we come to reform the Common Fisheries Policy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
EC/Islamic Republic of Mauritania fisheries agreement
The next item is the report (A5-0426/2001) by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2006 [COM(2001) 590 - C5-0555/2001 - 2001/0246(CNS)].
Mr President, the fisheries protocol with the Republic of Mauritania is of vital importance for EU fisheries.
The previous protocol expired on 31 July 2001.
This new protocol was initialled by both parties on 31 July 2001, fixing for five years the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the waters of Mauritania during the period 1 August 2001 to the end of July 2006.
The provisional application of this protocol will depend on the first payment being made before 31 December this year.
It is therefore of the utmost importance that Parliament delivers a favourable opinion this afternoon.
It is interesting to note that in 1995, following the unilateral termination by Morocco of the fisheries agreement concluded in May 1992 for a period of four years and in view of the likely problems of negotiating a new agreement with Morocco, the Commission initiated negotiations with third countries so that vessels prevented from fishing as a result of any loss of fishing opportunities off Morocco could, if necessary, be moved elsewhere.
As a result, a supplement to the 1993-1996 protocol with Mauritania was adopted which aimed to offset the loss of fishing opportunities for the Community fleet in Morocco by allowing for 18 Spanish vessels to transfer to the waters of Mauritania, a geographical area close to where they operated previously.
In remarkably similar circumstances, the failure to renew the last agreement with Morocco, which expired at the end of November 1999, has again led to the need to seek increased fishing opportunities elsewhere in order to offset some of the hardship caused by the loss of access to Moroccan waters.
The protocol before Parliament today reflects this need. It allows for increased opportunities for EU vessels, while at the same time providing for greatly improved financial compensation for Mauritania - and I will deal with that later.
This new protocol with Mauritania is now the Union's most important protocol with a third country.
Overall, the protocol offers allocated fishing rights for various species, or category of vessel, to Spain, Italy, Portugal and France.
If licence applications from these Member States do not cover all the fishing opportunities fixed by the protocol, the Commission may take into consideration licence applications from other Member States.
The table in my report compares the fishing possibilities offered by the protocol under review with those available under previous agreements.
From this table, you will see that, although there has been an overall increase over previous protocols, there has been a reduction for a number of stocks.
There will be a 30% increase in the number of vessels, which averaged 42 under the previous protocol, to 55.
According to the Commission, this measure was possible because opportunities had been created by the departure by a number of Far East vessels which used to target particular species.
There will be a 17% increase in the number of tuna vessels, from 57 to 67.
The tonnage for vessels targeting black hake will remain the same at 8 500 GRT. For those targeting crustaceans other than crawfish (shrimps and crabs), the tonnage will go up by 9% from 5 500 to 6 000 GRT.
However, it is important to note that there has been a reduction in the number of pelagic vessels permitted from 22 to 15.
The total Community financial contribution will be EUR 430 million, broken down into EUR 86 million per year for the period of the application of the protocol.
The EUR 86 million for the year comprises EUR 82 million in financial compensation and EUR 4 million for the financial contributions to fund the various types of fisheries-related assistance set out in Article 5 of the protocol.
The government of Mauritania has full discretion regarding the use to which the financial compensation element is put.
Following the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, this new protocol with Mauritania is obviously of key significance.
In this regard, it must be stressed that its principal importance does not lie in the scale of fishing possibilities that it offers or indeed in its cost.
From a Community fisheries and socio-economic point of view, its real interest is the hope which it holds out to people of the fisheries-dependent regions of Spain and Portugal, such as Andalucia, the Canary Islands, Galicia and the Portuguese south.
These regions, which had so much invested in the Moroccan agreement, must be offered real alternatives as quickly as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the European Union fisheries agreement with Mauritania, together with yesterday' s vote on the fisheries agreements with Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau, are a good opportunity for a political study on international fishing agreements.
I would like to make three brief observations in this respect.
The first one relates to the economic and social importance of these agreements for the European Union.
As is well known, these fishing agreements with third countries account for 25% of the supply of the Community market and represent around 50 000 jobs.
It has been proved, as in the case of the Efremer study, that they are highly advantageous for the European economy.
The second observation concerns the importance of the agreements for the economy of the developing countries. Clearly, the European Union cannot paternalistically and high-handedly impose a decision regarding the sectors to which compensation should be applied but, little by little and with diplomacy, we have reached a situation where part of this financial compensation is applied in the fisheries sector and in important activities.
Thirdly, it is clear that these fishing agreements are of mutual benefit for the two parties, for both the European Union and the third countries.
Lastly, I would like to refer to the Gallagher report, since the agreement with Mauritania is the most important one concluded with third countries to date.
In the light of the non-renewal of the agreement with Morocco, this agreement with Mauritania, as the rapporteur stated, is now of special importance for Portugal and Spain, but also for Italy and France, which are countries that also fish in these waters.
As you are aware, the Committee on Fisheries adopted an amendment proposing that the quotas be redistributed by the countries in the event that those for whom they are intended do not use them.
I must say that my group agrees with this principle provided that it is applied from now on, of course, to all fishing agreements and not only the agreements with ACP countries.
Lastly, I would like to thank Mr Gallagher for the excellent work he has done in this report.
Mr President, I would like to say that fishing relations between the European Union and Mauritania go back a long way, to 1987, and it is clear that - since the disappearance of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, to whose demise we all contributed - it is now the most important of all the European Union' s agreements in terms of volume of catches and budgetary allocations.
As previous speakers have said, it is one of the so-called Southern agreements, an agreement under which shipowners contribute to the economic costs by paying for licences.
As you know, in the Northern agreements, the shipowners do not pay.
As the rapporteur says in his report, four Southern States (Spain, Italy, Portugal and France) are going to be the beneficiaries of this new five-year protocol, although it is also the case that, if fishing opportunities are not utilised - as the rapporteur says - other European countries can use them, which is also something which happens in Southern agreements, but not in Northern agreements.
As always, I would like to stress to the Members of this House - and not only those of the Committee on Fisheries - the importance of fisheries agreements with third countries, the importance of continuing to sign up to them and to sign up to new ones.
I stress their importance for those third countries and for European regions which are highly dependent on fishing such as my own, Galicia, and I stress once again that this agreement is mutually beneficial.
Mr President, I would like to read a section from the April 2001 report of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries.
I have been assured by Commission officials that negotiations for third country fisheries agreements are based on information provided by this committee.
Regarding the most recent stock assessment of octopus in Mauritania, the report says "... the assessment conducted in 1998 indicates that the stock was over-exploited..." and it then goes on to say that "... the 1998 working group in Nouadhibou recommended a reduction of 25% of the fishing effort exerted by the cephalopod fisheries...".
This is a far cry from a scientific endorsement of increasing European fishing of octopus even if certain other fleets have reduced their effort.
The Commission states that there was a more recent assessment by Spanish scientists.
However, despite repeated requests, Commission officials have so far failed to provide a copy of this document.
I believe there is an important principle here in relation to access to information.
Parliament, which is the budgetary authority, is being frustrated in its attempts to obtain the relevant scientific information on this major third country agreement.
I cannot understand how the Commission can go for a study by anonymous authors and ignore information provided by its own main committee.
Parliament has a right to know.
The other point I wish to make relates to the clause which appears to facilitate the Atlantic Dawn.
I am curious.
I congratulate the Commission on taking legal action against the Atlantic Dawn, but I would now like to hear from the Commission the latest on this case.
This agreement is morally bankrupt. It is yet another example of the EU taking money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries.
The bribe of EUR 86 million per annum is taken from many pensioners and many of the lower-paid.
It is given directly to the ruling elite of Mauritania, who are ethnically different from the bulk of the ordinary people.
Very little money filters down to the ordinary people who are amongst the poorest in the world in one of the poorest regions of the world.
Furthermore, it is destroying fish stocks and destroying such infrastructure as exists.
Worst of all, however, hundreds of local fishermen are being killed each year and, if the excellent Channel 4 documentary on the Mauritanian agreement is any guide, some are being deliberately run down by trawlers engaged in illegal fishing permitted by a deliberately lax, ill-equipped monitoring and enforcement regime.
This is the reality.
For all the fine words in the Commission document, this agreement is creating a human and environmental disaster.
It is set to continue - and why?
To satisfy the insatiable greed of the largely Spanish fishing industry, which nobody dares to oppose for fear of reprisals at the Council of Ministers.
A vote for this report is effectively a vote to subsidise murder and it creates the very conditions in which terrorism is spawned.
This serious issue needs to be investigated and therefore I challenge this House to support me in the call for a temporary committee of enquiry, the papers of which will be ready for the next Strasbourg session.
If, as we say, we care about the poor and oppressed, if we believe in the right to life, then this House should support me in attempting to shine a light on this disgraceful situation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fortunately, what we have just heard is absolutely a minority opinion in this House, and I think we are all delighted about that.
I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, on the diligence and efficiency with which he has done his work.
He well understood that this was an urgent report, given the situation of the fleet affected by the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
A part of that fleet can now be included in the agreement with Mauritania, which will help to relieve the difficult situation which had been created.
The European Parliament is thereby giving its opinion on the Gallagher report on this agreement, which is essential to the European Union, in record time.
I also think it is fair to congratulate the Commission on having reached this agreement, which breaks the curse of the failure of the negotiations with Morocco.
Secondly, I would like to point out - because there has been false and ill-intentioned information on this agreement - that the agreement with Mauritania is very beneficial for both parties.
I insist; for both parties, and that is why it has been reached.
Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that there is no better defender in the world of cooperation development or of the conservation of resources than the European Union.
Therefore, neither private agreements nor public agreements with States other than the European Union, above all Asian States, can in any way be compared with the control and rigour applied by the European Union in these international agreements.
I would also like to take this opportunity, Commissioner, to condemn the recent seizure of a ship, the Lameiro Uno, which, while sailing towards Mauritanian waters, was seized by Morocco, accused of fishing, when this was not the case.
Commissioner, I hope that this intolerable practice by Morocco will not be repeated in the future, since it would jeopardise the achievements of the fisheries agreement with Mauritania.
I would ask you to take good note of this, in order to prevent any repetition of these practices, since vessels obviously have to pass through Morocco' s economic zone in order to reach Mauritania.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Mr Gallagher, for your report on the proposal for a regulation on a new protocol to the fisheries agreement with Mauritania.
I am delighted that you are in full agreement with the terms of this proposal setting out and safeguarding the facility for our fleet to fish in Mauritanian waters until May 2006.
As you know, we have a history of good fisheries relations with Mauritania.
Moreover, this agreement is now the Community's most comprehensive fisheries agreement and hence an important component of the Common Fisheries Policy.
We signed the new protocol at the end of July after four rounds of intensive and tough negotiations and I think we really have brokered a fair agreement which benefits Mauritanian fishermen and the Mauritanian sector as well as our own fishermen, while guaranteeing sustainable stock management.
I really must say, Mr Farage, that you would be better advised to base your comments on fact than political posturing.
So what exactly is the truth?
The truth is that we have included a whole series of new measures in this agreement which were absent from earlier agreements.
For example, some of the money goes directly towards improving scientific knowledge about resources.
From now on, stocks will be regularly and scientifically monitored, and we have stipulated that, if the size of the stocks changes, then fishing opportunities must be adjusted accordingly, as must the relevant financial compensation.
So it is quite untrue to say that we simply continue to fish the maximum catches, irrespective of how stocks develop.
That is the reality.
Secondly, we have based fishing rights on the data available, which Mauritania provided.
According to the data which we received, it was possible at the present time to agree on a slight increase in fishing opportunities for cephalopods.
However, I should like to point out that this is not the lion's share of the agreement.
The lion's share - around 40% - of catches under this agreement is accounted for by demersal species.
And, just for the record, they do not mainly benefit Spain, as you maintain, they mainly benefit the Netherlands.
Thirdly, the agreement contains a series of terms allowing for the sustainable management of Mauritanian fish stocks and the development of the local economy.
In order to protect local inshore fishing, we have moved the fishing areas for the Community fleet further away from the coast than was previously the case.
In order to help the local economy and create jobs in the country itself, we have agreed that demersal fish trawlers must now land a larger proportion of their catches in Mauritania.
In addition, more Mauritanian seamen will be taken on board EU ships in future.
Catch monitoring and controls have been strengthened and we have also increased the amount for so-called targeted actions significantly, by a total of EUR 20 million for the term of the agreement.
These flanking measures will help alleviate the concerns expressed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
As to the proposed amendments, we have absolutely no objection to Amendment Nos 1, 3 and 5.
In any case, these demands are already met under the interinstitutional agreements and, more importantly, under the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission of 5 July 2000, making these amendments superfluous.
We have a problem with Amendment Nos 2, 4 and 6 and cannot therefore agree to them.
As far as Amendment No 2 is concerned, the principle of non-discrimination is already laid down in the founding treaty of the European Union and there is therefore no sense in including this sort of clause.
As far as Amendment No 4 is concerned, I should point out that our standard practice is that no new mandate is required for a protocol extending a fisheries agreement.
As for Amendment No 6, mixed funding for negotiated fishing opportunities is part and parcel of our external fisheries policy.
In the case of agreements with third countries, the cost of compensation is footed by the Community budget, with shipowners paying for the licences.
May I also take this opportunity of pointing out that the sum quoted in the amendments is incorrect and that, from a purely formal point of view, the amendment should refer to the protocol.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Production and marketing of honey
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. This Parliament first raised the alarm about the threat to European beekeeping in 1985.
The resolutions which we passed in 1992, 1995 and 1997 - mainly unanimously - contain specific, reasonable, affordable and legally tenable proposals for direct aid to save the European beekeeping industry which, the rosy Commission statistics notwithstanding, is in a state of real crisis.
Our primary concern is not to increase the self-supply rate for quality honey from our beekeepers, which is currently just below 50%.
No.
What we are concerned with is guaranteeing that the 80 000 wild and cultivated plants across the European Union will be pollinated.
This is currently under threat as a result of the worrying decline in the number of beekeepers, more than half of whom are over 60 years old, and really has reached crisis point in certain regions.
It is truly amazing that, despite the patience and determination of the spokesmen of all the groups in this Chamber since 1985, we have not managed to bring the Commission to its senses and make it realise that its half-hearted policy based on the wishy-washy 1997 regulation urgently needs to be improved if we are to avert the threat to the balance of the European ecosystem from the beekeeping crisis.
It is incomprehensible, nay irritating in the extreme, that the Commission persists in doing nothing, despite its report on the unsatisfactory implementation of the inadequate measures based on the half-hearted 1997 regulation and despite its acknowledgement that European beekeeping has to contend with increasing difficulties.
With all due respect, Commissioner, we can no longer accept this absurd obduracy.
The Commission needs to come to its senses.
Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum.
You understand that, Mr Fischler.
The bases needed in order to introduce the direct aid now which we have lobbied for since 1992 are there for us in the Treaty.
In my report we have again made specific, affordable short- and medium-term proposals, which there is too little time to go into, but the Commission can read.
So what we want to hear today is that it is prepared to get moving on the basis of our proposals, which are supported by all beekeepers in the Community, from north to south, and we mean in the right direction.
Mr Fischler saw for himself on Tuesday, when beekeepers from the majority of Member States visited the House with their produce, which attracted a great deal of interest, that some stands were cleaned out before the beekeepers had time to offer their products to the invited guests.
I should also like to thank the honourable Members who attended the meeting with over 60 beekeepers and who, like my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, fully support the demands contained in my report.
We need more generous Community cofinancing than the current 50%, because many Member States are too mean to raise the 50% for programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed on the basis of the 1997 regulation, depriving their beekeepers of even the few hungry euros earmarked for their country.
We need both the immediate measures called for in the report and medium-term direct aid pending the mid-term view of Agenda 2000, especially premiums to compensate for loss of income because there is no Community preference in this sector.
I am almost proud of having managed, together with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets, to get appropriations for programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed raised from EUR 14 to 16.5 million for 2002.
That is the only compulsory expense in the agricultural budget to which this has happened.
But that cannot distract us from the fact that the Commission's bee policy is still underdeveloped.
All it needs is the political will on the part of the Commission and the Council to give us a sum which the EU takes less than five hours a year to spend, not to mention the EUR 2 billion embezzled from the budget. This political will is all that is needed to allow us, together with the beekeepers, to protect beekeeping in Europe and to prevent us from running blindly into the wall of an ecological catastrophe in the medium term.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the bee is a symbol of hard work and, in this respect, Mrs Lulling is the queen bee of the European Parliament in the truest sense of the word, because it is she who, for over a decade, has forced us not with carrots and sticks, but with honey and bee stings, by which I mean with sound arguments, to keep on debating this question, a question which many people tend to underestimate because, unlike me, they were not fortunate enough, back at the beginning of the 1980s, to meet the biggest group of visitors ever to visit this House in Strasbourg - a group of Bavarian beekeepers invited by the late Heinrich Aigner, who also fought long and hard for this cause. Several hundred Bavarian beekeepers came to the European Parliament, which just goes to show how committed these people are to their cause, which is also our cause.
Beekeepers are not a large group of voters, they are people who look after bees which, as Mrs Lulling has already said, ensure that a balance is constantly restored to our ecosystem, at least to a certain extent.
A cold winter is just beginning, but when it is over we know that spring will arrive, that the bees will again fly off to provide their pollination services and we shall again enjoy a blooming landscape.
But there is a danger that one day winter will come and no such spring will follow because there will be no bees or too few bees to provide this ecological function.
Many people believe that the EU is a country which flows with milk and honey.
With milk we have tried to get the quotas into order.
With bees, we have a self-supply rate of just below 50% in the European Union. Anyone who really wants to see a country which flows with milk and honey should fly to Argentina, as I did this summer.
Argentina could supply the European Union with most or many of the products that we need, but in these times of global political crisis, we are aware of two new elements.
First, we are aware of the need for quality following the BSE crisis and, secondly, we are aware of the need to be able to obtain healthy food from our own soil following the crisis on 11 September.
I think that a functioning European farming industry and a functioning European ecosystem need suitable support for our beekeepers, which is why I ask the House to throw its full weight behind the Lulling report.
Mr President, on the basis of the assessment and the application of Regulation (EC) No 1221/97, two clear conclusions should be drawn: firstly, that it is necessary to increase the amount of aid in each of the lines and the percentage of subsidy; secondly, that we must prevent, as was the case in the period 1998-2000, inequalities between sectors.
With regard to the corrections which should be introduced, we must achieve a reasonable balance in the cost-benefit for each of the action lines and a profound modification which transforms the current degree of co-funding, so that funding is entirely covered by the EAGGF Guarantee.
With regard to future needs, we should make two recommendations.
Firstly, we must establish a direct aid system which compensates for the loss of income suffered by European professional beekeepers.
Furthermore, we should create a COM for honey.
Secondly, we must recognise the importance of the role played by professional beekeepers by maintaining their status in the face of large bee-keeping operations, since they thereby allow the existence of a fully sustainable stock-breeding activity, which favours rural development and which, furthermore, produces healthy and high-quality products, and which is socially very beneficial, given its important contribution to environmental quality and its active role in conserving bio-diversity by means of the pollination carried out by bees.
I will end by saying, Mr President, that this task of pollination, which is safeguarded by beekeepers, must be compensated for through a line for specific aid which supplements the current Regulation.
I congratulate Mrs Lulling on her magnificent work.
Mr President, today the future of bee-keeping in Europe is in the balance.
This is about nothing less than saving a sector of production.
This is a matter of urgency because, while we are consuming more honey, production is falling to dangerously low levels.
Today we consume more than twice as much honey as we produce.
And if we are producing less it is essentially because of the devastating effect - now scientifically proven - which a certain number of systemic insecticides used to treat arable seeds have had on bee populations, which have been really decimated.
This situation is not unique or unusual; today nearly all European bee-keepers are affected.
Faced with a situation of this nature, the Commission's proposal, which is extremely weak, confines itself, as part of its new regulatory framework, to statistical work and a handful of promotion measures.
These proposals are obviously not sufficient to tackle the problems affecting the sector.
No one is denying that there is a need to refine the statistics, but this work is no substitute for what is most urgent, which is rebuilding bee populations so that our bee-keepers can save honey production in Europe.
Product promotion is a good thing, provided that the product concerned is available.
Furthermore, you have to be particularly careful with promotion when the products concerned are ones of which we have a considerable shortfall, which is the case with honey.
It is necessary to promote the link between the product and the land.
I do not believe that it is the European Union's job to fund the promotion of Chinese, Argentinean or Mexican honey: these are honeys which do not guarantee traceability in any shape or form, which are not subject to quality control, which do not comply with our standards and which are often nothing but flavoured glucose syrups.
We cannot claim that we wish to encourage European agriculture to develop in a way which is more respectful of the environment while at the same time letting our bee-keepers sink into indifference, and it is true that they do not constitute a powerful lobby.
They are all the more deserving of our attention.
Any product, including honey, can, admittedly, be purchased from outside, but the pollination of our plants is not something that can be imported.
We are dealing here with an area which is essential for preserving our environment and our bio-diversity.
That is why I welcome the work done by our excellent rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, and by all of the Members of the Committee on Agriculture who unanimously adopted the amendments which we tabled together.
These open the door to the possibility of Community funding being made available to help European bee-keepers to rebuild their hive populations in response to this urgent situation; we state this in Paragraph 10.
Veterinary costs related to bee-keeping should also be treated in the same way as for other animals; we state this in Paragraph 5.
And to safeguard the future of this industry in the long term, it is essential that, in the future, procedures for the approval of plant protection products take account of their effects on bees in terms of death or alteration in behaviour; this is our Paragraph 17.
It is essential that the precautionary principle be applied here.
Commissioner, the Commission needs to wake up; the Council needs to wake up.
This is a matter of great urgency.
We Members must sound the alarm.
The European Union would bear a huge responsibility if it hastened the disappearance of our bee-keepers.
I hope that all Members will support the wise, necessary and urgent proposals which we adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. First, may I congratulate you, Mrs Lulling, on being crowned queen bee of the European Parliament here today.
I should also like to congratulate you on the report which you have submitted.
However I hope, with reference to the sting which was also mentioned, that you do not share the fate of the bee which, as you know, can only sting once.
That would be a real pity.
Programmes to improve the conditions under which honey is produced and marketed are regularly submitted by all Member States for approval and, with only 80% of available funds being taken up, the satisfactory application of Regulation 1221/97 would clearly appear to be guaranteed.
For the rest, the Council has approved the European Parliament's motion for the funds earmarked for the application of the regulation to be increased by EUR 2.5 million.
The Commission would therefore be delighted if the Member States and the enterprises in question were to take up all these funds in order to implement as many measures as possible within the current legal framework, in order to help the sector and allow it to develop in line with the rapporteur's considerations.
When the report on the first three years' application of this regulation was submitted to the Council, the representatives of the Member States raised no objections whatsoever and approved the Commission's conclusions unanimously.
In discussions with the Commission, the enterprises in the sector welcomed the fact that the aid regulation in favour of European beekeeping was to be maintained.
The economy in the honey sector is stable, production and imports have remained steady and the self-supply rate has fluctuated between 48 and 50% for several years and is therefore nothing new.
Bearing these facts in mind and bearing in mind the heterogeneity of the sector and the widely differing bee economies in the European Union, we feel that neither a new common organisation of the market in the honey sector nor a direct aid regulation in the form of direct income support for beekeepers is warranted at the present time.
Other suggestions in the report, such as specific aid to improve the bee population through rearing apiaries, can already be implemented under the current regulation, without the need for any new legal provisions.
We also have all the facilities of the structural policy and the policy to promote agricultural products at our disposal.
They too need to be implemented accordingly, although the initiative here lies mainly with the Member States.
Having said which, the Member States and the enterprises in question need to work more closely together in applying and implementing the programmes in order to ensure there is coherent political and financial support for this sector across the EU.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity, as Mr Fischler is still here but will surely not be able to stay for this evening's vote, to say that I am somewhat disappointed.
You cannot say that these paltry funds of between EUR 10 and 14 million - granted, we shall get a bit more next year - are satisfactory because 80% are being taken up.
I realise that we are making demands on the Member States and that a bit more will be done within the existing legal framework, but we also want a more flexible approach than is possible at present.
But I must say that I really am appalled to hear that not one representative in the Council - i.e. not one Member State - had any objection whatsoever; do they really think we need do nothing at all?
I think it is quite something that the Member States apparently feel no need to react to what the European Parliament has to say about your report.
But we and the beekeepers shall make sure that the Member States at least acknowledge what we have to say about the report, just in case they think there is no need to act.
As you know, we have not called for any all-powerful order, but we still take the view that we need direct aid regulations in the medium term.
You say they are not warranted at the present time.
You have heard the beekeepers, they take quite a different view and you must be fully aware of what is happening in this sector.
We shall also ensure that beekeepers are better informed about the facilities available under structural policy and measures to promote agricultural produce, but here too we have very limited funds for numerous quality products.
Mr President, I just wanted to say this to Mr Fischler because I already know what he has told us. I had hoped for something more, rather than being hung out to dry!
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
My colleagues in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms have told me that at 8.57 a.m. they received an e-mail convening the Committee for 9.30 a.m..
This way of doing things seems rather odd to me.
I should therefore like this not only noted in the minutes but also brought to your attention, Mr President, so that, since we shall be making a formal protest, the Bureau is kept informed of the fact that committees are meeting after being convened with only 33 minutes' notice - something I find rather odd, not to say strange, not to say inappropriate.
Mr President, I do not want to prolong the debate unnecessarily.
I would, however like to say that I am the deputy chairman of this committee and I was treated in exactly the same manner.
It is a sorry state of affairs when a deputy chairman is not even given proper notice of an extraordinary meeting.
This sort of treatment is quite simply unacceptable.
Thank you for your observations.
At this point, however, I cannot do anything.
Amongst other things, as you know, this House has expressed its wish that the urgent procedure should be voted on during the next sitting of Parliament, next Monday.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Zimbabwe
The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0759/2001 by Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group,
B5-0774/2001 by SjÃ¶stedt, Marset Campos and Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,
B5-0787/2001 by Maes, Lucas and Lannoye, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group,
B5-0788/2001 by Mulder, van den Bos and MalmstrÃ¶m, on behalf of the ELDR Group,
B5-0799/2001 by Kinnock, on behalf of the PSE Group,
B5-0801/2001 by Van Orden, Deva, Parish, Foster, Banotti, Corrie, Gahler, Korhola, Lehne, Maij-Weggen, SacrÃ©deus and Belder, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group
on Zimbabwe
Mr President, I believe that the resolution on Zimbabwe that we have formulated together is quite rightly a tough one, intended as a warning to Mr Mugabe.
At a time when democratic elections should be in preparation, Mugabe' s only response has been to encourage and establish an atmosphere of terror in his country - everywhere, in the countryside and in the towns.
This makes it crucial that the elections are able proceed in a normal way, and that the international community continues to insist that they are.
But nothing suggests that Mr Mugabe is receptive to this justified democratic demand from within his own country, where even in the previous elections it was clear that the virtual majority wanted a change of government.
Mr Mugabe is clinging to power and to that end regards all possible legitimate and especially illegitimate means as justified.
For example, journalists must now apply for a work permit before they are allowed to write.
This of course runs counter to freedom of expression.
The printing works of the few still more or less independent papers are smashed up.
In this way opinion forming is hampered.
Today I received the manifesto of the women' s organisations, which complain that women obliged to sell the fruits of their labour on the land to a state institution are either not paid at all or else far too late, in a country where inflation is running at 86%.
We shall therefore vote in favour of this motion with great determination for this and many other reasons mentioned in the text.
Mr President, Zimbabwe really had all the qualifications for becoming a prosperous and successful country in southern Africa.
That is why it is so incredibly tragic to see it heading straight for the abyss.
Zimbabwe has been discussed by us many times in this House, as I know it has also been in the other institutions.
We have often thought we have seen some small glimpse of hope or gleam of light.
We have been wrong every time.
There are no such glimmers.
The situation is alarming.
Zimbabwe is a lawless, economically impoverished country governed by a dictatorial old ruler who has completely lost contact with reality and with his own people.
Robert Mugabe breaks promise after promise made to surrounding countries.
He has not succeeded in stopping the illegal land occupations or in bringing about fair land reform.
Human rights are infringed on a daily basis, and the opposition is harassed and persecuted in an unacceptable way.
The regime is thoroughly corrupt and, in terms of democracy, the impending elections, in which election workers are threatened, harassed and imprisoned, cannot be called anything other than a joke.
Freedom of expression is totally restricted.
We must immediately break off all communication with, and suspend all assistance to, the Zimbabwean regime.
All Mugabe' s foreign assets and all those of his family should be frozen.
I really want to appeal to both the Commission and the Council to be crystal-clear in their condemnation of Mugabe' s regime and to state that our and the world community' s patience is at an end.
We must establish a broad, international coalition and form of cooperation with the SADC states so as to put pressure on the regime and take measures against it.
At the same time, it is of course important to find ways of supporting the opposition.
There is a small number of courageous people who, at risk to their own lives, are fighting for democracy and human dignity.
Mr President, this is the second urgent resolution on Zimbabwe that we have put forward in just over three months.
The reason for this is our enormous concern at the continued deterioration of the situation in that country with such a short time to go before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September there were some indications that Mugabe might be prepared to respond to international pressure.
Sadly, it is now very obvious that the commitments given at Abuja were a sham.
It would seem that Mugabe thinks he can make a few promises, buy a little more time and then carry on with his repressive policies while the economy of a once prosperous Zimbabwe collapses.
Half a million Zimbabweans are now on the verge of starvation.
Opposition politicians go in fear of their lives.
Mugabe's absolute contempt for international opinion was further demonstrated by his defiance towards the EU troika which visited Harare at the end of November.
We now have to show that we are serious in our threats to take action.
At the moment Mugabe thinks he is untouchable and even flies to Spain for medical treatment.
We are not proposing the blunt instrument of economic sanctions.
We know that this would impact on the population at large and in any case we are only too aware how such measures can be evaded.
We are calling for smart sanctions that would directly hit Mugabe, his family and his cronies.
Steps should be taken immediately to freeze their overseas assets and to impose a travel ban.
The decision to move in this direction should be taken by ministers at Laeken this weekend.
Our resolve should be made absolutely clear in the meeting scheduled to take place next week between the European Union and Zimbabwean representatives under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
If Mugabe does not take immediate and verifiable action in the way that the international community is demanding, the European Union must be ready at once to impose the smart sanctions.
Our resolution today sets out clearly what has to be done.
Let us not dilute the message in any way.
The resolution is a basis for action now.
Mr President, this is the sixth and most sharply worded motion since the crisis broke in Zimbabwe.
We have the Council to thank for finally getting Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement moving since the last resolution.
We hope that contacts with Zimbabwe in this context will bear fruit, although we do not really expect this man to show the slightest interest in our measures.
On the contrary, he will get his own party to elect him as a presidential candidate in Victoria Falls this weekend and he is already preparing to make a farce of these elections.
For a start, he is now demanding proof of residency as well as identity cards as proof of electoral status.
A great many people find it very hard to provide such proof.
And now he wants to hold the elections in constituencies, rather than as nationwide elections throughout the country.
People who are not registered in the large towns where they work will have to travel home.
Most will not be able to afford to do so.
The aim is to ensure that as many people as possible are excluded de facto from the elections, because he knows that this will stop the majority of his opponents from voting.
There are 200 000 people currently starving in the Masningo province because Governor Hungwe has stopped food from being distributed by NGOs.
The Governor has demanded that the food be delivered to him first so that he can arrange for it to be distributed.
Then, of course, he will only feed his own people.
We must not let this man get away with it. We must ensure that we take targeted measures to stop Mr Mugabe in time, and I call on us all to do so.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is painful to have to stand by as a stubborn president, who has also earned a great deal of credit, uses unscrupulous party activists to help him systematically ruin a country, with no scruples about using deadly force in the process, because he cannot come to terms with the threat of losing power.
Like Mr Gahler, I was one of the parliamentary election observers at the time and saw for myself how Mugabe and his rent-a-mob were driving the country straight towards catastrophe.
Despite massive attempts to intimidate the electors - and we shall no doubt see an action replay of that now - and despite massive support for the opposition candidates, which has ended in death in a multitude of cases, the MDC achieved a remarkable result, clearly signalling to Mugabe that political change was on the horizon.
Now, with presidential elections imminent, Mugabe is again tightening the screw of force and terror.
There is no sign of the return to the rule of law promised in the Abuja agreement; on the contrary.
By using more and more legislative repression, massively restricting the freedom of the press, threatening the opposition, continuing to occupy farms and permanently undermining the rule of law, Mugabe is isolating himself more and more, including from his traditional allies in southern Africa.
This was blatantly obvious at the last meeting of the ACP/EU joint parliamentary assembly in Brussels in October.
These countries are being sucked into free fall by the humanitarian and economic disaster in Zimbabwe and further pressure is needed to make Robert Mugabe change direction and hold the presidential elections in accordance with the standards of free and fair elections, and this is where we also need the support of the institutions of the European Community.
Mr President, the regime of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe is having a very bad press internationally, and with good reasons.
Mugabe is sacrificing countless human lives, literally and figuratively, to his utterly ruthless aim of retaining power.
The shocking Dutch newspaper headline of less than a week ago 'Zimbabwe stinks of blood lust' sadly completely sums up the content of the article by the paper' s correspondent in Harare.
The accompanying vulgar cartoon from the Zimbabwean state paper The Herald underlines this ominous message.
The cartoon turns Mugabe' s major challenger in next year' s presidential elections, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change, into a downright caricature.
He is depicted as the yes-man of rich white farmers in his own country and of Western powers.
However, Zimbabwean political reality looks completely different. Naked state terror against white farmers, their black managers and agricultural labourers as well as against political opponents of Mugabe' s party, ZANU-PF.
State terror manifests itself in ten or so methods of repression: undermining the judicial system, politicisation of the army and police, attacks on press freedom, occupation of the estates of white farmers, slander against independent institutions like the Red Cross, purportedly acting as cover organisations for the opposition, electoral fraud, tapping the opposition' s telephone traffic, detention of and slurs on members of the opposition MDC party, violence and intimidation against supposed supporters of the opposition and, finally, murder of political opponents.
In this context, I should like to ask the Commission urgently, in its meeting with Zimbabwean Government representatives at the beginning of next week, to speak up above all for those domestic organisations that help the victims of political violence in Zimbabwe, who now total hundreds of thousands.
When Mr Mugabe became the first President of Zimbabwe some 40 years ago, that land-locked country in Africa was a rich nation that could feed its population and export food to neighbouring countries.
About 1000 white farmers, owning most of the land, produced the food and the surplus.
After independence in Zimbabwe, the Lancaster House Agreement between Britain, as the colonial power, and Zimbabwe allowed for land redistribution to black families and appropriate compensation to white farmers without any loss of production.
Mugabe has failed in implementing these reforms.
He has failed to settle the poor black families.
Since independence, Mugabe has had much time to establish real democracy, rule of law and prosperity for all.
Instead, he has enriched himself, his friends and destroyed his country's economy.
He has made the poor even poorer.
He has intimidated, looted and deprived the white farmers who produced so much wealth for his nation.
Zimbabwe needs a free and fair election now.
Mugabe should not fear.
He will be judged on his record.
If he is a statesman, like Mandela, then he should step down with dignity and let someone else from Zanu-PF contest the election.
If he is still a Catholic, then he should listen to Archbishop Ncube of Zimbabwe who has also condemned him regularly without fear.
Mr Mugabe cannot and will not be remembered in Africa unless he gives his countrymen a chance to breathe, walk without fear and seek opportunities to enhance their quality of life.
I have a simple message for Mr Mugabe - be an African elder and retire gracefully to your village.
Mr President, Article 96 consultations will not be easy but we should give them a chance.
Zimbabwe confirmed its participation, but the original date of 19 December for the start of these consultations was yesterday postponed.
We do not have an indication of another date.
The idea is to hold them next month.
It has been indicated that SADC, ACP and the OAU will be invited to and included in these consultations.
This is good because it broadens out the scope by anchoring in Africa the kind of discussion we have to go through with Zimbabwe.
The consultations will focus on the issues which matter to us - human rights, democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the escalation of violence.
The consultations will provide an opportunity to seek the government's views and their firm commitment in the following areas: politically motivated violence, elections, freedom of the media, the judiciary and illegal occupation of properties.
I would like to reassure Parliament that these consultations cover practically the totality of the issues raised in their draft resolutions.
I would like to stress that there will also be a clear EU position on the points Zimbabwe is bound to raise, such as land reform, interference in its internal affairs, alleged support for the opposition and the imposition of what they call "white values".
Finally, not pre-judging the outcome of the consultations and handling them in the spirit of the Cotonou agreement is not only necessary to address the situation with Zimbabwe, it is also necessary to maintain mutual trust and confidence between the EU and ACP countries.
But respecting the rules and the spirit of these consultations is not the same as carrying them out in a vague and weak manner.
This is not how the piano is going to be played!
As regards electoral monitoring, the Commission is getting prepared for this.
The Government of Zimbabwe has announced that it will not accept monitors; it will only invite friends to observe the presidential elections.
The auguries for an EU presence are not too good, but we will be able to mount an EU mission should this be feasible.
We are maintaining flexibility to react to developments and possibilities.
A key requirement will be that no international observation mission - whether multilateral or bilateral - is manipulated by Mugabe into sending short-term observers only for polling day.
We have to keep in mind that last year polling day itself was relatively calm.
It is clear that the campaigning period in the run-up to the poll is crucial for determining the fairness of the electoral process itself.
The Commission considers that a minimum length of observation time - that is, one month - is necessary and we are discouraging others from sending short-term observers only.
The Commission has suggested that the EU focus its approach on the SADC Parliamentary Forum's norms and standards, which comply with the UN standards and have been endorsed by Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF Party.
There are indications that other international partners, such as the Commonwealth and the United States, will agree to use those standards, which would then allow the international community to judge the openness and fairness of the elections.
In parallel, the SADC Electoral Forum and the Electoral Commissions Forum of SADC countries are being encouraged to open a dialogue with the Zimbabwe authorities and the political parties, on the preparations for the presidential election.
We see close collaboration with SADC in this election-related activity as a way of creating some sort of base-line case so that we will be able to do something if we cannot participate directly.
But this is the preferred option, and Zimbabwe should welcome the EU observers.
The Commission has remained engaged in the country in order, on the one hand, not to pre-judge the outcome of the consultations and at the same time to up the stakes for Zimbabwe of an eventual failure - thus increasing the pressure on them to cooperate.
This is the rationale of what we are doing at this moment.
We have therefore taken the following actions: the Commission has currently a mission on the ground to assess humanitarian needs and food security issues.
This we will do in any case, whatever the political outcome.
Preliminary results show that, remarkably, the deterioration of the situation is much slower than could have been expected.
The Commission has also participated in the UNDP land mission.
Successful or not, it is worth exerting a positive pressure on Zimbabwe by doing anything possible to move forward the dossier of land reform.
The Commission has maintained, as I mentioned before, its offer to support the electoral process.
We continue preparing our cooperation under the new five-year funding cycle, not least to demonstrate to the Government of Zimbabwe what it has to lose.
We will not take any decisions on whether or not to proceed with signing and implementing the Country Strategy for Zimbabwe until after the consultations have been concluded.
To sign or not to sign is a very important question in many cases and here it is quite clear that we want the consultations concluded before we move on.
But not to prepare would also imply lack of respect of the whole process of planning in the Cotonou framework.
The regional dimension is important.
It appears that Zimbabwe's neighbours are becoming increasingly concerned with the deterioration of the situation and the potentially very dramatic consequences for the country and the whole region.
This is why we have taken the initiative to maintain close contact with SADC and Nigeria in view of Article 96 consultations.
It is, in fact, the first time ever that the opening of these consultations has included a reference to the use of our partners in the region.
The General Affairs Council accepted this approach, ensuring close coordination and complementarity with SADC and the Abuja process.
The Commission and presidency have proceeded with a series of informal exchanges with SADC and Nigeria against this background.
We note that these African partners are already exerting effective peer pressure on Mugabe so that a solution to the crisis may be found.
The emerging African ownership approach has to be welcomed, particularly in view of the negative effect that the continuing crisis in Zimbabwe is having on its neighbours.
I must confess that the outlook is not optimistic.
Things look very bad as we move into these consultations.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Cluster bombs
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0765/2001 by Sakellariou, Wiersma and van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group,
B5-0775/2001 by Brie, Frahm, Eriksson, Korakas, Figueiredo, Marset Campos, Papayannakis, Boudjenah and SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,
B5-0782/2001 by McKenna, Maes, Schroedter, Lucas and Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group,
B5-0789/2001 by van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group,
on cluster bombs.
Mr President, I wanted to begin my speech by expressing my horror at this war in Afghanistan and any other war.
We have always spoken out very clearly against the Taliban government and the measures it took against its own population, against women' s rights in particular.
But we are also against the deaths of - I believe - thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
Today we are talking about a weapon which is being used in Afghanistan, a weapon which the United Nations Convention of 1980 called into question, a weapon which is today also the subject of discussion in the Conference taking place in Geneva.
A weapon which, together with anti-personnel mines, makes enormous areas of our planet uninhabitable.
Mr President, I believe it should be banned. As simple as that.
I even find the fourth paragraph of this resolution, which says that we must provide them with more reliable mechanisms, repellent.
I believe that nobody in this House has expressed the horror of any war better than our recent winner of the Sakharov Prize, the Israeli Nurit Peled-Elhanan, who spoke here yesterday.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Cluster bombs, as we all know, are one of the most treacherous conventional weapons ever devised by man.
Civilians and aid workers fall victim to these bombs years after the conflict has ended.
The peace process often grinds to a halt because unexploded bomblets close off whole areas.
Refugees cannot return, because the area is no longer inhabitable.
These are the reasons why our group agrees with the statement made by the President of our Parliament and condemns outright the use of cluster bombs by the US army in Afghanistan.
This bombardment will set the peace process and economic development in Afghanistan back years.
I think it is irresponsible to continue this bombardment and I call on the USA to put a stop to it at long last.
I also call from this platform on all countries, especially those who have signed the UN Convention on Conventional Weapons, to apply an immediate moratorium at their next conference and pronounce a definitive ban on the use, production and supply of these weapons.
And I call on the Commission and the Council in its negotiations with the USA to urge them to subscribe to a ban on cluster bombs.
Could I just briefly refer to the statement made by the Commissioner on Zimbabwe, which I very much welcome.
We have put off these Cotonou negotiations and we really need to have a deadline by which they must take place.
Otherwise I can see Mugabe will just keep on deferring it until nothing happens at all.
I would suggest that we ought to set a date, such as January 12, by which, if nothing has happened, we proceed with the sort of strong measures that we have suggested.
Turning to the cluster bomb issue, I have to say that I have been one of the foremost activists in support of the campaign to ban antipersonnel landmines because our armed forces recognise that their limited military utility is outweighed by the danger that they so often pose to civilians, often many years after a conflict is over.
There are other weapon systems that could be used instead of antipersonnel landmines to equal effect, but without the negative dangers.
There are those engaged in mine clearance actions who will testify to the fact that a large proportion of the hazardous material they come across is unexploded ordnance of various sorts rather than antipersonnel mines Sometimes this ordnance includes unexploded bomblets from cluster bomb units.
I have to say that cluster bombs are not antipersonnel landmines and it is bogus to try and confuse these two issues.
While I would support the need for such remotely delivered munitions to contain self-destruct or neutralising mechanisms, it would be most unwise to insist on a ban until our armed forces are satisfied that their operations would not be impaired or that they have substitute weapons of equal effectiveness.
We have to be very careful and beware of what I might call 'banning creep'.
Otherwise we are going to blur the focus of our actions against systems such as antipersonnel landmines and the wide support which that sort of campaign attracts.
There are some elements in the resolution that I can support, but I am suspicious of some of its driving elements.
Therefore, I am inclined to abstain on the resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one international agreement to protect the victims of international armed conflicts states that it is forbidden to use weapons, projectiles or materials and methods of war which may inflict unnecessary injury or suffering.
So much for the theory.
In practice, things are very different.
Unfortunately, there are malicious people in today's world who are unscrupulous in their decision to use force and who are unscrupulous as to which weapons they use.
But there are also people who have good reason - in order to limit and prevent force and terror - for having recourse to weapons, who have to have recourse to weapons on grounds which are perfectly in keeping with human rights.
Our call is to these people. If you have to have recourse to weapons, even with good intentions, then those weapons should not, as this text states, be weapons which inflict unnecessary or avoidable injury and unnecessary suffering.
In this respect, there is indeed a connection with our lasting and extremely - not completely but extremely - successful fight against landmines, which are weapons in all but name.
I think that we should state our views in no uncertain terms in this case too.
Perhaps there are technical features which can be incorporated in order to prevent this sort of injury and unnecessary suffering.
But at least until there are, there must be a moratorium and that is what we are saying today.
We are sorry that these weapons are being used, including in Afghanistan.
But what is more important is for us to look to the future and for the European Union to come out quite clearly and unequivocally in favour of a moratorium in order - I repeat - to prevent avoidable injury and unnecessary suffering.
Europe must support such a moratorium unequivocally.
Mr President, my group has given the go-ahead for the vote on this resolution, and I am one of those who support the resolution and am vehemently in favour of a moratorium.
We must tread very carefully in this particular war.
We are fighting a terrorist regime but we run the risk of not preparing for peace and of becoming embroiled in this conflict with no clear peace programme or prospects.
We oppose the death penalty which the Taliban have applied and yet we import it club class in huge American transporters.
We abhor Taliban misogyny but say nothing about the rapes carried out by the so-called Northern Alliance - a highly dubious alliance - on a massive scale.
The same applies here: obviously we have to use weapons systems in order to bring this war in Afghanistan to a successful close.
But, on the other hand, we need to ensure that as many civilians as possible are spared in order to prevent this war from escalating around the world and in order to prevent further escalation in weapons systems, especially now that more and more politicians and former pacifists are suddenly beginning to think in terms of the admissibility of war and to accept war as a policy instrument.
Sometimes it has to be the last resort, but what worries me is how comfortable we have become with the idea of war.
It is precisely at such times that we need to ban this sort of weapons system and, more importantly, to strengthen international law.
We have an international coalition against terrorism, but unless we can cash in on it by strengthening the international law of the United Nations, we shall be prey to other constellations which we absolutely do not want.
Hence, as I said, we need to fight terrorism but the ultimate aim must be to strengthen international law and ban - and this too is a topical issue - atomic as well as biological and chemical weapons.
Which is where the USA comes in and of course, most importantly, a ban on these cluster bombs which, in our view, are a means of war which endanger civilians to an unreasonable extent.
Those who know what damage was caused in the Balkans or Kosovo, mainly because of the mines laid by the Yugoslav army - that too needs to be said - they will understand why, at all events, we need to take a moderate line here.
The Commission shares Parliament' s concern about the humanitarian, economic and social problems caused by a variety of unexploded ordnance such as cluster bombs and the particular difficulties of clearing contaminated areas.
A number of studies on cluster bombs show that no less than 10% of delivered cluster bomblets fail to explode on impact and that the remaining unexploded ones tend to have effects similar to anti-personnel landmines.
They also are victim-activated and provoke fatal or disabling injuries as serious as those caused by landmines.
The Commission has taken due note of the proposal submitted by the International Committee of the Red Cross to address the problems caused by cluster bombs and other 'explosive remnants of war' at the review conference of the UN Convention on the Prohibition or Restriction on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons.
This approach is broadly shared by the EU.
At the review conference, which is being held in Geneva from 11 to 21 December 2001, the EU will present a common position on the issue of the unexploded remnants of war, requesting concrete steps to address this issue under the CCW framework.
With this in mind, we have carried out diplomatic dÃ©marches to prepare the ground for a successful outcome of the Geneva meeting.
Parliament's initiative is therefore particularly timely and welcome.
The Commission will closely follow developments at the CCW review conference.
On an operational level, the Commission is already providing an indirect but tangible contribution to the reduction of the threat posed by cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance through the legal and budgetary instrument of the anti-personnel landmines regulation.
Mine clearance carried out under this regulation encompasses de facto clearance of other unexploded ordnance.
We are already engaged in such broader clearance activities in countries such as Laos and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo, where the anti-personnel landmine problem is very clearly connected to unexploded ordnance pollution.
Mine clearance is also supported as part of ECHO-funded humanitarian aid in many countries and as part of development activities when we are carrying out ECHO-financed reconstruction work or building roads, etc. in a number of countries.
A week ago, in Kabul, I saw de-mining activities funded by ECHO.
Through two organisations we have employed something like 1 500 to 2 000 local Afghan staff who are continually working on de-mining.
We walked on marked paths in areas where I counted 30 to 40 recent non-exploded cluster bombs.
They do not necessarily stay on the surface of the ground.
If a neighbouring cluster bomblet explodes it may bury a few others and functionally they become anti-personnel landmines.
They have three functions: armour penetration capability, spraying shards of shrapnel from the casing, and starting a fire.
It was a very morbid experience but it gives me real satisfaction that we are funding this kind of activity on a large scale.
Certainly this is a main priority in the present situation where we are working to make it possible for the refugees to return home safely.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.

Women in Afghanistan
Mr President, Commissioner, unless women are involved, there will be no lasting peace in Afghanistan.
That was the most important message to come out of the Afghan women's summit convened in Brussels on 5 and 6 December with the support of the EU.
Around 50 leading representatives from every social group in the country attended the conference, in a bid to make the voice of Afghan women heard in the current international political debate.
We are delighted that the UN-Afghanistan conference held in parallel in Bonn decided to appoint at least two women, including one as deputy prime minister, to the transitional government.
Our summit in Brussels certainly helped here.
They can count on our support, but more needs to happen.
We insist that women be given a good chance and be selected as candidates in future elections at all political levels.
That means they need support and practical help now in a special democracy programme.
Care must be taken in any future negotiations to ensure that Afghan women are fully integrated in efforts to resolve conflicts and in ongoing peace talks.
The whole world and the media are watching at present and this must be used to build up new structures and ensure that the voice of Afghan women is heard.
My group will use International Women's Day in 2002, just as it did in 1998, to maintain the wave of support in favour of averting a humanitarian disaster.
The new watchword of the Social Democrats, who have been highlighting the plight of women under the Taliban regime for years, is this: no project for the future of Afghanistan and no form of political agreement will be accepted unless women are fully involved.
We are calling for a group of leading Afghan women to be set up to coordinate international support, with a corresponding contact for assistance from the EU.
The women and girls of Afghanistan have had to withstand 20 years of war and constant infringement of their human rights.
But that does not mean they were condemned to silence.
Afghan organisations such as the RAWA have worked hard to resist the Taliban regime.
There is no reason to believe that things will be much better under the Northern Alliance, which is why we must support the courage and determination of the RAWA today.
This morning we put budgetary arrangements in place to support NGOs such as the RAWA.
But we need staying power and committed women to ensure that women get peace, freedom and equality in Afghanistan.
We must not let up until women's rights are fully respected as human rights under the future constitution.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we live in the same world as the women of Afghanistan.
I should like to recall their Declaration of the Essential Rights of Afghan Women, which they adopted in Dushanbe on 28 June 2000.
These were women issuing a call to action and not only victims.
I should also like to recall, as Mrs GrÃ¶ner has just done, the Afghan Women's Summit, which concluded on 6 December 2001, last week, and which issued a proclamation which it is important to be familiar with.
This proclamation says: Afghan women want their rights now, not tomorrow, not later on.
All these rights have been returned to them; we therefore need to restore these rights now.
That is why I have tabled an amendment which I would ask you to support, calling for these rights to be re-established as quickly as possible.
We need to give them the means to travel and to receive education and healthcare because ultimately we, the women of the same world as them, are a little anxious.
We are a little anxious and we call on the European institutions and the UN institutions to be vigilant.
Paragraph 5 of the resolution calls for the UN to focus particularly on establishing equality between men and women in Afghanistan, because these women have really been the symbols of many things.
They have been the symbols of their own oppression, but they have also been the symbols of famine.
Six months ago, when we were debating the situation in Afghanistan, they were the symbols of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues, and even of their own oppression.
It is not therefore a question of discarding the symbol once it has served its purpose.
It is a question of acting in such a way that the women are able to rediscover their rights and, for those who feel able to fight actively as representatives of all of the people, to participate in the government.
These women are active participants in this process and we live in the same world as they do.
They are demanding the freedom to travel and the recognition of habeas corpus; I believe that these freedoms are the same as those enjoyed by Westerners and that we should not seek to draw a distinction between them. That is why there is no secondary issue here, just one thing which I am asking you and that is, if possible, as an institution, to work to ensure that these freedoms are respected, because we are not sure that tomorrow will be any better than yesterday for these women.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to add to what my fellow MEPs have already said by stating how gratifying it is to see the delight shown by Afghan women.
However, we are also concerned about the fear that prevails at the same time.
Afghan women have good reasons to be afraid, for we know that the Northern Alliance too has perpetrated crimes such as forced marriage.
It is important that women and children should survive the winter.
At the same time, it is important to proceed with the measures referred to in this House: full access to education and healthcare for women and young girls.
We must immediately proceed on the basis of a rights-based approach.
Afghan women should not have to beg for the right to education as a favour.
Instead, this must be a right.
In that way, they will achieve the dignity and receive the education that they require.
We also need to earmark funds but, in this area, equality between the different ethnic groups is required.
We are delighted about the outcome of the Bonn Conference, but the work must go on.
I should also like to draw Mr Nielson' s attention to the special report prepared by my predecessor, Mrs Rehn, on the UN' s peacekeeping activities and ask him to note that there is a lot to do when it comes to the treatment of women by the peacekeeping forces.
Women are needed in the peacekeeping forces, and an understanding is required of how to treat women who have suffered violence.
I hope that the UN will support the proposal tabled by Mrs Rehn in her report to Kofi Annan.
The issue of guilt also needs to be examined, that is to say who bears responsibility for what.
It is the only way in which to bring about healing.
I believe there is a lot of international experience in this area that we can draw upon.
Last but not least, quite a serious issue, Commissioner Nielson.
Mine dogs, which are extremely important in clearing away all this devastation, are also needed.
I hope that the EU can offer support in this area, too.
Mr President, the international Afghanistan conference at Petersberg in Bonn led to excellent results last Wednesday.
The 29-strong transitional government will include two women.
This is a fundamentally important message and a first step towards social recognition.
With the end of the Taliban's reign of terror and its mediaeval regime in sight, the brutal suppression of women's rights will also come to an end.
They have been the main ones to suffer under the caste of self-appointed warriors of God.
They have been denied an education, training, career and the right to any say-so whatsoever.
They were banned from public life.
The painful result: only 5% of women and girls can read or write.
From now on, women will acquire equal opportunities in access to jobs, medical care and the right to vote on a par with men.
In Parliament and the government they need seats and a voice.
I am convinced that they will succeed in building up their own organisations so that they too can influence the economic and social decision-making processes.
They will be unstoppable in finding their new identity, but they need staying power and our support.
I hope that the women whom we honoured on 8 March 1998 in our campaign "A flower for Kabul" will be able to return to their professions as doctors, teachers, professors and managers.
On behalf of the PPE and as a member of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I support the proposal to make the 8 March next year Afghan Women's Day.
The European Union has supported Afghanistan alone to the tune of EUR 400 million over the last 10 years.
In future, we must invest more in programmes and projects for women.
As far as reconstruction is concerned, we call on Afghanistan's neighbours to take an active part in this process.
Mr President, as a co-author of this resolution I am proud that I spoke out in June of this year in this Chamber against the brutality and medieval obscurantist policies of the Taliban government, when they chose to destroy the beautiful Buddhist statutes in Bamiyan.
This was well before they, and their tragic country, became the focus of the world on 11 September, as the Taliban's link with the perpetrators of the attack on the USA became clear to everybody.
Afghanistan is now at an historical crossroad.
I, as a British MEP, am proud of the role played by the courageous troops from my country in helping America rid Afghanistan of its oppressive masters and end their harbouring of international terrorists bent on the destruction of western values, including women's rights.
I salute particularly those who have been wounded in the campaign and hope, as the UK is about to become a major component of the UN peacekeeping force, that no further casualties will ensue.
Two weeks ago I was invited to meet a representative from the Revolutionary Association of Afghan Women and I, as a Conservative, baulked initially at the title "revolutionary".
However, after my meeting I decided that, in Afghanistan, my western views on social and political rights for women would no doubt, in the eyes of the old mujaheddin guard, such as President Rabbani, classify me, too, as a revolutionary.
I welcome the participation of two women in the interim government and I am hopeful that the new generation of younger, progressive and modern political leaders will see the way to establish a new order based on equality of the sexes and on full political and social rights enshrined in their international treaty obligations, and cease to regard women and their role as a purely economic one and a procreative one and banish them to invisibility in their burkas.
Women were once, in the 1960s and 1970s, welcomed by the government of King Mohammed Zahir Shah as full participating members of society in their professions, in higher education and in politics.
I hope that Afghanistan can return to this form of moderate secular government again, and make use of the huge pool of talent residing in more than 50% of its population.
Mr President, Saudi Arabia has no credibility and offers no guarantees in terms of defending Afghan women.
Saudi Arabia is one of just three countries which officially supported the Taliban regime.
It has been promoting and financially aiding Islamic fundamentalism and it seriously violates the human rights of women.
Mr President, given Saudi Arabia' s anti-women pedigree, is it coherent that at the meeting in Washington on 20 November, that country should be named as part of the group that will lead the reconstruction of Afghanistan?
Mr President, Afghanistan is now entering a hopeful stage and they must begin to change the harsh living conditions for women.
We need a plan containing urgent measures in order that Afghanistan may embark on reconstruction and the road to peace and progress.
The European Union must concern itself as directly as possible with imposing order in the distribution of humanitarian aid and establishing speedy measures and structures so that girls and women may receive education and healthcare.
My final recommendation, Mr President, is that we remember those women' s organisations which resisted the Taliban - such as RAWA - and it is those organisations which must now play a decisive role so that women are fully involved in the reconstruction.
'I keep on seeing dead bodies: our country is a cemetery.
We keep on resisting to free ourselves from terrorism and the war lords, and also from the USA, which created Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban and which, in order to fight and kill them, also bomb us.'
Fatima was talking to me on the telephone from Kabul: she is not a refugee but a RAWA leader.
She says the streets in Kabul are once again crowded and the markets are full but there is no money and widows still live on charity and children scavenge on rubbish heaps.
Everyone is still afraid.
A few women have removed or raised their burka, some men have had a shave, music has started to be played again, but there is fear of punishment and vendettas.
That is why, said Fatima - and I agree with her - there should be a United Nations force there, without Russians, Americans or the British but with contingents from other countries: a multi-ethnic and multi-religious force working at disarming the military groups.
Everybody is talking about the rights of Afghan women.
That is excellent, provided women are not used yet again to justify acts of war.
For years, Afghan and also European women have been denouncing the oppression and violence of the Taliban regime to deaf ears in the West.
The war is not over; we cannot pretend it is and talk just of the future and reconstruction.
Important steps have been taken for women to be included in the formation of the government, but that is not enough and the process is not finished.
We must support those democratic women who have a secular view of the Constitution and who rise above ethnic and tribal divisions, but without denying their own identities.
Many of us have met them; together - as other Members have mentioned - we have drawn up demands, but we have also put our own responsibilities on the table.
The mines that maim were produced in western factories; the cluster bombs, dropped in their thousands in recent days and lying unexploded, are products of our factories; ours are the perverse patents allowing mines to be designed in the shape of butterflies or dolls; ours are the pretty yellow cluster bombs, the same colour as the packets of food dropped from aircraft.
A shared road links us to the Afghan women, the road to freedom and justice for everyone, men and women.
The resolution we are voting for today and the Fraisse amendment must not remain lifeless words on paper, but must be given practical effect.
Even before the rise to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan during 1995-1996 the EU was conscious of the poor position and status of women in Afghan society. This was recognised in the nature of the aid programmes which we financed at that time and which had a strong focus on the provision of health care, education and employment creation for women.
With the arrival in power of the Taliban in Kabul in 1996, the EU agreed a Common Position on Afghanistan.
The Common Position is renewed annually and clearly sets out among its objectives the promotion of respect for international law and human rights, including the rights of women and children.
In addition, the EU undertakes in the Common Position to support aid programmes which integrate gender concerns and actively attempt to promote the equitable participation of both men and women and promote peace and human rights.
As a result, the Commission, through its ECHO-financed programmes and through its budget for aid to uprooted people, continued, even during the Taliban period, to finance actions which provided health care and education for women and girls and provided employment opportunities and training for women. I met many of these women and men in Kabul last week.
It made me start talking about what I call the 'other Afghanistan'.
We all know the Afghanistan of the warlords.
But there is an alternative Afghanistan. We also have heroes and heroines of peace and compassion.
Many of them work in projects that we are funding, did so during the Taliban regime and have continued doing so since September 11.
In an ECHO-funded project for vulnerable children, I met the girls sitting there learning to read and write and asked how many wanted to become housewives when they grew up.
Only a few hands were somewhat hesitantly raised.
Then I asked how many wanted to become schoolteachers or doctors.
Everyone put their hand up - they all wanted to do something.
A very nice moment I would say, and their lady teacher was proud.
Another project involved a woman producing quilts which we use for refugee projects.
She was alone, her husband had died in the conflict, and when the Taliban came to power, she had to stop working as a crane operator in the construction industry.
She has 10 children and her home was being used. They sat on the floor sewing these quilts and that was a very nice experience.
At the end, when we left, I could not resist giving her a hug to express my feelings - clearly not politically correct when the neighbours could see or, indeed, at all.
But it was well received, and I was quite happy to be part of a civilised and nice meeting of cultures in the centre of Kabul.
Now we are fortunately in the post-Taliban era.
Changes are now possible and we hope that what was achieved in Bonn on December 5 will pave the way for a big improvement in the situation of women and girls in the country.
Women were included in the delegations in Bonn; women will hold office in the Interim Administration.
The Provisional Agreement makes a number of specific references to the guaranteed participation of women in the next phases of the political process - the Loya Jirga and the Transitional Administration.
All of this will be overseen by the UN which has a constitutional role, recognised in the Provisional Agreement, to monitor the conduct of the Interim Authority and the emergency Loya Jirga, as well as providing for the development and implementation of a programme of human rights education to promote respect for and understanding of human rights in Afghanistan.
The Commission is currently processing new, additional aid programmes worth EUR 28.5 million, which will start being implemented in the coming weeks, for emergency aid and aid to uprooted people.
Gender will, of course, be either a specific or horizontal issue in all of these programmes.
ECHO is already present in Kabul and we will formally inaugurate the ECHO office there in the middle of January.
Commission officials plan to start being there permanently from 1 February 2002.
It is therefore important to ensure follow-up also in view of what we are discussing here.
Progress will provide crucial indicators to allow the EU and the rest of the international community to judge the commitment of the new Afghan administration to the engagement that they now have entered into.
I must warn you not to expect miracles.
It is a very traditional society, especially outside Kabul.
The reality on the ground does not reflect the elite in Kabul that we easily get in touch with.
There are many deep-seated differences.
We must take a very broad-based approach and make sure that we deliberately include women in the many decentralised activities that we carry out across the country.
Indonesia
Mr President, so it is true after all: Bin Laden' s Al Qaeda network is definitely operating in Indonesia.
It has training camps in, among other places, Sulawesi, the island to which I shall confine myself to referring in this speech.
Using the Islamic terror group Laskar Jihad as a front, thousands of these fighters, some of them foreign, recently arrived on the island of Sulawesi.
The thirty-nine-year-old Ya'far Umar Thalib from Yogyakarta, Pakistan-trained leader of this terrorist organisation set up in the late 1990s, denies the presence of Bin Laden' s followers.
The opposite turns out to be true.
Only yesterday did the head of the Indonesian national security service, ex-general Hendro Pliono, after a meeting with President Megawati Sukarnoputri, confirm that Al Qaeda is operating on Indonesian territory.
I hope that the Indonesian authorities will not content themselves with making these statements.
I call on them urgently to act decisively against Laskar Jihad and this offshoot of Al Qaeda, as there is no time to lose.
Since the conflict first erupted on Amboina on 19 January 1999, one day before the Islamic festival of Idul Fitr, Laskar Jihad has murdered at least 10 000 Christians and has put many times that number to flight in terror of their lives.
I am extremely concerned that after the Moluccas this anti-Christian force should have found its way to Sulawesi too.
I still have a vivid recollection of the story documented this autumn of the eight-year-old Christian boy.
The boy was sitting on the bus with his mother.
En route, some 50 Muslim terrorists forced the vehicle to stop.
The attackers checked the passengers' religious identity.
Two turned out to be Christians, the woman and her son.
They dragged the boy off the bus with brute force, leaving the mother behind utterly distraught.
The young victim' s terrified screams were to no avail.
The terrorists dragged him over the asphalt into the jungle, and nothing more was heard of him.
Just one of the countless documented attacks on buses by Laskar Jihad in Sulawesi.
I ask both the Council and the Commission to do their utmost to contribute to the combating of terrorism in Indonesia, to explore in what way they could support a process of conciliation on the ground, and to examine what measures they can take to promote economic development in this region.
As a Parliament we have passed a number of important motions on Indonesia, Timor and the Moluccas.
When we talk of Indonesia, we are talking of an empire in which, under dictatorship, whole sections of the population were forcibly transported to other parts of the empire, the transmigration.
That still underlies many complex conflicts.
At the same time the transition from dictatorship to democracy is an enormous step.
Since 1999 there has been some democratisation, but that is proceeding terribly slowly: on the one hand attempts are being made to strengthen democracy, on the other hand fierce ethnic conflicts are raging in many areas.
The Jihad, which was previously active in the Moluccas, is now operating in Sulawesi.
And every time one sees that the army has difficulty in really detaching itself and accepting the rule of law and democracy.
This is clear in Papua. The island is still further from the capital and although legislation on autonomy is in prospect, as well as a special court for investigating certain events, it is still clear how much effort it requires to take this step.
Therefore we must strongly condemn the murder committed and do all we can to facilitate that process of reconciliation.
The same applies to Sulawesi.
Let us therefore distance ourselves completely from the terrorists, the Jihad, and at the same time support the Indonesian authorities.
The fact is that the vast majority of the population want reconciliation, want to live and build a society together.
Ordinary citizens, whether Christian or Muslim, are not interested in the Jihad.
For this reason, given all our experience, and with due modesty, we have an important part to play there.
We all have to condemn the assassinations that took place in Papua on 10 November.
There is a real danger that more assassinations are being planned.
There is an onus on the Indonesian Government to investigate thoroughly and to bring in the international investigation teams if necessary.
It is essential that those responsible are brought to justice.
It is also essential that the Indonesian Government protects witnesses from intimidation and murder and it should also protect organisations, NGOs and others from the same threat.
It is also important that the Indonesian Government should replace its Kopassus units because they are seen daily as a threat to the Papuan people.
We also believe that the Indonesian Government should call a halt to the army's commercial activities in Papua.
Thousands have died on Sulawesi alone, where there has been two years of fighting.
The Indonesian Government needs to make an effort to ensure coexistence between the Muslim and the Christian populations, which had been possible for many years.
Mr President, since November, after a relatively peaceful period in Indonesia, we have again been alarmed by serious outbreaks of violence in, for example, Sulawesi and Celebes and by the murder of Theys Hiyo Eluay, the leader of the Papuas in Irian Jaya.
I should like first to say a few words about the murder of Theys Hiyo Eluay, which took place on 10 November after he had had discussions on behalf of the Papuan community with the senior command of the Indonesian military forces in West Papua.
Theys Hiyo Eluay was not only a charismatic leader of the Papuas, but was also a moderate man, who did not seek complete independence for his province, but whose aim was autonomy within the Indonesian state and who had succeeded in achieving this autonomy via the Indonesian parliament.
In October autonomy was ratified in the Indonesian parliament and after a dinner with the regional military staff he was murdered on the evening of 10 November.
It is typical of relations in Indonesia that military units are able to frustrate a constructive process of peace and reconciliation in this way and that this kind of murder can take place.
Many people believe that it was an act of revenge, because an autonomous Irian Jaya would never have given the military the power and financial rewards that they had previously enjoyed.
My request to the Commission and the Council is that they should ask the Indonesian Government to investigate the murder thoroughly and punish the culprit, so that justice is done in a country where injustice prevails.
In addition I should like to request help for the regional government of Irian Jaya, for example for the setting up of a civil service academy, so that people have a real chance of administering the region.
And then there is the situation in Sulawesi and Celebes.
These are the same Laskar Jihad groups that previously caused such misery in the Moluccas and were responsible for thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees.
In this case too we would request that the Commission and the Council ask the Indonesian government to protect the Christian community in Indonesia and keep better control of the fundamentalist Muslim groups.
If Indonesia wishes to retain its respectable and important position, the present government really must call a halt to this violence and the European Union must make it clear to Indonesia that political murders and violence are not acceptable; otherwise the relationship between the European Union and Indonesia will in my view be put under strain.
Mr President, the Commission fully shares with honourable Members their condemnation of the kidnapping and murder of Theys Eluay, Chairman of the Papuan Presidium Council, and adds its voice to the call for the Government of Indonesia to ensure a full investigation of this dreadful incident and to bring its perpetrators to justice.
We are informed that this is now being investigated as a murder case, which may not be sufficient to give us full confidence but at least they are taking this approach.
Further action is also needed to restore calm and to develop confidence in the democratic process.
In this context, the Commission warmly welcomes the adoption last month by the Indonesian national parliament of the special autonomy law for Papua and encourages the Government of Indonesia to proceed to full implementation of the new law with determination and with due speed.
The Commission also shares the deep concern of honourable Members concerning the recent deterioration of the situation in Sulawesi.
Since December 1998, there have been several instances of violence between Muslims and Christians.
The two communities are increasingly segregated - and both are armed.
While reports from the area are sometimes unclear, the situation is certainly serious.
Intercommunal violence has flared up recently around the town of Poso.
A report by a local humanitarian fact-finding mission, which visited the area (including Poso and Tentena) last week, suggests that the situation is now relatively calm, but that it remains very tense.
While the TNI and police are making efforts to maintain security, to collect weapons and arrest those responsible for violence, the presence of a large and vociferous group of Laskar Jihad gives rise to continued fears of escalating violence.
The Commission' s Delegation in Jakarta, together with the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States, will continue to make every effort to monitor developments in these areas and to draw our concerns to the attention of the Indonesian authorities in EU dÃ©marches and other contacts.
The Commission fully shares the stated position of the European Union, which firmly supports the territorial integrity of Indonesia, while encouraging the government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully Indonesia' s internal conflicts, whether separatist or sectarian in character.
Colleagues, as you know, eight immigrants, including three children died last weekend in a freight container which had been shipped to Ireland.
Therefore, before opening the debate on the subject, I would ask you all to rise and observe a minute's silence in memory of those victims of the tragedy.
(Parliament rose and observed one minute's silence)
Immigration in Ireland
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I believe that this new tragedy illustrates yet again what we might call the fate of immigrants.
A year ago, it was 58 foreigners who were found dead in Dover; the year before, Yaguine and FodÃ©, two young Guineans, were found dead in the undercarriage of a Sabena plane.
It seems to me that this keeps happening and that, faced with these tragedies, we actually only have one policy, which is to lock the door and throw away the key.
And, as Bernard-Henri LÃ©vy would say, it seems to me that increasingly people are losing interest in what we might call the suburbs of the world.
It would appear, Mr President, that there are two ways of tackling immigration issues today.
The first, which is increasingly common, is to want to keep our borders wide open so as to have a source of cheap labour, liable to be ruthlessly exploited; and the other is not to want any immigration at all, which is neither preferable nor desirable.
I believe that it is high time, Mr President, that we had some effective legislation, which is rigorous, of course, but simple in terms of form and common to all European countries, which takes account of the needs of both the southern and northern countries.
We cannot continue to strip the countries of the south of their intellectual assets whenever we need them, cynically importing brainpower as if it were just another commodity which we need, as it were, to safeguard our pensions, while at the same time speaking the language of repression.
This is not about repression or charity; it is dignity which is at stake here.
I believe that this is how we should tackle the issue of immigration.
On the other hand - and we have seen illustrations of this throughout the afternoon - if we do not take into consideration the fact that today three quarters of the earth's population is living in the most absolute poverty; if today we do not cancel the debt of developing countries and if we do not discipline ourselves to invest in health, education and infrastructure, I am convinced that, once again, we will have failed to learn the lessons of history, as recent as it is.
Today, these destitute men and women, who are totally neglected, form a breeding ground for terrorism, a place where terrorism thrives.
Fighting terrorism today also means fighting this poverty.
Mr President, I have been so bold as to intervene without taking notes because I really do not think that we can continue to treat these people with such great inhumanity.
Mr President, I should like to thank you for the one minute's silence for those who died.
There may well be further deaths unless we change our approach to this whole issue of immigration and refugee status.
I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to the survivors of this tragedy for the loss of their spouses and their children.
The discovery of eight bodies, plus the five people who are seriously ill, in a container in Wexford in Ireland was an appalling tragedy which has shocked people, not just in Ireland, but all across Europe.
Regrettably it is not the first time that this has happened.
