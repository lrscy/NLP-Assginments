Of course, much of what we currently complain about in relation to decentralisation or the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation results from Community decisions, for which we all bear our share of responsibility.
The solution is a familiar one and it entails slimming down procedures and simplifying them to some extent.
In that regard, there remains a great deal of work to be done.
Allow me to say something here on two or three key points.
The figure for payments in the Commission's preliminary draft was EUR 8.2 billion less than the ceiling in the Financial Perspective.
Now the Council has submitted a draft with a figure EUR 10.3 billion below the ceiling.
If you look at the Council's summary table, however, you will find that the content is highly questionable.
Under the heading for the Lisbon Strategy, growth and employment, for example, the fact of creating a new EUR 342 million margin, and reducing the payments by EUR 548 million from the figure in the preliminary draft, effectively amounts to making an artificial margin to accommodate the European Council's pronouncements on political priorities.
I assume that the underlying issues are the problem of financing the European Institute of Technology and the problem of financing the Galileo project.
Let me be very clear here: Parliament firmly favours a Community solution for the Galileo project and, in the overall context, awaits new proposals from the Commission.
I have one brief comment on Heading 3: in relation to natural disasters, what has happened to former Commissioner Michel Barnier's proposals on civil defence in Europe?
Do we have a joint response and, if so, how might it impact on the 2008 and subsequent budgets?
Mr President, the foreign and security policy issues, to which we have referred repeatedly, confirm that our political analyses were correct: the current figures in the draft budget are insufficient to address the challenges in Afghanistan, Palestine or Kosovo, and cutting the Emergency Aid Reserve is merely a virtual solution, the point of which we cannot grasp.
In this regard, we would ask the Commission to state clearly what, from its perspective, lies in store for us in the coming years.
I have one final point, Mr President.
The Member States undertook - and I quote here - referring to the Statement of Assurance mentioned in paragraph 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement: 'to produce an annual summary at the appropriate level of the available audits and declarations'.
'to produce an annual summary at the appropriate level of the available audits and declarations'.
I say this very much in earnest: those Member States not in a position to guarantee that the annual report will arrive in good time may expect us to take issue with them on this matter on budgetary as well as other grounds.
Otherwise, I fully support what our two rapporteurs have said.
I would like to welcome everyone to the new season, which seems interesting and intensive as always.
It is so gratifying that already in July we achieved some very productive and well-intentioned communication.
In Lithuania it is said that a good start is half the job.
Therefore, I hope that the atmosphere in which we have started working and the results that we have already managed to achieve by negotiating and adopting three important declarations is a really good start to the task at hand.
Today we discussed the first version of the Council's budget, although I very often hear from Parliament that we - the Commission - are given so many tasks.
I certainly accept this and agree with it; we are ready to react and provide any information that is required.
As regards the first draft of the Council budget, I would like to mention that the Commission, when it presented its version, referred to the forecasts of the Member States using our analysis.
We therefore believe that our proposal was fully economically and politically sound.
Therefore, the Commission cannot fully agree with many aspects of the Council's first negotiated budget.
Certainly, we agree with the opinion already presented by MEPs that the biggest horizontal cuts...
I would like to repeat that the method of horizontal cutting was applied again in all categories.
The Commission, certainly, considers that this approach and methodology is unsound, particularly in categories 1a and 1b, where we talk about innovation and research, even more so as we have an additional problem with the European Institute of Technology and the Galileo programme, which has to be solved as an additional parallel problem of the annual European budget procedures.
Certainly, this means that it is necessary to return to discussions on quantities and sizes and not to consider arithmetical reductions.
The same applies to agriculture and the category of foreign affairs policy where, in my opinion, the Council's approach of putting funds in reserve is rather conservative and, surely, we will all have to return to it soon.
Over the coming fortnight the Commission will be presenting its proposal to Parliament and the Council on the adjustment of the budget as regards Kosovo and Palestine.
Certainly, as always, we worry about the Council's approach to administrative expenditure and I agree that the budget has a certain Finnish colouring, especially in the European Parliament.
I mean this in a good sense, because I see the need for discipline, strict responsibility and soundness in the expenditure of the country representatives and we accept this and will always respond to it.
The Council's proposal includes the horizontal cut in the conditions in which the Council itself will not be able to fulfil its commitment to employ extra people; more than 800 staff members to perform additional developmental tasks surely cannot be acceptable to the Commission.
We really expect Parliament to have the same attitude towards this issue as we do and hope that the re-adjustment will be made jointly with Parliament.
Briefly speaking, therefore, it is gratifying that the beginning has been successful.
Yet we react critically to the Council's first proposal and assess it critically, and we are ready to discuss Kosovo and Palestine in the short term and also to discuss and take decisions on the proposals on the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology on around the 19th and will try to come to a mutual understanding on these important issues.
I therefore hope for a successful procedure and hope that my fellow Lithuanians manage to translate my first Lithuanian speech well and correctly.
(DE) The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) The Lisbon Strategy requires that 3% of the Member States' GDP should be invested in research, two thirds originating from the private sector.
Only a very small number of European regions reached this goal.
In 2004, 42% of European companies carried out research on their activities and Member States invested only 1.84% of their GDP on research.
In 2006, 35% of the EU active population worked in the field of science and technology.
Education is essential for the future of the EU.
It should be accessible to everybody, either rich or poor, living in either the urban or rural environment.
The quality of European education should be measured depending on the graduation rate and the admission rate to the next education level.
We need a new Social Europe, in which its citizens should have priority.
Having regard to the fact that both the European Union and its Member States will approve their budgets for 2008 in the autumn, I require that the investments in education and research have priority in the European Union.
Inland transport of dangerous goods (debate)
The next item is the report by BogusÅaw Liberadzki, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the inland transport of dangerous goods - C6-0012/2007 -.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to submit to you today the proposal for amendment of the directive on the inland transport of dangerous goods.
The transport of dangerous goods accounts for about 8% of all goods transport, nearly a million operations every day.
We have to guarantee freedom of movement for dangerous goods and intermodality in national and international services, whilst at the same time keeping an eye on the safety aspect in order to protect our environment, our citizens and workers in the sector.
This proposal is designed to update four directives and four Commission decisions on the transport of dangerous goods by merging them in a single legislative act.
This is an important simplification of Community law on the subject.
In addition, the scope of the Community rules needs to be extended to include inland waterways transport, a sector that is not covered by any rules of Community law at present.
Admittedly it is a less significant mode of inland transport, but an accident on an inland waterway can have serious consequences.
A single set of rules for all transport of dangerous goods in internal waterways will make it possible to minimise those risks.
Finally, the proposal relates to both international and national transport.
Those are the aims of the proposal for which Mr Liberadzki is rapporteur.
Before the debate begins, may I thank your rapporteur and TRAN for their support for the Commission proposal.
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, it is my pleasure, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to submit a report in which, first of all, we welcome the fact that the Commission has submitted the draft directive that we are considering today.
We are in complete agreement with you, Commissioner, that this consolidates, and at the same time reduces the number of, the regulations relating to the transport of dangerous goods.
Secondly, we also agree that this regulation could have a very big impact both on transport safety and also on the quality of life of the public.
Finally, the regulations that we wish to adopt, or rather to combine from many different sources, thereby reducing the number, are based on the recommendations drawn up by the UN for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterways, which together account for over 110 billion tonnes/km per annum within the European Union.
In presenting this report I would like to emphasise that the Committee on Transport and Tourism approved it almost unanimously, deeming it to be both important and necessary, and that it brings in a new level of quality in that it extends regulations concerning the transport of dangerous goods to passenger trains.
It also regulates when Member States, for reasons that are not strictly to do with safety, can introduce certain derogations from generally applicable regulations, and how these derogations should be introduced and dealt with at EU level.
I would like to ask everyone here to support the amendments that have been discussed and introduced, especially Amendment 44, where, at the request of the Council, in addition to vehicles we introduce the concepts of wagons and inland waterway vessels, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, and I would ask you to vote in favour of this.
I would also specifically like to ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 45, which, after much discussion, was drawn up as a good compromise.
This refers to Article 1(3)(b), where we have introduced the words 'where justified, it is possible to prescribe the route and the means of transport to be used'.
Then Amendment 16 could be omitted as unnecessary, or we could vote against it.
I would also ask you to vote against Amendments 46 and 47, since it would appear that these rules are already included in the text, and so they will merely pad out the regulation unnecessarily.
Finally, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation, which was very productive.
I would particularly like to thank the Council and the Commission - the Council both under the German Presidency and under the Portuguese Presidency.
We had about five working meetings.
There were no significant differences of views, and we were able to resolve any differences that did arise.
In my opinion this was a model of cooperation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yes, the proposal for a directive on the internal transport of dangerous goods is an important issue, because around 110 billion tonnes/km of dangerous goods are transported in the EU every year: 58% by road, 25% by rail and, up to now, 17% by inland waterway.
The purpose of this proposal for a directive is to simplify and coordinate the existing rules on the transport of dangerous goods.
It also extends the scope of the EU provisions, which currently cover transport by road and rail, to transport by inland waterway.
That simplification reduces the red tape and improves intermodality.
Common rules on transport by road, rail and inland waterway ensure a uniform level of safety throughout the Community in internal and cross-border transport.
Uniform rules governing means of transport simplify and promote multimodal transport.
Extending the scope of the provisions to inland waterway transport is a welcome move.
That means the same safety rules apply to all Community inland waterways.
That will have a positive impact on working conditions on board, on transport safety and on protection of the environment.
Uniform rules reduce costs by avoiding the need for a variety of authorisations and permissions.
Moreover, that is likely to improve the potential use and the market prospects of transport by inland waterways; after all, we are trying to shift more transport of dangerous goods to inland waterways.
The draft amendments adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism largely reflect the Council's position.
We are in agreement and we want to try to get this through at first reading if possible.
Let me underline that I do beg the House to adopt one particular draft amendment, which the rapporteur has already mentioned and which represents a compromise.
It is important to include sensible provisions in this dossier.
Here we are in agreement with the Commission and the Council.
The draft amendment relates to the provision allowing Member States to lay down specific safety requirements and possibly also to prescribe the means of transport if they can justify it before the Commission.
In conclusion, let me give warm thanks to the rapporteur, with whom we were able to work so well together, and request the House to adopt this report at first reading.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to thank the rapporteur, not only for his report but also for his inclusiveness in bringing together Parliament, the Council and the various political factions on this important issue.
Members will be aware that current Community law in this area resides primarily in four directives that deal with the transportation of dangerous goods.
The RID Directive and the ADR Directive deal with rail and road respectively, with the transport of dangerous goods by inland waterways covered by the annexes to these two directives.
The proposed new directive now extends the scope of Community law to inland waterways and we need to support such a move.
Some people may think that the rapporteur has not gone far enough in challenging the scope of the directive and there are others, mainly from industry, who think the directive too proscriptive and that it goes too far.
The rapporteur has, frankly, got the balance right and surely the important aspect of all of this is that we would establish a single system of regulation for the transport of dangerous goods by inland waterways, with standards laid down and with everybody, including Member States, knowing their responsibilities.
This report does give us added value, as explained by our rapporteur.
It will enhance safety and therefore, I believe, and my group believes, deserves our full support.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) As has already been said, Mr President, the proposal seeks to update and consolidate the existing directives and regulations on the inland transport of dangerous goods.
A single legal text will now cover inland waterway transport in addition to road and rail transport.
In all honesty I wonder how anyone could possibly oppose it.
I cannot imagine that anyone questions the usefulness of and need for measures to ensure that these transport operations are conducted in the safest way possible.
If these measures can be combined and worded more clearly, then that benefits all of us.
In committee we upheld most of the rapporteur's chiefly technical amendments.
Clearly the rapporteur liaised closely on these with the Council and, on a directive of this kind, that is generally the most efficient way of going about it.
So it is commendable too that the rapporteur is keen to secure an agreement at first reading.
But the ALDE Group was rather surprised by Amendment 45 and finds it a bit casual.
Why not settle for the text used in Amendment 16, which everyone was happy with, ourselves included?
Why go along with everything the Council wants, even when that may work against the efficiency of logistics chains?
Why not talk to the Council about this?
Not all Member States are in favour of this 'compromise'.
What will the rapporteur, and also Mrs Sommer and Messrs Jarzembowski and Simpson, have achieved if Member States are able arbitrarily to favour one mode of transport over another?
Surely it is obvious that every mode of transport must ensure, in its own specific way, that its operations are safe and efficient.
Why should the market players not be able to determine that for themselves?
We made sure of that previously with Amendment 16 and so I urge you to take another look at Amendment 45 and maybe think again.
My thanks to the rapporteur for his hard work, but I think it is a pity he allowed himself to be seduced into reintroducing this provision on the use of prescribed forms of transport by the back door.
Again, I urge you to reconsider your position on Amendment 45.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the proposed new directive on the regulation of the inland transport of dangerous goods is a necessary piece of legislation.
It integrates previous EU regulations into a single piece of legislation and extends it to include transport by water.
The inclusion in the proposal of international regulations on the transport of dangerous goods makes the directive a consolidated document of international scope.
The new directive also makes it possible, to a limited extent, to take specific national conditions into consideration, where this is dictated by economic requirements and the state of the roads.
An example here could be the extent to which megaliners are used.
The amendments that have been proposed are technical in nature and do not give cause for concern, except for Amendments 46 and 47.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Liberadzki, for his constructive input in the preparation of the report.
The UEN takes the view that the directive meets the expectations of those concerned.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are very positive rules for multimodal transport, which I hope will grow in future, because they are more transparent and easier to understand.
At last, inland waterways have been included, as the Greens had requested in an earlier report.
I found it hard to understand why this took so long.
The pollution caused by an accident involving a vessel transporting highly toxic chemicals can, of course, cause even more concentrated pollution if it happens on a river than might be case on the high seas.
I regard the stringent rules that Member States may lay down, and that extend to prescribing the means of transport, as necessary, important and right.
Conditions on our various transport routes are extremely varied.
There may be high bridges, for instance, that are inaccessible to rescue forces.
There may be high traffic density, which can under certain circumstances make the transport of dangerous goods even more hazardous.
Dangerous goods are often transported in the vicinity of towns.
All this means that we must provide Member States with that possibility, so that they can react to such dangers in a flexible manner.
A central issue in this report, however, as in many others, is monitoring.
The national states must systematically monitor compliance with the rules, otherwise we will have empty words that pretend to a kind of safety that, unfortunately, does not exist.
To be quite frank, there are serious deficiencies in this area in some European states.
There is also a major challenge to be met in terms of training fire-fighters and rescue forces.
I hope this also acts as an incentive to make this monitoring more stringent and at last to minimise the dangers of transport - whether by water, rail or road.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, the use of just in time delivery by industry and trade, with the ultimate aim, in short, of maximum immediate profit, means that dangerous goods are less and less in warehouses and secure factories and more and more on roads, rivers and railways and at sea.
For very many years, the European Commission has been doing everything it can to deregulate the transport sector for the greater benefit of private interests, taking no account of the general interest.
So much so that, when anyone raises the issue of public safety, the Commission immediately takes refuge in the subsidiarity principle.
As always, the European Commission boasts of having worked closely with employers, forgetting, as always, the workers who might have been able to teach it a great deal, especially about the general deregulation of the transport sector, social dumping, and the refusal to introduce binding legislation on working conditions and training for road transport staff.
There is a serious risk of a major disaster involving a dangerous goods consignment in the future.
Then those who have made the decisions will be responsible.
Yet this Parliament could vote for simple and effective measures, such as the designation of lorry parks as Seveso sites and triage at railway transit points for dangerous goods; imposing a traceability obligation in real time with a system of geographical location of all dangerous goods to ensure that incompatible products are not kept together; and training in the necessary safety measures for the personnel involved.
But most people see this as unnecessary expenditure.
Well, you can assume that, but do not count on us for support!
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Liberadzki's excellent report and his well-argued proposal for a directive on the inland transport of dangerous goods requires little discussion.
I voted for it in committee, and I confirm my vote here and believe that many colleagues from the ITS Group will follow my example.
The more internal trade such as that between the Union's Member States increases, the more useful it is, in my opinion, for the conditions in which that trade takes place to be comparable, especially in terms of safety, but also from the point of view of checks and related administrative procedures.
It would be unreasonable to criticise or even worse reject such a technical text on which there has been wide-ranging and informed consultation with many experts from the Member States.
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank, in addition to Mr Liberadzki, the dangerous goods committee for their work, bearing in mind that that work has been carried out continuously in accordance with the international agreements in force in this field.
I would like to conclude by noting that the amendments, or at least many of the amendments tabled, should in my opinion be accepted, especially Amendment 2 to Recital 14, the amendments relating to observations on the obvious non-inclusion and therefore exemption of those Member States which do not as yet have a railway system, and frankly I also intend to support Amendment 45.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my good friend the rapporteur, BogusÅaw Liberadzki, on this really balanced and successful report.
As Mrs Sommer has already pointed out, 110 billion tonnes/km of dangerous goods are transported in the EU every year.
Like Mr Henin, I too would prefer at least part of that quantity to be stored in warehouses.
Unfortunately that is not the case, which is why we must look into that matter too.
A first, important point in this report is the updating and coordination of existing rules on safety requirements for tanks and vehicles.
A second important point is the extension of that requirement from road and rail to inland waterways.
If we look at the transport trend in recent years, it becomes very clear that inland waterways are becoming increasingly important.
I agree with Mrs Lichtenberger that accidents on rivers are, of course, particularly dangerous.
These measures - and here I am speaking as someone who lives in a country of transit - may also lead to a shift towards the railways.
That is, of course, a very good thing.
We in Austria naturally welcome this report, in particular because Austria, given its geographical location, sets very high safety requirements for transport participants.
I also find it extremely welcome that in future every Member State is also to have the right to regulate or prohibit the internal transport of dangerous goods on its territory.
In my view, that includes in particular laying down special provisions on environmental protection and the option of prohibiting or restricting the transport of certain hazardous goods.
If the report is adopted in the wording proposed by the rapporteur, it will be a very good report and we can all be satisfied with the outcome.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to thank our rapporteur for the work he has headed on the really very technical issues involved in the transport of dangerous goods, which represent nearly 10% of the goods across Europe.
I certainly welcome the fact that not only does the report shed light on rules that affect public safety, it is also extended to inland waterways goods transport, because many of us think that is a mode of transport that should be developed throughout Europe as an alternative to road transport.
It also raises high hopes on the part of European citizens.
As well as being a step towards simplification of the legislation as regards the administrative procedures, for both consignors and consignees, it is also a crucial step for the training of personnel involved with the safety of dangerous goods.
Although we have to define our position on certain points raised in the amendments in more detail, the report undoubtedly represents a step forward, on clarity in particular and on safety.
Mr President, I wholeheartedly echo the comments of my Group colleague, Mrs Lichtenberger.
We welcome this package as a step in the right direction, albeit with some reservations.
Our amendments seek to strengthen the package, particularly in relation to training in how to deal with accidents and the right of individuals to know what is being transported.
I personally would like to go further still.
I would like to include military and civil nuclear materials in the same framework.
Scotland, sadly, plays host to military nuclear facilities and civil nuclear sites and sees regular transports.
The Sunday Herald newspaper recently revealed that 67 nuclear safety incidents relating to transport have taken place in Scotland over the last seven years.
So there is clear room for improvement, and I believe that the EU can act where the UK Government will fail to.
In the meantime, however, I welcome any steps in the direction of giving people greater rights to know what they are sharing the roads and waterways of Europe with, and that they are safe.
This report helps to do that, so we welcome it.
(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, dear MEPs, between 1995-2004 freight transport increased by 28%, and by 2020 a 50% increase is predicted.
58% of the freight transported is carried by road, 25% by rail and 17% by internal navigable waterways.
Dangerous goods represent 8% of the transported freight.
This transport type highly endangers the regions the goods are carried through and therefore, the European Union must take the necessary measures to increase the security of this transport type.
The existing laws in the European Union cover only the transport of dangerous goods by road and by rail, but for transport by sea there are only international conventions to which Member States are party.
Following Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, almost the entire length of the Danube has become an internal navigable waterway.
The Danube runs through seven European capitals and nearby many urban agglomerations, that is why the safety of the transport of dangerous goods along Danube is extremely important.
It is essential that the measures on the transport of dangerous goods should be doubled with measures on the intervention of emergency services in cases of accidents where such transports are involved.
There is a huge number of victims, even among those who should intervene in the event of an accident.
Moreover, the transport of dangerous goods should be carried out during less crowded periods and routes, so that the related risks can be minimized.
I think that for the safety of the transport of dangerous goods a short a transition period as possible is needed in order to implement this Directive.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Liberadzki and the Committee on Transport and Tourism again for this excellent report, which, like you, I really hope will enable us to adopt the proposal right away at first reading.
In fact, it is because we are anxious for it to be adopted at first reading that we are ready to agree to the amendments reflecting the negotiated agreement between the institutions. We do not, however, think the amendments that would jeopardise agreement at first reading are desirable.
What is true is that, as everyone has emphasised, the report will help to simplify the legislation and therefore make it easier to apply and thus to extend to inland waterways.
I agree with Parliament that the inland waterways networks should be widely developed. They can be a way for Europe to achieve the modal shift that we would like to see.
That is what I wanted to make clear.
Once again, I thank Parliament and its rapporteur for its excellent work on this report, backed by expert knowledge.
I think it can be said that the consultation on this report was absolutely exemplary.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing - (FR) The steady rise in the transport of dangerous goods has made it necessary to introduce European legislation to simplify and coordinate the rules applicable to the transport of these goods.
It is our responsibility to protect public safety and that also applies to the transport of dangerous goods.
It therefore seems important to me that Member States should be able, if necessary and in a proportionate and transparent fashion, to require the use of mandatory routes.
They must also be able to insist that carriers use one mode of transport rather than another if they believe that that will be safer for their citizens.
Freight transport logistics in Europe and sustainable mobility (debate)
The next item is the report by InÃ©s Ayala Sender, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on freight transport logistics in Europe - the key to sustainable mobility.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, this afternoon we are discussing a key sector for European growth, competition and employment, namely logistics.
Logistics are essential to the quality of our citizens' daily lives, although they do not perceive this clearly enough.
This exercise attempts among other things to increase the visibility of this topic among citizens.
This is a sector which accounts for approximately 13% of GDP in the European Union and has great economic impact as it amounts to between 10 and 15% of the final cost of finished products in Europe.
In some sectors, such as the important automotive industry, it exceeds even social costs.
It is also a sector which hitherto has appeared to be a matter exclusively for industry and the market; its success and potential for growth appeared incontrovertible and this must continue to be the case.
But, true to our firm conviction that the best market is a well-regulated market which facilitates and promotes positive capacities and, moreover, prevents potential risks before they become barriers and obstacles to necessary growth, creativity and development of our citizens, we therefore applaud the Commission's decision to begin to consider this sector in terms of the contribution which the European Union can make so as to increase opportunities and restrict obvious risks, given the growth forecasts for the transport sector in Europe.
The talk is currently of growth of some 50% between the years 2000 and 2020.
Therefore the sector will be able to exploit and increase the opportunities open to it in a situation which we perceive as being defined around five essential priorities.
The first priority is the recent enlargement towards the east which increases distances and creates outlying areas; at the same time, however, it also creates new opportunities both in terms of markets and trade in our citizens' diverse cultures.
The second priority is globalisation, which accelerates trade, diversifies needs and redefines the geographical position of territories and peoples.
I am thinking here of my own country, Spain, which appears to be peripheral where enlargement is concerned, yet is placed by globalisation on a crossroads between areas as important as Latin America, Africa or trade with Asia.
Another of the priorities for tackling logistics is climate change and current energy needs.
We need to make infrastructure use more efficient, improve traffic management and restrict unladen journeys; current logistics can make a major contribution to this.
The fourth priority is the opportunities for Information Exchange that we are seeking in Europe under the Seventh Framework Programme and the whole future of the knowledge economy.
Logistics are the very embodiment of intelligent transport - transport which includes planning as a fundamental concept and is based increasingly on intelligent transport systems.
SESAR, SafeSeaNet and Track and Trade are all devices and new technologies which are being successfully applied to this sector.
Finally, demographic changes and young people's employment expectations are also areas to which logistics can make a decisive contribution.
To that end the proposal for a report specifically tries to support the Commission in identifying bottlenecks and trying to draw up new proposals.
We need to prevent the administrative burden being too great by using precisely these intelligent systems to reduce and restrict formalities, which remain complex, especially in, for example, customs and maritime trade; I believe, however, that the proposals the Commission is making in this regard in its action plan are potentially very positive.
Another bottleneck for which we are also proposing a number of solutions is the lack of infrastructure and shortfalls in associated funding.
To that end we reiterate the need to terminate the system of cross-border networks by opening up unused historic passes in the Pyrenees, or in the Alps where we believe it would also help, and reducing congestion on some roads by opening rail tunnels.
There is also a specific proposal to that end which I particularly support, namely the proposal for a system of dedicated freight railways.
We would urge the Commission to submit a plan to us on the subject.
As for the need for finance, what we would like is for the debate on the future funding of a sufficiently ambitious European transport policy to include logistics as a priority concern.
Regarding the lack of manpower we support the Commission in its proposal to make the profession more attractive but we would like it to refer not only to training but to improving social and working conditions.
Finally, we also wish to support and encourage the Commission in this regard when we point to the need for any future consideration of urban transport to include a specific chapter on urban logistics.
We believe that our citizens endure congestion on a daily basis when logistics, which if successful are invisible, are shown to have failed.
To that end we believe it is time that logistics took its rightful place in European discussions.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly want to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her report on freight transport logistics.
I should also say to Mrs Ayala Sender that I remember our visit to Zaragoza, where we had the opportunity to see the benefits of all the work currently being done in Europe on developing logistics.
The report gives us high hopes of the approach adopted by the Commission in its communication on logistics in 2006.
This resolution is an important step in the joint efforts by Parliament and the Commission to improve the operation of freight transport in Europe.
I find it very encouraging, because in a few weeks' time I shall be presenting the Action Plan for Logistics.
Mrs Ayala Sender has eloquently set out the issues at stake: the economic dimension and the efficiency of logistics, which are a key element in the competitiveness of our economies.
Logistics facilitate the flow of goods and help make our products competitive by giving them access to more distant markets.
Thus logistics have become an important and dynamic industry that creates jobs and Europe has the most successful logistics companies in this field.
Furthermore, logistics improve environmental efficiency.
As Mrs Ayala Sender has said, they help to minimise transport congestion.
Freight transport and logistics also have to meet the challenges of reducing the number of road accidents and pollutant and noise emissions.
The work to be done on logistics does not involve regulating this rapidly growing sector, but ensuring that it has a sustainable future by allowing it to mobilise the efficiency potential that still exists in the transport business.
In fact, that is why we have developed the idea of comodality, the effective combination of different modes of transport.
In that respect we can use logistics to reconcile the economic and environmental objectives.
However, there are still some obstacles to the development of logistics.
First, the lack of harmonisation and common rules stands in the way of new solutions, particularly the development of information and communication technology.
We could plan freight transport better, we could improve the operation and safety of transport systems, we should improve the monitoring of goods and ensure that customers have the necessary information.
The logistics chain must work as a coherent whole, even if several partners and several modes of transport are involved.
Secondly, we must lay more emphasis on quality in freight transport, with service quality indicators and the sharing of good practice. That means improving the training of practitioners and recognising their skills.
Thirdly, we have to address the problem of bottlenecks, obstacles to freight transport.
We have consulted everyone working in the logistics field and received five hundred replies, which will help us in our preparation for the Action Plan for Logistics.
The report by Mrs Ayala Sender also, rightly, highlights the simplification of administrative procedures, infrastructure investment needs and the problems posed by logistics in urban areas.
We need concrete answers to all those questions.
I am pleased that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has attached real importance to the Action Plan for Logistics that I shall be presenting in October.
The plan should propose concrete measures with clear objectives and a specific timetable.
It will be one of a set of initiatives including a freight priority rail network, a port policy and two Commission documents on the maritime space without borders and motorways of the sea.
The adoption of those measures will be an important signal and a way for us to identify alternative modes of transport that are efficient, integrated and environmentally friendly and, of course, meet the needs of users.
The Action Plan will be coupled with measures to make rail, sea and inland waterways transport more attractive.
The Commission does not claim to be able to solve the freight transport problems facing Europe on its own, but, on that point too, the report by Mrs Ayala Sender sends a message to the Member States to encourage them to develop their own logistics initiatives, especially by investing in infrastructures, in close collaboration with the European Union.
We shall only succeed if the Member States and the European Union act together.
Logistics are a major problem.
By working on them, we shall achieve the modal shift that we want to see in the fight against global warming.
In my view, the way to make European mobility sustainable, that is to say compatible with our environmental requirements for the benefit of the economy and of European citizens, is through good logistics and good transport infrastructures.
May I thank Mrs Ayala Sender wholeheartedly for her contribution to these advances in logistics, which are key to the development of sustainable transport.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayala Sender, most sincerely for a very creditable report.
I am nevertheless sorry that the Committee on Transport and Tourism omitted from the report certain key issues which the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy brought up.
Of these, the most important is the internalisation of the external costs of transport, such as environmental costs.
Pricing that takes account of real costs, including environmental and social costs, is a fundamental means of making a transport system intelligent, efficient and rational.
In Switzerland the road toll on lorry transport has led to the effective transfer of consignments to the railways and reduced the number of trucks travelling empty.
This is a good example to us all.
It needs to be realised that an efficient, rational transport system is not the same as the constant expansion of road traffic.
Carbon dioxide emissions from traffic cannot continue to increase as they are doing now; otherwise the reductions in emissions achieved in other sectors, such as industry, will have been a waste of time.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for their work.
Freight transport logistics is such a broad subject that it is not always easy to confine oneself to essentials.
As it is put so well in French: 'qui trop embrasse mal Ã©treint'.
So let us be glad that today we have managed to pick out the key points!
We have to tread new ground, because this is not an easy field.
It is an area of conflict between the economy and growth on the one side, and the environment and security on the other.
Put simply: everybody wants the goods, nobody wants the transport.
That means that this sector, which does indeed offer very good employment prospects, does not have a very good image.
We must do our part to remind people firstly that it is an important economic sector, secondly that we can tread new ground, and thirdly that the sector still has employment potential today.
I still regard the reference to training as very important and it should be taken up by the various countries.
Specialisation in these areas can lead to new and interesting jobs.
Research can also help make freight transport more efficient, environmentally compatible and also more secure.
Cooperation among countries remains essential.
We need only think of the Trans-European Networks.
We all think globally, nobody wants to act locally.
To put it simply, we want these networks everywhere, but we do not have the resources, whether we negotiate with the Council to get more funds for the Trans-European Networks or with the countries themselves.
As regards modes of transport, I believe nobody has anything against shifting goods to the railways and inland waterways, but efficiency is the key point.
Efficiency is not just a question of price.
If transport by rail becomes cheaper but not more efficient, we will not achieve that modal shift.
So we must combine efficiency with price if we are to deal with this matter adequately.
Finally, let me raise the subject of megaliners and standardisation.
We cannot prohibit, or even authorise, everything purely at European level.
We should work together properly with the Member States and find directives, for example in the fields of security and infrastructure, that must determine whether or not these megaliners should be tolerated.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her initiative.
Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that we are still not used to talking about logistics, either at European level or in the Member States.
Often we have a road policy, a railway policy, an aviation policy, a maritime policy, and in some countries we find it very difficult to coordinate them.
Logistics involve no more nor less than avoiding too many transfers between the different modes of transport and making sure that optimum use is made of them where they are most efficient or profitable.
In that respect, I think that the work started by Mrs Ayala Sender is very promising and we are, of course, looking forward to the Commission communication.
I should also like to reiterate the point made by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. In my view, not enough emphasis has been placed on the reports on the environmental aspects of the question.
Clearly we have to develop logistics in Europe and transport policy is an adjunct to the internal market and its development, but we cannot, on the one hand, have ambitious plans to reduce greenhouse gases and, on the other hand, be over-modest.
In that respect, I am concerned at the fact that 60-tonne lorries have been allowed to creep into all the reports.
An earlier report referred modestly to a European modular concept; some reports talk about megatrucks and gigaliners, the theory of the road lobby being that the larger the lorry the less it will consume and the greater the saving.
That is untrue.
The larger the lorry, the more competitive it is compared with the rail and waterway transport, and the more the Commission policy on railways, waterways and motorways of the sea will be undermined.
It will not even be worth talking about any more.
There will still be just as many lorries, but what is certain is that there will be far more goods on the roads and we shall have failed.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, in its communication the Commission rightly says, and not for the first time, that logistics play an important part in our response to all manner of new challenges, on the environment for example.
Equally important, of course, is the role of logistics when it comes to the Union's competitiveness.
Priority has to be given here to optimising the European transport system, addressing the problem of existing bottlenecks and applying advanced logistics.
Action is required.
How can we improve the efficiency of individual transport modes and combinations of those modes?
That is the million-dollar question.
And I would emphasise here that the anticipated growth in freight transport needs to be addressed as pragmatically as possible.
If we are to cope with that level of growth, maximum use must be made of all modes of transport.
So it is emphatically not a matter of one or other but of all.
It is a pity that the House's reaction to the communication threatened to get bogged down in a policy debate on whether or not these longer heavier vehicles - ecocombis or gigaliners - should be allowed, as Mr Savary said just now.
After a lot of pleading we now have agreement on a compromise which is as neutral as possible.
As someone who is in favour of these big, longer heavier vehicles, I would like to add one thing, and that is that calling for innovative ideas, only then to discard them on the basis of false arguments, will get us nowhere.
Base your decisions on proper research, that is what I say.
Once again, the anticipated growth of road freight transport will test us to the utmost.
Results in the immediate future will depend on how we prioritise existing obstacles.
Sacred cows will have to be sacrificed, including those surrounding longer heavier vehicles, for example, or the proliferation of driving bans in the European Union, the sacred cows over cabotage, and so on and so forth. I sincerely hope these priorities will shortly be formulated more clearly in the European Commission's Action Plan.
It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for her hard work.
I am leaving directly, not out of rudeness, but because I have an important meeting elsewhere.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I welcome the contents of this report today, which supports the broader development of trans-European road networks in Europe.
The second largest road development in Ireland at present is the construction of a 112 km road called the M3, which will by-pass the towns of Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells in County Meath.
There has been a lot of press coverage recently in Ireland about the role of the Commission in the context of the M3.
Some people who oppose this development have totally misrepresented the role of the Commission in this matter.
I want to set the record straight as to the exact role of the Commission concerning the M3.
On 29 June 2007 the Commission sent a letter by reasoned opinion to the Irish Government, seeking an explanation as to why the Irish Government did not carry out a second impact assessment when there was an archaeological discovery at Lismullen last March.
The Irish Government will defend its position because it acted only after independent reports from the Director of the National Museum of Ireland were given to the Irish Government.
This report recommended that this find at Lismullen be excavated and preserved by record.
This proposed plan of action was supported by the Chief State Archaeologist in Ireland.
However, the Commission sending a letter by reasoned opinion to the Irish Government does not mean, as has been reported, that Ireland is going to be fined hundreds of millions of euros by the European Union or that the building of this road, which has commenced, has to stop, or that legal action will be taken against Ireland.
I know that this is an emotive issue, but the role of the European Union in this issue has to be put into perspective.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Green I am of course in favour of any improvements in logistics because that can help reduce environmental damage.
I must say from the outset, however, that there are few areas where the European Union really has the power to do anything in this regard.
There are always logistical weaknesses in areas where the link between different transport modes does not work; this is particularly harmful when the railways cannot be used because the logistical links are cumbersome, bureaucratic, non-existent or poorly developed.
Even in cases where many transport modes run empty, however, we find that there is clearly a lack of logistics, or that it is simply not worthwhile to use the rolling stock in an efficient and targeted manner.
Those are crucial issues and they are indeed addressed in the dossier.
At the same time, they have been exploited by a number of lobbyists.
In my view, the improvement in infrastructure is not yet logistical; we still see empty wagons even on very good roads or railways, which does not help us in any way.
In particular, I object to the fact that this dossier has been misused as a propaganda instrument for what are known as gigaliners.
We are already suffering from the fact that very poor use is made of the rolling stock.
Nonetheless, it is intended for reasons of economic self-interest - especially on the part of the timber industry, in the past at least - to introduce very large HGVs, which will adversely affect road maintenance.
After all, we must all realise that roads will need to be repaired far more frequently if even more weight is put on the axles, if even more weight presses on the asphalt surface.
That is why we cannot speak of environmental or economic improvement here, because in the end this also hugely distorts competition with the railways.
Mr President, far more freight is currently carried by road than is good for the quality of our air, our protection against excessive noise, our safety and the amount of space we need.
These transport operations continue to grow, especially as they have become relatively cheaper over the years.
Companies are organising more and more movements that are not necessary.
There are two reasons for this: the sourcing of raw materials, the various stages entailed in processing them and the sale of the end products are all handled at very different locations, and this generates a lot of unnecessary transport operations between those locations.
Despite the creation of main ports and other large distribution centres, goods still travel further than they need to.
In sparsely populated countries with few or no railways, most notably America and Australia, enormous road freight vehicles have developed, so-called road trains or rigs.
These keep the cost of road transport down, but they create far too many avoidable problems for everybody else.
We must not allow these heavy vehicles into Europe.
Freight transport has to be cut, and that which is really necessary must as far as possible go by rail or water.
Mr President, the importance of logistics to our society is well known.
Everyone involved has a duty to ensure that logistics operations proceed smoothly.
Public authorities make the operating framework as favourable as possible and business and industry devises concepts to meet market demand in the best way possible.
I am glad that the rapporteur mentions that and emphasises the various areas which need consideration.
Something which gave rise to much discussion as we dealt with this report is the question of these longer heavier freight vehicles or 'ecocombis'.
Although practical tests at national level have yielded quite positive results, opinions on these vehicles differ.
To my mind the compromise is a good starting point for further debate.
I look forward to seeing what the European Commission will bring to this debate, both in its Freight Logistics Action Plan and in the study of vehicle weights and dimensions.
The study will be commissioned shortly and its findings will be published next summer.
To sum up briefly, my compliments to Mrs Ayala Sender on her report and I hope that the course embarked upon can be taken further later on in the year.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, for years now globalisation has landed us with rising expenditure on freight transport; on top of that we have had enlargement eastward - together with a misdirected EU aid policy.
As a result, millions of vehicles are transporting freight every day, from private cars to HGVs, and the adverse effects such as congestion, noise, environmental pollution and fine dust pollution are escalating.
The concentration on road transport will no doubt exacerbate the existing problems in densely populated areas and on the main transport routes.
HGVs are far more often involved in accidents than other forms of transport and strict EU-wide rules on rest periods will make little difference.
Brussels does not take public health protection really seriously either, for there is no other explanation for the failure to transpose the Convention on the Protection of the Alps.
In fact the EU addressed those issues years ago, drawing up action plans and calling for transport to be shifted from road to rail.
Yet once again it did not managed to achieve any real results.
In regard to Trans-European Networks, we cannot continue to close our eyes to reality and, in the end, rolling country roads will have to become economically attractive.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me point out that the Commission itself said that logistics is a matter for the industry itself.
I believe that is the right approach.
I hope, therefore, that when the Commission presents its action plan, it will divide it up into measures we can take as a Community, measures the Member States can take, and measures it is up to the industry itself to take.
Of course we have to reduce the red tape that is still an obstacle to coastal shipping, which has to fill in various forms, while HGVs can simply drive across the European Union.
We must indeed cut back government bureaucracy and promote modern transport infrastructure and systems.
Let us make no mistake, however.
Logistics is a matter for the industry itself and we should not take on a burden we simply cannot afford.
On gigaliners - perhaps it would be better to say either 60-tonners or 25m-long HGVs, for there are different categories - at this moment in time my Group is quite definitely against authorising their general use in transport.
After all, in most parts of the European Union infrastructure such as bridges, crossings and roundabouts are certainly not suitable for such long or heavy HGVs.
The State treasuries are not handing out any money for reinforcing the bridges or converting roundabouts.
Given that transport situation, gigaliners produce considerable transport safety problems.
Just imagine one of those 25-tonners coming round a bend in a small village, misjudging the bend and then trying to reverse!
I think, therefore, we should continue doing what we have done in the past.
We should authorise them in Finland and Sweden, which have huge open stretches for the transport of timber.
In that regard, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has made a sensible suggestion.
It says we should authorise these gigaliners in the Member States, but only subject to very stringent conditions, if we can show the Commission that the necessary transport security exists, that the necessary transport infrastructure exists.
That means we should check those conditions in individual cases and for individual countries.
(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, Member States have to ensure a favourable environment for the development of freight transport logistics and to remove the barriers involved.
Both for carriers and for clients it is extremely important that freight arrives on time and under the established terms.
By 2020 a 50% increase in freight transport is predicted.
Freight transport logistics represents 13% of the Union's gross domestic product and 10-15% of the final cost for products is represented by the cost of transport logistics.
That is why Member States should facilitate freight transport and the rules and controls should be carried out on the basis of common norms, without introducing barriers to the free movement of goods.
These norms should be forwarded with priority to all the relevant carriers so that they can respect the regulatory provisions, and observe their contractual obligations...
(The President interrupts the speaker)
The European Union has to use more environmentally-friendly means of transport.
It is no coincidence that 70% of the priority projects for the development of the European transport network are meant for railways and waterways transport.
Unfortunately, Member States have made little use of the Marco Polo programme for the transfer of a larger volume of freight transport from the road to the sea transport system.
The navigable waterway made up of the Rhine, Main Channel and the Danube shortens the distance between the Northwestern and Southeastern Europe by 4 000 km.
Moreover, as of 2007, the European Union has an exit to the Black Sea.
For freight transport logistics, intelligent transport systems and the use of technology become indispensable.
However, freight transport needs a good transport infrastructure and that is why we hope that the budgets relating to the Community and national transport projects will become a priority in the future.
I think that this report is extremely important for the economic development of the European Union.
Member States should do more for freight transport logistics.
Congratulations to the rapporteur.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I am one of those people who believe that progress and welfare cannot be attained without ambitious objectives, but I also believe that we in the Community and the European Union have on too many occasions given ourselves grandiloquent and unrealistic agreements and objectives.
This is what I believe happened in 2000 with the Lisbon Strategy, which was going to make us the most competitive and dynamic world economy by 2010; or in 1994 with the Essen Agreements on trans-European networks, most of which are still pending.
In March this very year, the European Council set a target for a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, whereas in reality we have proved incapable of attaining the much more modest targets to which we committed ourselves in Kyoto.
Now we are debating freight transport logistics in Europe as a key to sustainable mobility, a crucial element for our growth and development; and given the significant growth in freight transport predicted by 2020, logistics is something we cannot ignore as it is a necessary tool to increase the accessibility, efficiency and security of freight transport, as well as its sustainability.
However, at the same time it is necessary to correct persistent failures such as the bottleneck in the trans-European road network in the Biriatu Pass in the Basque Country, or other aspects where there are shortcomings such as the lack of corridors currently devoted to rail freight (such corridors do not need to be high-speed in order to be competitive), or the poor interoperability of the railways, or the lack of efficient transhipment.
We must make intelligent transport systems possible, apply the potential offered by the Internet to the management of freight transport by standardising weights, dimensions and rules governing freight, reducing red-tape and establishing one-stop access points.
We must promote co-modality of the various modes of transport, not forgetting motorways of the sea and inland waterways; most of all we must incorporate the real costs, including environmental costs, into the price of use.
All this cannot be achieved while reducing States' contributions to the Community budget.
(DA) Mr President, EU transport policy is on the wrong track.
Broadly speaking, nothing is being done about the key problems: climate change, congestion and accidents.
It is as though we have become inured to congestion and accidents - but we cannot be content to inure ourselves to climate change once it has begun.
We have to act now.
Yet traditional thinking prevails every time, even in this otherwise excellent report - which includes the absurd proposal to allow the use of megaliners.
What would happen if we allowed the use of these juggernauts of up to 60 tonnes?
Would we have fewer lorries?
Of course not.
The gain from increasing the size of lorries would be eaten up by the increase in transport tonnage.
That is a law of nature; it is what happens when transport is cheaper.
Our roads would become full of these mobile warehouses, and neither 'intelligent' traffic management nor any other hocus-pocus would be of any help.
It would be like applying small sticking plasters to a gaping wound, which will just become larger and larger with the present transport policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote against the megaliners in paragraph 21.
We cannot permit this kind of heavy goods vehicle in Europe.
We cannot make it cheaper to transport goods by road.
As mentioned earlier, this would undermine the competitiveness of maritime and rail transport: precisely the modes of transport that must be reinforced if we are ever to have sustainable freight transport in Europe.
(RO) Mr President, this report is welcome as logistics is the key to economic development, and transport and mobility are the engine for sustainable development, and has to respond to the current imperative challenges, that is the need to decongest traffic and to fight against climate change.
Faced with the need for sustainable economic development and the need to reduce pollution, logistics, planning, exchange of best practices as well as efficient cooperation between all relevant players - authorities, producers, carriers, beneficiaries - are the only viable solutions.
Currently, both carriers and beneficiaries prefer the rapidity of roads and airways.
Unfortunately, the extreme heat this summer caused the introduction of traffic restrictions for heavy-load vehicles in certain regions, such as Romania, and thus freight transport traffic faced difficulties and financial losses were reported.
Under these circumstances, railway transport and above all internal navigable waterways and short sea routes, as well as comodality, have undoubted advantages for decreasing the pressure on road infrastructures.
It is mandatory to resurrect the debate on co-financing the Transeuropean transport networks because, in order to make these massive investments in European infrastructure, national financial efforts, irrespective of their significance and however well-intentioned they may be, are insufficient especially in the case of the new Member States.
The Commission has to bear in mind and to allocate more funds as of 2008.
I would focus on the importance of the rapporteur's recommendation towards Member States to draw up national action plans for freight transport logistics, together with the European general action plan.
Within these national plans, major importance should be attached to crossborder transport to and from third countries, as well as to the security of cargoes.
These plans can successfully contribute to the improvement of priority management and to the absorbtion of Structural and Cohesion Fund financingmeant to improve and enlarge transport infrastructure, as well as to a better cooperation between the TEN and Marco Polo projects at crossborder level.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Ayala Sender on her excellent report.
I would like to raise two specific issues: firstly, I too welcome the points made in the report about the European Commission's intention to investigate the possibility of creating a single transport document for all modes of transport.
This is a very interesting announcement, which could support interoperability and promote multimodal transport, does not require investment expenditure and could help in integrating us to a great extent.
The second issue, which I also consider to be particularly important, is the creation of a system of training and further training in the areas of transport and logistics in order to create a system for the mutual recognition of skills and competences; this is in reference to paragraph 17.
I would definitely like to support this concept for the reasons given above.
The third issue that I would like to raise is Schengen and, more specifically, how the new Member States are to introduce its principles in practice.
(FR) Mr President, I should also like to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for the excellent work that, at the time Parliament is discussing this type of work, has resulted in this own-initiative report on freight transport logistics in Europe, a very important subject for our fellow citizens, as has often been said.
Since I have to be quick, two main points.
The first is that it is more essential than ever to take logistics into account in our overall goods transport strategy and we must pay particular attention to urban logistics and logistical problems in towns.
The second point, and here I am speaking as a member of the Committee on Budgets, is that European Union investment must include the financing of logistical infrastructures.
We know how disappointed we were about the amounts of the appropriations allocated to the RTE-T and I am counting on the support of the Commissioner in ensuring that the Member States make a greater contribution - at any rate managing to persuade them - when the financial perspectives are renegotiated.
Finally, I should like to draw attention to the views expressed on gigaliners, lorries weighing over 60 tonnes, being driven on European roads. As very many of my colleagues have pointed out this evening, these are not in line with European objectives for safety or environmental protection or sustainable development.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, logistics processes are a matter chiefly for industry and the transport sector and in my view that is how it should stay.
They are considerations featuring prominently on the agenda in Europe and indeed worldwide and for that reason we welcome the Commission's proposal.
But efforts need to be concentrated on securing a better framework for transport and fewer obstacles rather than on yet more European rules or prohibitions.
The rules do need to be tidied up.
So I am happy that in this regard we have significantly streamlined the rapporteur's draft report.
Let me say a little more about the obstacles to logistics.
Last year in this House we debated the Naiades report.
We are fully behind the Commission on this, because there are a lot of obstacles to inland waterway transport too, and I hope the Commission will lose no time in laying its first proposals before Parliament.
Another obstacle to logistics is the restriction on these 60-tonne vehicles.
I support the compromise, namely that Member States must be able to decide whether or not they apply this, but I am also aware that there are an awful lot of myths, not to say mega-myths, doing the rounds on this subject.
You are having a study conducted, Commissioner.
I urge you above all to study the facts and I also urge you to study the international routes.
I agree with my fellow Member Mr Jarzembowski that we must not allow these gigaliners into our towns and villages.
But over long-haul routes where there is no alternative, fine.
So will you look at the facts?
I await your conclusions with interest.
(HU) I would like to thank my colleague, Mrs Ayala Sender, for an excellent report.
She has prepared some comprehensive material covering all areas, which will help in the drafting of the Commission Action Plan.
It is an investment in the future of the European economy for timely, effective freight transport logistics to be put in place throughout the whole of the EU.
Its existence will contribute to sustainable economic development, improved competitiveness and regional development.
However, to achieve this goal we need ever higher quality, more punctual, effective and secure logistics and, most importantly, harmonisation of transport methods so that the efficiency and the benefits of individual methods can be used to full advantage.
This requires the creation of the right technical, practical and economic conditions.
Impact assessments relying on a unified strategy for logistics development are required.
It is important to separate the roles of the state and the private sector.
Efficient logistics is the key to sustainable mobility.
Mature logistics solutions contribute to the optimisation of freight transport, and so it is also useful to look at opportunities for research and development support for developments in logistics.
(PT) With this initial report, on which the rapporteur is to be congratulated, we hope to contribute to the definition of a strategic framework for freight transport logistics in the European Union.
We consider logistics to be an essential tool for the effective planning and implementation of a balanced and sustainable use of the various means of transport.
Logistics are consequently central to a process of rationalisation for the purpose of achieving the most competitive and sustainable levels in the future.
Despite the advantages conferred by a modern system of logistics in the areas of economic efficiency and competitiveness, optimum use of resources, creation of employment opportunities, protection of the environment and improvement of safety and security, we recognise that there are still problems to be solved, one of the most obvious being the chronic underfunding of the TENs, including the development of freight transport logistics.
It is therefore essential to explore alternative sources of funding via private-public initiatives, the EIB, the Structural Funds, etc.
Another timely point raised in the report is the need for the Commission Action Plan, mentioned earlier, to provide measures to fight organised crime in international freight transport and ensure the security of freight transport loadings against theft, robbery and hijacking.
It is for the public authorities to regulate these and other matters, and to facilitate multimodal freight transport, which is essentially a business activity.
Measures such as 'one stop administrative shopping' and cutting red tape reduce costs and pave the way for a sounder and more competitive economy in the sector.
Given the high growth rates in freight transport that are expected, the future role of logistics will be crucial to achieving an efficient, sustainable, accessible and safe transport system.
To this extent, we are sure that logistics will make an increasingly essential contribution to achieving the Lisbon goals.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, efficient freight transport logistics is crucial to territorial cohesion.
So says Ms Ayala, whom I wish to congratulate on her sound and thorough report.
In view of this I would like to ask the Commission to pay special attention to the specific problems faced by island territories, for which maritime transport is of particular importance.
Simplifying procedures, tackling the problems of island ports such as the excessive costs produced by market limitations, or how to facilitate new infrastructures through trans-European networks and the Structural and Cohesion Funds: these are measures which would contribute to improving the economic development and competitiveness of islands.
I would like to close by asking the Commission to give special consideration to the needs which being an island presents in the forthcoming action plan on transport logistics which it is to present.
(DE) Mr President, as transport policy stands today, Europe is aiming at more transport software, i.e. more intelligent solutions to improve efficiency, but also to serve the interests of the environment and health protection.
We will not go into the detailed reasons for this change, although surely it has much to do with the fact that we do not have the money for large new infrastructure projects - see, for instance, the rather modest funds allocated to the TENs and suchlike.
Under these circumstances it is most important to ensure that new hardware is not let in through the back door on Austrian and European transport routes.
I, like a number of others, am referring to the 60-tonners or gigaliners or whatever we call them.
At any rate, they can certainly not be authorised in an infrastructure that is not appropriate for them; they might be a good solution on flat land where there is little traffic, but they would be totally misplaced in mountainous and densely built-up areas.
Austria in particular is in no way equipped for superweight trucks.
Over the past few months we have seen again and again what they mean in terms of bridge construction and the weight they can bear.
We have no interest whatsoever in landing ourselves with new problems here.
It is not in the interests of transport policy either, and especially not in the interest of health and environmental policy.
If we cannot produce any extra European funds to pay for the external costs of the existing infrastructure, then we should leave things as they are or, in this concrete case, leave the gigaliners in northern Finland.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining with your rapporteur in emphasising the importance of logistics, not only from the economic point of view but also environmentally and socially.
I think it is unanimously agreed that logistics should be developed and made more efficient, more environmentally friendly.
That is made very clear in the report by Mrs Ayala Sender, which I welcome.
A number of the wishes you have expressed, which I have listened to very carefully this afternoon, will be incorporated in the Action Plan for Logistics that will be coming out by the end of October.
Since I really do not have enough time to reply at length, I shall just refer to the rules on the size of lorries.
That is certainly one of the most controversial issues and we shall not be able to debate it fully today.
I shall simply make a few comments.
It is a fact that, although we hope to see much more of a modal shift in the future, at present most goods are carried by road.
We have to assess any measures that might improve the efficiency of that mode of transport and reduce its impact on the environment.
The assessment should also cover the rules on the size of lorries, Directive 96/53.
I think any amendments have to be considered very carefully, because they might have complex repercussions.
We need to examine the effects that wider or heavier lorries might have on the infrastructure, safety, the environment, the system of shippers and carriers, and intermodal competition.
As I said, I feel that we should give these questions very serious consideration. My services will therefore be embarking on research to evaluate experiences.
On the basis of its results, we shall be able to discuss all the nuances of this very important issue, which must not be treated lightly.
That is my first point and I shall wind up very quickly, too quickly for my liking, but I appreciate that Parliament has a timetable.
The second important issue in the work on logistics is infrastructures.
Reference has been made to the financing of infrastructures.
I should like to draw attention to the new Marco Polo II Programme, which will enable us to finance logistical solutions favouring the modal shift or the reduction in traffic.
Finally, training.
The last speaker, Mr Rack, said that a new culture has to be developed.
That is indeed what is necessary and we always come back to the men and women working in the transport business, who need to master a whole range of new skills if transport is really to be made more efficient and mobility more sustainable, in other words more environmentally friendly.
I thank Parliament very much and I shall take full account of this report and the subsequent debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Single European Sky (debate)
The next item is the oral question to the Commission on building the single European sky through functional airspace blocks final) by Paolo Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism - B6-0135/2007).
author. - (FR) Mr President, I must first render the things that are SESAR's unto SESAR, or to another Italian, Paolo Costa, who is actually the author of this written question and has asked me to stand in for him and put it to you in his absence.
This is an oral question to the Commission with debate on the creation of functional airspace blocks for building the Single European Sky, in other words, the intentions of the Commission regarding the implementation, or progress to date in the implementation of the package of texts which were the subject of conciliation in December 2003, 'the Single Sky package'
One of the texts provided for the creation of functional airspace blocks, in other words airline routes at the various airspace levels, in order to optimise consumption, reduce greenhouse gases and if possible reduce congestion at the busiest airports, not forgetting the possibility of bringing down air transport costs.
This is a particularly sensitive issue, with reservations on the part of the Member States, which have always reaffirmed their sovereignty over their airspace.
That is especially true of the Member States - and I know of one that is dear to me, my own country - which have large military forces and military airspace blocks reserved in a virtually discretionary fashion.
Mr Costa is concerned that, as we might have feared, no progress has been made, as far as he can see, on that text on the creation of airspace blocks, one of the four on the Single Sky, and it has met with strong resistance from the Member States.
Mr Costa is therefore putting the following question to the Commission.
The Commission has just produced a communication making it clear that the cost of not having functional airspace blocks for building a Single European Sky is about EUR 1 billion.
Mr Costa has put an initial question: is the Commission satisfied with that situation and does it believe that the introduction of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 on airspace organisation is progressing satisfactorily?
How does the Commission account for the fact that no new functional airspace blocks have become operational since the Regulation came into force?
Article 10 of the Regulation provides for an extension of airspace organisation to lower airspace and requires the Commission to determine any other steps that might be necessary 'in the light of progress achieved'.
In view of that, what changes does the Commission think should be made to existing legislation?
Finally, does the Commission agree that it should not wait until the end of 2008 before bringing forward a proposal to that effect?
Finally - there is more than one question in the oral question - Mr Costa is asking whether the Commission agrees that the 'bottom up' approach, whereby the initiative to create functional airspace blocks is left to the Member States, has failed and that a more proactive approach by the European Union is now required?
I think, and I hope I have remained true to its spirit, that that is the question Mr Costa is putting to the Commission.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr Savary, I thank you and, through you, Mr Costa, because I think this question has been very well put and the problem it raises is a real one.
The reform in March 2004 was intended to organise air traffic in line with operational requirements, not national borders.
It is a way of shortening flights and avoiding aircraft flying around unnecessarily.
I shall answer each of the questions.
The first concerns the cost of air traffic management and the repercussions for the Single Sky.
You and Mr Costa have just quoted the key figure of EUR 1 billion if the Single Sky is not implemented, and I might add that, according to Eurocontrol, the potential savings are even greater, since EUR 3 billion could be saved.
In addition to the reduction in airline costs, a saving of two billion would be achieved through the improved efficiency of aviation services.
It is true that, as Mr Savary says, completion of the Single European Sky is not progressing quickly enough, given the importance of the objectives: competitiveness, sustainable development, combating climate change and promoting safety in the air.
Should we, for that reason, stand there with our arms folded and do nothing?
No.
For the first time, the adoption of basic rules on the Single Sky has given the Community real powers in this area.
The 2004 reform has been implemented: separation between regulation and the provision of services, certification of providers in accordance with European rules, air traffic controllers' licences and a range of technical measures adopted by comitology.
Lastly, there has been the launch of the SESAR industrial project, a real addition to the Single Sky.
But we need to move faster.
The Commission must take stock of what has been done.
Back in December 2006, I consulted a group of high-level experts and this July they presented their report to me on the reforms that are imperative.
The Commission will be submitting a communication based on that this autumn.
The second question relates to functional airspace blocks.
It is true that in the 2004 reform the Council opted for a bottom-up approach, with action by the national governments on the creation of the blocks.
Frankly, that was not an entirely satisfactory approach, because it limited the possibilities for the Commission and the Community institutions to ensure that the blocks were actually created and that work at local level did not become bogged down.
Another part of the problem is that insufficient stress was placed on improving the economic efficiency of the service provided.
We are going to try and introduce a performance-based approach by the first half of 2008.
That would set specific performance targets for service providers and provide for incentives and intervention mechanisms in the event of non-completion.
I believe that that performance-based approach will speed up the creation of functional blocks, because they will be essential to the achievement of the performance targets.
We are working on the idea of a performance review body and a coordinator responsible for developing the projects more quickly.
I personally think that a coordinator of the kind we have for the trans-European networks would be very useful in speeding up the creation of these functional blocks that we need.
We shall not, of course, be waiting until 2009 to accelerate the creation and efficiency of the functional blocks.
I would hope to present you with an initiative by the middle of 2008.
It is generally agreed that the blocks can only be effective if upper and lower airspace are regarded as indivisible.
Lastly, the fourth question, the bottom-up approach of the Member States, which, it must be admitted, has in some ways been a failure.
In that case, should we adopt exactly the opposite approach?
I am not sure.
I think we still have to try and make the best of the bottom-up approach, but in order to develop a Single Sky we need to move on to a second stage, based on performance, on mechanisms.
We have to cooperate actively with the Member States to encourage political commitment and exercise pressure from above to develop functional airspace blocks.
That is why this question was so welcome. It has given me an opportunity to explain the main initiatives we shall be taking, which are in line with the very pertinent comments made by Mr Savary.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, we have no problems at all with what you have achieved in terms of improving efficiency in airspace, but your reply was quite clear.
That reply was to the effect that Member States have not done their homework.
Member States have not met the obligation that has existed since 2004 rapidly to create functional airspace blocks.
On the one hand that results in the costs you referred to of up to EUR 3 billion, and on the other hand it also leads to environmental pollution.
At the moment, we are discussing the introduction of emission trading in air transport, talking about 3% of air transport emissions.
If we had sensible, rapid and efficient air transport management we could reduce fuel consumption by up to 12%, which would substantially reduce CO2 emissions.
Mr Vice-President, you are a gentleman, but let us get to the crux of the matter: the Member States are not doing their homework.
That is why we - you as the Commission and we as Parliament - must all tell the Member States: detention time!
You have to catch up quickly now after falling so far behind.
Yet that may not be enough.
We must also threaten them with changing the bottom-up-, bottom-down approach.
If Member States cannot manage to make progress on the truly vital question of air safety, air efficiency, the impact of air transport on the climate, then we expect that in 2008 the Commission will not just present a report saying that the Member States are improving in terms of creating airspace blocks, but that it will threaten the Member States.
You can rely on our help.
Then we will have to change the system and create the airspace blocks at European level.
That is the stick we need in order to persuade Member States rapidly to create efficient, functional airspace blocks.
I know how difficult that is, but kind words will get us nowhere.
We must slowly begin to wave the big stick.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am so long in this Parliament that I recall the occasion when Commissioner de Palacio first proposed the Single European Sky and the term 'functional airspace blocks' first entered EU vocabulary.
Well, after a painful birth, progress was made in 2004 with the regulation that enacted these airspace blocks, but I have to say that since then progress has been painfully slow, particularly in regard to the extension of those airspace blocks and specifically as regards lower airspace.
I appreciate, Commissioner, that it was the Commission's intention to work with Member States and no doubt some Member States have proved to be less willing to pursue this policy at the pace that we would like or, indeed, had envisaged, but surely the time is now right to find the accelerator pedal and for the Commission now to come forward with a directive as soon as possible.
Since 2004, no new airspace blocks have been created and, as we have heard from previous speakers, the cost of that in our failure to create a Single European Sky is estimated to be at EUR 1 billion.
In addition, the existing legislation is in need of updating and the travelling public are still faced on a daily basis with air traffic delays, due to the antiquated attitudes of Member States and what appears to be inactivity by the Commission.
Patience is running out, and action is needed urgently.
Failure to act is not an option, which is why my Group will support the oral question placed before Parliament by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Commissioner, we are all growing older and we would like to see the Single European Sky in our lifetime.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, I should like to ask whether this aviation liberalisation policy can be considered in any way to be helping certain regions and regional airports.
Look, for example, at what is happening at Shannon Airport in my own constituency in the west of Ireland.
Aer Lingus's decision to discontinue flights to London has adversely affected the region, not least economically.
It is totally contrary to Irish government policy.
To my mind, then, as far as Europe's regions are concerned, this freedom in aviation matters will help strong areas to progress, but weaken those which are not so strong.
I would therefore ask the Commission to look at the case of, say, Shannon Airport, and consider how this policy can be pursued alongside regional development policy in such areas.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, the 'Single European Sky' initiative confirms my experience as a private pilot that aviation is a textbook example of an area that calls for supranational cooperation irrespective of state borders.
For that reason, and in view of the need to ensure maximum air traffic safety, maximum effectiveness and minimum flight delays, we support the creation of functional blocks and, consequently, the Single European Sky.
However, let us not forget that while fragmentation is expensive, defragmentation costs money too.
Since this is a complex system, I support, in the interest of continuity, the gradual establishment of a single operations management system in a common airspace.
In addition, the unification of European skies where 27 national operating systems exist today will jeopardise the jobs of air traffic controllers and other specialists in this field.
As far as I am aware, a rather successful long-term social dialogue has been conducted on these issues and, in my opinion, it is thus necessary to reconcile seemingly contradictory procedures.
We want our flights to be safer and more effective; we want minimal flight delays and maximum elimination of the dangers of unusual air traffic events.
Human lives are at stake: the lives of those who fly and also the lives and fates of those who manage the air traffic.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I am disturbed by the suggestion that the process of establishing open skies be accelerated.
There seems to be no recognition of the problems that open skies have visited on regional airports in Europe, even in their preparatory stage.
In creating a single European sky we will see the emergence of two major hubs - Heathrow, definitely, and either Frankfurt or Charles de Gaulle - flanked by a network of sub-hubs.
The competition among airports to be the first or second level in the open skies hierarchy is proving cut-throat in my country.
Shannon Airport - a hub in its own right - and regional airports like Cork are being starved of routes, while Dublin Airport is chronically overcrowded.
My government stands by and does nothing because the logic of open skies is to let the market decide, and the market, not social responsibility or common sense around regional and rural development, is deciding in a way that increases profits but does not serve people.
Rather than rush open skies, let us, even at this late hour, take whatever time is necessary to do serious assessment on the impact of the policy.
Then let us take whatever measures are needed to ensure that whole areas of Europe, like the west and south of Ireland, are not cut off from a viable, economic future by open skies.
(DE) Madam President, we all share the same concern regarding European transport policy.
We want to improve the efficiency of all modes of transport, and especially air transport, without at the same time increasing environmental pollution.
If possible, we even want to improve the environmental balance of flying.
We have had many ideas on the subject in Europe, such as emission trading.
We hope to achieve our aims by, for example, possibly taxing aircraft fuel and suchlike.
That may not be the wrong approach, but the way to achieve our aim is a different one.
As in the case of road transport, we should seek more intelligent solutions.
The idea of an open European sky and a Single European Sky is the right approach, although of course it needs to be implemented.
SESAR is a step on the way but we must do more in this respect.
Let me address a final point because we will be voting on the subject this week.
Congestion is found not just in the sky, but on the ground too, especially in airports.
Let us, therefore, get rid of the senseless, bureaucratic rules on carrying fluids at airports.
That would save a lot of money and a lot more trouble.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, we regard the Single European Sky as the most important project for the future of air transport.
The Commission always emphasised its importance under your predecessor and I also believe it to be the case.
We adopted the 2004 package of regulations.
We still have a kind of patchwork in the sky, with 58 national airspace blocks, even though we know we would really only need one, or to be generous perhaps three to six.
We know that this patchwork - the figures were given earlier - has adverse effects on safety, and of course also on the economy and consumers.
We know about the stacking and congestion in the skies and nowadays we are putting far more emphasis on emissions.
We have realised that we can take a big step forward here.
In its progress report, the Commission showed how slowly the Member States are moving, even if there are some initiatives, and proposed a few ways of exerting pressure.
Now I am not saying that is meaningless, nor 'I told you so', but as early as 2003 we said the bottom-up approach would not work, because even at that time we suspected that Member States would get embroiled in discussions about areas of sovereignty in regard to service provision and that such crucial matters need to be regulated by top-down legislative rules.
At the time we thought perhaps Eurocontrol could propose rules and make a proposal based simply on the substance, on functionality, which the Member States could then quarrel about, rather than waiting until they themselves had created another kind of patchwork, in a bottom-up approach.
What is important now is seriously to consider whether we need to review the legal framework.
That would be the only way to exert real pressure and bring about the necessary changes.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, in the spring of 2004, when the European Union was adopting the relevant legislation, there was talk of the benefits that civil aviation would obtain from the reorganisation of air traffic rules and military cooperation with the civil sector in this regard.
The European system at that time was very fragmented, which resulted in there being narrow airspace corridors.
As a result there was a worsening in the safety of flights, and about 20% of aircraft were delayed, more fuel was being used, which had a negative ecological impact.
Is the situation any better today, Commissioner?
Why have the so-called 'functional airspace blocks' not begun to function?
Is this just the fault of individual Member States?
Or perhaps our laws did not meet actual requirements?
It would be good to have a prompt response to these questions and to take remedial steps now, and not wait to the end of 2008.
Growth in air traffic is phenomenal.
What are needed therefore are appropriate legal regulations, but regulations that do not just remain empty words.
What is also required is appropriate staff training.
And finally, how do you see this issue in the context of the EU's neighbours, Commissioner?
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with what other speakers have already said and I would add that the Single European Sky needs to be completed as a matter of urgency.
It is clear that the softly-softly approach of Regulation 551/2004, designed to encourage Member States to make optimum use of these more functional airspace blocks, has not worked.
I understand too that this is largely because many Member States are holding back, they prefer not to be involved, stress their sovereignty, and so forth, but we must not allow them to get away with that.
Aviation is very much a sector which needs to be dealt with in every particular at the European level, in the interests of the industry, consumers, safety and the environment.
At a time when climate change is so high on the political agenda, Commissioner, we cannot have aircraft making unnecessary detours, wasting huge amounts of aviation fuel, and so on.
We simply must push ahead with this dossier, along with other instruments - SESAR, the emissions trading system, and so forth. We cannot go on allowing tens of millions of euros to be wasted due to inefficient management of our airspace by a whole lot of unnecessary air traffic control centres.
There is plenty of scope for trimming and pruning here and that is what we want.
It is likely, moreover, that we shall soon reach the limits of capacity thanks to the sector's rapid expansion.
Existing bilateral contacts aimed at forming functional airspace blocks have achieved hardly anything, so we really do need to pull our finger out.
Appointing a coordinator and a performance review body would seem to be a step in the right direction, but at the same time, Commissioner, I fear that this bottom-up approach will not be enough; we have taken it as far as we can and we must now look to take new legislative initiatives.
(RO) Madam President, in 2006, low-cost companies opened 225 new European airways routes, meaning 1 800 new flights per week.
The fragmentation of airspace at national level, with specific operational rules and procedures, may have negative effects on the safety of transport capability, on the introduction of new technologies and on costs.
While passing from one air sector to another, pilots change frequency and contact the next air traffic controller.
Air traffic control has become a critical element.
It is important that new functional blocks be implemented following consultation of all the relevant parties, and Member States take effective actions in order to achieve an integrated management system.
Meanwhile, investments should be made in more efficient aircrafts and airport infrastructure.
Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU adds new functional blocks for the Community airspace, with relevance both for the Black Sea region and for cooperation in the Balkans.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I appreciate and share the impatience expressed by Parliament.
I shall give you a very precise but very concise answer. Ladies and gentlemen, you will have a report in October 2007 and a second package of legislation by the middle of 2008, so it certainly cannot be said that we are not doing anything!
We are therefore going to answer this question in detail together.
The second point: I have probably spoken to you about a coordinator, a senior political figure who will promote the introduction of these operational blocks between the Member States.
I must say that the results achieved in the trans-European networks indicate to me that this would be a useful way of stepping up our action in this area.
I shall reply to the third question by referring to Sesar, because Sesar exists, it is already a joint enterprise that brings together all the participants.
I believe that the introduction of Sesar will overturn all the bad habits that were keeping us confined to airspaces defined by national borders, which are no longer sensible.
Thus I am giving a very positive reply to the question put by Mr Costa and discussed by Mr Savary and have listened carefully to what Parliament wants.
I am ready to do all I can to respond.
The debate is now closed.
Written statement (Rule 142)
in writing. - (CS) The Member States agreed to set up common airspace blocks to control a single sky, irrespective of national borders.
Prior to that two planes collided over Germany and 71 people perished.
The arguments for a single sky are growing stronger: we have 57 control points for 28 000 daily flights; the US has two.
Three years later we are no further on.
The EU has not put all of the Regulations from 2004 into practice.
These Regulations were supposed to integrate airspace in the internal services market and provide a basis for an effective operating system with emphasis on safety, the environment and increased flying capacity.
We currently have 65 radar centres with 31 systems using 22 computer networks, and we expect that the number of flights over Europe will double in 10 years' time.
Do the citizens know that their governments and parliaments are ignoring the benefits of common Europe to their disadvantage?
Why does the process of creating a shared operating airspace for both civilian and military flights over a united Europe take such a long time?
Is it to appease local economic interests?
Is it to protect national sovereignty, to the detriment of transport safety and at high prices?
Today we want to know how and when we are going to integrate the classification of the upper airspace and how are we going to jointly operate the lower airspace in the future.
Can obstacles to the creation of functional blocks over European territory be identified openly?
Is it possible to shed light on the political will of Member States to fulfil their obligations?
We are also worried about the failure of the bottom-up approach because in three years the Member States have not developed the functional blocks needed for more efficient control of the sky.
Commission Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0138/2007).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission
Part one
Subject: Forced labour in Europe
Trafficking in people for purposes of exploitative forced labour has been on the rise in recent years in the EU.
The victims, whether European citizens or immigrants, are suffering under new forms of slavery.
What action does the Commission intend to take to put an end to this phenomenon?
Since such trafficking is facilitated by Member States' failure to ensure employers' compliance with the legislation on labour and workers' rights, what measures will the Commission take to tackle this problem?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, forced labour and trafficking for labour exploitation are gross violations of fundamental rights and we are fully committed to preventing and combating such crimes.
According to estimates from international labour organisations, in 2005 there were at least 12.3 million people in forced labour worldwide.
About a fifth of these have been trafficked.
Trafficking for labour exploitation is mostly an organised crime business and creates an estimated 12 billion dollars per year.
We also know that trafficking is still a low-risk crime.
European strategy aims to move it from being low-risk, high-reward to high-risk, low-reward.
An integrated strategy against trafficking for labour exploitation is needed which comprises prevention, prosecution, protection and assistance to victims.
The Commission will play the role of facilitator to establish a network of all the stakeholders and institutions involved in a preventive strategy.
First of all, labour inspection services, employers' organisations, trade unions.
In relation to prevention, the major goal is ensuring the respect of labour laws in all the work places and therefore fighting against illegal labour, especially in the sectors which are more at risk, including agriculture, construction, food-processing and domestic work.
I am also committed to developing new legislation on combating trafficking in human beings and labour exploitation of migrant workers.
The recent proposal for a directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally resident third country nationals is an example.
This proposal aims at fighting more effectively the exploitation of migrant workers through dissuasive administrative sanctions and through penal sanctions in the most serious cases, including trafficking, and where particularly exploitative working conditions are found.
Investigation and prosecution should become more effective.
Law enforcement officials should fully apply the legislation against trafficking in the field of labour exploitation, including legislation complying with the framework decision on trafficking and the directive on residence permits for victims of trafficking.
As national good practice shows, measures to provide assistance for trafficked persons are crucial to protect their fundamental rights and simultaneously promote successful prosecution.
The granting of assistance, residence status and support to find a better alternative for labour and life will secure the cooperation of trafficked persons in criminal proceedings and make it easier to punish the perpetrators.
In conclusion, on the occasion of the first Anti-Trafficking Day on 18 October next, the Commission will draw up recommendations with and for Member States on identification and support of victims - first of all vulnerable categories like children - based on close cooperation between law enforcement, prosecutors' offices and NGOs and other service providers.
(RO) Madam President, please allow me to thank Commissioner Frattini for his answer.
Since the time I submitted my question, I met the Commissioner and we discussed aspects of the trafficking in people.
I deeply appreciate the involvement of the European Commission and of the Commissioner himself in the fight against this phenomenon and I am glad that on 18 October, the European Commission will launch actual actions to stop this phenomenon, including those mentioned by the Commissioner, i.e. introducing criminal sanctions for serious cases of moonlighting.
I would like to ask if the Commissioner intends, on behalf of the European Commission, to request a mandate from the Council for signing, on behalf of the European Communities, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, a very efficient legal instrument for combating the trafficking in human beings.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the answer is certainly yes.
We are, and I am personally, committed to ensuring that all the international instruments see Europe as an actor and as a protagonist.
As regards the instrument to which you referred, as well as the other concrete initiatives, the Commission undoubtedly cannot, ladies and gentlemen, do everything alone.
I should like to propose a directive on the criminal punishment of profiteers, or rather slave-traders, who use and abuse the victims of trafficking, but unless the Member States give their consent, unless the network of small, large and medium-sized enterprises in Europe supports us, such instruments will be much less effective.
What I am therefore appealing for is for us to work together.
(DE) EURO 2008 will be held in Austria and Switzerland next year.
The people traffickers and traffickers in women are already prepared for it.
Is the Commission also prepared?
Vice-President of the Commission. - It is a very important question.
We had quite a good experience during the 2006 football World Cup in Germany.
We worked together in very close cooperation with all the Member States, police authorities and German authorities.
We were able to prevent at least 3 000 or 4 000 young victims from being trafficked in Germany during that period of time.
We are ready to do the same.
We are preparing a report, which will be published very shortly, on the very important results of European cooperation.
You may know that at least 12 Member States have been cooperating in adopting measures to block and to control at the borders suspect people who are trying to illegally bring in young victims of this trafficking.
We are ready to do the same next year in cooperation with Germany, Austria and Switzerland, which will also host championships.
Germany did a very good job on this.
(LT) The phenomenon whereby people are taken and forcibly employed and whereby they are deprived of freedom of movement and any activity, whereby it is impossible to leave one's job, as in a prison, is a very old one.
We know about this from the media and from various inquiries.
Has the Commission any generalised, statistical information on the countries in which this has occurred, and do you not think this is a matter of criminal law?
A Member State has no right to refrain from punishing offenders who deprive others of their freedom.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the European Court of Justice plays an important role in safeguarding the legality, implementation and application of third pillar instruments.
Under Article 35 of the Treaty, the Court has jurisdiction, upon request of a Member State's court or tribunal, to give preliminary rulings on the validity or interpretation of framework decisions and decisions, on the interpretation of conventions established under Title VI of the Treaty, and on the validity and interpretation of the measures implementing them.
However, this jurisdiction only exists for those Member States which have declared that they accept the jurisdiction of the Court.
Moreover, those Member States, having accepted the jurisdiction, may limit it to the highest national courts or tribunals.
At this moment, unfortunately, only 16 Member States have accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court to give preliminary rulings on third pillar instruments, and two of them have made a limitative statement.
This is really insufficient in my view and does not allow for appropriate dialogue between the Court and the national courts applying European law on a daily basis.
In addition, the European Court has jurisdiction to review the legality of framework decisions and decisions.
Both Member States and the Commission may bring an action before the European Court to challenge the legality of these measures.
In practice, the Commission has made use of this possibility twice.
I refer to the cases regarding the request for annulment of the framework decision concerning the application of criminal law with respect to the protection of the environment and ship source pollution.
But, in my view, these provisions also need improvement.
In particular, the present Treaty does not provide for a mechanism similar to the infringement procedures for Community legislation, in order to monitor the implementation of the instruments in Member States' legislation.
I have expressed my view on the gaps with respect to the jurisdiction of the Court in the area of freedom, security and justice in two communications I submitted to the Commission in 2006 and July 2007 on the implementation of the Hague programme.
The Commission therefore welcomes the mandate agreed by the Member States for an intergovernmental conference to finalise details of a reformed treaty.
Under the reformed treaty, I would expect the Court of Justice to become fully responsible in all justice, freedom and security areas.
This is important to tackle poor national implementation of previously agreed work.
(ES) Madam President, the Commissioner has replied as I anticipated, as I am aware of the value he places on the institutions of the rule of law.
The problem is that the Constitutional Treaty is still at an indeterminate point: we do not know if we will succeed in concluding it and in the meantime we must operate in this Community, tackling terrorist crimes on the one hand and on the other ensuring legal certainty.
The question I would raise with the Commissioner is, in the light of the lack of will on the part of some States to take on commitments before the Court of Justice, whether he believes it is appropriate for us to continue to adopt anti-terrorist measures if at the same time such measures are not coupled with a strengthening of the courts.
In other words, each time a measure of this type is adopted, the Member States should enter into a commitment to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.
Otherwise, we will be faced with the possibility of authoritarian or coercive methods being adopted without the possibility of recourse to the Court.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very delicate issue.
On the one hand, I believe that the Member States must shoulder their responsibilities and, in my view, their first responsibility is to agree in October, during the Portuguese Presidency, on the proposal that the Intergovernmental Conference has received from the European Council, a very clear mandate which includes the new powers of the Court of Justice.
There is no doubt that we shall then be able to take a huge step forward, particularly as regards the most delicate issues, the most sensitive sectors, i.e. those of the current third pillar, where the Court will finally have jurisdiction.
We will finally have the possibility of a full review by the Court of Justice.
I would point out that in some cases the Member States are reluctant even to follow the Court's directions; the Court of Justice has told us that in some areas the instrument of criminal law may also be a European instrument; the Court said this of pollution, for instance, which is a sensitive issue.
Some Member States are continuing to oppose any such agreement, which unfortunately has to be unanimous and which simply follows on from a Court decision; they nevertheless continue to oppose it.
Clearly, this problem can be resolved only if the Portuguese Presidency manages to obtain agreement in October, something that would be a major success and would bring about that leap forward that you have mentioned and that I fully support.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, it is an open secret that in some of the new EU Member States the forces behind organised crime are on the best possible terms with the highest political circles.
To what extent and by what means will the Union help those eastern and south-eastern European countries, which have huge monetary and financial problems themselves, to fight that interaction between politics and organised crime?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a general objective this does not, in my view, relate only to the eastern countries, since the general objective is to encourage a strong, hard-line and ongoing fight against corruption.
The fight against corruption cannot come to an end, for instance, when a country becomes a Member of the European Union.
We have worked with many candidate countries which have become Member States of the European Union.
Those countries have achieved very good results and our interest now is, for instance, in working with those which are not candidates, but are simply our neighbours: the countries of the Western Balkans, important partners such as Ukraine, countries with which we have an important partnership.
I think that it is always in our interest to help those countries to root out corruption and business and politics are always bound up in corruption.
My answer to the question is certainly yes.
The European Union is interested, and I think that it is in our interest, and I would also say in the interest of the people of those countries, because people who suffer politics-related corruption have their rights denied on a daily basis.
That is something we owe to Europe and to the people of those countries.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, organising illegal immigration and people trafficking are important branches of the business of organised crime.
We as a European Union brought Frontex into being with your initiative - a good idea fraught with major implementing problems: Member States do not deliver, actions are interrupted in July and only resume in September.
What will you do to make the Frontex instrument function efficiently and provide Member States with the necessary support throughout the year, so that we can have an effective instrument in our hands to combat organised illegal immigration, something you also want to see?
Member of the Commission. - I should like to thank the honourable Member, Mrs McGuinness, for the question.
Firstly, I wish to reply to your question on GMO research in general.
In the past the Commission funded research projects on genetically modified food in the Fifth Framework Programme and also in the Sixth Framework Programme, with several projects that contribute to shedding light on the safety assessments of genetically modified foods.
Research projects were also funded on the issue of coexistence between GMO and conventional crops, which also addressed traceability measures.
These projects will ultimately contribute to reducing costs and to ensuring informed customer choices in line with Community legislation.
This year, in the first call for proposals in the 7th Framework Programme, the Commission called for the submission of proposals on a topic for research on assessment of short- and long-term effects of GMOs on human and animal health, with the aim of supporting the development of improving techniques for post-market monitoring and for analysing their possible limitations.
While evaluations have been finished, the selection process of proposals for funding is still going on.
Moreover, a complementary study has been launched by the Commission in DG Environment dealing with the long-term effects of genetically modified crops on health, biodiversity and the environment.
The key objective of this study will be to prioritise the potential risks of the main crop trade combinations cultivated worldwide by collecting and analysing information from peer-reviewed literature and from the relevant organisations, both within and outside the European Union.
With the necessary expertise in research and cultivation of GM crops, the results are expected next spring.
In the future, Commission-funded research could include tools for safety assessment, risk/benefit assessments, including risk communication and perception, detection methods, ways to ensure traceability and coexistence of genetically modified and conventional organisms.
On the second part of your question on the coexistence issue, I would like to add the following.
It should be noted that authorised GMOs can be freely traded and used within the EU under the conditions of the authorisation consent provided.
The legislative framework for the authorisation of GMOs for placing on the market and for deliberate release into the environment in the EU does not provide the possibility to establish zones where the cultivation or placing on the market of GMOs is generally prohibited.
A general ban would contradict Community legislation, in particular Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs.
Indeed, only GMOs that have been scientifically evaluated as safe for the environment and animal and human health are authorised to be placed on the market.
A specific ban on a product must be scientifically justified according to Article 23 of this directive, the so-called safeguard clause article.
Community research into coexistence is studying appropriate measures to segregate authorised GM crops from conventional and organic crops in a feasible and practical way.
The research results indicate that sufficient segregation is feasible for the major crops studied so far - maize and sugar beet.
However, with increasing commercial cultivation and genetically modified crops in the EU and imports of genetically modified food and feed, adventitious presence through gene flow and admixture becomes unavoidable.
On your question about the possibility to authenticate a GM-free designation in relation to livestock products, I would like to draw your attention to the statement of the European Food Safety Authority paper published recently on 20 July 2007, where EFSA noted that no technique is currently available to enable a valid and reliable tracing of animal products like meat, milk or eggs, when the animals have been fed a diet incorporating GM plants or, to put it another way, DNA fragments or proteins from GM plants have not been detected in edible products from farm animals using the existing available techniques.
To add something from the area of my colleagues, the Commission continues to assess the coexistent measures notified by Member States with respect to their compliance with Community legislation.
The Council asked the Commission to develop jointly with the Member States guidelines for crop-specific co-existence measures at technical level.
The Commission is currently setting up a European co-existence bureau which will conduct this technical work jointly with national experts and stakeholders.
The work is planned to start by the end of 2007.
The first crop to be addressed will be maize.
As for the further steps towards harmonisation, the Commission intends to sum up the developments in the Member States regarding the development of the regulatory regimes and practical experience with GM-crop multi-cultivation in a report scheduled for the year 2008. This will be the basis for the decision about future steps to take on this issue.
Finally, concerning the last part of the question concerning potential consequences, as regards the GM-free status, I would like to add the following.
Farmers are free to decide amongst themselves not to cultivate GMO or to create, on a voluntary basis, zones where GM crops are not cultivated.
These zones can be established only under the voluntary and unanimous agreement of all farmers concerned in the respective locations, while allowing for the possibility for any farmer to withdraw and cultivate authorised GMOs if he or she so wishes.
The regions or farmers which wish not to cultivate GMOs or to adopt a GM-free status, can certainly benefit from the research findings from the research framework programmes.
To date, the results from our research projects do not indicate any reasons why a GM-free status would be beneficial for public health or for the environment.
As regards other issues related to your questions, as for the economic implications on voluntary refraining from GM-crops cultivation, they depend on numerous factors such as prices for GM or non-GM crops, agronomic differences between GM and non-GM crops, differences in yield, seed costs and so on. Local factors, pest pressure, climatic conditions, structure of agriculture of production and so on and regulatory conditions to ensure the coexistence of GM crops with conventional and organic production.
The economic impact is likely to vary between regions and Member States.
Such differences are also reflected in the differences between the uptake rates of GM crop cultivation in different European regions.
The EU livestock production is highly dependent on the import of animal feed derived from soya beans, maize and other crops.
Most of the imports of maize and soya bean-derived foodstuffs are labelled as GM.
Certified non-GM soya bean meal is currently only available for a small market segment. Given the increasing share of GM soya bean production worldwide this could be expanded, but of course at higher cost.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I am grateful for your response, but it was rather lengthy, and I think I must comment on that - it was nearly nine minutes.
Madam President, I will be brief.
While you are chastising the Commissioner, may I say thank you because very often we do not get information and I really appreciate your clarity.
I will need to study the detail. I have two comments and a question and I will watch the time.
Should a country decide voluntarily to be GM-free?
This is being proposed in Ireland; it is part of the Programme for Government and is being looked into.
Could we as a country decide we do not want to bring in food produced from, for example, meat of animals which have eaten GM products, or to bring any particular food into our country because we want to keep ourselves GM-free?
Are you concerned about the impact on grain prices of such a policy?
Member of the Commission. - I will tell you frankly that it is a bit difficult for me to answer.
Of course, they will have to follow the existing Community legislation.
That would be the straightforward answer.
If the question was connected to research and development, it would be easier for me, but I think the answer is quite straightforward: it has to be in line with the existing Community legislation.
Is it not the case that the Commission's dilatory approach to approving GM derivatives is helping to inflate EU livestock feed prices?
For example, the excessive delay in approving use of the corn by-product Hercules is severely damaging the competitiveness of our grain trade sector, yet GA 21, a GM product from Argentina, is approved in the EU for human consumption, but not for animal feed.
Is it not time to rationalise and bring some sense to this situation and cut adrift some of the contrived political correctness that is driving it?
Member of the Commission. - I would just like to stress that, from my point of view, we clearly take great care to take all possible steps to understand the GM or non-GM situation as much as possible.
Decisions made in the Commission are always based on existing knowledge.
We never ignore this and try to stick to this approach.
Policy implications, as you mentioned, have never been the subject of our attention.
I too would like to join Mrs McGuinness in thanking the Commissioner for an excellent and interesting response.
I think it will be a very useful precedential document for us to study, because it seems to me that he robustly supports the scientific justification for the use of GM crops in Europe where they are scientifically approved and authorised.
He mentioned the safeguard clause.
When is the Commission going to base all its decisions on the scientific research that his department is executing and to counter the public opinion that militates against the use of GMs, that is disadvantageous for our farming community and indeed for the cost of food, and is negative for the economy of Europe?
Member of the Commission. - As you know, it is a complex issue and it is important to understand that some people have precautionary fears.
That is why it is important that we develop the awareness and the level of knowledge as far as possible, because it is of vital importance that we base our decisions on the knowledge we have.
I will try to do my best to ensure that this level of knowledge is developed in the future as far as possible.
Thank you Commissioner.
I did not mean to be too harsh but we have to strike a balance between detail and time, which is difficult.
Part two
Subject: The operation of the EU budget
Can the European Commission make a statement as to how it believes that procedures for agreeing how the EU budget is spent annually can be simplified and streamlined in future?
Member of the Commission. - I would like to respond and to repeat my response which I already sent to Mr Crowley about the annual procedures and budget procedures in general, and how they can and could be improved.
I would like to give my answer in two parts.
The first for the current reading, what can still be done, how we can use funds more efficiently, and, of course, the future proposals in our revised treaty, which arose from the June Council this year.
In the current Treaty procedures, we can say that we are satisfied in general with the results, because under the current Treaty we have the possibility of improving and finding the fast-track solution if an urgent situation occurs. A recent example is last year's tsunami, and this year it was Palestine and partly Kosovo.
We were able to find the solution by fast-tracking one reading - but it takes some time, and very much depends on consolidated, trilateral negotiations between the two budgetary authorities and the Commission.
But of course the honourable Member is right in saying that, in this Treaty, there can already be a lot of room for improvement, and one of the examples concerns the pragmatic timetable in the annual budgetary procedure - followed since 1975.
We, on top of the treaty request, we altogether - I mean all budgetary authorities and the Commission - agreed to add two and a half months to the procedure, mainly because at that time there was no electronic mail.
Now we do not need this time schedule but still, inertly, we have this time schedule on our tables and nobody tries to deal with this question.
Of course these productivity gains can be drawn already on this example.
But another element which is very interesting and we have adopted together in negotiations with Parliament and Council, and the Council has finally adopted, the new Financial Regulation and its implementing rules, which have been in force since May of this year, 2007.
Here, already, we have some simplification and streamlining in the implementation of the European budget on an annual basis.
But of course probably the best messages I can transfer today to you are the revised treaty proposals.
And, here, I would like to point out four elements which can improve democratic scrutiny, accountability and transparency in the budgetary procedure.
The first innovative proposal in the revised treaty is that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure is proposed to be eliminated, providing one procedure for the adoption of the annual budget by the budgetary authorities.
Secondly, the so-called 'maximum rate of increase' in Article 27 of the EC Treaty - usually a source of conflict in the annual negotiation process - will no longer be in use or necessary because the substitute in practical terms for the maximum rate of increase, the multi-annual financial framework, will be enshrined in the treaties, which is not the case today.
Finally, in future financial regulations we will have a different adoption process.
This will be adopted by codecision with Parliament.
Until 2007 it was decided unanimously only by the Council - by the Member States.
That is a huge difference which we envisage.
So all these proposals, together with the possibility of improving on an annual and everyday basis, will give more powers to the democratically elected European Parliament and will further democratise the decision-making process.
I thank the Commissioner for her response and for her facilitation of a further question.
It concerns the question of what the new Reform Treaty presents to us with regard to the multiannual funding aspect and the functioning of the budget.
As you know, every year we have the usual arguments with regard to certain own resources that are being made available as well as what other funds we have made available and how those monies have been distributed to the different headings, whether it is agriculture, social structure, structural funding, regional funding and so on.
One of the biggest complaints we always get here in Parliament is that people do not know where European money is being spent.
They do not know where exactly the funding they are giving, as they see it, is being distributed amongst the different countries.
I know Member States have a responsibility themselves to say that, but is there some mechanism whereby the Commission could be more forthcoming with regard to highlighting the areas of expenditure?
Member of the Commission. - I would like to announce that we obtained an agreement with the Council precisely on the new Financial Regulation, under our transparency initiative, whereby Member States have agreed to report and make public all information on all recipients of funds - not only for agriculture but for all funds.
The agriculture agreement will take effect from 2009 and the others from 2008, 2009 and 2010.
This is a huge step for transparency, responsibility, openness and communication with citizens.
Citizens will be able to know who will receive each penny and why, so it will also be much easier for Member States to answer.
(DE) Commissioner, my question concerns the late payment directive.
Many small and medium-sized undertakings, and many researchers too, constantly complain about the length of time it takes from authorisation of a project to actual payment.
Pre-financing is far too difficult for many small and medium-sized undertakings.
Do you think the European Commission might also bring its payment conditions into line with the late payment directive, which applies throughout Europe and which we all agreed?
Member of the Commission. - We know the problem and have applied new regulations and implementing rules to these questions.
We hope that the new ones, which have been in place and in force since May of this year, will simplify the procedure and, of course, will allow for a more responsible response from the Commission also.
We understand that the rules need to be the same for everybody, not only for Member States and recipients but for the Commission also.
(DE) Commissioner, you referred to political crises.
This year we have seen countless natural disasters in Greece, the UK and elsewhere.
It is most important for budget funds to be made available rapidly in such cases.
Are the instruments we have now adequate or could improvements perhaps be made?
Might there be ways of increasing the overall financial volume, given that the figures for this summer show that the funds we have at present will certainly not suffice?
Member of the Commission. - As we are all aware, under Article 149 of the EC Treaty, the content of the education programme is the responsibility of Member States, which means that decisions on the design of the curricula delivered by the educational institutions, as well as the subjects taught, are therefore taken solely by the Member States.
The Commission has the role of supporting the Member States in their development of quality education.
Under our Education and Training 2010 work programme, the Commission plays a central role in facilitating the exchange of best practice between Member States in order to help ensure that their education and training systems can meet the challenges of the 21st century.
Because labour market issues are an important part of the Lisbon Strategy, it is clear that aspects of education policy that relate to labour market, and more generally to competitiveness, play an important role in this respect.
This said, it does not follow that subjects such as ancient Greek, Latin, history, archaeology and linguistics are unrelated to the labour market.
Apart from direct employment opportunities in many of these areas, the study of such subjects entails the development and transmission of a range of generic skills, such as analysis and reasoning.
One of the reference texts for the work programme in the recommendation of Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2006 on key competences for lifelong learning, these competences include 'communication in foreign languages and cultural awareness and expression'.
The latter includes an awareness of local, national and European cultural heritage and their place in the world.
Civic competence as defined in the resolution includes knowledge of contemporary events, as well as the main events in transnational, European and world history.
So I think this is a very direct and explicit contribution to the orientation which is asked for and supported by Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, and, I believe, by many other Members of this Parliament.
(EL) Commissioner, thank you for your answer.
You have assured me of your continued interest.
How much of the funding is being allocated for the promotion of the 'Education and Training 2010' programme, however?
You are the Commissioner responsible for Culture.
What part of the research from the 7th programme is to be used in the areas you have mentioned - that is, in furthering knowledge in the fields of language, culture, history and linguistics?
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, in 2000, the millennium year, 17.6% of the population aged between 18 and 24 had not gone beyond lower secondary education.
By last year, 2006, the level had fallen to 15.3%.
Six new Member States had already beaten our 2010 benchmark, which is 10%.
Under Article 149, as I previously mentioned, this is the full responsibility of Member States.
The content and organisation of education is the competence of Member States.
Our role is to support and supplement the action of Member States.
We have done this in a number of ways. I will mention just some.
In particular, the Commission has supported the development of the evidence base on which policy measures can be built, sponsoring a number of studies around this problem.
Further, last year, in our 2006 communication on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems, the Commission stressed the importance of pre-primary, pre-school, education as an effective means to reduce school drop-out rates, and pointed to the dangers of tracking pupils too early.
The Commission has also launched a public consultation process quite recently on the modernisation of school education.
This includes seeking the views of stakeholders on how best to tackle early school-leaving.
In the framework of the analysis of the Lisbon national reforms programme, the Commission issued specific recommendations to Member States about early school-leaving, where it was deemed necessary.
Through the education training 2010 work programme, it has used the open method of coordination to develop good practice and peer learning on early school-leaving.
Member States have also been encouraged to make use of the Structural Funds for targeted interventions to tackle particularly high rates of early school-leaving and to participate in projects funded under the lifelong learning programme, which addresses this issue.
In conclusion, progress has been visible and measurable, but not yet enough, and we need to really continue and improve the dynamics.
(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your answer.
Even if education is the Member States' responsibility, the Commission should involve itself in ensuring the future of the European Union.
Recommendations are part of soft law.
The European Commission has to explicitly request the Member States to develop action plans for fighting against school drop out.
The European Union needs skilled human resources.
It is unacceptable that young people originating from poor families or from a rural environment are obliged to leave school because of their financial situation.
The EU population is growing old and in order to ensure the sustainability of the social welfare schemes increasing work productivity is necessary.
Here is my question: Commissioner, what are the measures you are taking in order to support Member States to financially assist those children who deserve to continue their studies, especially those originating from poor families or from a rural environment?
This is really a problem and we are talking about the future of Europe.
Member of the Commission. - This could be a long answer but, in short, we try to cooperate, pool resources and policies in order to promote better conditions for young people.
Tomorrow, for example, the Commission is going to adopt a written procedure - a policy paper on youth employment.
We believe that youth is our future and the future starts now.
We encourage especially the new Member States to use more structural funds for the support of educational policies for mobility.
Of course, in saying that Member States' basic responsibility is the system and the content, we believe that quality or efficiency and equity followed by Member States could deliver more concrete and better answers for our citizens, including the young.
I am sure the investment in human resources, especially via education and training, is the most valuable and efficient investment in society's cohesion and future competitiveness.
I say that not only as the Commissioner responsible for these areas, but also as a politician and a father.
So we do not doubt that we need to do more together.
You referred to the Structural Funds several times.
What can you, as Commissioner, do to encourage countries to use those funds for their people, for social programmes etc.?
Certainly, in Ireland, I know that the bulk of those funds were used for roads and for big infrastructure projects.
Virtually nothing was spent on people.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this is the question on EIT private sector funding.
We believe that public and private partnerships are instrumental in driving information in the knowledge-based economy.
If not, we do not succeed.
The private sector provides not only additional financial resources but, more importantly, can bring about changes in the strategic direction of innovation.
So I would say it is not so much about money itself, but the way we cooperate, how we put together partners and interests.
Many EU countries have taken action to facilitate structural relations between the public and private sector with a view to promoting knowledge transfers between universities and industry.
In this context, the activities of the EIT and, notably, knowledge and innovation communities will be implemented through innovative public-private structure partnerships and financed through a variety of public-private sources.
The precise arrangements for their funding cannot be determined in advance and will clearly evolve over time, but the objective is to maximise the share of contributions from the private sector.
The Community contribution, which was agreed at EUR 308 million for the next Financial Perspective, is intended to act as a catalyst to draw forth resources from the private sector.
The Commission has been particularly attentive in seeking to facilitate and attract private sector participation in the financing of the EIT and knowledge innovation communities (KICs).
For example, a key criterion for the selection of the KICs will be their capacity to ensure long-term and sustainable financing, including a substantial contribution from the private sector.
It will be important for the governing board to identify fields for potential KICs that will attract the interest of a wide range of participants, including those in the private sector.
Moreover, the EIT will be empowered to establish an EIT foundation with the specific objective of mobilising and leveraging resources from both individual and corporate donors.
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, it has been said that private funding would also come from the United States of America and Microsoft has been mentioned as an EIT sponsor.
