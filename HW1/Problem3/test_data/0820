In addition to this, I want to mention just two things.
First, the debate on the Treaty shows the importance of increased resources and a long-term perspective in the EU efforts in respect of communication, dialogue and democratic development.
I then tried to make some adjustments to the allocation of quotas in this area by the Committee on Budgets.
I hope that we are now all agreed on more aggressive investment.
Secondly, I want to mention the pilot project that I myself have initiated.
It relates to support for the reconstruction of cultural and religious institutions and monuments in conflict-affected areas.
The proposal concerns, first of all, the Balkans, but in the long term it should also be possible to use the experience gained from that in other areas where destroyed museums, and razed churches and mosques, can constitute a cause of conflict which the EU can help to remove.
Such areas could be, for example, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq, and perhaps even Tibet.
In this area I appeal for the Members' understanding and support.
Thank you.
(FI) Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr ItÃ€lÃ€.
I know both men and I also know that they are in favour of openness and transparency and are keen to structure the European Union's economy on a sustainable basis, as is only appropriate.
It is good to keep a tight rein on expenditure and acknowledge the demands of common sense.
I would like briefly to focus attention on a few issues, the first of which is research and innovation.
Although I know that this is largely in the hands of the Member States, all the same, the European Union needs to remember its own commitments, the Lisbon Strategy, for example, and it has to keep to them, so that we can channel budget money into research and innovation, creating new added value for Europe.
I am delighted with this emphasis on the Baltic Sea.
I believe it has largely emerged on account of the rapporteurs.
It is good to realise what a state the Baltic is in and these two pilot projects are a good start.
It is true that we need considerably more input, but this is a good place to begin.
Thirdly, when drafting the budget it is important to remember the principles of sustainable development and the Union's values.
This must be the way to act, for example, when we send money to third countries, and we are involved in various projects such as the Palestinian Autonomous Area.
We need to ensure that resources are used properly and that they do not result in work which runs counter to democracy, human rights and freedom of speech, that is, the Union's values.
The way in which money is spent and the Union's values must always go hand in hand.
(RO) At the beginning of this year, we planned to negotiate together with the Council a pragmatic and efficient budget of results, which would achieve the policies now necessary in the European Union.
By our amendments in the Committee on Budgets, we have made severe cut-backs in the programmes consuming the tax payers' money without any real value added.
The cut-backs in agriculture, amounting to 553,000,000 euros, namely 77% of all the cut-backs operated, reveal another clear agenda of the Council to gradually eliminate this policy that the entire structure of the new Member States' economy depends on.
I am glad that, in the Committee on Budgets, we have managed to reestablish the level of the funds designated to agriculture.
I also hope that the operational programmes and the rural development programme will be approved as soon as possible by the European Commission.
Besides these aspects, I would like to speak about the importance of the budget for the European Union's youth policy.
The budget we have proposed operates a 9% increase in finances for lifelong learning programmes, reaching a total amount of 900,000,000 euros.
These programmes have contributed to advancing the European idea more than anything else.
90% of young people identify the European Union with the possibility to travel, to study and to work anywhere in Europe.
For these young people, we have to do more.
One of the problems they deal with is the small number of European scholarships, especially as regards the Erasmus programme.
In the current budget, we have increased payments by 100,000,000 euros due to the European Union's enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria.
Nevertheless, we have to make sure that a bigger share of this money reaches every student.
Erasmus should not be an additional income for young students but, on the contrary, the main support for those with low financial possibilities.
Last, but not least, I would like to remind the Commission of the commitments undertaken in the trialogue of July, namely to ensure an adequate number of jobs for the new Member States.
At present, very few Romanians or Bulgarians work in management positions and, on the contrary, many of them work under temporary contracts.
The additional funds we have provided to the European Union's Selection Office should be spent efficiently for the employment of permanent personnel for the new Member States as soon as possible.
(BG) It is a challenge for a representative of Bulgaria, one of the newest EU Member States, to take part in the adoption of the 2008 budget as a full member.
This has become possible thanks to the enlargement policy pursued by the European Union and supported also through its budgetary policy.
I support the report and congratulate the rapporteurs and coordinators on the agreement they have reached with regard to the budget and its changes.
The draft 2008 budget, in its Sustainable Growth part, makes it possible even for the newest EU Member States to achieve the goals facing them in connection with their membership.
The operational programmes within the framework of the Structural Funds ensure high quality and qualifications of human resources, competitiveness, improvement of the infrastructure, strengthening of the administrative capacity in transport, the environment, etc. Regrettably, the available resources are less than what is needed.
I wish to express my support also for the strategic increase of payments to the Structural Funds, the Social and Cohesion Funds, because this will enable them to expand the operational programmes and their capabilities.
I support also the 30-percent reserve for the administrative expenditures line because I believe this is a way to ensure efficiency of expenditures and control over spending.
The draft 2008 budget pays attention also to the new regions that have joined the EU.
In the Black Sea Region, these are Bulgaria and Romania which are also borders of the European Union.
The policy of the EU and the national governments is aimed at transforming the region into an area of security, stability and goodneighbourliness.
The region needs improvement of the infrastructure, more investment, and adequate measures to protect the environment because of its high industrialisation and its transformation into a transfer zone for raw materials in the energy sector.
The European Union with its policy and financing should guarantee both the environmental security and the stability and security of energy supplies to Europe..
The Black Sea Monitoring and the Framework Programme for the Black Sea Development is a pilot project which I am confident that the European Parliament will support; it is a right step towards good development of the Black Sea region and towards integration of the citizens of the Black Sea region into the EU membership policy.
(LT) I would like to speak about the impact of the EU budget on the wellbeing of the ordinary citizens of Europe, some of whom are following our debates today.
Very often we hear that the European Union must develop into the world's most competitive economy, and the budget can facilitate that.
However, it should be restructured in order to be more efficient and should encourage scientific research and innovation.
Regrettably, in reality it appears that the European Commission does not even have a definition of what constitutes scientific research.
Various projects have different expenditures set to be financed according to the research and innovation programme.
We constantly speak about Europe and its influence in the world.
The 27-strong newly enlarged European Union is capable of making changes on a world scale.
The budget allows substantial funding for aid for third countries.
However, according to the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors, the funds are very often used inefficiently.
The reason for this is because most of the countries to which we give our aid are governed by non-democratic regimes.
Human rights are being abused and aid projects help a handful of people to get richer rather than improve the wellbeing of ordinary people.
I would therefore like to urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure that we adhere to the condition defined in our documents, in particular that aid programmes should be allocated in line with the promotion of democracy and human rights.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, thank you to the whole budget team for their good work.
Please allow me a few remarks from the point of view of the Committee on Regional Development.
In its estimates, the Commission evaluated the need for finance and, in harmony with the threshold values of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the terms of the financial perspective, took into account the likely applications for the current period.
Thus, logically, the commitments within the framework of the Structural Funds for 2008 increase by 0.9%, and payments by 3.2%, while monies for the Cohesion Fund increase by 14.4% for commitments and 36% for payments.
Since the Commission is, in fact, the only institution that has unrestricted access to the required information in connection with overall financial requirement, our Committee was guided by the Commission's proposal and also unanimously and immediately corrected unjustified amendments undertaken by the Council in its draft budget.
Above and beyond our amendments, we also simplified the administration and made the use of the funds more efficient, particularly against a background of the Lisbon and GÃ¶teborg goals.
We focused on the unique status of small and medium-sized enterprises and traditional small business activities such as research and development.
Not least, we considered it important to make special mention of the JEREMIE and JESSICA initiatives, to mention but two of the many key points in regional policy.
We also support the Commission in facing the future demographic challenges in Europe, particularly that in some regions and even in entire Member States, population ageing has become a major problem due to declining birth rates.
Family values must be promoted, for example by helping young women to balance family and career responsibilities.
This is forward-looking policy, which must also be reflected in the key areas of regional policy.
(NL) Mr President, a Europe anchored in solidarity: that is what we want.
The 2008 budget contains some new elements that further demonstrate this.
A more modern budget is also needed, however: one that is in keeping with the knowledge-based economy - and anchored in solidarity.
At the initiative of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, more financial assistance is to be provided to Palestine and Kosovo.
This is essential, however complex.
There are other issues, too, where Europe must show solidarity.
Support is needed for the Global Health Fund and for my initiative to reinforce sexual and reproductive health and rights in poor countries, examples being the reduction of maternal mortality and the right to an abortion.
This supports the emancipation of women, thus aiding the development of poor countries.
Solidarity is also relevant when it comes to the reorganisation of the EU budget.
The best way of doing this, of course, is to reduce agricultural subsidies, which is eminently feasible now that prices are high.
Europe must invest in new technology, and Galileo has shown that there is room for another budget.
We can live with lower agricultural subsidies, whilst Galileo stands for increased employment and innovation.
(SV) Thank you Mr President.
The adoption of the budget each year is one of the most important duties we MEPs have.
It is one of the few opportunities we have to send a very clear, collective message about what kind of EU we in Parliament want to see.
Generally, I think that it is good that an increasing number of my fellow Members here in the Chamber seem to see the importance of holding back EU funds, but there is still much to be done.
I think that it is important for us to set the right priorities in the budget, but the work on monitoring the money and its use is as important as budgeting for the right purposes.
If we are doing it today, I think that unfortunately in many areas we are seeing that some of our money almost does more harm than good.
In addition, the institutions must develop the EU's accounting system so that it is easier to understand and monitor the money, so that we can see both beforehand and afterwards how it is actually spent.
It is a question of transparency.
Personally, I would hope that the 2008 EU budget would signal more clearly an EU that prioritises, an EU that focuses on its core task - to create free movement of goods, services, persons and capital.
But unfortunately this year's draft budget leaves much to be desired in this respect.
Let me just take a few brief examples: grants for silkworm breeding, bee-keeping, cotton farming, energy crops, figs, hemp, nuts, olive groves, rice cultivation, and tobacco.
Export subsidies for cereals, sugar and products from the wine sector.
Altogether, these budget headings amount to more than EUR 1 858 436 000.
Aside from the fact that the budget headings, in my view, are an incredible waste of European taxpayers' money, they are doing more harm than good.
They affect people outside the Union.
Nevertheless, one of the most serious examples is, I think, the EU's export assistance for agriculture, where the EU subsidises its own agriculture sector and thereby dumps goods and prices on the markets of poor countries.
This invalidates the poor countries' natural competitive advantages and is a serious obstacle on their path to prosperity.
We have to do something about this, not in 2013 but next year.
Thank you.
(EL) Mr President, first of all let me congratulate the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, who have today presented in this Chamber with a budget with clear political targets and a well defined ceiling of 0.98% of GDP.
Allow me to stress just two points relevant to both this Chamber and all countries.
The European Parliament emphasises in paragraph 24 of its resolution the need for the Commission to approve as quickly as possible the national operational plans of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and of the Structural Funds.
Correct timing is particularly important, especially after the recent widespread natural disasters in southern European countries, particularly in Greece, where the resources to rectify the damage done have to be speedily provided.
My second point is about the recent crisis in cereals prices, which have caused an upheaval in the cereals market and have upset agricultural revenue.
This has led to an evident saving of resources in the Community budget.
Let me point out, however, that under no circumstances should these savings be made available for other policies; they must stay within the CAP framework and be used to manage crises in the agricultural sector, for example.
Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets recommends for the first reading in the Plenary a 2008 budget of EUR 129.6 billion for commitments and EUR 124.2 billion for payments, with strict observance of all our agreements and commitments, both from the multi-annual programmes and the financial perspective and, I might add, well below the ceilings that we agreed in this multi-year plan, in a spirit of budgetary discipline and, at the same time, linked with an offer to the Council to resolve current issues such as Galileo and the financing of foreign and security policy sustainably.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr ItÃ€lÃ€ and Mr Virrankoski, who, together with the coordinators and staff, did an excellent job preparing for the first reading.
Firstly, the Parliament budget.
Between the vote by the Committee on Budgets and the vote in the Plenary, a process of conciliation has been under way in consultation with the Bureau of this House, with close involvement by the administration.
As part of this process, we were able to resolve several contradictory positions judiciously and satisfactorily.
However, I would like to add at this point that a Bureau and an administration must be willing to face questions and criticism from the Committee on Budgets, as that is part of our task.
Part of the conflict that we discuss every year was able to be resolved by creating a deadline of two to three weeks between presentation of the administrative proposal on the Parliament budget and the decision by the Bureau, to enable the Groups to be listened to more closely at the beginning of the process rather than at the end of the procedure.
Commissioner, in your letter dated 17 October, you again laid out the implementation of the budget as at the end of September.
You showed where it was working well and where it was running into difficulty, where some programmes had possibly been implemented too late, and where the Commission itself had practised a little too much micromanagement regarding other questions for the Member States.
However, overall, the report showed implementation has improved since the May report.
If the Commission now wishes to remain credible, it can no longer claim late implementation or other difficulties for 2008 to justify being in arrears with payments or commitments in the implementation of the 2008 budget.
Today we can say that, with the agreement between the institutions on the agencies - starting with the German Presidency and concluded by the Portuguese Presidency - and thanks to the exceptional work done by our permanent rapporteur Jutta Haug, the development of the agencies has been firmly re-established so that, in future, no agencies will be set up without adequate cost-benefit analyses and without clarifying whether they add any value.
Therefore this must be continued in the code of conduct that is being agreed for the executive agencies.
At this point, Commissioner, I must also say that this year, we dealt very circumspectly with the Commission's administration budget, but that does not have to be the case every year.
However, the continued assessment of staff positions, screening, development - prudently and without exaggeration, but carried out very transparently - those stay on the agenda for us.
Mr President, we have taken a very clear position on Galileo.
When we talked about the Reform Treaty this morning and gave it solid support, then in future that will be called the Community method.
If Member States believe they can rely on a hodgepodge of financing or on financing outside the Community budget then, in the light of this development in Europe, that is simply absurd and does not make sense.
In my second point I would like to speak about the financing of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
Without Parliament, the CFSP would already be bankrupt, for we would have to front up with approximately EUR 90 million, according to the Decision of the Heads of State or Government in December 2005.
When I now hear that we may have to go well beyond what the Council and the Commission put forward to us, with Palestine and Kosovo to be added as well, then we are prepared to find a way through.
Obviously we will also have to talk about the flexibility instrument, on the basis of the vote.
This also applies to further acknowledgement of Parliament's interests, as expressly - and correctly - called for by the Committee on Development.
The Presidency must realise that, with the exception of Galileo and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, everything can be decided by Parliament on its own.
Therefore my urgent recommendation: the Council needs to get a sufficient mandate so that we can put both Galileo and the Foreign and Security Policy on a firm footing - hopefully not only for 2008.
If this is not achieved, then we are all going to have to have further sittings during the 2008 budget.
The door is open for all negotiations, but we expect a clear signal from the Council that it is taking action on these two key questions.
Either way, from the point of view of this Parliament, there will be a 2008 budget.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 25 October 2007.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - We must demonstrate to the European taxpayer that the EU's budget is value for money and represents sound financial management.
Therefore, the EP's continued monthly commute to Strasbourg totally contradicts this, especially with our focus on climate change.
Whilst I welcome the comments in the ItÃ€lÃ€ report on greener use of transport, these hardly tackle the scale of the problem.
We urgently need to act as pioneers and set a real example.
On the Virrankoski report, I am disappointed by the level of funding for poverty reduction programmes to the poorest regions, including Asia.
If the EU is to have credibility as a global power it needs to put its money where its mouth is.
Whilst I welcome the support for Palestine and Afghanistan, in the case of the latter, the EU strategy needs greater collaboration with neighbouring countries India and Pakistan to achieve long-term success.
Furthermore I regret the proposed reduction to CFSP funding, especially in Kosovo.
This should not be delayed or underfunded.
Finally, I support the emphasis on the Lisbon Agenda creating jobs and increasing skills.
These initiatives will really bring added value from the EU to the people I represent in the West Midlands.
(The sitting was temporarily suspended)
Membership of Parliament: see Minutes
Commission Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0318/07).
We wanted today, and I think some colleagues are aware of this, to try a little experiment in order to make Question Time a little more friendly and interactive.
I would therefore invite all Members of this House to come forward to the front row of seating so that we can be a little more friendly amongst ourselves and the Commission.
Please, come forward to the front seats rather than sitting right at the back.
I can see that some of you are still shy.
Come on, it should be fun to have an experiment!
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
First part
Subject: Child abduction
In the light of the number of cases of child abduction and disappearances, what measures is the Commission proposing to coordinate Member States' means of preventing and punishing these types of acts throughout the European Union?
Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission fully agrees on the importance of combating the disappearance and abduction of minors.
Enhancing children's rights, as you all know very well, is one of my personal priorities.
The first action undertaken by the European Commission in relation to this was to support, in 2001, the creation of a European network of organisations, the European Federation on Missing and Sexually Exploited Children, which is now called Missing Children Europe.
To date, we have 21 organisations in 15 Member States.
Then, with the financial backing of our Community programme, the Daphne Programme, several centres were created or revamped from 2001 to 2005, with the aid of Child Focus.
Several Member States have, over the last 10 years, set up emergency call lines in order to speed up searches and support families of missing children.
Cases of missing children and abduction can quickly become, and still become, cross-border phenomena.
We therefore propose to have a single telephone number for urgent calls about missing children.
To that end, the Decision of 15 February 2007 on reserving the national numbering range beginning with '116' for harmonised numbers for harmonised services of social value will be implemented.
This is an important decision by each Member State, particularly in relation to the 116000 number for hotlines to report missing children.
You know that putting in place the services corresponding to a 116 number remains the responsibility of Member States.
There, unfortunately, I have to say that three Member States have not yet responded.
Legal measures have been taken by 17 Member States.
There have been calls for candidates for the management of the hotline numbers in 12 Member States, and only four Member States have so far chosen service providers: Belgium, Denmark, Greece and Portugal.
So I am not at all satisfied at the state of play in implementation of the decision taken in February 2007.
In addition to these emergency phone numbers, a mechanism of assistance in the search for missing children is necessary.
Several systems already exist and can serve as an inspiration for a Europe-wide action.
You know about the American system, 'Amber Alert', the French 'Alerte enlÃšvement' and the Greek 'Amber Alert Hellas' system, which are already in place.
We support Member States in putting similar mechanisms in place nationally.
Provided that all Member States adopt such mechanisms and that interconnection schemes are put in place, resolving cross-border cases would be possible and easier.
To that end, we have drafted guidelines describing our idea for a Europe-wide child alert mechanism.
The issue was discussed for the first time at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council on 1 October 2007.
Finally, we support the creation of an international database of child abuse images, which will be a new tool to help identify victims and criminals.
The feasibility study and implementation phase are funded by the AGIS programme and, since September 2005, this database used by Interpol is funded mainly by G8 governments and private companies.
So far this database has made it possible to locate and arrest several criminals in Europe and outside Europe, most recently a very well-known paedophile in Thailand, and save victims.
- (ES) Madam President, thank you very much for enabling us to be face to face with the Commissioner, whom I have already asked many questions on similar matters.
The issue of missing children is a distressing one.
For example, in my islands alone, the Canaries, three children have disappeared in recent years without a trace, meaning that they have not even appeared in paedophile networks.
They disappear completely, which leads us to wonder whether these children are used for certain purposes such as, for example, trade in organs, and whether mafia organisations with possible international connections are operating within the European Union.
This makes me think that this is a matter that requires an initiative that is somewhat more ambitious than those that the Commission has undertaken so far.
I know that the Commissioner has always been ambitious, but I also invite him to be ambitious in this area, as it is a distressing matter for parents and for society in general, because children are the most precious thing that we have.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Medina, I fully concur with your wishes and I can tell you how dissatisfied I am to see that even when we adopt initiatives, the Member States do not implement them.
The idea of a single telephone number in Europe for urgent calls should have been specifically implemented by each Member State by the end of September.
This is now the end of October, and only four Member States have a functioning system; the other 17 have adopted initiatives but are still lagging behind.
The other proposal that we want to make is for closer cooperation to monitor what is commonly referred to as 'sex tourism'.
Unfortunately many European citizens apparently travel as tourists to other parts of the world to commit horrible acts of paedophilia, and in this area I agree that international collaboration must be stepped up.
I agree with you - and sadly we have proof - that missing children are often used for organ trafficking.
Unfortunately this applies not only to my own region, but to other regions very close to the European Union, such as the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the Black Sea.
Unfortunately, organ trafficking is a reality, not to mention the discovery of organ trafficking of adults and children from the Far East and South-east Asia.
Obviously, even though this is an area which until now national governments have not been willing to hand over to the EU, it may soon be handled more effectively by the European Union, partly as a result of the adoption of the agreement on the new institutional treaty.
(EL) Madam President, may I ask the Commissioner if it is certain that in all Member States births of children are being declared?
Is the number of children crossing the borders of the EU being recorded, so that their possible disappearance or the use of their organs can be made known?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Yes, you are right.
We have discovered cases of children not yet registered at border crossings, and that is why I attach great importance to identification.
Identification means helping the countries of origin, either within the EU - though I do not think that is the case - or especially in neighbouring and partner countries, where there is sometimes a lack of control regarding registers, and where children who are not yet registered, or not registered at all, are a matter of particular concern to me.
That is precisely why we have decided to aid strategic projects to help and strengthen the civil registry capabilities of partner and neighbour countries, partly through European funding programmes.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in your examples, you specifically mentioned that four Member States had set up emergency call lines.
There have been other issues - I remember the situation with the tsunami at that time - in which those who came into this area, for example to indulge their inclination for paedophilia, were protected by data protection and their relatives and the authorities were unaware who was really affected here.
Is it not time to stop pussyfooting around and start naming these Member States?
'Naming and shaming' would be a suitable method of prompting these Member States to do what they should, so that they finally demonstrate better behaviour.
Vice-President of the Commission. - I have already said that I am not at all satisfied with the level of implementation and, so far, only four Member States have implemented this decision.
This decision now has to be implemented by all the Member States.
The fact that only four Member States so far are implementing a decision unanimously taken in February 2007 shows that we have to do much more.
Concerning the right balance between protecting the confidentiality of data, or the protection of privacy of data, and the fight against paedophilia, when we talk about paedophiles and crimes and the abuse of children, from my personal point of view I am on the side of the victims - the children - and I am not on the side of the criminals.
So, provided that all the guarantees are acknowledged, we should first of all support the victims and parents, not the suspected criminals.
Member of the Commission. - Actually, I had some problems pronouncing it myself.
To begin with, I had hoped it would be eradicated without my having to learn how to pronounce it, but unfortunately it is becoming persistent so we now have to discuss the issue.
First of all, I had the opportunity yesterday, during the one minute speeches, to hear the Honourable Member's intervention on this issue, and I share his concerns.
One could say that, relatively speaking, we have a low number of infections - for example, about 250 in Italy as compared to more than 150 000 on the island of RÃ©union a few years ago.
However, the worrying thing is the trend.
What is actually raising our concerns is the fact that we now have tropical diseases spreading in Europe as a combination of climate change, which of course helps the proliferation and survival of the vector, and at the same time increased mobility, which allows the introduction of the virus via the movement of people coming from the tropics.
It was important for us to take immediate measures.
From the beginning the Italian authorities reacted correctly, rapidly and effectively, so one can now say that the situation is at a much lower level, even though we still have on-going cases.
The first thing the Commission did was to take various measures, using existing instruments or adjusting these to deal with the situation.
First of all we made sure that we offered technical support through the European Centre for Disease Control, once again proving the wise choice of the European Union in establishing such a centre.
We now had to deal with this new threat and new form of challenge.
We adapted our legislation and included vector-borne diseases in the list of diseases to be addressed as a priority.
At the same time we asked Member States - and this is a legal obligation on them - to notify the Commission and other Member States through the early-warning response system.
It is very important to be able to detect cases as soon as possible in order to prevent the spread of the disease.
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), in addition to the case definitions, also produced standard operating procedures and is updating them regularly.
Very importantly, we upgraded and strengthened laboratory capacity in order to detect and identify the chikungunya virus.
We did this through the European Network for Diagnostics of 'Imported' Viral Diseases, which is funded under the public health programme.
Also, through the same programme, we are funding joint activities with Member States to further strengthen preparedness for public health emergencies.
We had the opportunity to discuss in plenary a communication and action plan on generic preparedness, which was adopted in 2005.
The system is in place and we can use it of course, and it has been used, but we will of course adapt it and adjust it to be able to deal with this form of health threat as well.
Information for the public is very important, and is something we also do through the ECDC, both for the areas affected and also for travellers.
Technical guidance documents on the rapid detection of cases of chikungunya fever are in place, as the cornerstone for an effective epidemiological surveillance.
Also, the ECDC has produced a robust package of technical guidance documents: information for health care workers; case definitions for chikungunya fever; and flow charts for identification of cases.
These are available and are currently being used by the competent authorities to facilitate decision-making processes at national level.
We are also dealing immediately with the issue of blood safety, which is an important factor as well, with the cooperation of the national competent authorities.
However, if the situation persists, my services are ready to adopt a new donor-deferral rule for this disease as well.
The new public programme and other instruments will also fund research in addressing many issues related to vector-borne diseases, as we also need to look at the issue of the insects themselves, and of course at global change through projects like Eden, which concerns emerging diseases in a changing European environment.

All this demonstrates how climate change has an immediate effect on health.
In parallel, I should mention that we also have problems in animal health which have developed because of climate change.
The European Commission is planning to adopt a communication next year dealing with that aspect of climate change too.
(SK) Commissioner, thank you for your competent reply and congratulations to the Italian authorities for their appropriate action.
Looking at the whole matter, I find it somewhat strange that no vaccine against the chikungunya virus is available yet, even though, according to some data, up to 1 million people were infected with the virus in Africa.
I understand this to some extent when it comes to bird flu because in that case a virus that can be transmitted has not been isolated yet and therefore we cannot develop a vaccine.
However, in this case we seem to have a virus that can be identified by serologic and other methods, and a serum or vaccine against it could now be developed.
If the virus happened to spread, such a serum or vaccine would be an effective treatment against the chikungunya virus and perhaps also against an even worse infection: dengue fever.
Member of the Commission. - The Commission is fully aware of the scale of the humanitarian needs inside Iraq and its neighbouring countries.
The Commission's response to this crisis is twofold.
Firstly, in order to support the refugees from Iraq and neighbouring countries, the Commission has immediately responded with the financial decision on EUR 6.2 million in humanitarian aid, adopted in May 2007, to address the most urgent needs of the refugees.
That assistance will be further increased to EUR 7 million by the end of 2007.
The Commission has engaged with the governments of Syria and Jordan, which bear most of the burden of the refugee crisis, to develop assistance programmes.
Those governments have clearly indicated that they were not in favour of external humanitarian assistance programmes, implemented via international organisations and NGOs.
They expect the international community to support their national systems, mainly in the fields of education and health, as these systems also benefit Iraqi refugees.
Consequently, the Commission has identified quick impact projects for a total of EUR 37.7 million, for which the Commission is in the process of consulting Member States.
All these actions form the Commission's immediate response to the refugees' most pressing needs.
The Commission realises that they only partially alleviate the enormous suffering and the pressure on the institutions and social fabric of neighbouring countries, and that is why it is currently further developing its response strategy in order to match it with appropriate funding.
Secondly, as far as the situation inside Iraq is concerned, the Commission is supporting the International Committee of the Red Cross with, so far, EUR 4 million, and is currently identifying additional solid and acceptable partners operational in Iraq with a view to increasing its level of assistance.
It has to be acknowledged that while there are significant humanitarian needs, there are also significant impediments to the delivery of humanitarian aid.
These are severe security concerns and problems of access that prevent the Commission and any other donor from allocating funds which are truly commensurate with the level of needs.
There is in fact a dearth of humanitarian partners able to operate and implement programmes inside Iraq that properly address the needs of the most vulnerable people.
Finally, the Commission would like to recall that it is the main financial contributor to the international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq, with a contribution of EUR 123 million. That is, by the way, 46 % of the total contributions to date.
Since 2003, the Commission has committed over EUR 800 million in Iraq.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your clarifications, but may I remind you that Iraqi refugees in Egypt are already estimated to number 200 000; the European Commission is not offering anything for Egypt.
The University of Amman has just conducted a study which estimates that Jordan has more than a million refugees - an absolutely catastrophic macroeconomic impact; the European Commission is not taking any steps to address this.
Even Israel is setting up a quite remarkable medical assistance programme for Iraqi children.
As for Syria, I am not a party to the talks that the Commission has been holding with Syria, but I have often spoken with the Syrian authorities: the fact is that they already have perhaps 2 million more inhabitants.
Today, Madam President, allow me just to remind you of this, today, right now, in Rabiah, on the border between Syria and Iraq, a huge humanitarian disaster is developing: thousands of Iraqis, who heard a rumour that the borders were about to open, have gathered there and cannot enter.
The situation is absolutely tragic and we can no longer ignore what is going on.
I think we all share your concern, but our rules allow half a minute for supplementary questions.
Member of the Commission. - I have already mentioned that the governments, especially the Syrian Government, which the honourable Member referred to, have clearly indicated that they were not in favour of external humanitarian assistance programmes implemented via the international organisations and NGOs.
So the amount of assistance provided reflects the reluctance of the Syrian and Jordanian authorities to let international non-state actors, such as the UN and NGOs, intervene in their respective countries.
Our assistance can only be directed through organisations that are accepted by the local authorities and have sufficient operational capacity.
This imposes a natural limit on what we can do.
We are, however, working on capacity-building programmes and engaging in direct dialogue with the Jordanian and Syrian authorities to strengthen our implementing capacity in these countries.
It should be noted, if I may say so, that the Iraqi Government itself seems very reluctant to assist its neighbours.
The Iraqi Government has repeatedly declared it will allocate USD 25 million to assist Iraqi refugees.
However, although commitments were made at the Sharm el-Sheikh Conference last May and relations were strengthened between Iraqi, Syrian and Jordanian officials, it seems as though Iraq is not cooperating sufficiently.
We therefore have to ask the Iraqi Government to assume at least its financial responsibility for its own citizens.
The lack of coordination among UN agencies in managing humanitarian crises is of high concern.
We note strong competition - and it is awful to say so - between the UN humanitarian agencies, instead of close cooperation.
We hope that the appointment of a new humanitarian coordinator will improve the ability of our UN partners to address the crisis.
(LT) Recently Turkey, a candidate for EU membership, launched military action against Iraqi Kurds in Iraq.
What is your view on this?
What impact could this action have on the situation in Iraq?
Would any aid be required and what is the Commission's opinion on Turkey's action?
Member of the Commission. - That is not an easy question.
The Commission condemns all terrorist attacks as criminal and unjustifiable under any circumstances.
Having said that, we regret the suffering caused by those actions.
Turkey faces continual cross-border terrorist attacks from the PKK, which is on the EU's list of terrorist organisations, as you are aware.
The Commission understands Turkey's need to protect its citizens but we continue to urge Turkey and Iraq to tackle the problem through cooperation between the relevant authorities and by respecting international law.
In this context, the recent bilateral agreement between Turkey and Iraq on the fight against terrorism is a welcome step.
The EU and Turkey have regularly reiterated that they remain committed to the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.
We expect Turkey to continue to play a constructive role in order to reach those objectives and promote regional cooperation.
However, let us take into account the pressure from the Turkish public, which is faced with killings of soldiers and civilians in the south-east of the country almost every week.
The Government has to show its willingness and ability to take more effective action.
As many of our Member States know well, it is very difficult to tackle terrorists effectively.
The Turkish authorities are understandably trying to engage the US, Iraqi and Iraq's Kurdish authorities in their efforts.
It is the only way.
The resolution passed in Parliament and the building-up of a credible threat of intervention should be seen as a part of that strategy.
Vice-President of the Commission. - It has been drawn to the attention of the honourable Member that the detailed answers provided below relate only to the Commission, which is of course by far the major employer amongst European institutions.
One of the purposes of Directive 1999/70/EC concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work is to establish a framework to prevent the abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships.
To prevent abuse, clause 5(1) obliges Member States, where there are no actual legal measures to prevent abuse, to introduce one or more of the following measures to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term contracts:
objective reasons justifying the renewal of such contracts and relationships;
the maximum total duration of fixed-term contracts or relationships;
the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships.
The rules governing the employment of staff in the European Institutions are laid down in the Staff Regulations, which were discussed with staff representatives before being adopted by the Council.
The European Institutions are thus bound by law to respect the provisions of these Staff Regulations.
The Staff Regulations allow the European Institutions to recruit three main types of staff: permanent officials, temporary agents and contract agents.
Temporary agents and permanent officials occupy a post in the establishment plan.
There is no limit to the level of responsibility which permanent officials and temporary agents can exercise.
The situation for contract agents is different.
They do not occupy a post in the establishment plan and they must work under the supervision of a permanent official or a temporary agent.
There are two distinct categories of contract agents. One category of contract agent was created to perform tasks which are non-core and which do not necessarily need to be performed by an official.
Such contract agents can be offered permanent contracts so their tasks can be considered as permanent in nature.
The spirit of Directive 1999/70/EC is followed for such staff as they are generally offered a first contract for a fixed term, an extension for a fixed term and a third contract for an indefinite period.
In some cases a permanent contract can be offered directly upon recruitment.
There are currently around 2 300 such contract agents working for the Commission around the world, mainly in delegations, representations and administrative offices.
A second category of contract agents exists to cover temporary or specialist needs not covered by existing posts, and to substitute staff temporarily absent, among others on maternity or parental leave.
By limiting to three years the maximum total duration of successive, fixed-term employment contracts in any one institution, the staff regulations give de facto effect to clause 5(1)(b).
Such contract agents represent approximately 15% of the total staff.
It is clear that permanent officials are the mainstay of the Commission staff.
Contract agents provide valuable support on a temporary basis to the work of Commission officials.
There are currently around 3 200 such contract agents working for the Commission in its different sites.
(EL) Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
May I also ask him whether in the case of contract agents, or auxiliary staff as they were once known, the previous years of employment will count as years of service?
If this is so, do their previous years of service count for more in a competition for a job than the qualifications of other applicants who have succeeded in the competition but as yet remain unappointed?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Of course, the contract agents' relationship with the employer is based on the contract which, at the same time, must be in accordance with laws and the labour market in these places, so there is no seniority system as we have in the case of permanent officials.
Therefore, this is a contract which is based on the conditions on the labour market and we have successfully recruited a lot of good contract agents.
(DE) Commissioner, I am sure you understand that the way the staffing of the European Union develops in future is a great challenge for us.
Therefore it is very important to Parliament that we are told not only the number of employees and recruitment offices - for I believe you have described these employees as full-time equivalents - but also the exact amounts that are planned for each of the categories and how they are distributed between the countries.
Could you provide us with those statistics?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Pension rights and the pension system are, of course, one of the most complicated things in all Europe.
First of all, it should be mentioned that the 2007 budget provides for 23 198 posts for the Commission.
This question contains two sub-questions: on the action taken by the Commission in terms of recruitment in order to limit the implications of the growing number of EU officials on the budget and on the impact of the growing number of EU officials on pension costs.
For the first sub-question, it must be recalled that the reform of the Staff Regulations was put in place in 2004, inter alia, in order to curtail budgetary costs linked to the increase in institution staff.
The new career and promotion structure and the new staff category of contractual agents were introduced with a view to having a positive impact on the budget.
On the other hand, the honourable Member might be aware that, during the 2007 budgetary procedure, the European Parliament asked the Commission to carry out a substantive screening exercise providing a mid-term evaluation of its staff needs and a detailed report on the Commission's staffing for support and coordination functions.
The European Parliament also wanted to be informed about the Commission's intentions concerning staff redeployment to address the priorities of the new Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and, more particularly, those policies supported by Parliament during the negotiations.
As a result of the screening of the Commission's human resources carried out at the request of the European Parliament, the Commission confirms the need identified in 2002 and 2005 for additional staff exclusively in relation to enlargement-related tasks: 890 new staff for 2008, broken down as 640 new staff for EU-10 enlargement and 250 posts for EU-2 enlargement.
For 2009, there is a confirmed need for a last wave of 250 posts for EU-2 enlargement.
The Commission endorses the decision to maintain stable staffing once all enlargement-related personnel are integrated, with no requests for new posts for the period 2009-2013.
The Commission commits to meet new staffing needs in key policy areas exclusively through redeployment within and between departments.
The Commission is committed to delivering the highest standards of value for money to the citizens it serves, delivering high quality service through increased efficiency.
The Commission has already shown its commitment to these goals in practice.
Over the period 2000-2007, figures show that the increase of establishment plan posts within the Commission is lower than in the other institutions.
For the second sub-question, it should be noted that the recruitment for the period 2004-2008 due to enlargement will only have an effect on the pension costs in 30 years, meaning that, in the near future, enlargement will have no impact on pension costs.
Nevertheless, the Commission is extremely attentive to the growth of pension costs in the coming years.
In the budget pension costs were expected to increase by 10% in 2008.
This is due to exceptional circumstances.
The higher-than-average increase in 2008 is a normal rebound after the lower-than-average increases for both 2006 and 2007.
There will be the first round of departures of contract agents, whose contribution will have to be transferred to another scheme, and 3% annual expected increase of salaries and pensions.
Even with this exception, we estimate that the growth rate of pensions for the 2007-2013 period is compatible with an 8.5% average increase in expenditure taken into account for the 2007-2013 financial framework.
Concerning the long-term financial effects of the current wave of recruitments, the impact was analysed when preparing the reform of the Staff Regulations.
Measures have been taken to reduce the pension costs and the Staff Regulations require that the pension contribution rate paid by the employees, currently 10.25%, is updated yearly so that it corresponds to one-third of the total contribution required to guarantee the long-term equilibrium of the Community pension schemes.
(NL) Madam President, I am a municipal councillor in a Belgian municipality with 13 000 inhabitants.
The supervisory authority does not approve the budget of this small municipality unless a staffing requirement schedule is supplied, complete with detailed budget.
A 16% increase in the number of officials for some years, as in the EU, would never be authorised; nor would an increase in pension costs of more than 10% in one year.
The Commissioner has pointed to enlargement, but despite that enlargement the number of MEPs has been reduced.
My question is: does the Commissioner not think that it is high time to also consider a freeze on the number of staff, in spite of possible further enlargement?
Vice-President of the Commission. - Yes, but as I said there will be a staff freeze after the enlargement, so this comparison with a municipality is not a similar situation.
We have a big political project - the enlargement of the European Union - and we have taken on new officials.
This has been the same model as during all previous enlargements.
We have been quite successful in recruiting people from new Member States, and this will be frozen. After that, the overall number will be frozen.
Commissioner, they say in Brussels that if you pass all those tests and exams and you are admitted to the European Commission as an official, then you will in any case have a quiet life until your pension.
So I would like to ask about the quality of those who are working in the European Institutions.
Perhaps the Commission has some plans to make the lives of those who are not very industrious more difficult, to have some attestations and to make a clear difference between those who are doing their best and those who have too quiet and easy a life.
Vice-President of the Commission. - I can with pleasure provide you with all the details of our career development system, which is one of the most complicated systems in the world, I must say, and which is a matter for constant debate.
There is a yearly evaluation of every single official.
There is a promotion system which takes account of this evaluation and offers a certain number of points, which, consequently, form the basis for promotion.
This system is quite detailed and developed.
You are right also in asking about the quality of the staff.
Concerning the average open competition or 'concours', there are approximately 42 serious applicants - not to mention other applicants - to each published post.
This is the case during the year, so we have always had a large influx of very good and experienced people, and the recruitment tests are very difficult.
I must say that it is not such an easy life inside the Commission and not so calm and quiet until pensionable age.
However, you are also right to state that most officials will really work a very long time in the Commission, and this can also be considered an advantage for the Commission.
(DE) You have mentioned the staff screening exercise several times today.
One of the results of the staff screening was that the task of 32% of the Commission's staff is to administer the administration, that is, to provide administrative support and coordination.
That is 11 000 people!
Question: when are you going to draw some conclusions from these numbers?
When are you going to produce an action plan for reducing staff numbers?
Vice-President of the Commission. - I am sorry that I cannot answer in Finnish immediately, but we can have further discussions in Finnish.
I am a little afraid of not using the right terminology, which must be so exact in the European Union.
Like the Council, the Commission has concluded an agreement with its staff trade unions, putting a certain amount of human resources at their disposal.
In the case of the Commission, on the basis of the resources agreement of 2001 and annual resources protocols, 12 so-called secondment posts are granted to the trade unions on a permanent basis out of a total of more than 23 000 posts at the Commission.
Such secondments to trade unions, on the basis of their representativity, have been allowed since 1989.
Furthermore, a very limited number of posts are granted on a flexible basis, in particular in order to account for changing majorities after elections.
The staff thus put at the disposal of the trade unions continue to be paid a salary from the EU budget as Commission staff.
In addition, the trade unions receive a budget which allows them to recruit up to nine contractual agents from Function Group II (secretaries).
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, as far as I recall you were a trade union leader in your country and trade union activity must surely be of interest to you on account of your background.
I did not receive a precise answer to my question of how many of these trade union employees presently work for the Commission in total in all the trade unions represented?
I have an additional question relating to this matter.
There is a rumour going around that the Commission would pay its employees a salary during a strike.
Have the unions succeeded in negotiating a solution where if they go on strike they will get paid while it is on?
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FI) I can, in fact, answer the question from my own knowledge of the situation.
There are 12 seconded experts in the Commission's trade union.
In addition, there are 19 positions on the staff committees, which are of course separate bodies.
They may employ a total of nine secretaries.
What you said about strikes is partly true.
It is true that the Commission has agreed a negotiated solution that during a strike officials may be paid some of their salary, but normally not all of it.
For me it is something of a delicate matter that people who are on strike get paid half their salary.
(DE) Commissioner, I would be interested to know how much these functionaries are costing.
What does it cost per year?
Vice-President of the Commission. - The budget for the trade unions is approximately EUR 500 000 per year, which is given from the Community budget.
Can I again remind those Members who have joined us in the interim, we are trying an experiment today and I would ask you to come to the front of the Chamber.
Please do not feel shy, come and fill the front seats rather than sitting right at the back, so that it makes it a closer encounter.
Subject: Total proceeds from fines imposed on businesses under competition rules
Can the Commission indicate the sum total of the fines it has imposed on businesses under European competition rules since the beginning of its current term in office and whether any measures have been taken or whether there have been any consultations within the Commission with a view to reserving this money - less the relevant amounts budgeted - for additional EU activities rather than transferring the extra revenue to the Member States?
Member of the Commission. - Since the beginning of its current term and up to the end of September 2007, the Commission has adopted 21 decisions imposing fines on companies that have infringed the anti-trust rules.
The total fines imposed during that period amount to just over EUR 5.2 billion, 95% of which has been imposed on cartel participants.
However, it should be borne in mind that such fines become part of the European budget only once they are final: that is, if no appeal has been lodged by the undertaking on which a fine has been imposed or when all possible appeals have been rejected by the European courts.
As companies frequently challenge the validity of the Commission decisions imposing fines, a large part of the amount mentioned above is not final, so to speak.
The possible use of the proceeds of fines for additional activities, as suggested by the honourable Member, is prevented by legal constraints.
Such use would run counter to the budgetary principle of universality as set out in Articles 17 to 20 of the current Financial Regulation.
According to that principle, total revenue covers total expenditure without any specific link between a given item of revenue and a given item of expenditure.
The basic objective of anti-trust fines as laid out in the preamble to the 2006 guidelines on the method of setting fines is to ensure deterrence, in other words to discourage companies from behaving illegally.
In time it is to be hoped that the levels of abuse, and hence the number and volume of fines imposed, will decrease as complying levels increase and we are still doing our job properly.
(NL) Thank you for that very interesting information, Commissioner.
I should like to know whether I have understood properly: in view of the Financial Regulation, the majority of that money actually returns to the Member States eventually - is that right?
Secondly, you tell me that - only when it is final - the money also belongs to the EU budget.
Can you tell us how much, approximately, of that large sum of EUR 5 billion can actually be termed 'final'?
Member of the Commission. - (NL) The answer to the first part of the question is a resounding 'yes': it returns to the Member States.
It means that a Member State's contribution to the European budget is assessed as being lower.
Your next question was when is what part final, and that is very hard to say.
It depends in any given year on the circumstances, whether the party concerned was sensible and refrained from appealing, or decided on a rather longer path and tried to get a bit knocked off.
(DE) Commissioner, you mentioned the amounts imposed as fines.
These fines are intended to change the behaviour of the companies upon which they are imposed.
What are your observations in this respect?
In view of the occasion, I remember that when you commenced your role as Commissioner you gave us in the Committee on Regional Development the opportunity to discuss the de minimis rule with you.
You responded very quickly then, for which we are very grateful.
Are companies responding as quickly as you did then?
Member of the Commission. - We hope that is a fact, but I am not 100% sure, and certainly not sure enough to be open and honest with you.
We should take into account that it is not only the level of the fine, but also reputation, that is hopefully making a difference in the attitude of companies.
I find it interesting that now quite a number of CEOs of organisations who contact me mention that they are aware that this is real politics from the Commission, and that those who are not behaving and are abusing the rules and regulations are being confronted with a huge fine.
As you are aware, with our new fine level, that is indeed not sweet money anymore.
Having said that, they are taking the initiative within their own organisations to confront their own people, and saying that it should absolutely not be done any more in their companies.
They are confronting them, if they are not taking the right measures, and saying that if something is rotten then they should mention it to the top, and that the fact is that later on they would be fired without any form of package.
They also mention that damage to reputation, in combination with the fines, is a very important part of their attitude and their struggle to clean up the companies.
A couple of them recently mentioned that they loved to be on the front page of the Financial Times but not because of our fines.
That is indeed quite a good step forward.
(LT) This summer Germany announced its plans to increase food prices.
At the same time Lithuanian producers have made it clear that they intend to increase food prices in the autumn, without giving any objective reasons.
Are you able to envisage cartel agreements involving international food producers?
Food prices are increasing simultaneously in all countries without there being any increase in raw material prices.
Member of the Commission. - The Commission approved the merger of Gaz de France (GDF) and the Suez Group in November 2006, subject to commitments by the parties, which allowed the Commission to conclude that the merger would not significantly impede competition.
The commitments entered into by the merging parties include, most notably, the divesture of Suez shares in Distrigas, the Belgian gas incumbent, which has, as you are aware, also entered the French market, the divesture of GDF shares in the alternative Belgian gas and electricity provider SPE and the abandonment of any control, by law or de facto, Suez has over the Belgian gas transmission network operator Fluxys.
While GDF Suez is allowed to remain a shareholder of Fluxys, specific arrangements will guarantee that the latter is managed in an independent way, and this outcome is entirely consistent with the policy objectives pursued by the Commission regarding the liberalisation of the energy markets in Europe, in particular the package of proposals of September 2007.
The Commission decision on the merger provides that the parties must proceed with the divesture of their ownership, including a partial divesture of participation in Fluxys, and with the other commitments, including those relating to Fluxys governance, within a certain divesture period.
The parties have to fully comply with the commitments in order to legally implement the merger.
In the mean time, the parties have to respect certain obligations, which the Commission will oversee with the assistance of the monitoring trustees.
(NL) Madam President, fortunately I can speak in Dutch.
The Commissioner is aware of Parliament's interest in national champions: the 'level playing field'.
I have two brief supplementary questions.
Is it the case that cross-subsidisation between the production company and the network company is now a thing of the past?
Secondly, did I hear you say that the current proposals also fully accord with the new package you and Commissioner Piebalgs have presented?
Member of the Commission. - The Commission will analyse the planned subsidy to Volvo Cars in Ghent directly on the basis of the EC Treaty, since the matter exceeds the EUR 1 million ceiling laid down in the specific block exemption regulation on training aid.
Article 87 of the Treaty provides that aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, and which does not unduly distort competition, may be considered compatible with the common market.
Training aid can be permitted when it creates incentives for activities which will increase the pool of skilled workers in the European Union and which would not otherwise be undertaken.
That is the case where the training goes beyond what is normally done in the sector concerned; for instance, because more workers are trained or because the training is more extensive.
That was the situation, for instance, in the recent Fiat case.
On the other hand, aid cannot be authorised for training that is an accessory for the good operation of the firm concerned and that would therefore be carried out even without aid.
For instance, when a car assembly plant wants to produce a new model, workers have to be trained on the new techniques and new working methods to be adopted.
Subsidising this type of training simply relieves the company from a cost it would normally bear.
Accordingly, the Commission has in the recent past partially prohibited aid in favour of several assembly plants and you are certainly aware of General Motors in Belgium and Ford Genk.
The proposed eight measures for Volvo Cars Ghent relate to the introduction of a new production platform.
The Commission cannot, at this stage, exclude that the training concerned would take place in any case and therefore would not contribute to increasing the pool of skilled workers in the EU.
Therefore, the Commission has decided to open a formal investigation that is without prejudice to the final decision in the case.
We need more time to find out what it is all about.
The Belgian authorities, the beneficiary, as well as third parties, will have the opportunity to comment and to submit information before a final decision is taken.
(NL) Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
Also, incidentally, congratulations on your victory against Microsoft.
Moving on to what I wanted to say, as I understand it, then, the matter is still being dealt with.
Am I right in thinking that the new interpretation of the rules on State aid for training will also contain sufficient scope for social relevance in training courses ensuring that, if training gives workers more opportunities in the global labour market, this training aid will not be regarded as a major interference in competition?
Member of the Commission. - Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time; it hardly needs restating here.
It is not a trade issue first and foremost, but there are areas where trade can help.
That is why the Commission wants the Doha Round to deliver liberalisation of environmental goods and services and also sees scope for the new generation of free trade agreements to help facilitate sustainable trade.
The Commission is aiming to negotiate an ambitious and comprehensive post-2012 climate framework.
If we succeed in including all major players, we will have gone some way, the furthest we could, to obtaining a level playing field for EU industry.
That also means that the carbon leakage - the displacement of pollution from one place to another - that might otherwise flow from a failure to reach agreement will be avoided.
Our aim is to include all major polluters in a proportionate way and not to frighten away partners from the negotiating table in Bali, and later on, by preparing trade measures for imports at this stage.
We should rather address the free rider issue when, and only if, it actually arises.
A well-designed trade policy can help the world deal with climate change by generating the wealth needed to pay for the mitigation and adaptation measures required.
Investment in trade, in both low-carbon goods and services, can carry skills and climate-friendly technology throughout the global economy, helping to address climate change at global level and in the most cost-efficient manner.
Throwing that away would be doing a disservice to climate change policy.
It should not be forgotten that our approach to climate change policy has helped put European industry at the forefront when it comes to environmental low-carbon technology.
The EU has a considerable first-mover advantage as a result.
The Stern report made clear that combating climate change makes economic sense, in addition to the numerous societal benefits, because the costs involved are lower than the costs of inaction.
Trade policy can support climate change objectives by minimising those costs and generating part of the finance required and by fostering regulatory frameworks that support investment and trade in low-carbon goods, services and technology.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner Mandelson certainly seems to respect the time limit for questions.
He hardly confines himself to formalistic replies.
Today, Commissioner, we adopted the new framework for placing plant protection products on the market.
The entry into force of this framework will have consequences on the primary production of agricultural products and by extension on the European food industry.
Can you confirm to us that imported products are subject to effective checks to see whether they comply with the strict specifications imposed on domestic production?
Member of the Commission. - We are indeed looking at all these aspects.
But I would just reinforce the point I originally made: we want to secure the best, most far-reaching, most inclusive agreement for the post-2012 period that we possibly can.
That requires a great deal of persuasion of our trading partners, the emerging economies, who we need to persuade to buy into and sign up to the post-2012 agreement that we all agree is greatly needed and which needs to have the maximum geographical coverage.
The question we have to ask ourselves is with what tactics we can, or are most likely to, persuade emerging economies to sign up to the agreement that we want to promote.
In our view, it would not only be premature, but it would be counterproductive, to start using a stick or threats or create a scenario in which those who might be inclined to hold back would be somehow punished by some trade measure or other because they fell into the category of free riders.
If the time comes to reflect on such measures, then we would only approach that after considerable reflection and consultation, and, of course, any measure that we were even to contemplate would - and I have to stress this - need to be assessed for its WTO compatibility.
There is no question of the European Union promoting or adopting a measure that is not clearly and firmly WTO-compliant.
(DE) Commissioner, I would like to ask another question.
My colleague Mr Papastamkos is absolutely right when he says that we must think about preventing European companies being disadvantaged if other countries do not participate in whatever follows the Kyoto system.
There are three possibilities: firstly, the European Union could be the only one to commit to continuing.
That would, of course, put companies under financial strain and disadvantage us.
The second potential scenario is that if other countries do not participate, we will not participate either, although we would then be unable to meet the climate goals we have set ourselves.
The third possibility, if the others do not join this 'Kyoto plus' or post-Kyoto system, would be for us to pass appropriate sanctions.
What exactly might these sanctions look like?
Can you imagine specific sanctions?
Member of the Commission. - The Commission appreciates the interest shown by Parliament in a review of the trade defence instruments (TDIs) and reiterates the importance it attaches to the views of Parliament in the context of the current review.
It looks forward to the report by the Committee on International Trade, which it hopes will be completed soon.
On its side, the Commission is finalising its response to the consultation process.
Indeed, the Commission held a preliminary discussion, an orientation debate, before its meeting today on this subject.
Proposals to the Council could be made in the next weeks.
The Commission intends to keep Parliament closely involved and informed on this.
The Commission has, of course, carefully examined all reactions to the Green Paper, of which there are many hundreds.
The intention now is to inform Member States and Parliament of the main reactions and suggestions received, and these will also be published.
They will be discussed by the Commission again before proposals are tabled to the Council, hopefully in the last half of November.
Most stakeholders consulted and submitting their views share the Commission's opinion that TDIs remain essential in a globalising world economy where multilaterally-agreed competition rules are lacking.
Also, the majority of stakeholders do not see the need for a major overhaul of the TDI system. Neither does the Commission.
However, there is also a wish for the rules to be made clearer, as well as for increased transparency and for there to be more efficient application of the instruments.
The claim that the Commission has changed its approach towards the assessment of Community interest in some recent cases is simply not true.
Each case has been examined on the basis of its own technical merits.
Some cases have raised atypical issues, but they have been resolved in line with Community legislation and within the small discretion allowed by that legislation, after thorough discussion with Member States.
Lastly, it is correct that no new anti-dumping investigations were initiated in the first half of 2007.
However, it should be pointed out that anti-dumping investigations are industry-driven and are not initiated by us.
In other words, they are initiated on the basis of complaints from Community industry.
In the first six months of 2007, no complaints meeting the requirements of the law were lodged.
It is not unusual that the number of initiations varies from one year to another, depending on factors such as the business cycle, over-capacity in third countries and diversion of trade as a result of trade defence measures in other world markets.
The number of initiations has also fluctuated in past years.
In 2003, for example, the Commission initiated in total only eight new investigations, the first of which was initiated at the end of May in that year.
Also, the first semester of 2007 followed a period of exceptionally high activity at the end of 2006.
Finally, I would draw your attention to the fact that in September 2007 two new anti-dumping investigations were initiated against imports from China: one for citric acid and another for monosodium glutamate.
(DE) Commissioner, thank you very much for your comments.
Transparency plays an important role in this process.
When are we going to receive the evaluation of the Green Paper survey?
Either there is no evaluation yet, in which case you would have released your paper without an evaluation, or there is an evaluation - I assume that there is - in which case it is high time that it was presented to the public and to Parliament.
Secondly, I am interested to know whether you believe it is really tenable to determine essential matters without amending the basic regulation on the basis of new principles.
Thirdly, why is it that you want to treat 'market' and 'non-market' economies equally?
Fourthly, still talking about Community production, where do you see the percentage threshold for production outside the EU?
Member of the Commission. - The Commission has undertaken a preliminary assessment of the responses to the Green Paper, and that provided the basis for our orientation discussion on the subject today.
That paves the way for an even more rigorous assessment, which will accompany the Commission's consideration and agreement on the proposals that it wishes to submit to Member States on the basis of the review.
I can assure the honourable Member that information about the responses is - already, I believe - posted on the website of DG TRADE, but we shall also publish what is, I hope, an easily accessible version or presentation of the responses we have had to the Green Paper in order to allow good time for reflection on those responses to take place ahead of the submission by the Commission of our proposals.

The honourable Member seems to have alighted already on certain aspects of the Commission's proposals which have not yet been submitted to or agreed to by the Commission, so I suggest, with respect, that he is slightly jumping ahead of himself in some of the assumptions that he appears to be making.
(LT) The question I would like to ask is, obviously, based on my meetings and discussions with the industrialists of the country I represent - Lithuania.
In fact, I can reiterate what my colleague has said: there is a lot of concern about the liberalisation of the trade policy, and also a lot of criticism.
My question is: if the position remains the same, what will be the Commission's reaction?
What measures can the Commission be expected to take?
Would you be inclined to listen to what business representatives have to say, or would you consider other arguments to be more important?
Member of the Commission. - I am not quite sure what the honourable Member means by the 'liberalisation of our trade policy'.
By definition, trade can only take place when markets are opened and trade flows are, in effect, being liberalised.
Trade does not take place behind closed borders or where economies are being converted into fortresses, so of course the Commission seeks to promote the liberalisation of trade.
The Global Europe trade policy review and strategy that was presented and agreed by the Commission and the Member States a year ago sets out very clearly the interests of the European Union, which are to maintain open markets at home, to promote and use multilateral and bilateral negotiations, to open markets abroad and to use effective trade defence measures to tackle unfair trade or unfair competition.
Those are the three legs of our strategy; each is equally important.
The review of the third leg of that tripod is taking place after quite dramatic changes have taken place in the world economy, and indeed in the European economy, since the last review of our trade defence measures took place, which was over 10 years ago.
We have a responsibility to make sure that our measures are operating as well as they could be and that they command consensus and support and solidarity amongst our Member States.
When that weakens, the trade defence measures become less easy or possible to use.
It is in an effort to rebuild and restore that consensus, support and solidarity amongst our Member States that we are undertaking this review.
Commissioner, in order to get to one further question, I am going to take the next two supplementary questions together and ask you to deal with them both together.
(EL) Madam President, in addition to the questions put by my colleague Mr Caspary, let me add my own question about when we will have access to the assessment of the questionnaire on the Green Paper.
Commissioner, European anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures represent less than 0.45% of the value of total imports into the EU.
How, then, is the Commission's haste for unilateral revision of trade defence policy justified?
In which direction is the Commission leaning?
Is it towards politicising the procedure or preventing people from seeking redress against unfair practices?
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to ask a question related to the answers you have been giving.
Parliament does not acknowledge the need to review the trade defence instruments; the public consultation reached the same conclusion.
The Commissioner has not explained to Parliament the point of his proposal and, especially, to what extent his proposals and convictions have changed on the basis of the opinion of the public hearing and the opinion of Parliament.
This is the heart of the issue, because we do not understand the point of persisting with a review of instruments that everyone thinks are useful and are working well.
This, then, is what we need to understand.
Member of the Commission. - I do not quite know what the change of direction is that the honourable Member is referring to; there is no change of direction and, as I have made clear, neither the stakeholders responding to the review nor the Commission takes the view that a fundamental overhaul or fundamental reform is needed.
So, I am not quite sure what she means by a change of direction.
If there was no need for a review, then I think that the Green Paper that we issued would have received far fewer than the 500 responses that came in.
It would seem to indicate that a Green Paper that has over 500 responses indicates interest in a review which has taken place.
In answer to the first question, I can't submit an assessment to this Parliament until it has been undertaken.
The Commission has not yet made its assessment; it has not yet decided on its response.
It had a plenary discussion today and will make its views known when it submits its proposals to the Member States and, at the same time, they will be made known to Parliament, and that will be some time in the second half of November which is not very far away.
As for politicisation - politicisation of these issues is almost inevitable.
When you have European industry now representing different views and competing interests and, frankly, making very different rival submissions as to whether they want trade defence measures adopted, that is bound to be reflected in the positions of our Member States.
If the Member States chose instead simply to take at face value the objective and rigorous analysis of the Commission's services and to adopt the conclusions and the measures we propose; if they were prepared simply to do that, then the politicisation wouldn't arise.
However, the Member States are subject to the same lobbying and different competing interests, amongst producers, retailers, distributors, importers and consumers, as we are.
When people have different views, those views have to be debated very broadly in a political way, through a political process, and that is what happens.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (See Annex).
I am sorry for those who have waited.
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 19.35 and resumed at 21.00)
The rise in foodstuff prices, consumer protection (debate)
The next item is the debate on
an oral question - B6-0321/2007) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by Joseph Daul, Lutz Goepel and Neil Parish, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to the Commission,
an oral question - B6-0377/2007) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the PSE Group to the Commission, and
an oral question - B6-0378/2007) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by Sergio Berlato, Janusz Wojciechowski, Gintaras DidÅŸiokas and Liam Aylward, on behalf of the UEN Group to the Commission.
author. - Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I stand up and talk tonight because we are in a situation now where food security has become a real issue.
For 25 years we have been in a situation where there has been plenty of food in Europe.
In fact, we have been taking many decisions in agriculture, in the common agricultural policy, to restrict production in order to maintain prices and reduce the use of export subsidies and to export products on to the world markets.
Now we are facing a situation that is completely different: cereal prices have risen threefold this year; the livestock sector is having a huge problem, having seen its feed costs going up by perhaps 50% or 60%, and we are extremely concerned about this.
Mr Daul, Mr Goepel and I have tabled this oral question - and we are delighted that Commissioner Fischer Boel is here tonight - because we feel we now have to look at every opportunity for getting extra feed into the European Union.
We will have to face up to the reality that there are some feeds that are derived from GM maize and GM soya which cannot come into the European Union at the moment because they are not licensed.
I think we have to make sure that we look at this and that we have a system by which we can license these products.
Provided they are safe, they should come in to be fed to our poultry, and to our pigs in particular, as well as to our cattle, both beef and dairy, because we need to keep a very competitive industry.
We also have to look at the situation regarding supermarkets, because - do not forget - not only are we concerned at the price that the farmer receives for his or her products, but we are also interested in what the consumer has to pay.
There is no doubt that we are seeing, for instance, that only 10% of a loaf of bread is actually made from the raw material of wheat and yet there are huge increases in the price of the loaf because the supermarkets say they are having to pay so much more for wheat.
So we need to put pressure on the supermarkets to make sure that consumers are paying the right price.
It is great that it puts European agriculture in a very strong position to face up to the brave new world, because we will need food production, we will need farmers and we need the countryside, and all these things work very well.
But, as I say, we now have to get the balance right between the cereal and livestock sectors, and that is why we have tabled this question.
We shall be delighted to hear what Commissioner Fischer Boel has to say about it.
author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, it is a pleasure to see you again here in Parliament.
As you know, we were surprised a few months ago by a change in the situation in the market for some agricultural products, which not long ago we believed to be unthinkable; an enormous pressure on supply, with the consequences that we have been seeing.
This in turn caused a major disturbance in the livestock production sector, foreseeable consequences in the rise of consumer prices and not forgetting the FAO's warning about the consequences for foodstuffs in many areas of the world that could result from this situation.
Let us not forget that while in Europe we spend 10-20% of household incomes on food, there are societies where this item accounts for 90% of income or more, and it is easy to imagine what a price rise would mean to these vast populations that are already so deprived.
Therefore we need to act, and act immediately; and I am very pleased that the Commission has acted swiftly - and well - by taking some palliative measures, reducing the set-aside for 2008 to zero.
It is a shame we did not go further.
There are other measures that could perhaps be adopted without additional cost to the Community budget, such as advance authorisation of payments to certain livestock farmers of the aid they are entitled to, who are of course doubly affected not only by rising prices, but also by having to deal with livestock diseases, such as 'bluetongue', and so I think we could go a little further just now.
However, most of all we must go further in assessing and studying the situation so that we can quickly identify the measures that, in the short term, can be adopted in the immediate future.
We naturally place our trust in the sensitivity of the Commissioner and the Commission in following up this concern of ours.
author. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, throughout Europe we are seeing across-the-board increases in the price of foodstuffs.
Market surveys carried out show how European consumers are radically changing their eating habits, being forced to change the quality and type of products that they buy as a result of the exorbitant prices.
These increases can be blamed on the one hand on the excessive number of intermediate phases that products must go through from the producer to the consumer, and on the other on the disproportionate increases applied by major supermarket chains.
One thing is certain however: the blame for these increases cannot and must not be placed on our farmers, who are the main victims of this worrying situation.
Mr President and Commissioner, we believe that today more than ever, the European agricultural model must be protected in order to shield national agricultural markets from international price fluctuations and give substance to the defence of models of production and use of the territory which are so characteristic of European agriculture.
We welcome the Council's recent decision to ratify the proposal for zero set-aside for 2008.
However, this does not do enough to reassure us about the worrying situation in terms of cereal stocks and the rising price of cereals on the world market.
We also need to work with the various CMOs and make good use of these mechanisms for rebalancing the market, which would help ease food prices, at least in the internal market.
We asked the Commission, in a recent question, to propose an immediate increase in milk quotas of at least 2-3% to help stabilise the price of this staple product.
In a difficult economic climate such as this one, the European Union and the Member States have a responsibility to help consumers maintain their food purchasing power while at the same time protecting our farmers' right to an income.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I recall what I think is an old Japanese curse: 'May you live in interesting times', and I think this is exactly what we are doing now.
We have seen, over the last six to eight months, prices for raw materials within the agricultural sector rocketing, as mentioned already by the speakers, but I have to say that this is happening from an historically low level.
I think this is an important reminder to all of us.
These increases in prices will be reflected on consumer prices but to a lower extent.
If I may use the example of bread, a basic commodity - and I will use a German example - if you take the price of bread in a supermarket or in a store in Germany, only 4% of the price relates to the price of the cost of the wheat.
For the dairy sector, as has been mentioned already, a number of different measures have already been foreseen.
Milk quotas were increased on 1 April 2006 and 1 April 2007 by 0.5% in 11 Member States.
On 1 April 2006, eight new Member States received this restructuring reserve varying from between 2% and 5% of their national quota level.
On 1 April 2008 - next year - another 0.5% will be added to the increase in the quota allocated to 11 Member States.
In addition, all market support aids have been massively reduced and, at the moment, there are no export refunds and no disposal aid at all - zero for both of them.
The market outlook report in the dairy sector will be adopted by the Commission later this year and it will provide us with the basis for a further discussion on whether we need to increase again the quota.
Moreover, I have already had the chance here to signal clearly the expiry of the milk quota system by 31 March 2015, and indicated as well that we needed, for the period from now until 2015, a soft landing for the abolition of the quota system.
Among the possibilities mentioned is to increase the quota system over the period and we will have the possibility to discuss this during the health check next year.
In the cereals sector there are various different reasons for the increase in prices.
I shall just say, just to be sure that there are no misunderstandings, it is not biofuels that are causing the steep increase in prices.
We use, today, less than 2% of cereal production for ethanol in Europe, but the reasons are different: adverse weather conditions in Australia, drought in southern Europe, floods in the northern part of Europe, increasing demand from India and China, and restricted exports out of Russia and Ukraine.
Then, of course, there is the snowball effect from the very strong focus on ethanol in the United States and, therefore, a certain influence on the increase of prices in corn.
The Commission has, as mentioned already, reacted: set-aside is put to zero for the coming production year, for the sowing to take place this autumn and next spring.
Then whether to continue a zero set-aside will be a discussion to be held during the health check.
We expect that the zero set-aside could contribute to somewhere between 10 and 12-15 million tonnes, depending on the climatic conditions.
Moreover, I will submit to the College of Commissioners a proposal to the Council to suspend cereal import duties only for the current market year.
I think that those initiatives will help us to ease the pressure on the livestock farming and the consumer prices.
There are different problems for the pigmeat sector.
The pipelines are filled with meat, so there is an imbalance on the input and output in the sector and therefore the management committee decided last Thursday to introduce a private storage that I hope will help the problems in the pigmeat sector.
There are other possibilities, but I think we should try to find the right balance because, if it is only a question of prolonging the pain, then we gain absolutely nothing.
So, I think that we have reacted and I have had the possibility to thank Parliament for its quick reaction so that we could send clear signals as soon as possible to the farming sector on the zero set-aside.
I would like to come back to the GMO question in my final remarks, as I can see that my time has expired.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would have been happy to share my time with the Commissioner, because I am interested to hear her views on GMOs, but I will be here for the entire debate.
I think it is true, because it is not the first time we have said it in this Chamber, that the unpalatable truth is that the era of relatively cheap food is over and that what has happened was not predicted either within the Commission or, indeed, globally.
The Commissioner has gone through some of the reasons why we now have this imbalance in supply and demand and I agree with her: weather, climate change, the demand from the developing countries and, yes, biofuels are impacting globally - the Commissioner has acknowledged that.
However, it is important to remember - and there were others in this House prior to my time - what your predecessor Mr Fischler said when reforming the CAP in 2003.
He promised farmers better market prices.
Perhaps we are seeing the impact of those reforms now, and we are beginning to question those impacts because of the impact on consumer prices.
We have had positive developments on milk and cereals, but we do not have the same on the livestock sector in terms of the beef and lamb producers, chicken and pigmeat that the Commissioner has discussed.
We are asking the questions now about the volatility and whether we are happy with that volatility in demand and supply.
A major food company said to me recently that the supermarket buyers have no knowledge or interest in the economics of food production, but they are beginning to take note, and that is positive.
However, we need to monitor the power of the supermarkets and to look at whether they are passing on the price increases they are charging to the producers of food.
That is something I would urge the Commission - perhaps the Commissioner for Competition - to take a close look at.
They have refused to do it in the past.
Concerning GMOs, this is a big issue.
There is a problem in relation to the differences of approval methods between the European Union and the US and we need to look at that.
So I wait for the Commissioner's comments on GMOs before making my points in particular.
Lastly, we cannot ignore the impact on the developing world of insecurity, particularly with the grain market, where countries that cannot afford to pay more for food are seeing a massive increase in their food bill.
We must acknowledge it in this House and we need to take it into account in our policies going forward.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during World Food Day on Tuesday 16 October, the FAO wanted to raise public awareness of malnutrition, which currently affects 854 million people throughout the world.
On this occasion, the rising price of agricultural raw materials was highlighted, particularly its impact on consumers in the developing countries - my fellow Members have spoken about this at length - but also on the populations of poor countries, which import cereals.
While in the developed countries, we spend 10 to 20% of our household budget on food, in the least developed countries, this figure is 60 to 80% of the budget, and a 20% increase in the price of cereals is drastic.
This situation is made worse by the fact that some countries depend heavily on imports, and are affected by currency fluctuations, climate variations and increases in transport costs.
Commissioner, you have responded partially, but I hope there will be other measures.
What measures do you intend to take in the short and medium term, for the CAP health check, to put right this difficult situation for consumers in the North, and this even more difficult situation for those in the South, and to contribute to a global food equilibrium?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, it is important that there is now a focus on the very interesting situation that we are currently witnessing in connection with the very marked price increases for a number of agricultural raw materials.
At the same time, we know that in the areas where they have not yet taken effect, namely the pig sector, these price increases will lead to a very expensive winter in terms of food prices.
We are aware of the underlying causes: poor autumn yields, empty corn stores, etc. - I will not go into any more detail about this.
I feel that the situation we are currently experiencing should provide an opportunity for more discussion.
First and foremost, we should not be alarmed at the current price rises.
For far too long a litre of milk has cost less than a litre of cola and less than a litre of water.
It is completely unreasonable of us not to accept that food should cost what it actually ought to cost, because there is a long production time and many working hours behind the products, particularly in the milk sector.
It is also clear that there is now an opportunity to increase the production of foodstuffs in Europe.
The market is in fact demanding this of us.
The Commission has shown good initiative by removing set-aside and of course we still have the opportunity to increase production very quickly, especially in the milk sector.
We should continue the reform of the common agricultural policy from 2003 by reducing support, and we should seriously discuss further transfers of agricultural support to rural development policy.
We now have the opportunity to kick-start dynamic agricultural production in the EU, and this means that we can give farmers more freedom than they have at present to exploit the current strong demand.
Naturally, as is the tradition, we will also take care of farmers in mountainous areas and less fertile regions - that is all that is needed!
However, we must not be afraid of price rises, but instead understand and make offensive use of the situation in which we find ourselves.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, in the European Union we have recently seen a significant rise in the price of basic foodstuffs, particularly in the new Member States.
In Poland, for example, the price of bread has risen by 15% over the last two years, the price of apples by 83% and the price of potatoes by 33%, while the price of milk has almost doubled.
There is a similar trend in some of the old Member States: in Italy and in Ireland.
Of the new Member States, Lithuania too has seen the price of cereals, milk, fruit and vegetables almost double.
On the other hand, EU policy is based on limiting the amount of agricultural production, and this policy is beginning to appear increasingly at odds with the needs of consumers.
All the so-called reforms of the common agricultural policy are based on limiting production within the European Union.
Reform of the market in sugar is a massive limitation of sugar production in the European Union, from 18 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes.
Reform of the market in wine again involves limiting production.
Other reforms also aim at producing less in the European Union.
On the other hand, we have a very important signal.
Consumers are demanding more food in Europe, and this is such a major signal that the entire aim of the common agricultural policy needs to be verified.
We must ask ourselves whether the method of limiting production and setting production quotas is in fact good, above all from the point of view of the interests of consumers, as this is chiefly about them.
This is about Europe supplying as much food as its people require.
There are many signals pointing to a need to review the agricultural policy we have been conducting.
Many thanks.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, this discussion has gone crazy.
We have been talking about falling prices, lowest possible prices and all-time lows for years.
All the speakers who are now bemoaning the fact that prices are rising - finally heading upwards for once - and are calling for measures to hold back the price rises.
We should be happy that the market is functioning, with your help.
With the help of your predecessors, but also of demands made by the European Parliament, the billions of euros that were going into intervention and price stabilisation - the price pressure that ruined market prices on the world market and have caused the countries of the third world to get into difficulty - have been done away with.
Finally this circumstance has been eliminated and we are getting closer to the market, entering a situation that is being exacerbated by the use of corn to produce fuels.
There are many other reasons why such great demand exists on the market at present.
The market reacts, the price goes up and now we, here in the European Parliament, as representatives of the farmers, are asking for prices to be brought down again.
I have never been involved in anything so ridiculous in all my 20 to 25 years in Parliament!
That is why I applauded Mr Busk.
We should be delighted with this situation.
Of course we have to be watchful on behalf of those who cannot afford to buy food at normal prices.
We have to hold unjust wage rates and misguided social policies in any country accountable, but we cannot take measures to put food in the mouths of the poor at the expense of farmers who, in recent years, have left farming in their hundreds of thousands.
This is not the right way to be talking!
I am glad that we can even discuss the situation here today and that we have a market in which prices are finally increasing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important to initiate this discussion, although, partly because of what the Commissioner has told us, we are not seeing the full scale of the problem yet.
I would like to remind the Commissioner that a few months ago, we asked for a moratorium on the discussion of amendments to the CMO in fruit and vegetables in order to pause and reflect on what was happening - and what is happening now in wine - based on a few points, which I would now like to raise.
Firstly: we are talking about harvests that have failed due to climatic events, but there is no mention of the fact that we will be dealing with this problem for years, because climate change is happening in Europe and around the world.
Fact one!
Secondly: compared to 1950, when there were 2.5 billion of us and everyone on the planet had 0.5 hectares each, by 2020 the world's population will have grown to 7.5 billion (according to UN data) with around 0.2 hectares per inhabitant available for cultivation.
I understand where Mr Baringdorf is coming from when he says that this is a fundamental problem, but I do not think that the increases we are seeing at this time are to the advantage of producers.
If we look at the difference between the cost of the product and what consumers are charged, we can see that consumers and producers are paying for a very long supply chain.
However, this is partly due to policies created here in the European Parliament, so I think the Commissioner should look carefully at the actions we are going to be setting out.
Of course, it has been important to return fallow land to production, although today what we need most of all is in-depth discussion.
When the European Community was created, action was taken to meet the food requirements of the European people.
Today, we should adopt the same policy.
We can no longer allow land to be set aside under a decoupling policy, because this leads to a loss of production and renders our questions unproductive.
Therefore, we must prepare for an in-depth discussion on whether the policies of the past few years have delivered a response to consumers and producers, or whether conversely they have created problems for both.
Mr President, I want to focus on the position in the intensive sector.
I will not take time to recount the dire straits in which many producers in that sector find themselves, rather I want to focus on what I believe the Commissioner should be doing to help.
I have four or five points to make.
First of all, I think the Commissioner should recognise that soft measures, like market promotion, are not going to be enough.
Secondly, she should face up, more than has happened to date, to the long-term impact on grain availability and prices of the rampant switch in the United States to biofuel production.
Their targets, which are very aggressive, are in truth drying up the imports that we need in that regard.
Thirdly, with intervention grain stocks at an alarming low and the ratio with usage being totally out of kilter, there urgently needs to be action to address that balance.
Fourthly, I suggest that the Commissioner needs to be more proactive in fighting for speedier approval of GM substitutes.
With respect, Commissioner, you need, on behalf of agriculture, to match the vigour of Commissioners Kyprianou and Dimas as they resist GM approvals.
Fifthly and finally, you need to put a floor in the market for our intensive sector, with export refunds extended immediately to meat and hams.
On that point I am not sure that helping private storage will solve very much in the longer term.
Mr President, let me be first of all assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that I am happy to see prices going up for our farmers at last, so long as it is farmers who benefit, and not supermarket chains.
Up until now the small number of supermarket chains that dominate the retail sector in Europe have been profiteering at the expense of our farmers and producers.
In my constituency in Scotland, dairy producers have for far too long been getting GBP 0.17 per litre for milk, which is below the cost of production, while it was selling on supermarket shelves at over GBP 0.50 per litre.
That has driven many dairy farmers in my constituency out of business altogether.
We have now seen the price farmers receive for wheat go up by only 10 %, while the shelf price in supermarkets of wheat-based products has gone up by 40 %.
Once again, supermarkets are using fluctuations in price to pocket bigger profits for themselves.
That is a disgrace, and I agree entirely with Mr Parish that we should ask the Commission to start an investigation into the pricing policy of supermarket chains in order to ensure that consumers and producers get a fair deal.
(ES) Mr President, it is clear that the rise in prices that consumers are experiencing directly in their shopping baskets is due to multiple factors, but in my speech I am only going to discuss what Mr Stevenson said.
I think that the role of intermediaries and large food retail chains is concerning.
In many cases they respond to speculative movements, so the increases in the prices of final products are greater, as has been said, in percentage terms, than the increases in the prices of raw materials.
The situation is also very concerning for producers who, in the face of the huge purchasing power of the large retail sector, are obliged to reduce their selling prices, without being able to pass on the increases in raw material or fuel prices.
I therefore think, and I support the previous speaker, that it is important for the Commission - and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for being here - to act and take measures: that there should be investigations and the necessary means put in place to bring an end to these practices, which are unfair, and in many cases abusive.
I think that the resolution is very timely, and that we are in time to be able to adopt measures.
(PL) Mr President, many of those who have spoken before me have been pleased that there has been a rise in the price of foodstuffs, but we must ask ourselves whether this price is getting through to the farmer.
I have very serious concerns about this.
Many small farms are currently being closed down in line with the policy of the Commission and the European Union.
We must, however, also ask ourselves what kind of foodstuffs farmers are receiving.
They are getting beef from Brazil, sugar from South America, dodgy chickens from Asia, and thus cheap foods are pouring into our market, which is 'lowering' prices for us, but in fact restricting production in Europe.
The question arises: are we going to have to keep on bowing down to the industrial lobby?
Why, at the end of the day, can we not start supporting European farmers once again, at a time when a niche has appeared for us to increase this production and raise quotas for milk and starches, for example, for which there is a constant demand in Poland and other Eastern European countries.
(EL) Mr President, the problem of bread, milk, potatoes and other foods undergoing a price hike, which in some Member States is ten times the current rate of inflation, is very acute, particularly for those on low incomes, the main proportion of whose budget goes on food.
This problem did not come out of the blue.
We know that the food sector is controlled by a few undertakings which make significant profits at the expense of producers and consumers: consumer prices are many times higher than those paid to the producers because of the large number of middlemen and the market monopoly.
For this reason there is now an increased global demand for food and animal feed; cereals and oil seed rape are being used in the production of biofuels, not for environmental reasons but as part of the profit-making plans of the oil multinationals.
There has been a collapse in prices and EU intervention to help cereal production has diminished, and there has also been a mandatory set-aside because of the CAP.
All these factors, together, of course, with dreadful weather conditions, have drastically reduced the EU's stocks and production.
Nonetheless, trade and industry have exploited this at the expense of farmers and consumers.
This is why food and animal feed prices have risen.
These rises have worsened the position of workers, increased the number of undernourished people and bankrupted small and medium-sized livestock farmers.
Greek livestock farmers are in despair; they are taking action to demand substantial aid to help them survive.
The decision by the Council of Ministers on 26 September to remove the compulsory set-aside, suspend duties on imported cereals and take other measures, to which you have referred, Commissioner, will go some way towards easing the problem, but it does not solve it.
The decision suggests half-measures, which are by their very nature insufficient.
Substantial measures are required to boost and the stock of animal feed, control prices, and clamp down on cartels and speculation.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful that we can have this debate today with the Commissioner.
As commodities prices increase, people are paying more attention to agriculture again.
The situation is due, on the one hand - as already mentioned by the Commissioner and some of the previous speakers - to demand from third countries and on the other, to crop failures in traditional agricultural exporting countries such as Australia and New Zealand.
Therefore it is essential that we mobilise all the resources that we have in Europe.
I have now determined, for example during my visit to Romania, that at least a third of the total cultivatable land is lying idle, as it always has.
We have considerable resources within our Member States.
A first step would surely be to stop letting land lie fallow.
As already stated, as a farmer, I believe wholeheartedly that the first priority should be to produce healthy food, the second priority to produce fodder and the third priority to produce energy materials.
Ultimately, however, I believe that the slight price increase for our farmers does not in any way bring the price adjustment that would make up for the losses of recent decades.
As many of those who have already spoken have pointed out, we are getting perhaps 10% more in primary materials prices, but retailers are marking that up by 40-50% in some instances.
I am thinking of butter, for example, and this does not seem fair to me.
One way for us farmers to respond would be to organise ourselves better into producer cooperatives with production contracts, in order to meet the food retailer monopolies head on.
(HU) The present debate clearly demonstrates yet again how widely opinions vary in this House.
I agree with Mr Stevenson, namely that this price rise means only a very small increase in income for farmers, compared with the trade sector, supermarket chains, and market speculators, who take the lion's share.
Another problem is that cereal producers will benefit hugely from this, while livestock producers will lose a great deal.
We have an untenable situation here: certain sectors are either favoured or neglected under the common agricultural policy, and this price rise is set to make the neglected sectors even worse off, while those that are prosperous will get even richer.
I agree with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that the increase in prices is a good thing, but who is going to be affected by this price increase?
These contradictions are continually increasing, and unfortunately the distortions of the common agricultural policy deepen and exacerbate these distortions.
We need to fundamentally rethink common agricultural policy, because piecemeal interventions are merely cosmetic.
There can be no normal common agricultural policy as long as livestock production, wine, vegetables and fruit, pig-meat and poultry are neglected sectors.
Thank you.
(ES) Mr President, as I said last month during the debate we had in Parliament on the suspension of compulsory set-aside, which was also a night sitting, the increase in agricultural prices should provoke an in-depth discussion on the direction that the common agricultural policy is taking.
We will soon have the Communication from the European Commission on the CAP 'health check' on the table, but I fear that in that communication the Community executive will not be bold enough to acknowledge that the liberalisation of the markets also has a price, and that European farmers and consumers are now starting to pay that price.
Many Members of this House have always favoured a dismantling of the market management measures and have contributed to projecting the negative image that European consumers have built up regarding the CAP.
As I said at the last plenary sitting, I would like to know how we are now going to explain to citizens that we scarcely have the instruments to control these rises in agricultural prices in the European Union.
It would also be interesting to ask the European Commission to estimate what the cost is going to be for European citizens of this increase in food prices and to compare this cost with the cost for each citizen of the common agricultural policy.
I would also really like to know whether or not citizens will ultimately benefit in the coming years from the liberalisation of the markets and the drastic cuts in direct aid that European farmers are suffering from.
I am going to give you a statistic which I think is very significant: before the creation of the CAP, in 1961, the prices of raw materials for producing animal feed were twice as high as the prices paid by farmers 20 years later.
The common agricultural policy guaranteed a supply of raw materials at an affordable price and at the same time European consumers also benefited from a fair price for an essential commodity.
In a country such as mine, Spain, we are seeing rises in prices of foods as basic as milk.
I think that the economics and finance ministers of the European governments should now also be more concerned about the repercussions that this increase will have on inflation in their countries.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, all of us who are here tonight are aware of all the causes of the rise in the prices of cereals and raw materials.
Although you gave us some good reflections on what those causes are, there are, however, other issues that you tiptoed around.
As you are going to present your proposals on the CAP 'health check' to us in November, I would prefer to tell you now what I think, and say that I hope that in this 'health check' you will analyse whether the CAP is in line with the new requirements of the global market, because one of the principal causes of the restriction of European production has, I am convinced, been the lack of foresight by Community experts.
We need to review the current policy of extremely reduced stocks.
The Community intervention stores should, as has been said here, be the safety net for guaranteeing supply at times like these, but there are no supplies and the Community stores are empty.
I am very concerned, Commissioner, about the consequences that the rise in animal feed prices is having on European livestock farming, as it is having a very negative effect, especially on small and medium-sized farms.
Mr President, this is a very timely debate.
We all know that cereal prices have increased dramatically, and we know the reasons why.
Commissioner, it is a fact that we depend on, and still need, grain imports and substitutes from outside the European Union, mostly from the United States.
In this respect, I am concerned that it is taking so long to decide on the new strains of grain that are up for approval.
I am well aware that this is not necessarily the Commission's fault.
It is the fault of the national governments, because they could not agree.
You are going to have to take the decision, and I hope you take it as soon as possible.
I would urge speedier approval of the new strains of grain that are in the pipeline.
As price inputs rise, the cost is inevitably passed on to the consumer.
That is not something that anyone looks forward to, but it is where we must face up to the power of the supermarkets.
I have known Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for nearly 19 years now - ever since I have been in this Parliament.
I have to say that sometimes he gets it right and sometimes he gets it wrong; he is wrong on this occasion.
I am not against prices going up, as long as the price comes through to the producer as well as to the processor and the consumer.
We must address not only this issue, but also the use of GM grain.
We are importing into the European Union food for our consumers to purchase in our stores when we have no idea how it was produced.
There is no traceability of these imports. They could have been produced using any manner of means.
That is something that we must confront.
A large amount of the meat coming from Brazil, to name but one country we have discussed, is almost certainly produced using GM-grain.
How can we tell the difference?
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the authors of this resolution and give them my support.
The soaring price of cereals and therefore of foodstuffs generally reflects Europe's current dependence on the volatility of world agricultural markets.
Accepting this situation would mean accepting that consumers are becoming a variable for adjustment during the correction phases of these markets.
Accepting this situation also means denying the influence of the large supermarkets, which for 40 years have contributed to the downward trend in prices for farmers, while food prices for consumers have stayed the same or have increased.
This excessive margin capture could have, and should have, been used by the large supermarkets to absorb the rising cost of agricultural raw materials in the crisis we are currently experiencing.
Clearly this is not happening.
The large supermarkets are continuing to abuse their dominant position and the Commission must now discuss this question as a matter of urgency so as to prevent European consumers from being held hostage to an unfair and dangerous system.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will try to respond to some of the questions raised.
First of all, I agree with those who say that it is nice and very satisfactory to see that the market is now working, that the reforms we have been making are working.
That was the whole idea behind all the work done to reform our agricultural sector, so now the farmers can actually respond to the market, and that - from the farmer point of view - is what we really want to do.
It is also important to realise that this increase in prices is not a European phenomenon, it is a global phenomenon - and that is the reason why it is very difficult for us to take certain measures.
I would just like to respond to the idea of introducing export refunds.
I think it could send the wrong signal to the sector to continue production and thereby prolong the pain to the point where we see an increase in prices - here I am talking specifically about the pigmeat sector.
But there will be pressure on prices as long as we have overproduction compared to demand.
We see that prices are going down on carcases; we know that it is part of the cycle and we know as well that in autumn there is always pressure on pigmeat prices.
Let me just mention biofuels, which, under the mandatory targets that the Commission presented on 10 January 2007, will represent 10% of our fuel transport sector by 2020.
We never intended that this would be exclusively European production: we will need imports.
However, it is very important that we start on the first generation and thereby encourage our research institutions to try to find the golden solution for the second generation that will not be produced exclusively or mainly on cereals but on straw, woodchips and residues from slaughterhouses.
We therefore have potential, and we estimate that, by 2020, between 20% and 30% will be coming from the second generation, and we might be able to do better if we push the research investments.
Concerning GMOs, I can fully assure you that the Commission is aware of the problem posed by asynchronous authorisation.
You can see the consequences in the Directorate General for Agriculture's recently published report - which you can find on the internet - where there are three different scenarios.
The Commission is currently reflecting on the best way to address this situation without any compromise on our high level of risk assessment, with regard to both the environment and human health.
Important improvements have already been made in reducing the procedure or the time line - the time necessary - for authorising GMOs.
I would like to mention, just as an example, the recent commitment by the European Food Safety Authority to perform the completeness check within six weeks, compared with a much longer period previously.
I also expect that stronger support from the Member States will help the Commission in further shortening the time line of the authorising process.
Steps in this direction have been taken to increase Member States' support in the authorising process.
I am strongly committed to workable implementation of our rules to ensure that trade in animal feed is not disrupted, with clearly negative consequences for our farmers.
But I am also committed to ensuring the highest level of safety when it comes to placing new GM products on the market, and of course our trading partners know the specific rules that we have within the European Union.
Just two days ago I came back from Argentina and Brazil.
They told me clearly that they will be able to deliver non-GM products, soybean and maize mainly, and the types of GM products that have been authorised in Europe.
But they said that we have to be aware that this is more costly.
If we are prepared to pay the price they will deliver but we have to remember that they have other customers out there, and here they mentioned China as a big customer.
So I am quite sure that we will come back to this issue. I feel certain that we will before too long.
I have received six draft resolutions submitted under Rule 108(5).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 25 October 2007.
Tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Green Paper 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level'.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that the European Union is again discussing tobacco consumption.
In my country alone, 350 people die every day as a result of tobacco consumption so it is only right that we deal with this topic at European level.
I am very glad that the committee decided to launch a European initiative to continue to promote a ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and public buildings.
I think this is the right approach.
Whether there needs to be European legislation or national legislation that would then perhaps be established within the European framework is a matter for debate.
Those who still believe that we do not need it should bear in mind that, in relation to the Air Quality Framework Directive that we passed here a few weeks ago, we argued about whether we would accept 20 or 25 ppm of fine particulate in the air.
Commissioner, the figure in the average pub is 540 grams and after midnight at the 'Aviateur', a popular pub in this area, it is 1 730 grams, so you see how great the differences are and how necessary this is.
Another very important point, which has concerned me for many years, is additives.
Even now, 600 additives may be included in cigarettes, and 70-80 of these are on the 'red list'.
These are highly toxic, carcinogenic substances which may damage our young people's fertility and trap them in addiction.
These substances require very critical, intense scrutiny, the cost of which must, of course, be borne by the manufacturers.
The thought of Commissioner Kyprianou having to spend his last penny on tests made necessary by that industry is deplorable.
The question of costs must therefore be settled, by placing it firmly with the Commission.
I believe that this will reveal many of the main pathogenic ingredients of cigarettes.
Nevertheless, cigarettes are still dangerous.
For me, a further important point is the question of whether, in the long term, we can get industry to pay some of the expenditure brought about by tobacco.
As far as I can see, we have introduced producer liability in many areas: if you drive your car into a ditch and this was due to some defect in the car, the manufacturer of the car must pay.
Commissioner, I would like to see you make every effort to initiate this redistribution of costs onto the manufacturers of tobacco products because, when you think about it, my country spends EUR 50 billion getting people back on their feet.
Why should somebody who has never held a cigarette in their hand have to be involved in that?
That is very unfair, and I would be glad to see those on this side of the Chamber who have a social conscience working hard on this issue.
The costs should be transferred to where they belong - those responsible for them, the producers.
Of course, they will pass the cost on afterwards.
I understand that; that is the way of things in a social market economy.
Every year, thousands of people in Europe die because of smoking.
We must therefore put proper, strict rules in place.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to begin by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.
I think he, and other colleagues here, remember from the very first day of my hearing in the European Parliament, which he chaired by the way, that I have made a very firm commitment: I would like to see Europe free of tobacco.
I think that, slowly and gradually, we are getting there.
I would like to thank Mr Florenz for the work and his dedication and the commitment he has to this cause.
Also, on a personal note, Mr President, if you will allow me, I would like to wish Mr Florenz a happy birthday.
I understand that yesterday was his birthday.
I will not mention the age as I do not want to create an interinstitutional problem, but I would like to wish him many happy returns.
I would like to say that we see a trend and significant improvement in the area of smoke-free environments in the European Union, as compared to a situation three years ago where we only had Ireland and, I think, Italy which had just introduced these bans.
Now we have a much larger number of states that have adopted these more comprehensive bans, even some with a few exceptions: I shall come to that in a minute.
But I believe that we need a joint effort to achieve this - the Commission, Member States and, most importantly, the European Parliament.
I shall say that Parliament's contribution to the Tobacco Directive was of vital importance and I would like to interpret today's report as support for smoke-free environment policies.
I am also very happy that the report takes a very positive constructive approach to the Commission's Green Paper, in particular on supporting the Commission's view that only a full smoking ban can adequately protect the health of citizens and workers.
We have to be frank about that.
First of all, a comprehensive smoking ban protects from passive smoking, it is a disincentive for people, especially young people, to begin smoking, it is an incentive for many people to quit.
It creates, and this is an important factor, a level playing field among the various operators, especially in the entertainment industry, because the exceptions, in order to be effective, have to provide for separate rooms, sealed, negative pressure, separate ventilation systems - all this creates a certain cost that not all operators can meet.
It does create a better level playing field and, also, it is easier to enforce when there are no exceptions.
We have evidence from the European Union, but also from other jurisdictions which have introduced these bans before us, that there has been no negative effect on the hospitality sector.
Actually, in many cases the revenues went up.
Now, for me, what is important is a result. That is what we are trying to achieve.
The procedure through which we achieve it is not very important for me, whether it is European legislation, national legislation or regional legislation in some cases, what we need to do is achieve the target.
I am ready, and I would be willing to accept a step-by-step approach, provided that at the end the target, and not far away, should be an introduction of a comprehensive ban.
Where are we today?
I would like to mention that.
We already have total bans in Ireland and the United Kingdom - the whole of the United Kingdom.
We have Sweden, Italy, Malta, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland which have already introduced quite thorough smoking bans even with exceptions on the special sealed-off rooms as I said earlier, with separate ventilation systems.
France followed this two-step approach, so as of next year will have a similar situation.
Then we have the same restrictions, but with more exceptions, when it comes to hospitality venues for countries like Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands.
We have also proceeded in countries like Germany and Austria, where initiatives are under way already to strengthen existing smoke-free regulations.
We have had a Green Paper as you know.
We had a consultation, a debate in the Council and now with the contribution from the European Parliament I am planning to take all these and then decide what will be the next step at European level and what action should be taken.
We also have commitments under the international obligation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control - all these will be brought together to decide what the next steps should be.
I will go to another point which is included in the report, the Tobacco Products Directive, and I think that is a very important issue.
We will produce a second report on the implementation of this Directive later this year and it will analyse the state of implementation of the directive and identify areas that warrant future amendments.
It will discuss and will be inspired by the report. Several issues which feature in today's report will be included in ours, for example those on the regulation of tobacco ingredients, labelling requirements for tobacco products and products and manufacturers' liability.
I would like to mention two points. One is the issue of the pictorial warnings.
As you know, we have created a databank with different photographs and pictures that can be used as pictorial warnings, but I have to admit that it is very disappointing that very few Member States have actually taken advantage of that.
I really regret that.
To give you an example, I am just going through my notes, we have now only Belgium which has introduced them.
Romania will do it from next year and then we have the United Kingdom also later next year.
I have commitments from the Finnish and Latvian governments that they plan to introduce these in the near future and that was after many calls and urging Member States to introduce them.
We have many countries outside the European Union, like Switzerland and New Zealand, which signed licence agreements with us so that they can use our pictures and our suggestions so, for me, the situation in the European Union is very disappointing and therefore we are very seriously contemplating actually amending the relevant directive and creating a mandatory obligation to use the pictorial warnings.
I also find very interesting the Parliament proposal to have these on both sides of the package.
This is something that we will study.
Finally, the application of the implementation of the tobacco advertising ban is now everywhere.
We had problems with certain Member States. We managed to sort them out, some through legal actions, others through persuasion, but now that applies equally everywhere.
One specific aspect I would like to mention is the initiative we took recently to convince non-EU countries to stop allowing the sponsorship of Formula One events by the tobacco industry.

As you know, we do not have the legal extraterritorial jurisdiction; on the other hand, as these events are broadcast back to Europe they are viewed by the European citizens, they affect young people in Europe, they undermine European legislation and European policies in this area, so I have contacted both those from the private sector involved in this and the respective countries which still allow - there are only three - tobacco sponsorship and host Formula One events.
Hopefully soon we may have some positive results but I will pursue this issue.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur, but also the Members of Parliament who are very committed in this effort.
For me, and I have said that from the very first day, it is very frustrating that, in the European Union, with the highest levels of education and standards of living, people still die of preventable diseases.
More than 600 000 people die of tobacco-related diseases.
I believe that this is a lifestyle where we can encourage change.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, exactly 20 years ago, as a legal adviser in the office of the Belgian Secretary of State for Health, I had the opportunity to draw up regulations that led to the first national Decree banning smoking in public places in the then European Community.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the feeling that, with the resolution on which we are voting tomorrow, we are now playing a kind of pioneering role here, too, in this field.
The initiative in the Green Paper and the excellent report by Mr Florenz have without doubt shown us the way.
Anyone reading the resolution can come to only one conclusion: the European Parliament is opting henceforth for a zero-tolerance policy on smoking.
An immediate ban on harmful additives is demanded, as is the effective application of product liability in respect of tobacco manufacturers - these are examples of sections that speak for themselves.
An unrestricted smoking ban in public places, transport, enclosed workplaces - including catering and drinking establishments - is also called for here.
In this regard, however, my group believes that account must be taken of the decisions taken recently in a number of Member States calling for a high level of investment - which has not yet been written off - in a number of sectors.
Account has to be taken of these, but our ultimate objective in the longer term - to be pursued consciously and without hesitation - must be an unrestricted smoking ban, covering these places too.
The wind is fully in our sails on this issue.
If Eurobarometer and other surveys are to be believed, we have the full support of the people.
To anyone who still doubts the need for intervention, I should like to point out that, since we arrived here in Strasbourg on Monday afternoon, statistically some 480 Europeans will have died from the effects of passive smoking.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to take action against this.
My group, too, intends to invest the maximum effort in this, and also to support all the supporting anti-smoking campaigns.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the International Agency for Research on Cancer recently examined all available evidence on second-hand smoke and cancer.
This was an independent panel of international scientists from 12 countries convened by the World Health Organisation.
They concluded that second-hand smoke is carcinogenic and that exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers by 25-30% - quite a staggering figure.
There is no doubt that people in the workplace and in enclosed public places have the right to be protected from other people's smoke.
Remember that the majority of the population are non-smokers.
The best way to deal with this problem is by a comprehensive smoke-free regulation at Member State level, encompassing a ban in all enclosed public places and in workplaces.
I do not, therefore, agree with Amendment 3 by Mr Florenz asking for limited exceptions.
Any exceptions must be kept to a minimum.
Nor do I agree with his Amendment 2, which deletes a proposal for amending the Framework Directive on workplace safety and health, requiring all employers to ensure a smoke-free workplace.
Employers have a responsibility to protect workers' health.
Further, I would resist any suggestion that exemptions should be granted to pubs or bars not serving food.
Not only is this harmful to employees, but it would also lead to health inequalities.
For example, in the UK, non-food pubs accounted for half of all pubs in deprived areas, compared with a quarter in more affluent areas.
I also think that awareness-raising measures about the dangers of smoking are crucial.
Bigger and bolder picture warnings are part of this awareness-raising and, therefore, I cannot support Amendment 6, which deletes paragraph 16, which refers to these pictures.
I think we would all agree that we must act to help prevent young people from smoking.
The younger people are when they start smoking, the more difficult it is to stop in later life.
Therefore, I would urge support for paragraph 4 of the report, which is aimed at cutting the number of young smokers by 50% by 2025 and rejection of Amendment 1 by Mr Florenz calling for the deletion of this paragraph.
Smoking causes enormous health problems within the population, both of smokers and non-smokers, and I know that some colleagues feel that the use of snus is a better alternative.
However, I cannot support measures that may lead to the wider use of snus, because its use has its own health-related problems, including oral cancer.
There is no value in trading one health hazard for another.
Finally, if we are serious about improving the health of our citizens, then we must encourage all Member States to introduce the necessary measures to make a smoke-free Europe a reality.
Can I just suggest that we could make a great start by enforcing the ban here in our own Parliament buildings?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the timing of the Commission Green Paper and the report by Mr Florenz is excellent.
It is really high time the European Union returned to the issue of tobacco, as silence has surrounded the subject for too long.
The Florenz report rightly focuses on smoking among young people and the harmful effects of passive smoking in workplaces, public buildings and catering and drinking establishments.
