It is particularly important that all aid is made conditional on long-term agreements in the fields of employment and local development, that no aid is granted under Community programmes to companies that do not respect these commitments or that misuse aid.
Nor must aid be granted to companies that, having received aid in one Member State, transfer their operations to another without having fully met their commitments. Otherwise the aid they have received in the first country must be repaid.
Consequently, the Commission must make a rigorous assessment of all recent and current cases.
Companies that have received Community financial aid must also all be audited, and these actions must be accompanied by an exhaustive study of the closure of companies that have received Community financial aid and into the relocations now underway, at a time, like this, when enlargement is close and when this situation is even more worrying.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must unfortunately start on a note of difference between fellow Members, because I wish to express my regret that Mrs Figueiredo has been unable to resist giving priority to side issues rather than to the main one.
The side issue in this case is the petty quibbling of the national opposition. On top of that, what Mrs Figueiredo is saying is not true, because the Prime Minister, the government and the local authorities have been persistent and tireless in this matter.
Their actions in fact match the consensual way in which the Portuguese Members in this House have behaved, and this explains to a large extent the direction this debate has taken and much of the success achieved in terms of the compromise resolution, on which we will shortly be voting.
Let us hope that, especially where this Portuguese case is concerned, that of C & J Clark, which has upset everyone in Portugal, the Commission will finally draw the conclusions necessary to bring an end to a problem that has been around for such a long time: that of companies chasing Community subsidies.
I still remember an example that was renowned in Portugal ten years ago: that of Thierry Rousell, who successfully prospected - or so he said - in the BrejÃ£o region, sowed hope and then stole many millions of escudos.
Even today the case has still not fully come to light or been brought to justice.
These are longstanding problems, to which solutions will one day have to be found.
Industrial relocation and restructuring and companies closing down once they have received financial aid from the European Union are not new phenomena, but their scale and context has changed considerably.
We know that companies' motives for closing and then relocating are many and various.
We are also aware, however, of the damaging effects of relocations, especially when they take jobs away from regions that have no alternatives.
The recent case of C & J Clark in Castelo de Paiva speaks for itself.
These decisions lead to high numbers of redundancies, thousands of jobs are threatened by the far-from-distant prospect of the mass redundancy of workers - those, that is, who have survived previous rounds of redundancies -, with extremely serious repercussions for the regional economy. To these consequences we can add all the indirect effects of the fall in jobs and orders for subcontracting companies, most of which are fragile small and medium-sized enterprises created as offshoots of the main project and dependent on them.
Consequently, we cannot remain indifferent.
We cannot ignore, or pretend to be unaware of the fact that in most cases, these businesses, especially in Objective I regions, benefit from Community financial aid and from direct or indirect financial aid from the Member States.
Nor can we ignore, or pretend to be unaware of the fact, that most of the companies that close, relocate or seek to relocate are not companies that are suffering, and are instead success stories with high productivity rates and with acknowledged product quality. The decision to close is, therefore, a cruel one in social terms and is dictated purely by external economic reasons.
We must fully shoulder our responsibilities, bearing in mind that the European Union is the most significant player in the world in this field and in particular has to ensure that there is internal discipline in company relocations within the internal market itself.
We therefore wish to express our solidarity with workers who are directly or indirectly affected.
We feel it is unacceptable that a multinational company that has benefited from Community financial aid in the Member State in which it has decided to set up could breach the obligations inherent in this aid.
We call on the Commission and the Member States to urge Community-wide companies to refrain from taking decisions that will harm employment unless due consideration has been given to all possible alternative solutions.
We ask the Commission to look into the support mechanisms, at both national and Community level, from which the companies in question have benefited and which it distributes.
We must all know what is happening in this area and that public opinion can also exert control and impose its own sanctions.
Mr President, Gislaved, Bengtsfors and SkÃ¶vde are among the Swedish localities in which many people have seen their lives shattered when large numbers of jobs have been transferred to other EU countries.
Through dubious and, in some cases, illegal state aid, tax revenue has been used to move jobs around within the European Union.
One way of defending fair ground rules would be for the Commission - and I am therefore addressing, in particular, Commissioner Fischler, who is present here - to punish the Member States more severely if they infringe Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.
At present, the options for imposing sanctions under this article amount to nothing worse than the possibility of industries' and Member States' becoming liable for repaying the illegal aid.
They do not, however, have to repay more than the amount of the aid plus interest.
The punishment is therefore mild in relation to what has happened.
These limited consequences, together with the fact that few infringements of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty are discovered, have a damaging effect upon the common EC market.
The idea of the internal market is damaged through the distortion of competition that occurs when certain companies and certain forms of production are given unwarranted support.
Small localities in Sweden have so far been the losers in the dishonest job trading conducted in Europe.
For Bengtsfors and the province of Dalsland in western Sweden, for example, the effects have been disastrous.
The Member States must abide not only by the letter of the EC Treaty, but also by its spirit.
Naturally, cases such as Bengtsfors lead to people's confidence in the EU's internal market being undermined.
I want now specifically to address two questions to Commissioner Fischler.
The first concerns whether he considers current penalties to be adequate and sufficiently severe in cases where state aid is given to companies, as a result of which jobs are transferred from one European Union country to another.
In such cases, no new jobs are created. Instead, a social mechanism for providing security is swept away.
My second question to Commissioner Fischler relates to the answer previously given by the Commission to a question concerning the transfer of jobs in Bengtsfors in Dalsland to Portugal.
Does the Commission believe that structural aid must in the future be redesigned in such a way that new undertakings and new jobs are given priority instead of jobs being transferred from one place to another?
(without microphone) ... as a result of affirming my culture and language, unfortunately represents at this time the observation that the main social problems caused by the phenomenon of relocation are being seen in Portugal.
They are being seen in Portugal without the Commission having taken the due precautions in good time - I agree with my fellow Members who have said this already - but above all, as a result of the rules in Portugal being subordinated to an entirely excessive form of financial fundamentalism, which takes no account of the real economy and people.
Mr President, Commissioner, strengthening the collective and individual rights of workers, especially in the context of mass redundancies, company transfers and insolvencies as a result of industrial change, is enshrined in directives that the Member States must respect, by transposing them swiftly and effectively into national legislation, which does not always happen, and on which the Commission must take special action.
All of this legislative discipline and harmonisation is becoming all the more necessary now that we are - fortunately - seeing a phenomenon of integration of the European economies which has led to a high degree of foreign investment in production.
The benefit to the development of the various European regions is undeniably extremely positive, with the emergence of many success stories of one type or another that have contributed to the economic and social development of regions which, without this investment, might be condemned to stagnation and to falling behind.
Unfortunately, we are also seeing frequent cases of unfair advantage being taken of the material gains achieved without any concern to contribute to strengthening the chain of value produced in the region and, in particular, which fail to demonstrate any social concern.
Much of the responsibility clearly lies with the Member States themselves, who facilitate the start-up and operation of some production units to unimaginable levels, attaching priority only to the immediate interests.
The increase in industrial relocation that we are seeing in some European countries and, if we can generalise, particularly in the less developed economies such as Portugal's, is truly unacceptable.
Nothing, not even the current climate of economic stagnation in Europe, justifies the illegal and immoral behaviour in Portugal of some companies backed by foreign capital.
They have made their investments freely, the companies have been welcomed in good faith and with high expectations, and the aid granted is normally generous and funded partially from the public purse. The ongoing contempt for the interests of regional communities, for individuals and for the European Union itself is, therefore, completely unacceptable.
This aid must be conditional on long-term agreements in the field of employment and local development, which means that aid must not be granted to companies that do not respect these commitments.
It is also becoming necessary, as we stated in the motion for a resolution, to draw up a code of conduct regulating the conditions for relocating jobs and which also enables us to monitor the virtual practices of companies that fail to comply.
This is why a special role has been given to the European Monitoring Centre for Industrial Change, which can assist in defining alternative policies for cases of relocation.
It is also becoming necessary to increase and improve use of the European Social Fund, by focusing it in particular on the training and professional retraining of the workers involved.
Lastly, effective programmes focusing on research and development that make the best use of human resources and improve reception conditions for the reception economies must be promoted and developed, especially by the national authorities of countries under threat.
Commissioner, I wish to take this opportunity to convey our concern at the deterioration of the current social situation that the behaviour of some companies subsidised by the Commission is causing in Portugal.
Despite everything, I am fully convinced that the Commission is sensitive to the situation and will find the appropriate measures to remedy the situation, whilst taking the laws and the interests of the Union into account.
Mr President, this resolution takes it for granted that the European institutions grant public aid to private enterprises, even if they want to have a certain amount of control over the use of this aid.
I personally am against the use of public funds to increase private profits.
Public money, whether it belongs to the Member States or to the European institutions, should be reserved for public services.
Naturally, at the very least, we should demand that companies which do not fulfil their obligations, and in particular those which implement redundancies after receiving public money, reimburse the subsidies they have received.
Just as, at the very least, we should refuse to grant subsidies to businesses which, having received aid in one Member State, transfer production to another State.
The real problem, however, is not even that.
The problem lies in the current exponential increase in mass redundancies.
It is unacceptable for an employer or board of executives to be able to decide to make workers redundant simply to increase company profits.
It is unacceptable for lives to be destroyed and regions ruined in order to pay higher dividends to shareholders.
Mr Fischler, I would ask you this: what use are the European institutions if they are powerless in the face of this fundamental problem?
What power do they have if they cannot or do not want to force at least the major profit-making companies to keep on their employees, by forbidding them from implementing mass redundancies?
Mr President, it is very interesting that our Portuguese colleagues have brought this to our attention and we have had many contributions from them.
I want to approach this from a very different perspective.
I must emphasise that I do not defend managements that behave irresponsibly or take state aids and then do not deliver the jobs.
If one looks at the state aid conditions - and I have seen some of the applications for my own region - there are plenty of procedures in place for clawing them back.
The Portuguese authorities had plenty of ways of doing that.
I say to almost all colleagues that have spoken in this debate that they are walking away from the problem.
That is why I want to contribute.
I could tell this House every month about cases involving more job losses than we are talking about today: companies that need to restructure, companies that are working in a global market.
We have not heard the word 'market' from anyone.
I remind you that we work in a market place.
Companies have to produce goods that customers can afford to buy, at a profit, otherwise they cannot continue to employ people.
We are now living in a global market where companies have to be competitive.
It is entirely wrong to claim - as a number of colleagues on the left side of this House have - that every single closure is because a company 'wants to add to its bottom line'.
The closures I have seen are because the company wants to survive in business, to continue employing people in high-quality jobs.
I have been into businesses where I have been told, 'This is the component we are making today and this is the one we can now find in China or Indonesia.
They are the same quality, but I can buy this fully finished product for the price I paid for the raw material in the United Kingdom.'
That is the reality.
What are we going to do about it?
Industries that are facing that sort of competition have to look at the ways they can restructure, invest, change the process, introduce research and development.
Mr Santos was the first person to mention that.
We have funds from the sixth framework programme.
We have research funds to put into industries for the complete redesign and reconfiguration of processes.
Industries and vulnerable sectors have to start working much better together.
I should like you to pass on to Commissioner Monti, who I believe should be here, the message that we need to encourage industries to work together on reconfiguring their processes in order to make better quality products more competitively and at a better price.
I was amazed to see the reference to producing at a lower cost in my resolution had been taken out.
Producing goods at a lower cost is crucial
I come from a region where we have a traditional industry, the ceramics industry, that is facing this kind of pressure.
That industry is starting to reconfigure and to work together with support from the British Government, using European funds, to tackle these issues.
I went to see a company the other day that makes ceramics in competition with lower cost Portuguese producers.
That company has invested EUR 55 million to reconfigure its process.
It has had to lose jobs as a result, but it has worked with its trade union to do that.
That is the sort of fundamental change we want.
That is what the Commission has to encourage.
We do not want to have any more tedious debates in this House about state intervention, about criticising managements.
If we walk away from the issue and do not make European industry competitive we will continue to have this sort of problem.
Mr President, Commissioner, during the last Strasbourg part-session, the metalworkers came to demonstrate their dismay at the restructuring of Arcelor.
They left Parliament in disbelief, disgusted at not having been heard, and some said that they would come back, but only to cause damage.
The dockers were here this week, and they almost did destroy everything.
If Europe continues to ignore the social impact of the liberalisation policies it is implementing, there will be further explosions.
Of course, Europe is not responsible for uncontrolled restructuring, but, at the very least, we could try to regulate it.
For now, however, there is total refusal to do so.
The Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Diamantopoulou, has already stated that there will not be a directive on the matter.
Nor will there be a European code of good conduct for companies.
Nothing.
But when there is nothing, and no political outlet for despair, violence becomes the last resort.
Today, whatever Mr Harbour thinks, the restructuring of large companies has become proactive, in other words, far from just fulfilling the need to adapt to market fluctuations, they are responding to financial calculations alone.
These calculations are based on share price and anticipate the very short-term profits to be gained from a mass reduction in personnel costs.
Ultimately, even where expensive social plans are implemented, the calculations are viable and there is a return on investment within two years on average.
These stock market transactions, however, completely disregard the men and women whose lives they are destroying and the increased stress and workload they create for those described as survivors.
They also ignore externalised costs such as public aid and unemployment benefit.
You might ask what Europe's role is in this internal scheming within the Member States.
Perhaps none, except that the vast market and the rules on free competition that it supports create areas where, apparently, anything goes.
The Portuguese example of delocalising businesses is just a drop in the ocean, but it is representative.
Europe must, at last, provide genuine answers to this trend, which is not an economic accident, but a result of financial plans in action, which can only lead to violence.
Mr President, honourable Members, I would first like to make the fundamental observation that the Commission, too, very much welcomes and supports your initiative in taking up this very difficult issue.
We can also accept most of the points made and endorse those contained in the motion for a resolution.
I would like, though, to set out under three separate headings my response to the questions that have been raised in the various speeches, for all of which I am grateful, as they have led to a very rounded debate.
Firstly, I believe that, despite our structural and support policies, we must not ignore the fact we are in a market economy system and that the primary task must be to ensure that the market economy system works.
That has nothing to do with Manchester liberalism, but rather with adherence to, for example, our European rules on competition, for failure to ensure that competition works would utterly contradict the whole of our support policy and the entire cohesion and structural policy.
I believe that to be something that we must not permit.
The consequence is that evidence indicating the importance of our having a working market economy is very important and must not be allowed to be disregarded.
The second is to ask what we can do to ensure that aid is not misused, but applied to the purpose for which it was granted.
It was in relation to this that I set out in my first speech the elements of the current rules, and it goes without saying that, in this area, the Commission has to ensure that, where one rule or another is not complied with - where, for example, a firm, contrary to what was laid down in its agreement with the Member State in question or with the Community, moves the business to another location before the permitted date - then, reimbursement is required.
To the assertion made by some of you that there is, over and above that, the need for sanctions, I can only say that, at present, repayment is the sanction.
No additional sanctions at present exist.
That is an issue that perhaps ought to be discussed in the Convention, for if additional sanctions, for example of a financial nature, were sought, provision would have to be made for them in the Treaty.
Such a possibility does not at present exist in the Treaty.
The third thing I would like to address is the issue of whether new firms are given preferential treatment.
For a start, it does not make much sense in this context to insist that a firm be newly established.
What is much more interesting is to focus consideration on how many new jobs will result from a project being supported.
That is the decisive factor.
What this is about is increasing the level of employment in these regions.
You have made a number of suggestions with the future in mind, and to these I want to say one thing.
One of the items in your motion for a resolution is a demand that the Commission should draw up a list of those firms that have been found guilty by a court of law.
We can see difficulties in this as regards data protection.
That is a fact, and we have to live with it.
Apart from that, this debate comes just at the right time, as we will today have the opportunity to discuss future structural policy in the context of the new cohesion report.
It is therefore appropriate the proposals should be made as to how the rules on the grant of structural funding might be improved.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
I have received five motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The next item is the debates on cases of the violation of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
The next item is the debate on the following six motions for a resolution on Cambodia:
B5-0170/2003 by Mr Corbett and Mr Swoboda on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on preparations for the elections in Cambodia;
B5-0174/2003 by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Isler BÃ©guin on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the situation in Cambodia prior to the general elections on 27 July 2003;
B5-0176/2003 by Mr Belder on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities on the situation in Cambodia prior to the general elections on 27. July 2003;
B5-0177/2003 by Mr Vatanen and others on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the situation in Cambodia prior to the general elections on 27 July 2003;
B5-0180/2003 by Mr Vinci on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the situation in Cambodia;
B5-0186/2003 by Mr Maaten on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democratic and Reform Party on the situation in Cambodia prior to the general election.
Mr President, I welcome this resolution which highlights the declining political situation in Cambodia.
The situation must be rectified before the country holds its general elections in July.
Although we as democrats welcome these elections, they will be meaningless if political activists continue to be intimidated and harassed.
The reports that the voter registration process is unfair and undemocratic are of grave concern and must be followed up by real action.
In our resolution we urge the Cambodian authorities to allow for free and fair elections, allow freedom of expression, freedom of the media and religious freedom and more.
But in reality we have to work harder to exert pressure on the authorities to make these changes.
The European Union has to work in liaison with UN and other international organisations on the ground to monitor events and to try to find solutions before the country loses all hope of holding free and democratic elections.
Currently freedom of expression is being trampled by the Cambodian authorities.
The outbreak of violence which occurred in Phnom Penh is a reaction to a Thai actress's comments that Angkor Wat should be returned to Thailand.
This must be condemned.
So far the authorities' solution to the violence in Phnom Penh has been to arrest the journalists that broke the news story and to close borders with its Thai neighbours.
Furthermore, Cambodia's only independent radio station was closed with the charge of inciting riots.
The Cambodian Government reacted to the anti-Thai feeling amongst its population by expelling hundreds of Thais from the country.
Such abuses of freedom and clear displays of xenophobia must be stopped now.
I commend this resolution and I call on the European Union as a whole to maintain its vigilance on the situation in Cambodia, and to do everything within its means to secure democratic elections in the summer.
Mr President, Commissioner, we can only regret that, at the time of this new resolution on a South-East Asian country, once again our Parliament must condemn an increasingly widespread and serious failure to respect democracy and human rights.
Cambodia, despite the promising future that could have been predicted at one time, is becoming dangerously subject to the influence of an authoritarian junta, similar to those in the neighbouring countries of Laos and Burma.
Whereas democracy defuses wars, the juxtaposition of despotic regimes here represents a dangerous threat to this entire Asian sub-region.
How else can we interpret the crisis that has developed between Cambodia and Thailand, which has led to the devastation of the Thai embassy and Thai possessions in Cambodia and the closure of ground borders between the two countries?
This border conflict reflects what takes place on a daily basis in Cambodian society, which is a mosaic of different ethnic groups and cultural and religious diversity and has been harshly and deliberately weakened by the putschist leader, Hun Sen. State violence and all kinds of persecution have recently led to the assassination of Mr Om Radsady, presidential adviser to the national assembly, in the street.
Europe must use the many channels available in order to stabilise this country, and the entire region as well, especially at election time.
Let us not forget that Cambodia is the main recipient of aid in this region.
Both the situation inside Cambodia and the situation regarding its relations with its neighbours demand our attention today.
On-going tensions with Thailand and an atmosphere of political intimidation are characterising the run-up to the general elections of 27 July.
The draft resolution before us is therefore opportune.
The religious situation in Cambodia is also giving cause for concern, which is remarkable, as up to now the country has distinguished itself in a positive sense from its neighbours Laos and Vietnam as far as religious freedom is concerned.
Still the Christian churches are worried as conflicts between Buddhists and Christians are on the increase.
New guidelines from the Ministry of Religious Affairs also threaten to make serious inroads on the freedom enjoyed by Christians to practice their religion in public, provide Christian schooling or build new churches.
The resolution rightly asks the Cambodian Government to withdraw these guidelines.
I sincerely hope that the Council and the Commission will actively support this appeal.
The resolution contains another appeal to the Cambodian authorities that also meets with my complete approval.
They must take all necessary measures to curb the abuse of children.
Sadly trafficking in women and children is in any case an increasing problem in Cambodia.
Insiders stress that the national government could do more about this.
The US shares this view.
Their ambassador gave the Cambodian Government this warning very recently: less aid if they fail to address this.
Especially at this time of transatlantic drifting apart, Brussels must form a united front with Washington on this.
Mr President, this House has given a great deal of attention to Cambodia ever since the days of Pol Pot, the Stone Age Communist with a doctorate in philosophy from the Sorbonne.
Since then, we have campaigned for the freedom of the Cambodian people, even after the Khmer Rouge had been replaced by the Vietnamese occupation, and, even when the situation appeared as hopeless as it did in the struggle against the regime imposed by the Khmer Rouge, we kept on supporting the human rights of the Cambodians.
We did this in close collaboration with Son San, a grand old man of Cambodian democracy, who was a frequent visitor to this House.
What is even more disturbing is that the current deterioration in the situation follows signs of hope in the shape of last year's local elections, which provided a firm basis, at least in the most general terms, for the beginnings of democracy, which can be established only from the ground upwards, that is, out of local communities, in many of which - fortunately enough - it is actually growing.
What makes matters even worse is that repression from the centre outwards, that is, on the part of the government, is currently on the increase.
This is linked to the regime's fear of democratic movements and of opposition; it has to do with the instability resulting from the unresolved issue of succession to the throne, and with many conflicts along ethnic and religious lines, on which point I have to say, in response to Mr Belder, that these conflicts are not just between Christians and Buddhists, but believers, Buddhist and Christian alike, are being persecuted, and we have to stand up for both of them.
It is for this reason that I want to make it clear that, whilst our cooperation agreement with Cambodia was a step in the right direction, it was a pledge of our confidence, and such a pledge is justified only if the developments initiated by the United Nations, along with the rule of law and the beginnings of democracy, continue without interference.
If, however, the elections on 27 July are taken as an occasion for putting leaders of the opposition in fear of their lives and limbs, and intimidating religious groups and ethnic minorities, then that is a lamentable development presaging a fearful backlash, and something that we cannot accept.
So 'yes' to cooperation and to support for the fledgling democracy, but we also have to make it clear to our Cambodian partners that, if they jeopardise their democracy, they are also putting the European Union's cooperation at risk.
Mr President, I am delighted at the progress on economic cooperation with Cambodia and other Asian countries and I am also for the financial support that the European Union gives to Cambodia, but with a qualification and I will come back to that in a minute.
I would like to remind you that of all the countries that the European Union gives financial support to, Cambodia receives the most support per head of population.
However, I am very concerned about the human rights situation in Cambodia.
We all know that practices such as torture of prisoners, the involvement of the army and police in trafficking of women and children and excessive pre-trial detention are commonplace.
I have in mind particularly recent reports about the murder of Om Radsady, the ex-chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Cambodian Parliament, the threats against Princess Vacheahra, the present chair of this Committee, and the continuing violation of the rights of the opposition parties, especially the party of Sam Rainsy and the accusations against him over the responsibility for the attack on the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh.
Mr President, in the light of these events I would urge that the aid to Cambodia from the European Union must not be allowed to be unconditional and that our representatives in Phnom Penh must put explicit pressure on the Cambodian Government to make every effort to improve the human rights situation in their country.
With a view to the coming elections, the European Union must also press for guarantees of free, fair and democratic elections and of the safety of the various opposition leaders, otherwise, then the European Union must indeed immediately revoke its cooperation agreement with Cambodia.
It would be completely incredible if the European Union, that is always so tough on improving human rights and promoting democracy everywhere in the world, were to give such enormous amounts in financial aid to a country that cannot guarantee either one of these things.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is entirely of one mind with Parliament in its view that the recent violent deaths of many Cambodian politicians, which a number of Members have mentioned, give cause for grave concern.
The Commission very much hopes that the political climate will not deteriorate still further at a time when preparations are being made for Cambodia's forthcoming parliamentary elections.
The Commission also gives voice to the hope that the investigation mounted by the royal government into the background to the riots on 29 January this year will help make the country more stable.
I am able to assure you that the Commission, in close consultation with the EU's Member States, is following further developments in Cambodia with close attention.
The Commission is, moreover, concerned about the situation of the media in Cambodia.
Free expression of opinion in the press is, admittedly, permitted, but the publicly owned media continue to be under government control to an immense degree.
This is a point that has already been made by the EU committee that was sent to observe last year's local elections, and it has also been made by the Commission in its representations to the Cambodian authorities.
A preparatory mission, led by the Commission and consisting of experts on elections and representatives of the Member States, was in Cambodia from 27 January to 4 February.
It is on the basis of the information they brought back with them that a decision will be taken on whether, and if so how, to support the electoral process, and, above all, on whether sending an EU mission to observe the elections on 27 July makes sense, is advisable or, indeed, feasible.
All those in Cambodia with whom we have entered into dialogue have spoken in favour of the EU being involved in the electoral process and have expressed the view that the observers' mission at the time of last year's local elections had done a great deal to further a climate of confidence and transparency during the election process.
The outcome of the preparatory mission, which drew attention both to positive and objectionable aspects of the preparations for the elections, led the EU Member States to endorse the Commission's recommendation that a mission be sent to observe the forthcoming elections.
The Commission notes with satisfaction that Parliament has supported this decision.
I will turn now to the problem with the civil disabilities imposed on Christian associations.
A decree of 14 January for the prevention of conflicts between individual religious groupings permitted - and I quote - 'all activities connected with religious propaganda and proselytism, including the dissemination of notices and information brochures, only within religious institutions'.
Permission for such activities in public can, however, be obtained from the Ministry for Education and Religious Affairs.
These provisions apply not only to Christians, but also to all religious bodies, and were introduced to reduce the risk of conflicts and clashes motivated by religion.
In the absence of any in-depth legal analysis, it would appear that this decree, like other measures enacted to date by the Ministry for Education and Religious Affairs, does not necessarily constitute a violation either of the Declaration on Human Rights or of the Cambodian Constitution.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates.
The next item is the following five motions for resolutions:
(B5-0171/2003) by Mrs Kinnock, Mr Veltroni and Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Burma;
(B5-0173/2003) by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Burma;
(B5-0178/2003) by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Van Orden, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the renewal and strengthening of the EU Common Position on Burma;
(B5-0181/2003) by Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the renewal of the EU Common Position on Burma;
(B5-0185/2003) by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, Mrs Maaten and Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the renewal and strengthening of the EU Common Position on Burma.
Mr President, with this joint resolution, Parliament is addressing very clear requests to the Council and the Commission regarding the respective competences, not least because it has been unanimously agreed that there is a situation of total violation of human, political and social rights in Burma.
It has been noted that the military regime is continuing to prevent the parliament elected in 1990 and the parliamentary Committee created in 1998 which represents it from carrying out any democratic activity. It has been noted that, although no longer under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi is being subjected to pressure, threats and intimidation.
It has been noted that the systematic use of torture, extrajudicial executions and forced labour is widespread in Burma.
Thus, the requests are quite clear and direct.
We call upon the Commission to bring the case of forced labour in Burma to the attention of the World Trade Organisation, pointing out that, in the Singapore Declaration, the WTO stated that the ILO is the competent body to deal with matters of respect for labour law. We also call upon the Council not to show any signs of openness towards the regime in Rangoon and to preserve and strengthen the Common Position, bringing all possible pressure to bear on the country, including pressure on foreign investments.
This is the very clear appeal that Parliament is making.
We expect a response from the Commission. It is a pity that we cannot have a response from the Council, but the request is contained in the resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the situation in Burma, as Mrs Napoletano has described it to us, you can imagine what expectations and hopes this strongly-worded resolution on Burma, which is currently a State with no rule of law, will inspire in Burmese civil society.
What fears it should inspire in the military junta currently in power, if this resolution determines the EU's policy with regard to Burma.
Until now, the measures taken by the European Union to improve living conditions in Burma, to try to humanise the situation of its millions of inhabitants, have been limited to theory and political statements that have never been followed by action.
The political and moral responsibility of the EU is now involved. Perhaps it should be involved to the point of criminal prosecution.
Surely the very significant investments made by the Member States, regardless of any development in the military regime, represent de facto collaboration in maintaining the junta in power?
Surely European businesses are cynically exploiting the workforce in this prison-State, which has become a general labour camp, where the concept of citizenship no longer applies?
This country is certainly far from the European continent and European legislation!
Although we are aware of the totalitarian nature of the Burmese regime, however, and the motions for resolution are coming from all sides, the current state of affairs, in other words, the absence of the rule of law, continues under the Burmese sun.
We need to activate the European Union's economic and industrial lever in order to prohibit any investment by the Member States in undemocratic regimes.
We need to ensure that the industrial policy of the Member States is a moral one.
We also need to use the force of Community diplomatic and political action throughout this Asian region, which has a shared history with some of the Member States and for which relations with Europe are still so important for its development.
We must consider the criminals in power in Burma in the current context, in the context of the International Criminal Court that is now permanently operational to prosecute all individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
The time for theoretical statements has passed.
The European Union owes more than that to the winner of the Sakharov Prize and the Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi, to the 1200 political prisoners, and through them, to the millions of Burmese citizens.
This resolution is very strongly worded and comprehensive.
Each paragraph should be part of a framework for a genuine Community policy on the military junta, and therefore to the benefit of Burmese civil society.
Mr President, we are often placed in a dilemma when dealing with evil and repugnant regimes.
Some will call for dialogue, wanting to point out their concerns and encourage the regime to change its ways.
Others - the realists - want tough action and opt for isolation of the regime and sanctions.
Every situation is distinct and calls for different measures.
It can be said with some confidence that tyrants rarely listen to reason and only respond when their vital interests - often personal - are seriously under threat.
The European Union and the wider international community can be powerful bodies when they act with unity, consistency and determination.
When they are divided or make seemingly empty threats, sending different messages through other channels, then the tyrant sees no need to respond.
We are seeing this with Iraq.
Saddam clearly feels - wrongly - that he is being let off the hook.
Sometimes tough measures are introduced but there is little resolve in implementing them or there are deliberate efforts to undermine them.
We have seen this with Zimbabwe, where the very target of an EU sanctions regime is himself given specific exemption in order to be wined and dined in a European capital.
Now we come once more to Burma - another abominable regime - yet another case where the efforts of the European Union and the international community to encourage change have brought few tangible results.
We have been at this for years.
Parliament has been adopting resolutions and the Council common positions since 1996.
What have we to show for all this?
Where is the application and the resolve to achieve some real results?
Current sanctions against the Burmese regime are due to expire on 29 April.
The Council must renew the sanctions but it should strengthen them, introduce new measures, such as an investment ban, remove exemptions to the travel ban and extend it to include all members of the military junta.
The sanctions should be rigorously enforced.
In addition, I call upon the Commission and the Council to assess why the action so far has been ineffective and make recommendations to remedy the situation.
Mr President, there have now been too many years of systematic violation of human rights by the military regime in Burma - the Parliament should be active but it is non-existent - although there have, without a doubt, been improvements in the sectors of political and social life, and progress has been made in the area of individual freedoms, the most important element of which is the release of a remarkable woman who is leading democratic, non-violent resistance with determination and dignity - Aung San Suu Kyi. She is not yet free, however, and cannot move about freely.
In reality, however, Burma still continues to be afflicted by the repression of ethnic minorities, rape and violence against women. The elimination of political dissidents and summary executions have not stopped.
Torture, detention and forced labour are common practice. Despite the government's denials, I believe that children are still forced to join the army and also, I regret to say, the rebel military forces.
There are thousands of people suffering who we do not hear about from the media as we did, I am glad to say, in the case of the 13 years of house arrests imposed on the Nobel Peace Prize-winner.
Consider, for example, the tragic child-soldier system. 'It is a good idea to conscript children because they do the same job as adults but they are difficult for the enemy army to see', one official had the courage to say.
Forced labour is still common practice: recent Amnesty International surveys have shown that approximately 90% of the population of the State of Shan are subject to forced labour.
These people have no choice: either forced labour or prison.
Their work, for which they are not paid, consists of building military infrastructure, roads, buildings and military camps and even performing military duties.
They work without a break from morning until night, with no food except a small quantity of toasted rice.
Despite the fact that the Burmese penal code has banned forced labour, the situation has not changed. It has not changed despite the presence of the International Labour Organisation.
Even the recent endeavours of the Thai Government have been frustrated by the categorical opposition of the Burmese authorities, which have even refused to give members of the political opposition permission to leave the country in order to discuss its economic problems.
Worst of all is the continued abuse of power by the Burmese army, the military intelligence services, the police and other security forces.
I genuinely believe, as other Members have said too, that the European Union must both continue to use its influence to press for negotiations between the democratic groupings, the ethnic minorities and the State to resume as soon as possible, and put pressure on the Burmese authorities, continuing, that is, with the current trade policy on Burma and, if possible, taking even stronger measures to curb the scourge of forced labour, in particular. It must also undertake to pursue ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Burmese generals continue to wage war against their own population.
They take no notice of the rest of the world.
The military regime is still breaking all records when it comes to violation of human rights, political prisoners, forced labour, child soldiers, media censorship, violation of religious freedoms and violence against minorities.
Everything that God has forbidden goes on in Burma.
In drawing up a new common position, the European Union must speak with a clear voice.
The time is long overdue for the generals to release unconditionally the 1 200 political prisoners who are being held in atrocious conditions and tortured.
The Council and the Commission must also give very serious consideration to the systematic rape of women and sexual enslavement and argue for an international investigation into this.
The ILO must be given access to all areas where forced labour is going on.
The European Commission must denounce these abuses at the WTO.
The European Union must also demand that the regime put an end to the climate of impunity, that applies to all those who are guilty of torture, forced labour, deportations or unlawful executions.
Finally, Mr President, it is of the utmost importance that the Burmese refugees in Bangladesh are not forcefully repatriated.
While it may be true that the freedom of movement of the NLD of Aung San Suu Kyi has been slightly increased, that seems to be more a question of window dressing than of a significant change in policy.
The European Union must strengthen the sanctions against Burma.
A ban on foreign investments should be introduced.
European companies which get Burmese blood on their hands to serve their shareholders must be pilloried.
Unfortunately there are still Member States that give more weight to their own business interests than they do to a consistent human rights policy.
Only with broad international support do the oppressed Burmese people have a chance of ousting the generals.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, the Council's competent working parties are at present working on a new Common Position by the European Union on Burma, as the existing one is due to lapse on 29 April.
As Members of this House will be aware, the Common Position has been reinforced a number of times since 1996.
In doing this, the Commission and the Member States have endeavoured to formulate precisely targeted sanctions, which will hit the people we want to hit, and to avoid adverse effects on the innocent citizens of that country.
It has also been stipulated that, in the future too, the Council will respond appropriately to favourable as well as to adverse developments in Burma.
Parliament will, I think, understand why the Commission cannot act in advance of the results of the current discussions, but I am able to assure you that, whenever the Common Position is extended, the whole range of courses of action open to us will be re-examined.
As regards humanitarian aid, the Commission and the Community's Member States have already, on a number of occasions, reaffirmed their willingness to provide humanitarian aid to the most needy sections of the Burmese population.
I would like to confirm, as regards forced labour, that the Commission gives unconditional support both to the most recent UN resolution on the human rights situation in Burma and to the ILO's stance in defence of international labour standards.
Its explicit statement on the situation in Burma led to the adoption by the International Labour Conference of a resolution on Burma, which is now being implemented.
Turning to the proposal that the issue of forced labour be considered by the WTO, the Commission will be examining this more closely, taking into account, as a matter of priority, the forthcoming discussions in the ILO at the end of this month, and the next International Labour Conference, which is to be held in June.
The Commission has no reservations about favouring closer cooperation between the WTO and the ILO and welcomes the informal cooperation that already takes place to some degree.
The Commission also favours independent international investigation of the charges laid against the armed forces, namely of sexual violence and other infringements of the civilian population's rights.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates.
The next item is the following six motions for resolution:
B5-0172/2003 by Mr Karamanou, Mrs GrÃ¶ner, Mrs Ghilardotti, Mrs Prets, Mr Veltroni and Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the case of Amina Lawal, sentenced to death by stoning in Nigeria for adultery;
B5-0175/2003 by Mrs Maes, Mr Rod and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria and, in particular, the case of Amina Lawal;
B5-0179/2003 by Mr McCartin, Mr Posselt, Mr SacrÃ©deus and Mrs Scallon, on behalf of the PPE-DE, Group, on the case of the Nigerian woman, Amina Lawal, sentenced to death by stoning in Nigeria;
B5-0182/2003 by Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Eriksson, Mrs Morgantini, Mrs Fraisse, Mrs Uca and Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Nigeria: the case of Amina Lawal;
B5-0183/2003 by Mr Collins and Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the case of Amina Lawal in Nigeria;
B5-0184/2003 by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria and, in particular, the case of Amina Lawal.
Mr President, Commissioner, the subject of women sentenced to death by stoning in Nigeria, which has outraged public opinion worldwide, was debated here in the House last September.
And yet, Commissioner, ours was a voice crying in the wilderness.
Amina Lawal, the unfortunate woman who committed the heinous crime of believing that she has a right of self-determination over her own body, is due to appear before the Sharia court of appeal on 25 March.
Under Islamic law, she is guilty of treason.
How can this happen in the 21st century and be ignored by the powers that be on the planet?
What a pity the Commissioner is not listening.
How, Commissioner, can women's fundamental freedoms and rights be so violently, so rudely infringed, and be left to lobbying by women's organisations, public opinion and the media?
What has the political leadership of the European Union done, what have the Commission and the Council done?
What sanctions have we imposed on Nigeria, a country with which we have economic and commercial ties?
What purpose do clauses about respecting women's human rights in the Cotonou Agreement serve, Commissioner, if there are no sanctions?
Finally, does Nigeria have a secular, democratic regime or a theocracy?
Does the country have a government or is it ruled by mullahs?
Mr Karamanou, I do not know whether Commissioner Fischler understands Greek too.
I am asking this because I can see that he is not wearing his earphones.
Mr President, I have almost finished my intervention; the Commissioner has not listened to a word I said and is not therefore in a position to answer the questions I have put to him.
My intervention took the form a series of questions to the European leadership, which has done absolutely nothing to stop the crimes being committed against women in Nigeria.
Nigeria is a signatory to the Cotonou Agreement, which contains clauses about respecting human rights and women's rights and yet, as far as the Commission is concerned, it is a case of out of sight out of mind.
The political leadership has done nothing whatsoever and the entire matter has been left to the loyalty of women's organisations and the media; in other words, to pressure from global public opinion.
This pressure is very strong and it does bring in results but, in the final analysis, the European political leadership also needs to do something and insist that the Nigerian Government do what it should to protect women's rights in Nigeria.
And I also have this to say to you, Commissioner: in the final analysis, what is Nigeria?
A democratic regime, a secular regime or a theocracy?
Because on 25 March, Amina Lawal's case will be heard before the Sharia court of appeal.
We are out of our minds with worry.
We have no idea what is happening in Nigeria.
Three years ago, we were celebrating the return of democracy to Nigeria and a democratically elected government.
And yet this government is completely incapable of imposing the constitution and the law on the country.
The mullahs rule the country and are sentencing women to death by stoning for allegedly engaging in sex outside marriage.
We want the Commission and the Council to intervene at once.
The leadership must take a stand against these issues.
That is what we are asking of you, Commissioner.
Mr Karamanou, I have given you a lot of speaking time, firstly because I feel it was impolite of the Commissioner not to listen to you while you were putting questions to him - admittedly, the Commissioner does have a written text prepared beforehand, but it is always polite to listen - and, secondly, because the Chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities was talking.
Mr President, Commissioner. You will understand that this is a matter that concerns us greatly and I also endorse, not only the indignation of Mrs Karamanlis because of the colloques singuliers organised at your bank and for which you as Commissioner are not always responsible, but I also endorse the content.
Thanks to the international campaign, we were able to help Safya Hoesseini escape the stoning to which she was convicted even though she had been raped.
She was, however, spared on procedural grounds and that means that the danger has certainly not gone away for Amina Lawal, who was granted an appeal on 19 August and whose sentence will probably be reconfirmed on 25 March.
So you still have a little time, Commissioner.
She was convicted in Katsina, one of the twelve northern regions where Sharia has come into force during the past 3 years.
The death penalty, mutilation of women and flogging and the prevailing discrimination that accompanies these things have become common practices.
This immediately renders the Constitution of Nigeria, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all other treaties that Nigeria has ratified dead letters.
Presidential elections are being held in Nigeria in a couple of weeks.
Rioting associated with the introduction of Sharia has already claimed a couple of thousand victims.
Recently 220 people were killed in riots surrounding a beauty contest.
The atmosphere is defined by economic crisis, unemployment, lack of security and widespread corruption.
There is, alas, a huge danger of civil war in this enormous and densely populated African country.
And here we are voting on another resolution.
Commissioner, we did that on 15 February 2001, 15 November 2001, 11 April 2002, September 2002 and the ACP did that on 21 March 2001.
So now we are going to vote on yet another resolution but, like Mrs Karamanou, I call on you to take real action, not only to save the life of this unfortunate woman, but also to save this densely populated African country from bloody conflicts that could create thousands of victims.
Mr President, I read about this case last year and did the only thing that I could do. I raised it in my group.
We discussed it in the group and with other groups in this Parliament and passed a motion for a resolution on the plight of Amina Lawal.
The motion clearly sets out what we believe the government of Nigeria must do, in accordance with its international obligations and the requirements of its own federal constitution.
It must use its legitimate power to protect Amina Lawal and other Nigerian women in similar situations from this cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment under Sharia law.
We recognise the sovereignty of the Nigerian people and their federal government and we are increasingly aware that there is a global community and every citizen of the global community is entitled to our solidarity and respect.
I remember that when the Berlin Wall came down an African leader lamented the fact that the European Union had now turned to the East like a man looking at a gorgeous new girl that had appeared and Africa was going to be forgotten and left on the shelf.
When we have completed the process of enlargement, we will be economically and politically more powerful.
We can return our attention to Africa and, while recognising the sovereignty of the African nations, we have to say that there will be conditions attached to our development aid.
We must remember this and similar cases and the plight of all women under Sharia law in the African continent.
We are not trying to impose our will on any sovereign state, but we will tell them that there is a price to pay.
Africa needs our help and we will give it generously, but Africa must reciprocate by treating its citizens humanely.
Mr President, there are too many resolutions which have not been acted upon, and sometimes we too, as Members of Parliament, are guilty of thinking we have resolved a problem just by producing a resolution.
I, however, am a woman, and among my role models are women who, because they had the courage to speak out or the desire to laugh or love, were barbarously tortured and burned alive in the name of God by the cruelty of pious, religious Christians.
Nonetheless, religious practices, cultures and traditions can be changed.
I come from a country where the crime of honour continued to exist even after the war, a country which only recognised rape as a crime against the individual in the seventies, when the feminist movement was in its heyday.
Today, we women are still the victims of discrimination in Europe, our sexuality is commoditised, but our right to exist has been won.
However, the suffering and injustice suffered by women and people all over the world seem to scourge our bodies and rend our souls now as never before.
Once again, in the name of a God who is presented as all-powerful and merciful, religions, traditions and cultures mutilate bodies, stone people to death, impose arranged marriages and mutilate the bodies of innocent children with infibulation.
We must prevent the killing of Amina Lawal, a woman who has dared to love and is condemned to being stoned to death for having a child out of wedlock.
We must prevent religion, when it abuses human rights, whether the victim is a man or a woman, being used as a law, even a law which is secondary to the laws of the State.
The Federal Republic of Nigeria has ratified the international human rights conventions. These conventions must have more than just theoretical significance: they must be observed and enforced in practice.
Nigeria has even adopted a Constitution which guarantees the right to freedom without torture or punishment.
On a number of occasions, President Obasanjo has stated that he is opposed to the death penalty being applied on the basis of Sharia law, but he cannot keep up these double standards forever.
It is true that the issues are complex, but now, the lives of many men and women are at stake - today, it is the life of Amina Lawal, yesterday, it was the life of Safiya Hussaini.
Yet how many other women and how many men are lying in prison or are charged and hanged?
The European Union - and we personally - must make a total commitment not just to preventing Amina Lawal's death but to ensuring that the international agreements are genuinely ratified.
We must therefore compel the Nigerian Government to act on its undertaking and provide all possible assistance, prevent Amina's death and guarantee that a similar sentence is never pronounced again.
I genuinely believe that it is extremely important for there not to be double standards.
We must start from our basic principle, from the fact that it is essential for us too, here, to respect human rights - with regard to immigrants and many others - and so we must do everything possible to ensure that no more people die.
Mr President, in September last year Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the sentencing to death of Ms Amina Lawal.
Since then there has been strong international pressure from all sides to help Ms Lawal, and rightly so.
Of course, her case is exceptionally harrowing: a mother facing the death penalty.
The Lawal case been seen as a test case in and outside Nigeria.
Nigeria has no state religion and that is how it should remain.
Carrying out this death sentence would be a signal that different laws apply to Muslims in Nigeria than to Christians and that cannot be allowed.
The impression must also not be allowed to be created that violation of human rights and the death penalty are acceptable.
The Nigerian Government must ensure that they comply with international obligations in the area of human rights.
In less than two weeks Ms Lawal's appeal against her inhuman punishment comes up.
Hopefully she will win that appeal, but if not, I would like to remind President Olusegun Obasanjo of his own words.
In January of this year, at the time of the riots around the Miss World contest, he said and I quote: 'no one will be stoned in my country'.
My appeal to him is simple: keep your word.
The Nigerian Government has sufficient means to prevent this case from ending in tragedy.
We wait to see how the Nigerian Government will act after the appeal on 25 March.
We in Parliament regard human rights as a cornerstone of good relations between the European Union and other countries.
I express the hope now that the Lawal case will not bring dark clouds over relations between the Union and Nigeria.
Finally, Mr President, President Obasanjo was grateful to receive the Freedom Prize of the Liberal International a few years ago before he became president of that country.
Let him now continue to behave in keeping with that.
Madam President, Amina Lawal, an illiterate 31-year old Nigerian woman, is preparing to face death for the crime of adultery.
She claims she was raped by a friend and subsequently she bore a child.
The sentence of death by stoning, which is carried out by burying her alive up to her neck and then inviting onlookers to stone her, was delayed until after the birth of her child.
There are claims by locals that members of the local Sharia Court which tried her, have themselves had adulterous relationships which on occasions have resulted in the birth of children.
Sharia has recently been introduced in parts of Nigeria as part of a process of Islamicisation.
Christian groups have been critical of the Nigerian Government's failure to affirm that such punishments are contrary to the federal constitution, although President Obasanjo has said that he will weep if the verdict is carried out.
The sentence has been delayed until 2004 to allow her to wean her child.
Nigeria will unquestionably be in my opinion in violation of a number of international treaty obligations including the Convention against Torture and the UN Convenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which it is a signatory.
Even in Iran, there has been no stoning for almost two years now, with the most senior judge recently declaring the punishment illegal.
This is not about the death penalty per se, which remains legal in international law for the most serious crimes. It is about a disproportionate and gratuitously cruel punishment against a young mother.
It is not a feminist issue either.
Nigeria must understand that its relationship with the civilised world will not remain the same if the sentence is carried out and I for one will advocate expulsion from the Commonwealth and an immediate programme of selective sanctions and travel bans on Nigeria's leaders.
I would also call on the Greek presidency of the Council to summon the Nigerian Ambassador and make plain to him the feelings we hold so strongly in this House against such an unjust punishment.
Madam President, the cases of stoning in the States of Northern Nigeria, based on the application of Sharia law by Islamic courts, are a flagrant violation of human rights which we must condemn with all our energy, as Mrs Karamanou has done very effectively this afternoon, on behalf of our European Parliament.
Firstly because we cannot accept the death penalty and secondly because the application of Sharia law affects defenceless women, accused of actions, such as adultery, which cannot be considered crimes; and thirdly because, furthermore, in the case of Amina Lawal, she has not received the least legal guarantees during the trial.
The case of Amina Lawal is dramatic and urgent because, following several postponements, the sentence is imminent: 25 March.
But it is not the only case, Sarimu Mohamed, Safiya Hussaini, Bariya Ibrahima and Adama Yunusa have also been sentenced to prison following a series of international campaigns to prevent these stonings.
In none of these cases have any of the men involved in the adultery been punished.
The vulnerability of women under Islamic criminal law, torture and the degrading treatment they suffer represent an unacceptable violation of human rights and this should be reflected in the European Union's relations with Nigeria and with any other country that applies the Sharia.
Nigeria has one of the highest rates of illiteracy in the world.
There are ritual mutilations, there are millions of people displaced for religious reasons and Islamic law is applied in certain States, clearly discriminating against a section of the population, and there is no reaction from the central government.
The European Union, in accordance with the Treaties, which clearly lay down the principles governing our relations with third countries, and despite Nigerian oil, must use all its diplomatic powers to prevent the application of the death penalty imposed on Amina Lawal and condemn all the consequences of the possible stoning.
More than a million and a half people have protested to the Nigerian authorities and, thanks to this popular action, other stonings have been prevented, but the issue at the moment is to save Amina Lawal and to this end Sharia law must be abolished and, where necessary, hunted down.
Madam President, the stoning of women must be stopped now.
It is outrageous that there should still be places in the world in which the stoning of women is a lawful and accepted form of death penalty.
The Amina Lawal case again makes it necessary to take every possible measure to emphasise the EU's rejection of such barbaric and inhumane methods.
Nigeria is not the only country in the world in which such cruelties take place.
Stoning must of course be banned in every country of the world, but let the obviously appalling case of Amina Lawal be an opportunity to register our unshakeable opposition to the stoning of women.
In Nigeria, the difference between nationally and regionally applicable legislation must be brought to an end.
It is shocking that there should be no guarantee of Amina Lawal's ever appearing before a national court, even though the Nigerian Constitution guarantees her life and dignity.
It is important for us here in the European Parliament to take the opportunity we have to express our abhorrence and to keep exerting pressure on Nigerian society, for it is not merely an issue of the completely unacceptable discrimination between men and women that is the result of Sharia law in a range of countries, but an issue of ordinary humanity and decency.
There is still a long and tough struggle to be undertaken to ensure that human rights are both accepted and observed in every country of the world.
Madam President, I welcome this joint resolution on behalf of Amina Lawal Kurami.
This is the second time we will adopt a resolution on behalf of Amina Lawal.
I have no doubt that the first, in September 2002, contributed greatly to the international appeal for mercy that has helped to ensure her safety thus far.
I was asked at that time to launch an appeal on her behalf.
I would like to thank the thousands of people who responded, both in 2002 and to the recent appeal within the past weeks.
I also thank the European office dealing with human rights in Nigeria.
To be condemned to death by stoning for having a child out of wedlock is a breach of internationally agreed human rights.
I realise that this execution is not the wish of the Nigerian Government.
I thank in particular the Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland, His Excellency Mr Elias Nathan, who has publicly appealed for mercy on behalf of this mother.
We call on the Upper Sharia Court of Appeal of Katsina to respect and uphold the international human rights agreements that Nigeria has signed up to and to ensure that any Sharia law in breach of these rights is repealed.
Regional legislation must be in keeping with the international laws in place nationally in Nigeria.
I am aware that Mrs Lawal has not been restrained or held in detention since her sentencing in March 2002. I am grateful for that.
But we can only imagine the trauma that she has suffered with a death sentence hanging over her head throughout the past year.
Certainly she has been sick and has gone to several hospitals for treatment during this difficult time.
Even though Amina Lawal would have the right to appeal her verdict before a non-religious court, she has suffered enough.
I appeal for mercy and assurance that she will not be executed under any circumstance.
We must also remember that she is not the only woman in these circumstances.
When I was asked to launch an appeal on behalf of Safiya Husseini for a similar offence I was informed that at least four women were awaiting the same sentence - Amina Lawal was one of them - and that young boys from 12 to 16 years of age were awaiting amputation of their hands for theft. Whilst we respect national sovereignty there is a better way forward for Nigeria and its people.
We call for an immediate and lasting response to our parliamentary resolution.
Madam President, once again Parliament is led to, and strongly obliged to condemn the appalling situation of a woman named Amina Lawal, who has been sentenced to death by stoning in Nigeria for having exercised her freedom.
What can I say, what can I add to all that has just been said by my fellow Members, except to reiterate my condemnation of the appalling situation of a woman which justifies as still necessary the fighting that takes place on international women's days.
This intolerable situation forces us to restate our radical opposition to the death penalty and forces us to remember that a court of justice, whether in Nigeria or in any State in the world, cannot be based on religious principles and deny all the principles relating to absolute respect for human rights and respect for human dignity.
This, I am sad to say, echoes the obscurantism of the Middle Ages that our countries also experienced.
We must condemn again and again this intolerable situation of a woman, confirming the importance we attach to the principle of secularity as the principle of major organisation in modern, democratic States.
Madam President, Commissioner, the Nigerian Government should declare that the application of the Sharia by a regional court of justice is counter to the Constitution of its country.
In this regard, we would remind it, in particular, that respect for human rights is a fundamental element of the agreements concluded with third countries.
Apart from the situation of Amina Lawal in Nigeria, all those men and women in the world whose fundamental rights are denied expect the European Union to turn the resolutions that we adopt, sitting after sitting, in this House, into action.
I also fully agree with the questions raised by Mrs Karamanou.
Apart from adopting resolutions, Commissioner - although this is also addressed to the representatives of the Council - what are we actually doing?
Madam President, we are concerned here with saving the life of an innocent person and with a completely unfair judgment.
What, however, is also at issue - and I am addressing Commissioner Fischler at this point - is getting to grips with Sharia law and the Islamicisation of parts of Central Africa where this case is one among many and where we can expect incidents of this kind to be repeated again and again.
It is a matter of questioning clearly, steadfastly, patiently and consistently whether Sharia law really is compatible with human rights and the UN Convention on Human Rights.
We are a group of MEPs who have written to Nigeria's embassies throughout the European Union and in the rest of the world and asked them to attend to this case.
We must do everything possible to influence Nigeria's Supreme Court.
As stated in the resolution, we must also address the issue of its becoming possible for all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and the same protection under the Constitution, irrespective of whether they are Muslims or Christians or members of another faith or of none.
We must also be able to question whether it is reasonable for Sharia law to be so fundamentally at odds with international law and human dignity.
We must do everything possible to ask the following question: where, among believing Muslims, are the voices in Africa and Europe saying that this situation is incompatible with what needs to be at the heart of all religious faith, namely love and tolerance?
Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission does, of course, share Parliament's concerns about the sort of punishments inflicted in northern Nigeria under Sharia law.
In a whole array of cases, among them that of Amina Lawal, the Commission has made representations to the Nigerian Government, and our President Prodi himself has made a direct approach to President Obasanjo, who has also expressed his opposition to these punishments and pointed out that every complainant has the right to take his or her case to the Supreme Court.
The Commission also welcomes the statement made last year by the Nigerian Minister of Justice, to the effect that it was not right to discriminate against Muslims by imposing different sentences on them for one and the same crime.
As various Members of this House have already mentioned, Amina Lawal's appeal is due to be heard on 25 March.
Amina Lawal has been allowed legal counsel and will also have the opportunity to take her appeal to an even higher court if necessary.
We are, through our delegation in Abuja, following the progress of this case as closely as possible, but we refrain from direct references to cases that are still sub judice, preferring to bring pressure on the Nigerian federal government to at last abolish the death penalty for all offences.
Sharia law is a complex and delicate issue in Nigeria.
The position is also very problematic in terms of constitutional law, because the state's Sharia law is in contravention of both the constitution and the international obligations entered into by the Nigerian federal government.
Socially speaking, Nigeria is divided between the Muslim north and the Christian south, and the elections that are to be held next year mean that the issue is politically highly charged and very sensitive.
A study funded by the Commission has concluded that Sharia's application in criminal law is made even more problematic by the fact that the criminal laws are badly framed and applied without consistency by poorly trained judges.
The EU has elaborated a Common Position on human rights issues in Nigeria, drafted representations by the Troika on the death penalty, and made an official statement to the Commission on Human Rights.
The closest possible attention is being paid to Nigeria's adherence to the principles of the Cotonou Agreement.
The Commission is also itself immediately involved and, last year, concluded with Nigeria a Country Strategy Paper and a cooperation programme with Nigeria, key areas of which include human rights and good governance, and in which provision is also made for support to be given to civil society.

Nigeria is, moreover, one of the focus countries of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and a range of projects in support of governmental and judicial reform is shortly to be adopted.
It is in this way that we hope to be able to have a positive influence on the way in which the Nigerian federal government and Nigeria's federal states understand and put into practice fundamental human rights, under which influence it is to be hoped that things will take a turn for the better.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
Madam President, I wish to inform you, on behalf of the Group of the European Socialist Party, that I am tabling an oral amendment which would lead to the name 'EFTEC' being added to paragraphs 9 and 16. This is the name of a Swedish company experiencing problems similar to those of the companies referred to in the motion for a joint resolution.
Is there any objection to the application of this oral amendment?
(Parliament gave its assent to the application of the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
EXPLANATION OF VOTE
Resolution on the closure of businesses (B5-0160/2003)
The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of the resolution on the closure of undertakings after receiving EU financial aid.
We Moderates find it gratifying that, with this resolution, the European Parliament is attending to the harmful consequences that often arise in connection with the EU's Structural Funds.
We believe that the Structural Funds lead to a large and unwieldy merry-go-round of subsidy which, when it is used to aid undertakings, causes unemployment to be transferred between the EU Member States and a distortion of competition for individual undertakings.
What, instead, is required as a basis for creating more jobs are deregulation, lower taxes and fewer barriers to trade.
If the European Union is to have any possibility of achieving the Lisbon objective, the Structural Funds' aid activities should cease as soon as possible.
Madam President, this morning, I asked for the posters hanging from the windows of certain Members' offices to be removed because of the damage they do to Parliament's dignity.
Now, just before the vote, there are still numerous posters hanging on the walls.
If we permit this, it will catch on, and Parliament will end up at some point looking like an advertising pillar or a load of hoardings covered with posters.
That is not in the interests of this honourable House.
I ask that action be taken with the utmost rigour.
Mr Knolle, we are going to contact the competent departments to ensure that the instructions have been applied.
That was the last item on the agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.25 p.m.)
Welcome
I should like to welcome to our distinguished visitors' gallery Mr Rolandas Paksas, the President of Lithuania, who today in Brussels makes his first official visit outside Lithuania since his recent election.
The sole item on today's agenda is the war in Iraq.
(Various Members on the centre and left held up placards denouncing military intervention in Iraq)
Colleagues, I know there are very deep feelings on this matter, but I ask that today, as a Parliament, we act with decorum and dignity in the light of the seriousness of the situation.
Mr President, very briefly, if I may take the floor on a point of order, holding a debate such as that you have arranged is laudable, but parliaments should express their position by means of a vote.
We should offer the various groups the opportunity to table resolutions and express the conclusion of this debate through a vote.
Otherwise, our debate will have no effect.
Mr President, I endorse this statement.
I believe we need a resolution in order to define Parliament's position on a war that is going to destroy a nation.
(Applause from the left)
I wish to point out to you that the convening of a meeting like this one is at the discretion of the President, but subject to consultation with the Conference of Presidents.
There has been an agreement to hold this extraordinary sitting today.
Next week we will have the opportunity to hear Prime Minister Simitis and President Prodi, and, if the groups and the Members so wish, they may express themselves then in the form of a resolution and a vote.
The decision taken by the Conference of Presidents on today's sitting was for a debate without a resolution.
I shall follow that decision and respect the procedures involved.
I give the floor to Mr Papandreou, President-in-Office of the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, I know that feelings are running high today and I realise how important the initiatives taken by the European Parliament over recent weeks were, as we all tried to help bring about a diplomatic and peaceful resolution to the crisis in Iraq.
Feelings are running high because, when diplomacy ends and war begins, it is a sad, disappointing moment.
As the President said, the Iraqi crisis has been the cause of numerous heated debates within our House, within the international community and within the UN.
We have been working on a common basis, towards a common objective, as expressed on at least two different occasions, at the External Relations Council and later, at summit level: the objective of disarmament and full compliance with UN resolutions and, at the same time, the need to exhaust all diplomatic efforts before resorting to violence.
The Greek Presidency supported this objective; we took initiatives and we met all our permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council on numerous occasions.
We also had several meetings with the leaders of the United States, Kofi Annan and the inspectors.
Both the presidency and other members of the Council acting on our behalf made numerous trips to the Arab countries in the Middle East, where we and Mr Chris Patten, who travelled with us, met the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Arab states and the leaders of the Arab League in Sharm el Sheik.
We organised an important initiative to send a specific message to Iraq on behalf of the Arab League which got started but unfortunately petered out, and discussions at home about where we go from here, what we do next and how we deal with this crisis were also fraught with difficulty.
This is not the time to go into details, nor is it perhaps the time to apportion blame as to which opportunities the international community took advantage of and which it did not as it tried to foster a peaceful solution to this conflict.
However, what I would say is that we had a heated debate which will have important results and serious repercussions on future developments.
We need to examine the implications of this crisis within the European Union and the international community and the UN and decide how to tackle them.
I should like to point out that the stands taken by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs when they met the other day highlighted these disagreements, these differing perceptions as to what constitutes a just war. Differing opinions were expressed about the expediency of intervention, about the repercussions of intervening or not intervening and about stability in the region.
And yet, within these disagreements the President spoke of - and why try and hide the fact, they are a matter of public record - the presidency, all of us, especially the Council and the European Parliament, now need to decide where we go from here. Because the fact of the matter is that hostilities have now begun.
One of our prime considerations as we decide what to do next, as Mr Cox quite rightly pointed out, is that the crisis should be used as a springboard for serious thought.
That is what both we and the overwhelming majority of European Union citizens want; serious thought about institutional reform and the basic political will to unite behind a single foreign policy, a European Union foreign policy which speaks with a united, effective voice on international affairs, at international level, on the international stage.
Secondly, we need to examine the problems the Gulf will face in the immediate future, problems such as a possible humanitarian crisis.
To paraphrase ?ofi Annan at the Security Council yesterday, the international community will perhaps finally unite around the fate of the Iraqi people.
In truth, at the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, at the Council meeting the other day, which was an informal but nonetheless important session, a number of approaches were proposed which will need to be examined and which will guide us as we decide where we go from here.
First of all, we have to address the huge humanitarian problems which the war in Iraq will create, especially its repercussions on neighbouring countries and the problems which the European Union itself may face from a wave of refugees.
A second important consideration is the need to secure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.
A third important problem is the stability of the region as a whole.
A war can destabilise and cause problems for neighbouring countries, one of which, Turkey, is a candidate country of the European Union.
We had the opportunity at the European Parliament in Strasbourg a few days ago to debate the Kurdish question and the fear that this crisis has perhaps opened up another front in the war.
At the same time, however, we need to consider what the repercussions of this war will be, what repercussions it will have on Turkey itself, because we need to safeguard its progress towards Europe and its reform movement.
Another important consideration for the region, for stability in the Middle East, is the Middle East problem and the peace process itself.
As far as this process is concerned, the European Union is unanimously behind the so-called roadmap, which it wants not just published but implemented as quickly as possible.
Whatever happens in Iraq, we need to highlight the supremely important role of the United Nations in the overall process.
Luckily, there is unanimity here too.
Even if we were unable recently to keep the UN at the forefront, let us try and do so from now on and ensure that the UN has the standing it deserves.
I think that, within this, we shall face another two important issues.
First, trans-Atlantic relations, relations between the European Union and the United States.
As we all know, trans-Atlantic relations have been through - is still going through - a serious crisis.
Of that there can be no doubt.
It is therefore time for an honest discussion of today's real problems and challenges, an honest discussion of how we intend to deal with major issues, from weapons of mass destruction to the environment, poverty and inequality; now is the time for honest dialogue with the United States, a dialogue which, we hope, will help us find a way of really cooperating on security, on promoting real peace and on real global governance based on the common values of the European Union, values which we share in the European Union, values which underpin the Community in which we live.
The fact that we have been cooperating very closely with the Arab world over recent weeks is also extremely important.
This cooperation, Mr President, honourable Members, has shown that the conflict in Iraq is not and must not be a cultural war or conflict.
On the contrary, we must strengthen these ties with the Arab and Muslim world. We need an in-depth cultural dialogue here, a cultural dialogue which will pinpoint the problems of mankind for which we are jointly responsible and allow us, within this joint responsibility, to discuss the best ways of dealing with these issues and the common values which will guide us as we do so.
I should like to say here that I have a feeling, perhaps a ray of optimism on this dark and difficult day, that it is the will of the Member States and, I believe, of our citizens, that the crisis in Iraq - which has given rise to so much discussion and will surely continue to do so over coming weeks and months, perhaps even years - should now be used as a springboard by the European Union for drawing important conclusions about its own institutions, about our role, about the challenges we face and about how we can deal with this situation more effectively.
All I can say is that this is the feeling I had, that this is the will which was expressed during discussions at the External Affairs Council the other day.
A feeling that, even though we are of course bitter and disappointed about our failure to agree on Iraq, we should not let this divide us and we should focus on where we can take unified action by analysing these problems and moving on.
I am sure that this message, this objective will be supported by the European Parliament, which has fought long and hard for the common foreign policy, a stronger European presence on the international stage and the integration of the European Union, and which will play a decisive role here.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, I look forward to receiving your comments.
Mr President, as you said earlier, last week the Parliament debated the crisis in Iraq for almost four and a half hours.
It was a very good and responsible debate.
One week on, from the Commission's point of view, I am frankly not sure what I can usefully add to what I said last week, but that sort of consideration has very rarely encouraged politicians to keep quiet.
(Laughter and applause)
President.
Or even university chancellors!
Patten, Commission.
But at least I will spare the President this speech in Latin!
I can offer briefly one or two additional thoughts which I hope will provide some context for the rest of this debate and which, I am sure, Mr President, you were entirely right to call with the agreement of the presidents of the groups.
This debate takes place against an extremely sombre background.
Whatever the outcome of the war that has started in Iraq - and we must all pray that the military phase will be as short and as bloodless as possible - there can be no denying that this has been a very bad passage for the common foreign and security policy; a very bad passage for the European Union as a whole; a very bad passage for the authority of the UN, for NATO and for transatlantic relations.
I just pause to make one point about transatlantic relations.
Most of the things that we want to achieve as Europeans, we are more likely to be able to achieve if we are able to work with the United States.
(Applause)
It is equally the case that most of the things that America wants are more likely to be achieved if America can work with the European Union.
(Applause)
And finally, it is unarguably the case that the world is better served in terms of prosperity, security and stability when America and the European Union work together.
(Applause)
So the future of transatlantic relations is a matter of real concern to all of us and it was of course entirely appropriate that the Foreign Minister referred so eloquently to that issue during his remarks.
The Greek Presidency made heroic efforts to maintain a common position.
The European Council's declaration of 17 February was, in my view, extremely well judged.
Member States agree about the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; they agree on the need for full and effective disarmament of Iraq; they agree that the United Nations must remain at the centre of the international order; they agree, indeed, that force should only be used as a last resort.
However, they disagreed - all too publicly - about when that point had been reached.
How can we now pull things together again?
How can we emerge not just healed but strengthened from the trials of the last few weeks?
We should remind ourselves how closely and effectively we are cooperating - not just within the European Union but across the Atlantic - on a host of international issues.
We should redouble our efforts.
In the Balkans, for example, we are working flat out for economic and political stabilisation.
I was in Serbia last week and I witnessed the determination of men and women there to ensure that that the fragile stability that prevails should not be set back by the despicable murder of Zoran Djindjic.
I hope that at the European Council later today and tomorrow, heads of government will renew their pledge to maintain the momentum of development and of association between these countries and the European Union.
We must also maintain unrelenting concentration on Afghanistan, on which we had a donors' meeting here in Brussels at the beginning of the week: a recognition of how prominent a part we are playing under UN auspices in the reconstruction in that country, which still faces appalling problems.
After the fighting of 2001, the European Union pledged that it was there for the long haul, to help deliver stability and sound government.
This House helped to ensure that we put resources behind that pledge.
We must remain true to it.
I repeat what I said to this House last week, that we must also maintain the momentum of our own enlargement.
The decision to bring in ten new Member States is not some whim, which might be called into question by unrelated events.
It is a strategic choice for our continent.
And it is a choice of historic proportions.
We must press forward undaunted, just as we must press forward with the work we announced in our paper last week on Wider Europe.
That communication set out a vision about how our neighbours, not just to the east but to the south, too, can expect to share in our prosperity and stability if they are ready to align themselves on our values and on our legislation.
Our proposals for 'Wider Europe' mean the creation of a common economic and social space where all countries enjoy full membership of the internal market and, potentially, share in the four freedoms.
We must press forward, too, with the Middle East peace process.
It is encouraging that the President of the United States is now ready to proceed with the road map towards a two-State solution that was prepared, I have to say, several months ago within the international quartet.
But we must ensure that this means the urgent implementation of these ideas, not a long discussion with the parties about their validity.
Such discussions have proved to be endlessly frustrating in the past, as the parties have sought to impose incompatible conditions upon their cooperation.
We really cannot allow this peace process, once again, to be subject to conditional sequencing so that in practice there is no peace but more bloodshed.
(Applause)
More immediately, the whole European Union must strive to build on what we share in our approach to the conflict now beginning in Iraq.
The Commission has been working hard behind the scenes, in cooperation with international agencies, to contribute to the humanitarian assistance that may be needed.
I have discussed these issues myself in Jordan, Turkey and Iran in recent weeks.
ECHO, the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office, has reinforced its presence in the region.
There are now five permanent expatriate technical assistants in the Amman Regional office covering Iraq and the whole of the Middle East, an additional expert based in Jerusalem and a seventh one on standby in Amman.
ECHO has also kept regular contact with the main humanitarian organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Since January this year, ECHO has carried out three missions to Iraq itself to assess the situation and prepare for possible operations.
It has also conducted several missions to neighbouring countries.
Besides the EUR 15 million that had been earmarked for humanitarian operations in Iraq in 2003, the Commission has, of course, delegated authority to approve fast track aid for a further EUR 3 million in less than 72 hours.
If there were a crisis in a neighbouring country, it would be possible to agree another EUR 3 million for that purpose, too.
Depending on the scale of the needs, we may need to apply for additional funds for humanitarian purposes from the emergency reserve.
On the basis of previous experience - ECHO has been providing humanitarian aid to Iraq since 1992 - we expect that the Commission's contribution is likely to be focused on health, on water and on sanitation.
Some international organisations and NGOs are also predicting food shortages, with disruption of the Oil for Food programme.
That is something we may need to look at in due course, if the problem emerges.
In all this effort, ECHO will work closely with UN agencies, and will participate in on-the-spot information exchanges.
I should like to add one point here.
Nobody in this House, I am sure, under-estimates the courage and commitment of our humanitarian aid teams in the field.
I think all of us have good reason to be proud of them, proud of the work they have already done in that region and proud of the work which, alas, they have to do in all too many parts of the world.
(Applause)
We must also do all that we can to help Turkey cope with the political pressures generated by recent events, and to help Iraq's other neighbours, too - from Jordan and Syria to Iran.
As I said earlier, during my recent trips to the region I had a chance to gain a better understanding of the impact that war on Iraq could have on these countries.
The Commission will continue monitoring and assessing the situation closely and would look, with the Council, at possible EU responses.
In the present circumstances, I am bound to say that I am extremely pleased that we have taken the initiative to develop our relationship with Iran, not in an ill-informed way, not overlooking the disagreements we have with that country.
I think trying to develop our relationship with Iran makes considerable sense.
In an article earlier this week a respected newspaper columnist reminded us that after the plagues and misfortunes had streamed from Pandora's box, Hope remained behind to assuage the afflicted.
So perhaps we should hold onto hope that the war will be over quickly, and with minimum casualties - a point felt especially strongly, whatever your views on the conflict, by all those with fellow countrymen and women engaged in the fight.
(Applause)
We should hope as well that it will be possible to deliver humanitarian aid quickly and effectively, under international auspices, where it is most needed.
We should hope that the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq can begin soon, again under international auspices.
A point I made explicitly last week - perhaps the House will excuse me for repeating it - was that if post-war Iraq is managed under a UN mandate like East Timor, Kosovo and Afghanistan, I hope that it will be recognised in those circumstances and that part of the credit for that should go to those who have insisted on it from the outset.
We should hope, then, that reconstruction under international auspices can begin, guaranteeing Iraq's territorial integrity and providing for Iraqi ownership of the process.
We should also hope that those who believe that the real choice in the Arab world lies between pro-western despotism and anti-western democracy are wrong; hope that the regional repercussions will be benign - or, if they are damaging, that they will be contained; hope that the current crisis will serve to galvanise the Middle East peace process after a desperately bleak period in which things have drifted backwards; hope that those who believe that this war will strike a blow against international terrorism - rather than stoking the flames of it - are right; and hope, finally, that those many institutions and relationships which have been tested in the fire in recent weeks, including the European Union and the common foreign and security policy, will emerge strengthened by a renewed recognition of how badly we need the apparatus of international governance.
I should like to leave the House with this last thought: the challenge that we face today, the challenge that we will face in the coming weeks and months, goes far beyond what Winston Churchill once called 'the thankless deserts of Mesopotamia'.
We face a very clear choice in the coming months.
Are we to go back to the way the world was run, or not run, in the nineteenth century - a world of rival national sovereignties and balances of power?
Or do we try to rebuild the institutions and habits of global governance which have been so painfully constructed in the last half-century?
That is the clear choice which is going to face us.
I know which side of the argument I come down on.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when issues of war and peace are at stake, they have a profound effect on us - on our minds, our intellects, our hearts and our emotions.
What I ask of all of us is that we conduct this difficult debate with an attitude of mutual respect, taking the approach that - even when our opinions differ - we are all men and women of goodwill.
The reason why I say this with such emphasis is that, here in the European Parliament, when fundamental issues concerning Europe's future were at stake, we have always eventually managed to reach a common position.
While there is dispute concerning the crisis in Iraq, we must not allow ourselves to be divided on fundamental issues here in this European Parliament; on the contrary, where those fundamental issues are concerned, the road into the future is one on which we must journey together.
(Applause from the right)
Ladies and gentlemen, when we, in our present situation, consider what is happening tonight, we have to get to the root causes of it.
Let me repeat: what is happening tonight, and what will be happening over the coming days and weeks, would not be happening were it not for Saddam Hussein's criminal regime, with its torture, its secret service, its murders and assassinations.
It is Saddam Hussein who is responsible for the developments that are going on around us.
(Applause from the right)
We regret the fact that the UN Security Council was not able to agree on the attitude to take to the disarmament of Iraq.
(Interruption: And why was that?)
We really do regret that most deeply.
Pope John Paul II ...
Yes, he is indeed, on this issue, closer to some than to those who would criticise me for quoting him - Pope John Paul II has said through his spokesman: 'Those who decide that all peaceful means made available by international law are exhausted assume a grave responsibility before God, before their conscience, and before history.'
The American President, George Bush - having had the experience of 11 September, which, in terms of American psychology, means that America is at war - does indeed assume that responsibility, and, above all, assumes it together with others.
President Bush has said tonight: 'We have no ambition in Iraq except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people.'
If this is to be the objective, then our group is right behind him; this is something about which one cannot be neutral.
(Applause from the right)
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no cause for anti-Americanism.
Although I am speaking here as a European, that is something I can say as a German.
We would have wanted action to be taken via the United Nations, but at a time when we face the threat of anti-Americanism, we must not forget that it was the Americans who liberated the people who remained in the Nazi's concentration camps.
(Applause from the right)
Today, we recall how it was an American President, Ronald Reagan, who, in the mid-Eighties, said: 'Mr. Gorbachev, break the wall down!' - and was patronised for it.
At the time, that struck many people as ridiculous, as a mirage, yet without the Americans - and of course without Gorbachev - this transformation in Europe would not have been possible.
It is that that we must remember today.
(Applause from the right)
I can tell you, though, ladies and gentlemen, in all seriousness, there is much about a global power such as America that is worthy of criticism, and there is much, too, with which we do not agree.
We would not think it right for there to be only one great power left in the world, with the others no longer capable of bringing any influence to bear.
That is why, in these difficult hours, what is required of us Europeans ourselves is that we criticise the Americans less, but ask ourselves, as Europeans, more what we can do in order to be united, strong and capable of influencing our American friends.
That is the responsibility that we ourselves bear today.
(Applause from the right)
I unreservedly endorse what Mr Papandreou and Commissioner Patten have said, that we must now urge our American friends not to let a peace settlement in the Middle East be only a matter of words.
Israel has the right to live within secure borders, but the Palestinian people, too, have the right to live within secure borders, and with dignity, and we - Europeans and Americans together - must now do our part to bring that about.
(Applause from the right)
Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by referring to the European Union's great achievement, which is the reason why I appeal for us not to allow ourselves to be divided, whatever our disagreements about the matter in hand.
This Europe, this European Union, lives in peace today because, in our European Union, it is the law that holds sway, and not the law of the strong.
Let us in future do everything possible to prevent axes from being again established between capitals, with one city ranged against the other; instead, we Europeans must act as a Community.
That is what we must require of ourselves at the present time.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are grave times.
The chronicle of a war foretold is becoming reality.
On behalf of my group, the Socialist Group, I profoundly regret the failure of the peaceful approach and I hope that there is no mass destruction of the civilian population, bringing a trail of death and destruction to a population a half of which is under fifteen years old.
The Iraqi people are suffering a twin punishment: the punishment it suffers under Saddam Hussein, and the additional punishment of an unjust war.
In the face of this extremely serious situation, we once again call on the governments of the Member States of our Union and of its future members not to participate in a unilateral pre-emptive war which is morally and legally dubious and which is contrary to the wishes of the majority of Europeans.
(Applause from the left)
Our group would like once again to call on the European Council to meet today to increase its efforts, to overcome the current division and to find a single European voice.
Our Union is a community of values governed by law and the Member States are obliged to abide by the solidarity and mutual commitments laid down in the Treaties and which lie behind the CFSP.
Our current situation is really very difficult.
The European Union is divided, the United Nations is in deadlock and we are witnessing the philosophy of the unavoidable war.
However, we must not indulge in pessimism or defeatism.
Mr Michel Rocard has rightly said that none of our governments questions that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous war criminal, who in the past has sought to acquire weapons of mass destruction by any possible means, that his word and his signature cannot inspire confidence and that the dictator must be subjected to the justice of the International Criminal Court - something which this Parliament voted for in January with the opposition of the PPE-DE.
This is something we must persevere with.
The difference between us is in the rhythm and the means.
In other words, we must be able to ask ourselves why we Europeans have become so radically divided.
And that is our responsibility.
And in this regard I share the view of the President of the Party of European Socialists, Robin Cook, who said in the House of Commons that our interests are better protected by means of multilateral agreements and by a world order governed by rules rather than by unilateral actions.
(Applause from the left)
Ladies and gentlemen, the question is not whether or not we are friends of the United States.
We are loyal partners and not servants.
(Applause from the left)
The difference at the moment is that we do not share the Bush Administration's doctrine of pre-emptive attack.
And I do not accept that Jimmy Carter is any less American because he argues that this war is unjust.
That is absolutely absurd.
(Applause from the left)
And there is a further element, and that is that the current United States administration wishes to redraw the entire map of the Middle East, a century after the two European colonial powers - Great Britain and France - carved up the Middle East with a ruler and pen, and one only needs to look at the map.
There is no place for this in today's world.
And what is absolutely obscene is that we are told, as we all know, that the market for the reconstruction of Iraq is already shared out - and at the head of the queue is the company which was presided over by the Vice-President of the United States until two years ago.
This is unacceptable.
Commissioner, my group will vote for humanitarian aid administered by civilians in Iraq.
With regard to reconstruction, we will have to discuss this, but it should not fall to us to pay for the damage caused by others, as is happening for example in the case of Palestine.
(Applause from the left)
This is therefore a responsibility for the Commission.
And if you will allow me: I appreciate that, following 11 September, there is fear in the United States, but a great American, a great American President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, at the moment when he launched the United States into the noble cause of liberating Europe - with the exception of my country unfortunately - said that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
And therefore we cannot live in fear and terror.
We must live in a positive way.
And when we call for dialogue with other cultures, I must say to you, Mr Poettering, that dialogue with Islam - not only with the Arab people - must be based on something positive, and the great Arab poet from my country, from Cordoba, Ibn-Hamz de CÃ³rdoba, said rightly that the flower of war is infertile, and that is something we must bear very much in mind.
(Applause from the left)
Dialogue cannot begin on the basis of threats and war.
Allow me to add, in relation to what happened in the Security Council - and there are many countries which have refused to bow to pressure - that, as Robin Cook has also said, we cannot ignore the essential fact, and that is that, if we really believe in an international community based on binding rules and institutions, we cannot simply forget about them when their results do not suit us.
This is an essential point.
If we believe in the United Nations, we must support it and we must strengthen it.
We cannot unilaterally take the responsibility of saying that what has been done so far makes no sense.
If we all want peace, if we are against bloodthirsty tyrants, if we are in favour of an active policy of destroying weapons of mass destruction, we must be able, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to unite ourselves once again, and what my group respectfully asks is that you deliver this message, this demand, supported by millions of our fellow European citizens, so that the European Council speaks clearly, and so that we are capable of uniting and also of seriously relaunching the Middle East peace process - which is absolutely essential - and ensuring our future as a strong, consolidated and capable European Union in our own eyes and in the eyes of the world.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, this is not a just war.
Liberal Democrats have consistently argued in this House that war would be justified only as a last resort, if inspections had failed and if it were explicitly authorised by the UN Security Council.
We prefer the force of argument to the argument of force.
Nonetheless, much as we abhor Saddam Hussein's regime, we deeply regret that as we breakfasted in Brussels the bombs were falling on Baghdad.
I hope, for the sake of the Iraqi people and for the sake of our troops doing their duty as professional soldiers, that this war will be as swift and as bloodless as possible.
In the absence of UN legitimacy and moral authority there is a duty on the countries prosecuting this war to do so in a way that is consistent with international norms and conventions.
That means not using disproportionate force, not using the cluster bombs that drop small mines around the place, not using the incapacitating gas such as that used in the theatre in Moscow, not using the devastating MOAB bomb where air burst and mushroom clouds caused mass destruction.
They might also take care not to litter the Iraqi desert with depleted uranium.
(Applause from the ELDR Group)
Once this war is over it will be imperative that the United States and the United Kingdom shoulder their responsibilities in rebuilding rapidly a peaceful, stable and prosperous Iraq for the inhabitants who have suffered so terribly under our sanctions regime.
This will require the lifting of sanctions and immediate humanitarian aid.
It means uniting the different communities of Iraq and the building of stable institutions to secure the future.
Beyond that, they also need to establish a criminal tribunal for the crimes of the Iraqi regime and they must give back control of the oil fields to the Iraqi people.
If those countries can bring the same conviction and determination to the solution of the Israeli-Palestine conflict and the same zeal to eliminating their own weapons of mass destruction, as they demand of the Iraqis, then we might make progress.
It is important that the US does not act unilaterally in deciding the fate of Iraq.
Once this war is over, the European Union must be a standard bearer for humanitarian values.
We must be broadminded and generous and assume fully our responsibilities in the rebuilding of Iraq.
This is not the moment to haggle with the USA over the cost of reconstruction.
Europe must play its part with no hidden agenda.
As our heads of state and government meet this weekend they must discuss how we can limit the economic fallout of the war for Europe's economy, how the ECB can stand ready to act swiftly to restore confidence in our currency if needed, and how governments can show a renewed commitment to the reforms needed to revive Europe's economy.
They must also discuss, and be prepared to discuss when the crisis is over, why Europe has failed over Iraq.
It could yet be that this crisis will prove a turning point if our heads of state and government finally accept the need for a common foreign policy and a single EU seat at the UN Security Council, because Europe's troubled tribalism means that Washington wins the day.
If there is a lesson to be learned from this crisis in London, Paris, Berlin and Madrid, it is that if we had a common foreign and security policy our world view would prevail.
Mr President, as dawn broke over Baghdad this morning, the people were awoken by the awful, deafening sound of the first bombs falling on the city. These people were the very men, women and children who some of us saw going about their daily lives, met and questioned just a few weeks ago.
We are haunted by their faces at this terrible time. They know that 3 000 missiles will be dropped on Iraq from the first phase of the war.
They are expecting to see, or perhaps to see once again, the fierce and unrelenting attacks on their country by terrifying fleets of F15s, F16s, B1s, B2s, B52s, Awacs and Apaches.
President Bush brazenly refers to notions of honour and moral principles and appeals to God, when he has taken the most inhumane and inexcusable of decisions. He has decided to interrupt the peaceful disarmament of Iraq in order to launch an attack on a country worn down by previous wars and by a criminal embargo, where, we have been informed, 50% of the population is under fifteen years of age.
President Bush plans to launch an attack against this country involving 600 fighter planes, 70 warships, 6 aircraft carriers, columns of tanks and 300 000 soldiers. It is possible that some of the 600 journalists embedded in the armed forces will bring us pictures of popular rejoicing.
Perhaps we will see Iraqi people welcoming their liberators with sweets and flowers.
This is what we have been promised by George W. Bush and Kanan Makiya, a prominent figure amongst pro-American Iraqi exiles. According to the New York Times Magazine, this advisor to the President, who has lived in Cambridge since 1968, apparently spent much of his meeting at the White House in January explaining to his distinguished host that there are two types of Muslims in Iraq: Shiites and Sunnis.
This just shows the depth of knowledge of this country and consideration of its future at the very highest level of political power in the United States!
Can it really be true that these are the people who intend to decide on peace or war, instead of the international community?
What are they offering the Iraqi people?
The eviction of Saddam Hussein?
The Iraqi people will doubtless not mourn the loss of their dictator.
But then what?
Will there be a long-term American military occupation of one of the largest and most emblematic of Arab countries? Who can truly believe that this would be accepted?
Furthermore, what are they offering the rest of the world?
Will they pursue battles with other rogue states?
This is what General Wesley Clark, the former head of NATO forces in Yugoslavia, has led us to believe. To paraphrase his words, he said that if our ultimate aim is to put an end to the threat of terrorism, Iraq will be just one battle in a wider campaign.
Do we really know the extent of the destabilising chain reaction we are initiating in the region? This will pose a threat to the whole world.
A superpower with the greatest supremacy the world has ever known is openly affirming its imperialism, even if this means exacerbating divisions, increasing worldwide unrest and nurturing terrorism.
History will note that public opposition to this irresponsible policy was mobilised and expressed strongly throughout the world.
History will note that courageous people, including the leaders of the Churches, made their voices heard.
History will note that some governments dared to raise their voices in opposition and stand their ground in the face of pressure, slander and even threats.
What will we remember about the role of Europe in this historic situation?
I must say that I have not heard any comments this morning on the fundamental issue.
Will the European Union dare to demand the immediate end of this unjust, illegal and dangerous war?
What will it have to say about the fate of the Iraqi people,?
(Applause from the left)
... including Kurdish and Iranian refugees who may be threatened by this war?
Whether or not there is unanimity between all the Member States, there are stakes that Europe can and must win, whatever the circumstances. What is at stake is the fundamental basis of the international system, in place since 1945, and the law it embodies in the eyes of all democracies.
Europe must therefore express its view on the new strategic doctrine of the Bush administration, which exalts military force, justifies a unilateralist approach and legitimises pre-emptive war.
The European Union must strongly oppose the very grave precedent set by the American Secretary for Defence in failing to rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons or nerve gas against Iraq.
The European Union must also unequivocally condemn the irresponsible decision, taken unilaterally by a group of countries, including two Member States, to start a war without the approval of the UN Security Council, and against the will of the overwhelming majority of its members.
The European Union must commit itself in a much more proactive way to restarting the Middle East peace process, to find a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian problem.
Now, in allowing the war against Iraq to go ahead, we are allowing the situation in the Middle East to deteriorate to the lowest possible level.
The President of the Arab League has warned that we are opening the gates of hell.
Parliament is the only European institution to have made its stance on this war clear.
(Applause from the left)
I would like to remind you of the terms of the resolution we adopted on 30 January this year.
Parliament reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the rule of international law.
We voiced our full support for the work of Dr Hans Blix and Mr ElBaradei.
We expressed the opinion that the violations of resolution 1441 thus far identified by the inspectors did not justify military action.
We voiced our opposition to any unilateral military action.
We expressed our view that any pre-emptive attack would contravene both international law and the Charter of the United Nations. We stated that such action would result in an even greater crisis involving other countries in the region.
This, at least, will provide our President with the basis of a clear, explicit and strong intervention to make at the European Council today.
But even then, we shall not have heard the last of this.
In light of the extremely serious situation developing before our very eyes, which may seriously deteriorate, we must assume our responsibilities and turn the tide of war.
Old Europe must prove itself capable of setting out a vision of a new world.
We must listen to the urgent pleas of our fellow citizens.
This is what they expect of us.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking you for holding this debate, this extraordinary sitting. A similar sitting was held at the start of the first Gulf War.
Mr President, Mr Bush's declaration of war is illegal. The British Government is just splitting hairs in its pathetic attempts to justify military attack.
The United Nations has not failed.
It has represented the view of world public opinion correctly.
The existing procedures, with all their limitations, would have been more than sufficient to prevent the outbreak of war, to ensure the continuation of the inspections, and we are convinced that they would have brought about the disarmament of Saddam Hussein and - why not - his trial by an international court too, if only the United States and the United Kingdom had abided by the rules,
if only the other US vassal States, especially the current and future Members of the Union, had given the law precedence over gratitude towards the United States, which is understandable but belongs to a bygone age and was owed, in particular, to a much higher calibre administration than that currently in power.
The future heralded by tonight's attack is a future of war.
We are all wondering who is next on the list in President Bush's electioneering programme, for his list has nothing to do with the violation of international law or Security Council resolutions.
In 35 years, at least 106 resolutions have been violated: 31 by Israel, 23 by Turkey, 18 by Morocco, 16 by Iraq and so on. This completely arbitrary action, the lack of credibility of President Bush's speeches on democracy and the law now leave us bewildered and require us to act.
We are not Americans, we are Europeans, and today we must face up to the fact that a mockery has been made not just of international law but of European law too.
We believe that all the provisions of the Treaty have equal status and must be respected, including Article 19, which compels the European members of the Security Council to uphold the positions and interests of the Union. This they have clearly failed to do.
(Applause)
We would like the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, and Parliament to say so loud and clear.
The European Union, Commissioner Patten, cannot be reduced to a humanitarian agency,
(Applause)
and Parliament cannot be reduced to a humanitarian agency advisory board.
We consider that the United Kingdom and Spain's support of an attack to which even their own public are opposed is rash, illegal and incomprehensible.
(Applause)
We feel that the inconsistent behaviour of the Italian Government, which is to hold the next Presidency of the Union, of which it is a founder Member, has added to the prevailing confusion, but we also feel that France and Germany have also violated Article 19 in failing to seek agreement with the 15 Member States or with the Greek Presidency, which has been attempting to establish a role worthy of that name for the European Union right from the beginning.
We refuse to accept the choice now forced upon us by this situation: a choice between a position that is right but wholly ineffective, like the position of France and Germany, which failed to prevent war, and a position that is wrong, like that of the United Kingdom and Spain, which bewilders the people, facilitates war and paves the way for further wars.
If the European Union had had a permanent seat in the United Nations, if it had been compelled by shared institutions and binding rules to adopt a unified position right from the start, we dare to believe even now that war would not have started last night.
This is the challenge before us, before the Convention, although it does not always appear to be aware of the fact.
There are, however, more urgent, pressing signals we must send out, and the first concerns the Middle East.
Irrespective of the belated announcement on the roadmap, we do not believe that the Bush administration genuinely intends to bring about peace in the Middle East, to bring Israel's military operations to an end.
It will clearly be up to the European Union to make sure that the road map is genuinely implemented.
Mr President, we are expecting an initiative in this regard.
The second message concerns ourselves. It would be a serious, very serious mistake to postpone the Euro-Mediterranean Forum due to take place in Crete at the end of the month.
That would be another unnecessary sign of impotence, which we really cannot afford at this time.
(Applause)
Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I feel both sad and uneasy.
I feel sad because, as previous speakers have already said, war is always a sign of failure and because, unfortunately, what is happening is bound to fill us with sadness and also leave us dissatisfied.
I feel somewhat uneasy, however, because I actually believe that we have all been to some extent taken for a ride.
For weeks and for months, we were concerned with making the efforts necessary to achieve the disarmament of Iraq by peaceful means, whereas in reality, the United States' decision for military intervention had, in my opinion, been taken quite a while ago.
To be persuaded of this, one only has to read the report issued by the James Baker Institute last December, which laid out what the principles of US policy towards Iraq should be following the war.
I therefore believe that the decision to use force was taken several months ago.
We were encouraged to discuss disarmament by peaceful means and this gave the United States the time to muster its forces.
Having said that, the question we are facing, as Commissioner Patten said a short while ago, is not whether we in Europe want to be with the Americans or against them; whether or not we want to get on with the Americans.
The issue is much simpler than that: do you want, do we want, a Europe that is independent of the United States?
If the answer is 'yes', then this question must be put to the people, and we have clearly seen, in recent days, that the people wish to make their voice heard and to give their answer.
It is the people alone who will allow us to move ahead with the construction of an independent Europe, in other words a Europe that is not an adversary of the United States, but its partner on an equal footing.
We are told today that Iraq is dividing the European Union.
This is not true, ladies and gentlemen!
The Iraqi affair is merely revealing the true picture.
The European Union is deeply divided.
Some European States will always give the alliance with the United States priority over the construction of an independent Europe.
That is the reality of the situation.
It is because we and our governments have never had the courage to hold a debate on this subject that we have seen the spectacle with which we are all familiar.
This is the fault neither of France nor of Germany.
It is the fault of all the leaders of the countries of the European Union over the last forty years, who have never got to the bottom of the problem.
We shall have to resolve to do this.
If, however, we wish to see an independent Europe, we must also realise that this will come at a price.
We cannot want Europe to be independent and at the same time depend fully on the United States for its security, because it is the US that has to bear the brunt of mounting military operations in the event of serious problems.
If the European Union wishes to exist, it must be given the means to do so.
This is how things are; this is the reality of the situation!
Everything else is incidental.
It is all well and good to hold meeting after meeting, and for the European Union to see itself as some kind of super-NGO, but given its history, its ambitions should be somewhat different.
Mr President, like most groups, the EDD Group is divided.
Some of us consider war inevitable, some of us do not.
Our common task is to limit it as much as possible and warn neighbouring states not to interfere.
Let us pray that this war will end as soon as possible to avoid more innocent people becoming victims.
Let us then draw lessons from this and look forward to a lasting peace in the whole region, including peace between Israel and Palestine.
The Member States of the EU can help with aid for development, and the opening-up of our markets should bring prosperity to the region.
That approach may be the only means of avoiding an escalation of terrorism.
The lesson to be drawn is that we all support the United Nations and are willing to reform it to ensure that our common peace-keeping institution is capable of keeping the peace.
Kofi Annan wants a rapid reaction force to intervene for peace.
Why do we not go for that instead of making a common EU military force?
In conclusion, it is clear that a common foreign and security policy decided by qualified majority is not a solution.
In the European Council there is no qualified majority amongst those supporting the war, neither is there a qualified majority amongst those opposing it.
The group of five has a blocking minority, and the group of 10 has a blocking minority.
A common foreign policy following new rules on qualified majority would be a basket with nothing in it.
The only realistic approach is for the EU to continue the consensus and leave questions of war and peace to the United Nations.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, for ten years you have done nothing to prepare for a situation post - Saddam Hussein, to establish the protection of life and law in Iraq and the Middle East, and now, thanks to you, here we are discussing what to do after the war.
The war is a present to us from law-abiding Europe, your Europe.
Allow me to say that we non-violent, Ghandian protesters will fight from this moment onwards to ensure that war and other measures employed do not continue for one minute after Baghdad has been disarmed, not one minute!
Will we have the strength?
We are not going to shout 'Peace!' and then murder it as we did 70 years ago.
You say we are acting unlawfully?
As unlawfully as de Gaulle.
You are as law-abiding as Vichy!
We are acting as unlawfully as the Iraqi resistance, as unlawfully as the European resistance.
We tell you now that we are going to throw ourselves into battle without delay and fight for peace founded on freedom and the rule of law.
Cowardly Europe, Vichy's Europe!
It is not the Europe of those who suffered fighting fascism, the Europe of Altiero Spinelli, the Europe of Ernesto Rossi, the Europe of those who genuinely gave us the right to look the heirs of Lafayette in the eye too, which you are failing to do with your outdated fascist, communist, papist contempt for the world of international liberal and religious reform!
Mr President, the thoughts and prayers of my British Conservative colleagues today are with the men and women of my country's armed forces on whom has fallen the heavy and dangerous responsibility of disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction.
The international community has long recognised the threat that Saddam poses for the security of our world, but our institutions have sadly failed to implement its decisions and bring about Iraqi disarmament as the UN has demanded in 17 resolutions.
I have to say that, listening to this debate, I quite wonder whether some people ever intended that these resolutions should be implemented.
Today is not a day, however, to argue our differences over the reasons for this.
As the Commissioner has said, there are lessons which the UN, NATO and Europe will have to learn for the future.
That includes the practical reality of reaching a full European consensus when there clearly is division - there is even division in this debate.
It is because our first responsibility is for the defence and security of our people and the preservation of our democratic values - the very values which defend the freedom to participate in demonstrations such as those we have seen throughout Europe in recent days - that my party has given its clear support to the British Government and helped the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to secure a major and decisive vote of confidence in our Parliament last Tuesday evening.
Now that the war has started, the eyes of the world have clearly moved elsewhere, but I welcome the publication of the road map to peace in the Middle East and believe it should not be treated in the cynical way in which it has been referred to in this debate today.
If we are committed to peace in the Middle East we should all welcome that announcement.
I also welcome the recognition of the role of the UN in post-war reconstruction in Iraq.
I am very encouraged by what Commissioner Patten had to say today about reconstruction after what I thought was a rather different message last week.
There is no doubt that we enjoy peace, democracy and freedom of expression because European history has told us that the last generation, including the United States led by Roosevelt, fought to preserve these freedoms.
Failure to confront Hussein now would create dangers to those freedoms in the future.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, on behalf of our group I should like to give vent to our anger, our bitterness and our strong condemnation of the serious violation of the international law of the UN Charter by all the countries that are embarking upon this war.
To my alarm I discover that some in this Parliament are willing to accept political responsibility.
Had we not, I thought, actually agreed that we wanted to work through the Security Council?
That we wanted to give our backing to Kofi Annan, Hans Blix and the weapons inspectors in the attempt to disarm Saddam?
That we wanted Saddam before the International Court of Justice?
Wonderful! - but, then, this was to be done via the Security Council.
Now we see that the Security Council route is no longer being followed, a unilateral step to war has been taken and I hear of some who are willing to accept political responsibility for this.
My group, and I hope the majority of this Parliament, is not willing to accept any political responsibility for this.
This means that we in this House call on all the Member States, all the governments of Europe, to make neither political nor military contributions to this war.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, this means that, while the disarmament approach was beginning to bear fruit and Hans Blix and Kofi Annan were urging the international community to respect international law, this international law has today been dealt a heavy blow.
That has to be said first.
Of course we are together responsible for reconstruction, of course we are together on the side of international law and the multilateral approach.
Which is why we also say and I say here that Europe must not be the victim of the Pax Americana of the US. We must again seek new unity within Europe.
We must again seek that one voice, and that one voice is one of conflict prevention, one of contribution to international law and the multilateral approach.
It is also the voice that again and again will ultimately accept the responsibility worldwide for that international dialogue, for dialogue within Islam and, from our world, for cooperation with the Arab world, but as my group chairman Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo rightly said: 'The flower of war is a damned poor way to start this dialogue'.
(Applause from the left)
Starting from that basic thought, Mr President, I want to say here again that our Member States, if we feel that we need a common approach, should adhere to the articles in our Community Treaty.
Then in spite of all the differences we must also actually seek that common ground.
That common ground was and is the Security Council, is international law and can never be a unilateral step.
Our common demand is, of course, that the war be limited.
It is, of course, for Europe to be strengthened.
It is, of course, for efforts within the reality that we are experiencing today to ensure that we again take international initiatives.
The President-in-Office, Mr Papandreou, has rightly said that today with the leaders we will again have to think up measures.
But also try to hear the voice of our peoples in Europe, who this time are ahead of our leaders, who have understood what kind of Europe they want.
As you are together as leaders today, respect this voice of the European population and realise that this voice stands on the side of peace and international law.
The United States, Mr President, may be capable of starting a war unilaterally, but neither the United States, nor any other individual country, is able unilaterally to bring about permanent peace in this world.
For this we need a strong Europe and a strong United Nations.
I hope that our European leaders will hear this voice today.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, the unilateral attack by the United States demonstrates once again that the United Nations has not been a valid instrument.
The European Union has also demonstrated that the common foreign policy has not been common.
Perhaps we should remember 30 August 1954 when a European Union of defence became impossible.
I regret the letter of the eight members.
I also regret that the Spanish Government has expended more energy justifying the use of arms than seeking diplomatic solutions to the conflict.
I am glad that the Catalonian Parliament has adopted a resolution in which it asked the Spanish Government to support the role of the Security Council so that the work of the inspectors may continue, so that the use of force outside the context of the United Nations may be rejected, and I am glad that the demonstrations in the streets, in the city of Barcelona and in other main cities in Catalonia, have demonstrated that our country is against war and in agreement with its Parliament.
Mr President, war has begun and we have had the first ten Iraqi deaths in Baghdad.
These are facts.
From now on weapons will be doing the talking and words will become weapons; they are no longer reliable.
Let us look at the facts and the real agenda that is being employed will become clear.
What must our agenda be?
Our peoples are deeply disillusioned, Mr President-in-Office, because Europe with its powerful institutions has been unable to avoid this war.
Our European politicians will have to answer to their people for their impotence.
Our European politicians will have to find solutions if they are to provide a real answer for this in the future.
Secondly: war kills, and in particular innocent citizens, women and children.
We in the European Union must try to relieve the misery and ease the suffering.
War destroys and, as Mr van den Berg has said, we shall therefore have to build an international framework for reconstruction.
Thirdly: people know where the war begins, but no one knows where it may end.
The Kurds in Northern Iraq fear the loss of what little freedom and autonomy they have built up so painstakingly and at the cost of so many lives.
They again fear finding themselves between the hammer and the anvil.
Will the Kurds be sacrificed to do Ankara a favour?
The Turkish Kurds are fearful of being militarily overwhelmed.
The Kurds in Northern Iraq fear permanent occupation.
The Iranian opposition fears that the mullahs will take the opportunity to destroy them.
Will the European Union see the opposition in Iraq being completely sidelined?
In the Middle East the frustrations will flare up higher than ever.
Only a solution with a Palestinian state, which is clearly coming, can bring these frustrations to an end.
Mr President, with the United Nations ruled out of the game, with NATO rendered powerless, and with the European Union coming unravelled, the revelation of the day, ladies and gentlemen, is not war, or to be more precise the international 'rat hunt', which it is claimed began tonight, although this claim is wrong because Iraq has been bombed every day for the last twelve years by the empire - or rather by the empire and its flunkeys.
Nor is the revelation of the day the folly of the empire, this American empire to which we Europeans, like cowards, have been handing the keys to the world for years, whilst remaining fascinated, despite their shift towards totalitarianism, by their culture, their images and their language.
No, the novelty of the day is that the age-old dream of multilateralism and collective security, which inspired the entire twentieth century, has been shattered.
Like the League of Nations once did, the UN is crumbling into insignificance.
The international community is nothing but a hollow formula for supporting the empire and its Anglo-Saxon flunkeys.
All that remains are States and only France, assisted by Belgium and Germany, remains to save Europe's honour.
Consequently, in this slightly ridiculous debate, there is only one thing to say: 'The European Union is dead!
Long live the sovereignty of the world's nations!
Long live the Iraqi nation!
