Europe's relations with Russia have also been at the heart of your Presidency's work, Mrs Merkel.
When, in Samara, you were able to tell Mr Putin what our 'no-go areas' were and on what foundations we could and should cooperate, you took Europe forward in this regard too.
The German Presidency has also been very active in the area, sensitive as it is, of justice and internal affairs.
I should like very warmly to thank the Minister of the Interior, Mr SchÃ€uble, who cooperated very effectively with our Parliament on all of these matters.
Let us also pay tribute to the progress made in other areas, which are perhaps less spectacular but more tangible for our fellow citizens.
This progress has been pointed out several times over the last few days: reduced roaming costs, voluntary modulation in the agricultural sector, in the fisheries sector, the environment, etc. Obvious progress has been made on all of these issues over the last six months, and that is no mean feat.
Finally, I shall conclude with the agreement that was reached in the early hours of last Saturday, on the reform of the European Treaty.
I shall not go back over the extreme difficulty of the task, apart from to deplore certain remarks which - I shall speak my mind here - are not worthy of the sacrifices made by the people of Europe over the last 50 years to guarantee a climate of peace and reconciliation among us all.
(Applause)
I embrace the surge of hope created by the compromise concluded in Brussels on the relaunch of the EU institutions.
Is that to say that my group, and especially its European People's Party (Christian Democrats) arm, is fully satisfied with the new draft treaty?
Everyone will realise that the answer is no.
The European symbols, the title of Foreign Affairs Minister, the double majority voting within short deadlines - we regret all of that.
However, politics, and especially European politics, is the art of compromise.
The agreement reached by the German Presidency in a joint effort is a good agreement that we will support.
Thanks to you, Mrs Merkel, thanks to your country and also to the goodwill of the 27, the last six months have been very positive for European integration.
We are extremely grateful to you for it.
(Applause)
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the German Presidency has been a success, the German Presidency has set new standards.
That is what the President said at the beginning of the debate and, Madam Chancellor, the presence of the German Government and the competence of its members, particularly those from the Social Democratic Party, have made a lasting impression.
Last weekend's Summit achieved less than we would have liked, but it achieved a great deal.
The progress made at the weekend was not negligible; it was significant.
We have taken many significant steps forward.
Much of what you have reported on and what the Commission President has described was demanded by the European Parliament.
I should like to explain why it bodes well that you stood firm in these negotiations.
Much took place behind closed doors, but we meet in public.
I should therefore like to share the following: I have learnt that during the night you explained that if there were no unanimity you would convene the intergovernmental conference by a qualified majority and there would be a vote.
As this spectre of secession hung over the room - and some in this Europe wish to support it - you held your nerve, stood up and said that countries needed to put their cards on the table.
At this, several gave ground and then there came the unanimous result.
That explains how you led the negotiations to such a successful conclusion last weekend.
(Applause)
To those who only want to represent their own interests in Europe, who only want to appeal to national interests, I say, as your predecessor, Konrad Adenauer, did with characteristic bluntness: I must not slaughter the cow that I wish to milk.
He was right, and his words still ring true for the European Union today.
(Applause)
We have made significant progress.
Europe is now much more transparent.
There is transparency in the Commission, and also in Parliament, but not in the European Council.
We talk about Europe being in crisis, but last weekend has made it even more plain that it is not the European institutions that are in crisis; it is above all the governments of the European Union's Member States that are in crisis.
(Applause)
Madam Chancellor, I am not talking about all governments, just some of them.
I should like to thank the Heads of State or Government who fought on our side: Romano Prodi, Guy Verhofstadt, Jean-Claude Juncker and you yourself, who said: we want European unity because there is no alternative.
There were other governments who did not join in, who wanted something different.
The Polish Government - not the Polish people, who, contrary to their government, are pro-European - should remember that in its history Poland had the liberum veto.
The Polish Parliament of Nobles could only make a decision if there was unanimous agreement.
The liberum veto was the downfall of the Polish Commonwealth, amongst other things.
We will not have the European Union inherit this liberum veto, because we do not want it to be our undoing, and we will not allow the European Union to be led down a road that it must not go down.
Europe and the European Union are an idea. It is the idea of overcoming the demons and enmities of the past through European integration.
We will not allow a handful of people to resurrect past enmities and destroy the idea of Europe.
That is precisely what you put a stop to at the weekend, and we thank you for it.
(Loud and sustained applause)
I should now like to say a few words on a disturbing moment in these negotiations.
Madam Chancellor, our generation, regardless of the part of Germany from which we come, has a duty that we, like all democratic politicians in our country, try to live up to, namely to draw the right conclusions from our country's mistakes and from the crimes that were committed in our people's name.
The right conclusion that we Germans have drawn was to anchor the reunified Germany in the European Union, to make it part of an integrated community of nations, so as to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated.
That is our duty; that is what we are working towards together, whether Socialists, Christian Democrats, Liberals or Greens.
That is our common obligation, our common task, which we Germans - and I am saying this as a Member of this international Parliament - must, in my opinion, live up to.
We therefore also have the right to say that anyone who wants to use the dead of the Second World War to bargain for more votes in the Council of Ministers misunderstands what European politics is all about and should be rejected out of hand.
(Loud and sustained applause)
Madam President-in-Office, you said that the European Parliament was the big winner of this round.
We are the big winner because we will act.
The Council will continue to tie its own hands with its arcane voting methods.
Congratulations!
Once our majorities at both first and second reading are taken into account, we will be the decisive force in the European Union, just as we have been on roaming, REACH and the services directive.
You have just signed it now, with the European flag behind you.
In 2057 it is the pro-Europeans that people will remember and not those who wanted to stop this unstoppable idea.
My heartfelt thanks go to the German Presidency.
Thank you for your visit and for the excellent cooperation.
Finally, thank you also to Wilhelm SchÃ¶nfelder, who is sitting next to you and who has done a magnificent job representing the Federal Republic of Germany for all of these years.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
If the Parliament President were permitted to express approval, he would have done so now.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - President-in-Office, congratulations on a green light for Europe and a grand legacy for your leadership.
Action on climate change and energy security had made yours a noteworthy Presidency.
Securing agreement for reform of our Union has made it a great Presidency.
Joseph Conrad once observed 'Being a woman is a terribly difficult task, since it consists principally in dealing with men'.
(Laughter)
Nowhere was this truer than in the Council, where many of your counterparts seemed intent on burying Treaty reform.
It is a tribute to your character that you convinced, cajoled, and cautioned agreement where none had seemed possible.
Who in the months following 2005's referendum results would have thought that institutional reform was still within reach; that Europe's leaders would recognise the need for common action on energy security, climate change, foreign policy or shelve requirements for unanimity in the Council in favour of qualified majority voting in 36 new policy areas?
We are pleased too that you recognised Europe's growing political pluralism by giving Parliament three representatives at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.
Combined with making justice and home affairs subject to parliamentary scrutiny, this proves that European democracy has come of age and that this House is now an equal partner in governance.
Agreement came at a price, however, and that price was not simply a derogation here and an opt-out there.
The real casualty was idealism: losing the symbols of our Union and replacing the relative simplicity of the Constitutional Treaty with bureaucratic opaqueness is a pity.
As a result, your new Amending Treaty reads like the instructions for building a Japanese pagoda translated into English by the Chinese middle-man.
(Laughter and applause)
As for the content, President-in-Office, the devil will be in the detail.
Your propensity to play the fairy godmother means, I am afraid, that the naysayers - die Verfassungsfeinde heissen sie immer noch in Bayern - were rewarded in proportion to their negativity, while the friends of the Constitution - the silent majority - received precious little for supporting the Constitution signed by all Member States in Rome.
(Applause)
And so the French and the Dutch struck again with a side-swipe at fair and open markets.
The full effects of the British and Polish derogation from the Charter of Fundamental Rights are not yet known.
For Liberals and Democrats it beggars belief that a British Prime Minister is depriving UK citizens of the rights which made his country respected - and which are now guaranteed to other citizens - in order to pander to the popular press.
(Loud applause)
Only time will tell whether the changes to the text are cosmetic, or a wholesale attack on Europe's fundamental civic and market values.
However, politics is always a matter of bricolage.
While the result is not flawless, the edifice you have built is sturdy: the roof should not leak as long as the building blocks of progress are cemented by the mortar of determination.
Let us remind national leaders here and now that Europe demands give as well as take.
Until they resolve to cooperate fully, the Union will never be fit for purpose.
President-in-Office, six months is barely long enough for an EU President to shine.
However, as the leader who brought us the promise of a permanent President your reign was memorable.
Who else can boast of ending deadlock in the Council and ridding us of the much-maligned pillar structure?
Who else can claim credit for creating a European Diplomatic Service and a High Representative to boost our role on the world stage, and who else would have achieved so much without action which was hart aber herzlich?
The Portuguese Presidency must harness this momentum to ensure future developments are driven not by events beyond our continent, but, in the best tradition of the European Union, by idealism within.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that the almost lunatic position of the social-democratic President against the democratically elected Polish Government threatens to somewhat overshadow this joyful occasion, a day on which the goodwill of all concerned has brought us to an agreement, I would above all like to thank Chancellor Merkel, to whom we are all sincerely grateful, for her efforts.
We recognise that the President has got our institutions back into gear, and as Parliament we also appreciate President Sarkozy's mediation over the last few days.
As a former member of the European Convention, I would like to emphasise certain points to which we remain opposed: the reduction of the composition of the Commission, the absence of certain key rights of the family and children in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the absence of references to our roots and the failure to mention the symbols that have identified the Union up to now.
The flag, the anthem and the motto hold symbolic value for our citizens; it is dangerous to abandon them in an era of mass immigration and the loss of core values.
The Union is not and must not be a State; it is a communion of States, and requires visual symbols to represent it.
If we separate social policy from trade and monetary policy, we increase the risk of a Europe that, as in previous treaties, concerns itself with tractor windscreen wipers, but is incapable of playing a decisive role in creating wider prosperity both within and outside of the Union.
I welcome the increase in the power of the European Parliament, whose duty it is to restore in citizens and political groups the ability to defend national and regional traditions, combining them with wider Western culture.
Cooperation in legal and criminal matters must result in harmonisation of trial times and elimination of reduced sentences for serious crimes against security.
There is an immediate need for migration policy - the Mediterranean countries of the Union can be left on their own no longer!
For this reason we applaud the increased support for Frontex.
Strengthening relations between the Union and Africa means overcoming poverty, terrorist organisations and the ever more worrying synergy between the Islamic radicalism of Iran and Hezbollah, which threatens both moderate and secular Islam and the West.
We are therefore grateful, Mrs Merkel, for what you have achieved, and we would renew our request: today, there is also a need for a Charter of Duties; duties and rights cannot be separated!
I am sorry, Hans-Gert, it is only me!
(Laughter)
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the result is okay; it is even very good.
In plain language we have to say that the German Presidency - together with all those who wanted to move Europe forward - has managed to move Europe forward.
The script is fine, but the soundtrack was awful.
It was too painful to listen to.
I want to stress one point: on the one hand our citizens are reassured that Europe can act and make decisions, but the citizens of Europe have also been excluded from the process and in the longer term this will prove untenable.
We cannot build Europe unless our citizens help to shape the construction process.
If we continue as we are then at some point the edifice will crumble, like so many of our childhood dreams.
To keep the image, Europe is experiencing a midlife crisis.
Somehow, thanks to some very skilful manoeuvring from a handful of people, success was achieved.
Incidentally, in France you get the impression that Sarkozy was the only one at the Summit, and no one else.
It is very good to hear the plaudits being shared out more widely today.
On another point: something happened that we Greens cannot accept and that we will oppose to the end.
It is not possible to opt out of a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Either we have one or we do not.
Surely it is absurd to say that we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights with common values that applies in some places and does not apply in others.
We might go to Mr Putin and say: we are a Community of values.
Mr Putin and the Chinese will counter: except for where you are not!
This is impossible.
(Applause)
Over the next few years we want a process to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights part of the European Union.
Every British citizen and every Polish citizen is entitled to the same rights as any other European citizen.
If that is not the case then we are offering the State concerned a privileged partnership.
With Europe you are either in or out.
Let us put an end to this nonsense!
I am firmly convinced that we are facing challenges that we will not be able to overcome as individual nations.
These national ritualistic chants that we have at Summit meetings pour poison on our plans.
Each nation must decide through its government whether it wants to be on board or not.
The good thing about this Treaty is that at some point there will be a withdrawal clause.
We are not forced to stay together for ever.
Anyone who does not wish to does not have to.
The tyranny of a veto-wielding minority is as undemocratic as it gets.
That is why, Madam President-in-Office, it was certainly impressive to see how you, a woman, dealt with those machos like Blair.
I am not only talking about the twins, because Tony Blair was the one who took an axe to our project.
Despite everything already being signed and sealed he came back and said: I cannot.
One of the few things that I have learnt in politics is that once something is signed there is no turning back.
What is more, the issues that were being disputed had already been resolved in the Convention, including the scope of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Anyone who goes back on that shows that they do not take Europe seriously.
The most tragic, saddest aspect of all of this is that there are governments that do not take Europe seriously.
You are right, Martin, they want to milk Europe and at the same time they want to eat the cow, sell it.
We cannot tolerate this and that is why we Greens will be holding a campaign called: We want our rights back!
(Loud applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, my group will have the opportunity to return in detail to the various important dimensions of the future treaty that you mentioned.
I should like to confine myself today to just one issue that the President-in-Office of the Council has not mentioned.
What, in practice, is going to change the decision taken by the 27 to withdraw free and undistorted competition from the list of the EU's objectives?
Because one of two things is true: either the European leaders believe that this is merely a communications exercise designed to reassure, at little cost, the people of Europe, a growing number of whom see this obsession with competition as one of the reasons for the erosion of the social acquis, for the rapid growth in job insecurity and, vice versa, for the explosion in dividends; or this is a serious matter and, therefore, we absolutely must know what its practical implications are.
Those behind the first theory have solid arguments to draw on.
Firstly, the framework principle of an open market economy in which there is free competition appears on numerous occasions in the parts of the current treaty that will be replicated as they stand.
Secondly, a protocol specially devoted to reaffirming competition policy has been adopted by the European Council itself and will be included in the final text.
Finally, some of the provisions of the treaty that are based on the principle in question have not been amended in any way whatsoever.
It follows, then, that, despite the impact made by the European Council, there will be nothing new under the sun in this regard.
If there is nothing new, I believe that this will be a case of disgraceful deceit on the part of the Heads of State or Government who, in the eyes of many of our fellow citizens, are still pushing for a pluralist public debate on the future treaty as a whole, or the double treaty as a whole, a debate that would culminate in an EU-wide referendum.
I shall therefore listen very carefully to your explanations on this subject, Mrs Merkel.
What is going to change in relation to free competition, and will these changes affect the substance of the draft Constitutional Treaty or not?
In any case, I call on all those who are sensitive to this issue to take the European leaders at their word: free competition is not your aim - let us see if it is not!
The first, imminent, test will be the fate in store for the draft directive on the opening up to competition of all postal services.
In countries such as Sweden, in which this liberalisation is under way, it clearly has unfavourable consequences for employment and social and territorial cohesion, two areas that remain objectives of the Union.
Logically, then, this directive should be withdrawn or rejected.
Let us meet in July for this test of truth.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, we have come to know Chancellor Merkel as a charming, efficient, diplomatic and convincing version of Bismarck.
Chancellor Merkel, you united Europe under German leadership, letting it look as though Poland was the problem.
The Polish twins helped you by mentioning the war.
Many Germans were also the victims of Nazi Germany.
The argument is not valid.
But from 2017, it is you who can govern the EU with Turkey.
Poland did not gain or lose.
The losers are the 21 small and medium-sized countries.
My country's strength has been halved.
You doubled German influence, why blame Poland for that?
Will you always accept one citizen, one vote?
Will you accept this principle in the United Nations with India and China?
Would you give India and China 15 votes for one German vote?
The Polish proposal is not Polish at all.
It was presented by Sweden, and invented by a British mathematician.
Is it not also used in the German Bundesrat?
In Nice, Poland got 27 votes because Chirac would not allow Germany to have more votes than France.
Poland is now offering to reduce its share from 27 to 6, allowing you to have 9 votes instead of 29.
Shame on those 21 governments that criticised Poland for arguing their interests, plus the general interest, in an understandable system.
Nice is difficult; the Merkel deal is impossible.
If you succeed in ratification, your name will be forever linked to an EU which cannot be understood by the public.
Who can remember figures of populations changing every year?
Who can count if a law is passed without having a computer?
A double majority sounds easy but it is very difficult to use.
The Penrose system is much easier and fairer.
It could be further simplified by giving Germany six votes, France, the UK and Italy five, Poland four, then we would only have 81 votes together, and most of us could remember all the figures in our heads.
Just like you can in the German Bundesrat!
A more just system would be to give all Member States one vote each, and require the support of 75% of the Member States in the Council plus a simple majority in the European Parliament.
The American Senate does not take votes according to the size of the State.
Why here, and why make it look as though Poland is a thief?
The new system is also as bad for German voters.
It moves the legislative function into executive and judging powers.
We go backwards in history from Montesquieu to Merkel and Machiavelli.
It adds to the democratic deficit.
(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)
The core in democracy is the ability to hold elections, have a new majority and then new laws.
This core will now be further eroded.
The Constitution will have another name but the same content, therefore it should also be subject to referendums.
Six proponents and four opponents of the Constitution have sent an open letter to you calling for referendums.
77% of all Europeans want a referendum; only 20% are against - and we know all of them, they are ministers!
Listen to your own German citizens who want to be heard by referendum.
Sign the petition for a referendum in all EU Member States at the xO9.eu website.
(DE) Madam Chancellor, as someone who hails from North Schleswig I have other reasons to hold you in high esteem, and I should like to thank you very much for your commitment to the debate on climate change.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mrs Merkel, you will have to excuse me for the fact that I too have chosen to opt out of the jubilant mood that prevails in this House following the agreement that was reached at the European Summit.
I will not be expecting then any kisses from Mr Schulz or Mr Cohn-Bendit, but I think I will live.
What was predicted has come to pass: the so-called reform treaty has turned out to be nothing more and nothing less than a camouflaged version of the European Constitution, in other words, we are getting old wine in new bottles.
The reform treaty does not create more transparency.
In fact, the text has become more incomprehensible than ever before.
Nothing fundamental is being done about the democratic deficit.
There is no mention of referendums in the Member States; the role which the national parliaments will be playing will, in practice, be non-existent given the high threshold that is being built in; the European Union's boundaries are not any closer to being defined.
Even the Dutch proposal to include the Copenhagen criteria in the text has been thrown out.
The typically Belgian compromise - if I can put it this way - about the decision-making process takes no account of the fact that the smaller Member States will lose out in terms of influence.
Finally, European legislation clearly prevails over national legislation.
I can assure you, Mrs Merkel, that the triumphalism will be short-lived.
People are refusing to take the referendums in France and the Netherlands into account.
If this is the upshot of a two-year period of reflection, then I am bound to say that this is a deeply sad state of affairs.
The triumphalism will be short-lived if no new referendums are held therefore.
In the other Member States too, the distrust of the people will only increase, because the EU's democratic support base has become very flimsy.
There is an enormous chasm between European officialdom and the man in the street - this is, in fact, also borne out by Turkey's possible accession to the European Union - and I regret having to affirm, Mrs Merkel, that you have not taken any initiatives either in order to close the gap between the citizen and public opinion in one way or another.
Whatever happens, something will need to be done as a matter of urgency.
It is high time the European Union started to take public opinion in Europe into account.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the German presidency truly got Europe moving. Unfortunately, however, not in the direction of a prosperous Union within the global economy, but rather towards something more reminiscent of the regime of Fidel Castro.
It is all too clear from the conclusions of the Brussels summit that the Union wishes to preserve its excessively costly and inefficient social systems.
It is also clear that the leaders of the EU states still believe in the dream of full employment and stable prices.
And thirdly, the Union has again retreated by another step from its founding principle, from free economic competition without barriers.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you to take heed of the fact that the suppression of free economic competition, which is the driving force of the European economy, constitutes a serious warning to all democratically-minded citizens.
It is only a small step from the trampling-upon of freedoms in the area of commerce to the trampling-upon of fundamental human rights and freedoms.
The outcome of the German presidency is not, in my view, a courageous and challenging path to prosperity, but rather the easy path of populism, which leads straight to the hell of institutional autocracy.
The debate is closed.
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes
Membership of Parliament
The French authorities have informed us that Mrs Marie-Line Reynaud, Mr Pierre Moscovici and Mr Jean-Claude Fruteau have been elected to the French National Assembly.
Under Article 7(2) of the Act of 20 September 1976 as amended on 25 June and 23 September 2002 these Members have had incompatible mandates since 26 June 2007, the date of the constituent sitting of the French National Assembly.
Since the election of Mrs Reynaud and Mr Moscovici has been disputed and the deadline for disputing the election of Mr Fruteau is not until 28 June, and since the French Constitutional Court has to take decisions on the disputes as soon as possible, I suggest postponing the establishment of the vacancies concerned until the proceedings before the Constitutional Court have come to an end.
Given that their mandates have been incompatible since 26 June 2007, Mrs Reynaud, Mr Moscovici and Mr Fruteau may not at present take part in the business of the European Parliament and its bodies.
In addition, I note that the office of Vice-President, hitherto held by Mr Pierre Moscovici, has, with his agreement, now fallen vacant.
In view of the exceptional nature of the situation, I propose to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs.
European Council meeting of 21-22 June 2007 Activity report of the German Presidency (continuation of debate)
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on
the European Council report and Commission statement: European Council meeting of 21-22 June 2007 and
the Council statement: activity report of the German Presidency.
(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate shows just how powerful the European idea is and how much it unites us at times of crisis, even across party lines, giving us the strength to say what needs to be said.
I am a Christian Democrat, but I should like to express my unreserved support for the words of my fellow Member, the Social Democrat, Martin Schulz.
I should like to support every sentence.
As a German, I recall the final speech that the French President, FranÃ§ois Mitterand, made to this Parliament in 1995.
He said: nationalism leads to war.
This is Europe's strength, which we must preserve through thick and thin: a Europe that defends peace prosperity and social security.
Above all, however, I should like to thank the Council Presidency and you personally, Mrs Merkel.
You faced a mammoth task and you succeeded.
Not all of our hopes have been realised, but the substance of the proposals has been maintained both in climate and energy policy and where the reform Treaty is concerned.
You have succeeded in extending Parliament's rights, ensuring that European law continues to take precedence, strengthening subsidiarity in many areas, clarifying the delimitation of competences and much more besides.
Questions have also been asked about the principle of competition.
We will have to take a closer look at the implications.
Overall I believe that the German Presidency has been successful on the two most important points: it has been successful in implementing many initiatives in the ongoing programme, and it has cooperated in exemplary fashion with the European Parliament.
For this too, I should like to thank you personally, Dr Merkel, together with all the members of the German Government and the German Representation.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen!
Well done, Mrs Merkel, warm congratulations!
You have fulfilled your obligations as President of the Council.
The European Parliament had asked you to convene an Intergovernmental Conference and to resume the European Union's journey towards a constitution, a journey that has brought us peace and prosperity that now offers the globalised world a model of democracy and solidarity.
After a two-year period of reflection, the majority of the states and citizens came out in favour of forging ahead towards Europe's future.
Despite many abrogations, which I hope will not upset the EU's cohesion, we have helped those who had difficulties with the treaty.
We now have to prepare a mandate for this reform treaty, and we believe that is a good thing.
It contains a clear commitment to the principles, values and objectives of the EU.
In my opinion, the legally binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be enshrined in the treaty immediately after the preamble.
The extension of codecision and qualified majority voting are also positive aspects.
I nevertheless regret that clarity and transparency have been lost.
The symbols, the flag and the anthem also bear witness to the joy and freedom in Europe that Beethoven and Schiller emphasised.
I can assure you that we will continue to use these symbols and hold them up with genuine pride.
In this conviction, President-in-Office, we will now in the Intergovernmental Conference work together with the national parliaments and civil society to strengthen the European Union constitutionally.
We will continue to fight on this road, which Walter Hallstein described as constructio continua, and which Jean Monnet spoke of as 'step by step'.
And like sherpas, step by step, we will climb the Himalayas.
Thank you very much, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
(DE) President-in-Office, Mr President, my sincere congratulations on your excellent work, Madam Chancellor.
You have achieved a very good result, you have fulfilled expectations.
That is no great surprise to the German liberals, because even before the Bundestag elections we were convinced you would make a good leader; I am just saying this for the benefit of Mr Schulz, who said so in effusive terms today, but better late than never.
Before the German Presidency began, the Free Democrats in the European Parliament had urged the at the time still very hesitant Federal Government to set an ambitious target regarding the constitutional treaty.
We are therefore pleased that at the end of your presidency we not only have a timetable, but that the contents have been agreed as well.
However, the price that had to be paid for that is extremely high.
Names have been changed, longer time periods set, derogations allowed.
With the Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular that is a real disaster.
The so-called reform treaty is more complex and less transparent.
A minority has had its way at the majority's expense and the idea of Europe has suffered a severe blow as a result.
Whether the decisions that were taken in Brussels in the middle of the night will now actually be implemented remains an open question.
There is no guarantee that they will.
The Intergovernmental Conference must meet first and then things will not get moving until ratification begins in the 27 countries.
Everything is therefore still open.
The outcome of the German Presidency is therefore a fairly realistic reflection of the current mood within the EU.
It is not abysmal, but it is nothing to celebrate either.
What we have is the remote Europe of summits, not the close Europe of citizens.
In view of the difficulties that would have made an outcome almost impossible, the Presidency has taken us a good step forwards.
More would have been impossible.
Mrs Merkel, you have said how you would like Europe's citizens to remember the year 2007 in 50 years' time.
I would like to add one hope to that: it would please me very much if in 2057 - and I might just live so long - all Europeans were to see the wonderful sentence of the Berlin Declaration 'we have united for the better' not as a decision taken in a back room but as something they experience every day.
That would be a tremendous success for your Presidency.
My sincere thanks once again!
(Applause)
A UachtarÃ¡in, A UachtarÃ¡in in Oifig na Comhairle, A UachtarÃ¡in an ChoimisiÃºin, comhghairdeachas leis an SeansailÃ©ir Merkel agus leis na daoine go lÃ©ir i rialtas na GearmÃ¡ine.
First of all I should like to say that, when we speak of the results of the last week's summit, so much time and effort is given to reported emotions in the media or to the interpretation of what one person said to another, whereas the reality should be that we celebrate the success of the ability of all the leaders of all the Member States of the European Union to follow the leadership given by the German Chancellor, the President-in-Office, Angela Merkel, in finding and charting a way forward for the future development of the European Union.
In particular, because of the sensitivities that are involved in so many areas, whether it is the issue of votes in the Council, the rights of national parliaments or codecision in the area of justice and home affairs, these are fundamental points that are of national importance to those countries and it would be wrong for any leader of any government to fail to put forward their concerns with regard to those areas.
However, despite the hot wind that blows around many of these summits, success was achieved and it was achieved because the core principles of the European Union - i.e. compromise, consensus, understanding and tolerance - were brought together under your great stewardship, Chancellor Merkel.
The other areas in which the German Presidency has succeeded over the last six months are ones that we will benefit from in the future - and I say 'we' not just to mean those of us in Parliament: we as citizens and consumers within the European Union will be able to benefit from the work you have done.
(DE) Madam Chancellor, you have accomplished a hard task in difficult times.
Thank you.
Apologies for my German!
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I would like to underline once again what the chairman of my group has already said: it was a great weight off our minds when the outcome of the summit became known, and we shared your relief and your pleasure one hundred percent.
We were not surprised at Mr Prodi's disappointment either, however, because during this summit it of course became clear how everything was touch and go and what national egoisms actually threaten Europe.
In the days that followed - and in fact even during the summit itself - it struck me from reports and interviews about this difficult situation that in the light of this loss of further integration, which was also the subject of the summit, many people actually began to think positively about Europe again.
Basically, this is something quite simple: you only really understand what you have had when it is taken away from you.
Sometimes you only realise when it is too late, but this time it happened just in time.
I am extremely grateful for your negotiating skill, because I believe you were able to play very skilfully on simple matters such as how people tick and work in this Europe that is bequeathed to us.
There is also something I would like, however.
You have succeeded in bringing people closer to Europe again.
I would also like to see this transparency, the public nature of the summit, in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.
We should not allow this distance to occur and shut people out again.
I believe that would even help us in Poland, where we have the support of 80% of the population.
I thank you and wish you much success for the future!
(DE) Mr President, like many on the Left in Europe, I cannot approve of anything that encourages nationalism and makes it even more difficult to use the European Union's resources to solve social, ecological and global problems.
I am therefore a supporter of European integration aimed at a federal European Union with of course a federal constitution, but one with other principles, other priorities and other objectives.
I, too, owe you my respect, Mrs Merkel.
You have succeeded in giving a broad public the impression that the Brussels compromise is your masterstroke.
In many respects, however, the compromise is a continuation of the same old things.
It brings no major change in policy, only a seemingly better design.
The rejection of the draft constitution in France and the Netherlands at the time was rooted not in fear of a superstate but in fear of a Europe that was not a social Europe, and you have probably done nothing to allay that fear with the compromise reached in Brussels, the half measures, the postponed problems and the jostling for power we saw over the weighting of votes.
That is why we continue to demand referenda in the EU Member States - on this treaty too.
There is absolutely no reason to fear that if, as the most recent surveys show, the majority of Europe's citizens are in favour of Europe.
If this treaty is a good treaty, there is also a good chance that the majority of the population will support it.
- (SK) Madam Chancellor, I too would like to join the ranks of those who have been congratulating you, and who appreciate the agreement you have achieved over the question of Europe's future.
The Treaty establishing the Constitution may have been signed in Rome with great fanfare by the Heads of State, but the period which came next proved that these Heads of State had simply made a pleasant excursion for the purposes of signing a meaningless piece of paper.
Their signatures did not have the backing of a popular vote, as became apparent later in the sorrowful period of ratifications and referenda in various Member States.
This period revealed all of Europe's common weaknesses.
For that reason alone your success in the negotiations and your skills in achieving compromise deserve high regard.
Madam Chancellor, it is for you that the fanfares should be heard today.
After the signing, I believe that our efforts as MEPs will be motivated by a vision of cooperation, and not a struggle between the old 15 and the new Member States.
I am sure we will succeed in weeding out each and every point of ambiguity in the Treaty.
Finally, I would like to wish you a very pleasant holiday - because you certainly deserve it.
Mr President, Chancellor, President Barroso, I am not going to try my German out today.
Others have done it much better than I could.
As the German Presidency comes to an end, I start by congratulating the Chancellor on her very successful pursuit of the climate change agenda over the past six months.
The European Council Agreement in March regarding targets for a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, compared to 1990, was a historic one and we in the British Conservative Party particularly support this initiative very strongly.
As to the European Council last weekend, we have heard many different interpretations about the outcome of the Summit.
In the United Kingdom, reactions to the outcome have not, of course, been universally supportive.
Prime Minister Blair, who leaves 10 Downing Street today, maintains that the draft reform Treaty bears little resemblance to the constitutional text that preceded it.
Yet many of his fellow Heads of Government have contradicted him: the Irish Taoiseach and Finland's Europe Minister have said so, for instance - indeed the latter has said that there is nothing from the original institutional package that has been changed.
So when our Prime Minister says that the two cannot be readily compared, I think the British people can be forgiven for feeling doubtful about what the British Government has actually signed.
As Mr Blair promised the people of Britain a referendum in his last election manifesto, I really do believe it is incumbent upon his successor, Gordon Brown, to uphold that pledge.
Chancellor, I would also like to have one area of clarification on the point about the wide reports that the pursuit by the EU of free and undistorted competition has been undermined in the draft mandate for the IGC.
I also hear, however, that a protocol has now been annexed to make clear that the Union is indeed totally committed to competition and free markets.
There are reports that the German Finance Minister was himself concerned at the change.
He is quoted as saying, 'I see this with a certain scepticism.
If things go on like this, I see a risk'.
To many British people, the internal market and a genuinely competitive economy form a vital basis for their support for Britain's membership of the Union, and they would rightly be concerned at any attempt to undermine that.
I would be most grateful if the Chancellor could give reassurances to me on that point.
(FR) Mr President, it is true that it is difficult to resist the temptation to congratulate the Chancellor, and, I may add, I am not resisting it.
Mrs Merkel, I congratulate you, even though I will remain more doubtful of the future treaty itself.
At the end of the day, however, the reform of the treaties was at a standstill, Europe was stuck in a rut, its unity had been tested, and you gave it another chance.
The agreement passed on 23 June in Brussels is a complicated compromise, one that was reached after much effort in a Council that is marked more by the national tensions of some than by the universal sharing of the European spirit; a compromise reached at the expense of the ridiculous relinquishment of the EU symbols and of the appalling opt-out on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
However, this is at least an agreement that has come at a time when Europe needs to affirm its unity and its desire to move forward so as to meet the citizens' expectations and to rise to the challenges it faces in the world and within Europe.
Every opportunity must therefore be given to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.
As for the treaty itself, we will be able to give a definitive judgment on it only after we have seen the final text that will be derived from it. Doubts remain, but the mandate does at least have the virtue of taking up the institutional innovations that were contained in the first part of the draft constitution and that have scarcely been challenged, even in countries in which the 'No' vote prevailed in the referendum.
I am referring to the enhanced powers of the European Parliament, to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to the new majority decision-making rules and to the shift to unanimity on a number of issues and, therefore, from this point of view, I hope that the outcome will make it possible for the progress contained in the draft Constitution to be confirmed.
Having said that, there are two points that I should like to highlight as being important to our group and that concern the European Union's social dimension.
On the one hand, there was an article on the horizontal social clause and, on the other, an article providing a legal basis for the adoption of a directive on services of general economic interest.
On these two points, the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference remains vague.
We will be very vigilant when it comes to ensuring that, after having renounced the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Member States gathered within the IGC do not further undermine these two possible advances in the social dimension of the European treaties.
President-in-Office, thank you for bringing some real politics to the European Council.
In three days' time you will be free of the Presidency and be able to advance German policy with great self-confidence across the European stage.
Could you assure us that Germany will always fight to combat the version of pick-and-choose Europe that is Tony Blair's sad legacy?
My view is that it is sensible now to put into practice the closer cooperation revisions that we see inside the Treaty.
You spoke of the African proverb which says that you go faster by yourself, but you go further with others.
The problem is that if you stick to the British Government's approach, we will simply continue to go around in circles.
Show the way forward, break out of the corral, and the more timid and conservative partners will follow.
- PL Mr President, Chancellor, I would like to begin by commenting on the speech given by Mr Schulz, who has presumed to lecture and offend the democratically elected government of Poland, whose stance in these negotiations is even supported by the opposition, and therefore enjoys the support of the vast majority of the Polish people, which Mr Schulz has decided to affront.
This is something this House cannot approve of.
As far as the German Presidency is concerned, I would like to say that right from the outset its aim has clearly been to put the European Community's affairs in order.
Unfortunately it has made its priority the resurrection of the Constitutional Treaty which had already been rejected in referendums in France and Holland. In spite of this, its greatest success has been to convince the heads of 27 governments and states to agree to sign the watered-down version of the treaty.
It is, however, the style of the negotiations that has aroused concern, taking as it does the form of blackmail against states with a diverging point of view.
Let us hope that this will not become the norm in relations between EU Member States. I would like to take this opportunity to ask President Merkel what the legal status of the Constitutional Treaty is in Germany, where it was not signed by the president, and whether it is true that when votes are counted in the German Bundesrat, they use a variant of the equal influence system - the very system that was so vigorously attacked during the summit.
Mr President, you have described the new Treaty as retaining the substance of the Constitution.
Chancellor Merkel agreed with that today.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m said that it was essentially the same proposal as the old Constitution, and governments across Europe have described it as 99% the same.
You and they, Mr President, are right!
Yet there is one leader - correction, erstwhile leader, Tony Blair - who pretends it is something totally different.
Why?
So that he can con the people of the United Kingdom out of the referendum he promised them because he knows he cannot win it.
The shameless dissembling of the British Government, however, will not deceive the British people, because we know that when a Treaty looks like a constitution, when it talks like a constitution, and when it would walk us like a constitution into a stronger stranglehold of control from Brussels, then it is a constitution, howsoever you might deceptively describe it.
That is why the people of the United Kingdom still demand a referendum, and anything less would be a cheat.
Mr President, I have brought a cube with me, which shows the flag of the European Union - the 12 stars.
It was manufactured in Germany, invented by a Hungarian and consists of 27 pieces.
I have brought it just to remind us how difficult this Treaty is to put together.
Just like the cube, it should bear the symbols, it should have a message and be a keystone and a foundation for our joint European building, but, at the same time, it is made up of 27 pieces.
So this is how I congratulate the German Presidency on putting these 27 pieces together again, because there are big and small pieces - not every piece is the same.
This cube is not always so beautiful, because you can see the division lines.
However, from now on this could be kept as a good foundation stone.
I should like to add that the word 'fragile' should be written on its box.
All of us in the European Parliament and in the Council have to take great care to keep this cube together.
I am very happy that Europe is finally trying to swallow what it could not swallow for several years.
In that sense, it makes Europe stronger, because we all need something that could be a foundation stone.
We need a common foreign policy, and joint action on fighting climate change and on guaranteeing human rights and minority rights without double standards.
From that point of view, I really appreciate that a reference to minorities has not been omitted from the reform Treaty.
However, I also deplore the missing elements, especially the reference that people wanted to leave out of the Treaty - the symbols of the European Union, the stars, the flags - or any reference to Christianity.
This should not be done.
Let us keep this cube together, and we must be careful because it is fragile.
(Applause)
Thank you, JÃ³zsef SzÃ¡jer!
When we met for the first time, you gave me a piece of barbed wire with the Hungarian flag as a sign that the division of Europe had been overcome.
That was a very beautiful symbol, and I have never forgotten it.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to take up what the previous speaker said.
Perhaps we ought to show the flag more often now and play the anthem more often to show that these things cannot be lost, because they exist.
We have fought for the substance to be preserved.
It has been, and I believe that is a mark of success.
More has been lost, however, than just the name and the symbols.
It is after all clear that the reform treaty is something different from the constitutional treaty, because the vision of a political union, not only of a Europe of states but a citizens' Europe, is now even further from our grasp and it will be a long time before we can make a fresh attempt at a European constitution.
On this point, Europe's opponents have won and the European federalists have lost.
We must be quite clear about that.
I also think that the simplified treaty is sadly still a complicated treaty.
There is a loss of transparency.
The citizens will not be able to identify so easily with the new product as they did with the Constitutional Treaty.
Thirdly, I am concerned that distrust between the Member States, and also some Member States' distrust of the EU and its institutions, has grown.
They all want to join, but they do not all want to join in.
We will be watching very closely to see whether there are not only different speeds, but also different classes.
Some evidently want to be second class.
If that is what they want, then let them.
They should not be able to block the others.
That was an important stage that takes us forward.
But it is not the end of the reform process, and the new treaty will for the first time allow this Parliament to make its own proposals for further reforms.
I have no doubt that, in the next legislative period, we will return to everything that has been left behind this time and that we will pursue the European Union's further development from this Chamber of Europe's citizens.
(ES) Mr President, we must undoubtedly congratulate Chancellor Merkel and, in particular, the President of the European Commission, who is now having his second big success, following the approval of the financial perspective, because we have avoided a certain risk of crisis.
Many Members of this House may have hoped for more, but we must acknowledge that this agreement is perfectly consistent with the Community method.
I am convinced that we are going to carry on functioning perfectly well until 2014 or, in exceptional circumstances, for three further years, with the decision-making procedure adopted in Nice which, in the end - I would like to point out - was approved precisely in order to deal with enlargement.
Furthermore, I hope that, in order to round off the institutional package, the twenty seats remaining in the European Parliament will be filled for the 2009 elections, naturally, and adhering strictly to the proportionality criteria, that is to say, that it be done in an entirely democratic way.
Along the lines of the progress made in the field of justice and home affairs, I wonder whether the opportunity could be taken at the IGC to provide the European Counter-Terrorism Coordinator with content and duties.
I believe that this post responds to an objective need and to a great sensitivity amongst the European citizens, as the latest Eurobarometer indicates.
Incidentally, I am sure that the European Commission's services will ensure that the terrorist group ETA is called by its proper name.
In the same vein, I am delighted by the mention in the final point of the conclusions of the peace process in Northern Ireland, but I am also surprised to see that there is not the least reference to the threat to the European citizens, and to the Spanish citizens in particular, represented by the breaking of ETA's ceasefire.
Any opportunity to express the European institutions' solidarity with people whose freedom and lives are in danger every day is a good opportunity.
(PL) Mr President, Chancellor, as the leader of the delegation of the Polish left in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am pleased to accept the compromise in accepting the mandate and the opening of the inter-governmental conference achieved during the European Council summit.
The mandate adopted enables the new treaty to keep the most important institutional aspects of the constitutional treaty: the charter of fundamental rights, the extended competence of the European Parliament, the appointment of a European head of diplomacy and a note about European energy policy.
I am pleased that the Polish Government has finally withdrawn from its concept of an 'equal influence' system, which was opposed by the other EU countries, and accepted a compromised.
This was a wise decision.
However, the negotiating methods of the Polish Government, which uses arguments alluding to the Second World War, sully the image of Poland and have threatened Polish-German relations, which have so far been good.
Polish society's view of cooperation within the EU is different from the Polish Government's.
Eighty percent of Poles support European integration, and I have no doubt that it was this view of Polish public opinion that brought about the compromise at the summit.
Today, at a meeting with the Socialist Group, the Chancellor said that to her, relations with Poland are equally as important than relations with France, and misunderstandings are a thing of the past.
I am grateful to her for these words.
I call upon the Polish Government to collaborate actively with the other Member States to prepare the final version of the treaty in such a way that it can be implemented before the European Parliamentary elections in 2009.
(applause)
(SV) I wish to thank and congratulate the German Presidency on what it has achieved in conjunction with the Commission.
Through its work it has laid the foundation for a new Treaty.
I would thank and congratulate the German Presidency not only on what has been achieved but also in the light of what it will be possible to achieve in the future.
A new Treaty is not an end in itself.
The need for a new Treaty has emerged from the successes of European cooperation: enlargement, which has led not only to more Member States and a stronger EU but also to more different national wills to manage; the internal market, which has given Europe a stronger economic role in the world; and political integration and foreign policy, which has given the EU greater responsibility in the world.
All these developments have given rise to, and continue to increase, the need for a new Treaty.
What is now becoming possible, however, also brings home the fact that it is not the treaties that are ends in themselves, but the action that may be taken on the basis of them.
It is now becoming possible to deal with three issues that, especially given the historical background that we have, are more important than others.
The first issue is that of climate and the need for an energy policy whereby the EU Member States can stand shoulder to shoulder in order to safeguard integrity and security.
The second issue is that of the EU's future enlargement.
The issue of enlargement is now once again emerging clearly as a topical issue which must be given further impetus by the governments of the Member States and by the Commission.
It is the enlargements that have strengthened the EU and given it new tasks and that have given us a unique opportunity for peace and prosperity.
In this area, the internal market too has played a decisive role.
I would therefore point out that, instead of relating only to the economy, any calling into question of free and open competition also calls into question EU-wide equal opportunities for the Member States, individuals and companies.
Anyone who brings these things into question ultimately brings into question the European Union's ability to bring people and nations together.
I therefore wish to issue a clear and urgent request to the Commission, the German Presidency and future Presidencies: remove any doubt that secure, free and open competition must prevail for everyone in Europe.
Competition gives rise to prosperity, freedom and new successes.
(PT) Mr President, Chancellor Merkel, I too congratulate you, not only for the manner in which you conducted the Presidency of the Union, but also for the good results of the last Council.
I am Portuguese and, regrettably, I do not speak German, but I do know how to say...
(DE) Thank you, Madam Chancellor Angela Merkel.
(PT) The European Council has gone as far as it can, achieving a realistic compromise, in the words of Jacques Delors.
It has not been easy.
The heterogeneity of the problems and the diversity of interests encourage national egoism.
An agreement was reached thanks to there being determination, negotiating skills and a sense of responsibility on the part of some European leaders, although not all, as we are aware.
However, the finishing line is still a long and difficult way off.
In these complex processes of collective editing, it is easy to trip over a comma or fall at a word.
As my prime minister, JosÃ© SÃ³crates, says, we have a mandate, but not a Treaty.
For there to be a Treaty, everyone must collaborate - the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
A joint effort will be essential.
Bearing in mind the complex international context and the legacy of the German Presidency, I am sure that the Portuguese Presidency will do its utmost to adequately address the mandate with which it has been entrusted.
(FR) Mr President, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council has decided to end the period of reflection, which therefore means that the European Union has finally found a cure for the paralysis from which it has been suffering for two years.
Without an agreement among the 27, the Union would not just have remained at a standstill, it would probably have entered into a real crisis heralding a process whereby our collective project was taken apart, piece by piece.
The mandate entrusted to the Intergovernmental Conference responsible for drawing up the draft treaty may not be ideal, but it is the fruit of a difficult compromise, gathering together Member States whose differences one feared had become intolerable.
I should like to congratulate the German Presidency, and particularly you, Mrs Merkel, for your skill and clear-sightedness during the negotiations.
I am also proud of the role played by France and by its President, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose initiative it was to have a simplified treaty dedicated to extricating Europe from a long-term stalemate and whose political will has been crucial.
True, we may regret that the Community spirit has not been embraced by all our partners, but patience and time will no doubt enable us to complete our work.
I am now looking forward to this Lisbon Treaty, the signing of which in October will perfectly symbolise the end of a particularly disenchanting episode of European integration.
(PL) Mr President, what Europe needs is wise and balanced leadership, but what it needs more is joint action in important areas on the basis of the declared values that have become the mainstay of this Union.
If the Union is treated as a common market, then profit would come before the main aims of the Union, and it would no longer be a Union, but a market-place.
If the European Union is to some extent to be a cultural and political organism, then only 'more Europe', as Mr Barrosso often says, will contribute to the greater good of every Member State.
One point, however: I believe that the 'equal influence' system proposed by Poland, to which it was entitled, would not be a bad thing for real democracy and community, and for the equality of citizens.
The double majority system could be interpreted as a signal that the European Union will not be enlarged over the next few decades.
(DE) Finally, I would like to express a wish to all of us and especially to the President-in-Office who was to show understanding for both parts of Europe: may you be an example to your successor of that effectiveness in negotiation that can only be achieved when the welfare and rights of every European nation, true community and equality of the citizens are top priority.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, it is an interesting state of affairs in the European Parliament when all the leaders are still here.
I therefore thank you for the debate.
I would just like to deal briefly with two points.
Firstly, the question of the internal market and competition, which has been a great cause for concern here.
We debated in the Council whether competition is one of our objectives.
I believe competition is not an end but a means.
That is why we removed it from the 'objectives' heading, but we have made absolutely clear in the protocol on the internal market and competition that we will be inserting that this means remains intact and its importance is undiminished, and the Commission has also made quite sure of that.
So nothing has changed.
Employment and prosperity are our objective, but our objective is not competition as such, it is a means.
Secondly, a lot has been said about the voting system.
For clarity I would like to repeat here once again: all possible forms of weighting, including root systems, are conceivable if you take them as the only form of voting.
If we had been starting from scratch, we could have discussed them all.
There is, however, a double majority, and this double majority brings the weighting between population and the 'one country, one vote' principle.
Only this doubling makes the voting system acceptable, and we have probably now found a way that leads us back again to real international world problems and at the same time has a high level of fairness.
I would like to conclude with a sincere thank you.
I can report from our government that we had a cabinet meeting today in which we took stock, and that all the members of the government were proud to have conducted this Presidency with enthusiasm and great commitment, and that the Social Democrat just as much as the Christian Democrat members of the government have contributed to that.
(Applause)
Secondly, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commission, to JosÃ© Manuel Barroso and to all the Commissioners.
We have worked together intensively and well, we have had friendly, tough conversations, often extending into the night, but we reached agreement and I believe the Commission and Council have come out of this Presidency stronger.
I have enjoyed working with you personally, JosÃ© Manuel, and I have also enjoyed working with the entire Commission and all its staff.
Thank you very much!
My thanks are also due to the European Parliament.
It is nice to debate in this Parliament, to feel the spirit of Europe and to accomplish many difficult tasks with the wind behind you - and with a bit of idealism that is perhaps found more often here than elsewhere.
Because one thing is clear: where there is no more idealism there is only nationalism and clinging to your own vested interests.
That does not get us anywhere and I therefore extend my sincere thanks to the entire European Parliament and especially to those who always helped us along.
I will almost miss the cooperation, but one can always come here again as a visitor.
Thank you very much!
(Applause)
Mr President, Chancellor, Members of Parliament, I have nothing to add to what Chancellor Merkel has already said with regards to competition.
I would just like to make it clear that the discussions resulted in the non-retention of a particular expression used in the Constitutional Treaty, but in no way alter the principles of competition present throughout the entire Community acquis; that is, the idea that competition is an essential tool for the internal market and an essential tool serving the well-being of the citizens.
This point has been clarified and I think, from this point of view, we can consider ourselves quite satisfied with the results of this European Council.
I would just like very quickly to underline one more point.
The results of this European Council which, in fact, were extremely positive, now mean that we have an even greater responsibility.
Let us consider for a moment where we would be today if we had not had this success.
Prior to the European Council, I was untiring in my efforts to draw attention to our great responsibility in terms of credibility.
How could we Europeans say to the world that we were being serious when we talked about energy safety and the fight against climate change and when we promoted increased employment, if we were unable to resolve the institutional question?
This result has been achieved but, as has already been emphasised, we have a mandate, which is excellent, but we still do not have the Treaty.
This is why we must now all demonstrate the same responsibility so that, during the Portuguese presidency, if possible during the Extraordinary Council in October, we can achieve a Treaty to resolve the institutional question that is of such importance to the Union, allowing us to continue with our agenda for the benefit of the citizens, promoting increased employment and investing further in innovation.
I would remind you that innovation should be a priority, not only in theory but also in practice, as indeed should all the other objectives of the renewed Lisbon Strategy.
There is, therefore, a vast potential for achieving results to the benefit of Europe and European citizens.
And this is precisely why we need to provide the European Union with the Institutions that will give us the capability to act.
I am absolutely convinced that we are in a better position today to achieve these objectives than we were some time ago.
For this reason, I would like once again to congratulate the German Presidency and all those who contributed to this result.
It may not be an exaggeration to further emphasise the excellent institutional cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and also the fact that this is the first time that, from start to finish, an agreement has been reached by twenty-seven Member States, that is, the longest-standing members and the newest members.
The negotiations were difficult at times, but the truth is that an agreement was reached, and this point should be underlined as being very positive.
Thank you, President of the Commission.
Experience has shown that all three Institutions have always gone in the same direction for Europe.
Tomorrow, the chairmen of the political groups will be in Lisbon to discuss with the future presidency how things should proceed.
Thank you all for your participation.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Last week's political agreement on convening an Intergovernmental Conference and on the basic principles of the reform Treaty is a major compromise, but one that everyone can accept.
The reform Treaty has got Europe back on track, and has averted a more serious and drawn-out crisis on the European scene.
The reform Treaty is essential if the European Union and its institutions are to be capable of acting, and it is indispensable in view of further enlargement.
The principle of double majority in the decision-making process suitably balances and counterbalances the interests of the large and small countries.
The European Parliament is the unquestionable winner in these reforms, since the expansion of its legislative scope places its political weight alongside that of the Council.
Those in support of the Constitutional Treaty cannot forget, however, that symbols are of enormous significance.
Those in favour of integration were not seeking to create a European superstate, but wished to strengthen the common, or if you prefer, the supranational will in the legislative and decision-making process.
An example was set by the nine, among them Hungary, in representing the most important values in the constitution, including among others the retention of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the safeguarding of minority rights.
The political storms that raged in the Council have, moreover, taught us the very important lesson that in the decisions of the 27-member European Union, there are times when the positions of the countries in the Central and Eastern European region can, on account of their still undigested historical past, be integrated only at the expense of serious compromises.
It is precisely for this reason that the time has come for the Central and Eastern European Member States to begin, with the participation of Europe, to deal with their historical wounds.
This is the only way to ensure that the politics of victimhood does not prevail in the region or in individual countries.
in writing. - The package agreed by the 27 governments last weekend salvaged many of the practical institutional reforms that were contained in the constitutional treaty.
However, it also dropped many key features: the notion of a 'Constitution'; the loss of the title and status of 'Foreign Minister'; the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be spelt out visibly in full in the treaty, and not be enforceable in British courts; the removal of the symbols (flag and anthem); the abandonment of changes on legal terminology (where 'regulations' and 'directives' would have been called 'laws' and 'framework laws'); the postponement of and changes to the new voting weights in the Council; and various derogations given to individual Member States, such as the UK.
These will be seen by the European Parliament as major sacrifices, but they are necessary to secure ratification of the package by all 27 countries.
in writing. - (PT) The mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) to amend the treaties, defined at the last European Council conducted by the German Presidency, confirms what we have been denouncing for some considerable time: that those who did not accept the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands - which rejected the content of the so-called 'European Constitution' - began, almost immediately, to plan ways of getting around the sovereignly expressed wishes of the people of these two nations.
The IGC mandate speaks for itself.
It is a case of recovering the essential content of the already rejected treaty proposal - overcoming contradictions, mainly those which, having been compromised by the referenda, they now seek to avoid - dressing it up as a 'reforming treaty' and setting aside the 'constitutional character', the better to disguise the operation.
Those who repeat to exhaustion that the new treaty proposal is impregnated with democracy are, in the end, the same ones who, once again, are planning how to avoid binding, national referenda, to be held prior to any ratification of a new treaty proposal.
This is all the more serious inasmuch as it is an attempt to reinstate the qualitative jump in the joint federalist, neoliberal and militarist project which appeared in the rejected 'European Constitution'.
We may affirm that this is a doubly unacceptable process.
in writing. - The German Presidency was a disaster.
The so-called reform treaty which is labelled a success is not preparing the ground for a social, democratic and peaceful EU.
On the contrary, the EU is more divided now.
Worst in this respect were threats by German politicians like PSE chairman Martin Schulz against Poland and Great Britain.
Furthermore, the militarisation of the EU has been accelerated and there have been no commitments for another policy on climate change.
Any new EU Treaty should be decided by referendum in all Member States.
It is impossible always to talk about getting citizens more involved in European affairs while at the same time not letting them have a say on the most important issues in the EU.
My wish would be that the voices of the people who rejected the constitutional treaty because of its neo-liberal and militaristic character were finally heard.
I see the contrary, however: we are facing an attempt to get the substance of the constitutional treaty adopted through the back door by renaming the project 'reform treaty' and excluding the possibility of referendums.
If the EU is to be based on democratic principles this has to be prevented.

Statements by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, the chairmen of the political groups have asked me to make a statement on terrorism.
A few days ago, on 29 and 30 June, there were renewed terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow; they came something over three years after the 11 March 2004 bombings in Madrid that cost 192 people their lives and two years after the 7 July 2005 bombings in London in which 56 people were killed and more than 700 injured.
A few days later, on 2 July, a suicide bombing claimed further victims in Yemen: seven Spanish tourists and two Yemenis were killed and eight other persons injured.
There are many indications that the al-Qaeda terrorist network is connected with these attacks.
This is a threat to us all.
Terrorism is a direct assault on freedom, human rights and democracy.
Terrorism is an attempt to destroy our values by blind force, values which unite us in the European Union and in our Member States.
Wherever it takes place and whoever is responsible, terrorism is a crime to which we must respond with determination and solidarity.
The European Union must join with the international community of nations to fight against every form of terrorism.
Today, the European Parliament will be discussing Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert's report on the draft directive which the Commission presented last year that will require the Member States to identify important infrastructures in such areas as energy, health, communications and transport and protect them against terrorist attacks.
This will enable long-term security measures to be taken for the event of a terrorist attack.
This proposed European strategy is a tangible contribution to the fight against terrorism.
We must take all the measures necessary to counter terrorism.
In so doing, we must be guided by our principles of the rule of law.
The fight against terrorism can only be waged in a manner consistent with the values we are seeking to defend!
The European Parliament expresses its solidarity and support for the victims of terrorism and their families - for those who have lost their lives, but also for those who are still suffering the psychological and physical consequences.
May I conclude by quoting the words of the United Kingdom's new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown: 'We will not yield, we will not be intimidated'.
We will now keep silence in memory of the victims.

Calendar of part-sessions for 2008
Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda for this session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 5 July 2007 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Monday and Tuesday:
No amendments
Wednesday:
The Socialist Group, the Liberal Group and the Group of the European United Left propose that Mr Markov's report on road infrastructure safety management be referred back to the committee responsible in accordance with Rule 168.
Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of referring this report back to the committee.
There was a lot of concern in committee when the vote was taken to reject this proposal and no doubt the groups involved had reasons for doing that, but one of the consequences was that many road safety issues were then rejected also.
Rather than go through the whole procedure in this plenary, my group and I feel that it would be far better if we refer the whole Markov report back to committee as of today, take it off the agenda and basically start again with our discussions between all the groups in the hope that we can come to a proper solution.
(Parliament adopted the motion)
Thursday:
No amendments
(The order of business was adopted)
(DE) Mr President, I crave your forbearance because I do not know which Rule of the Rules of Procedure I am speaking under. But I am sure that in your infinite wisdom you will find the right one.
We have a number of debates in this House about Parliament's calendar of meetings.
There is a very great need for coordination between the political groups.
The deadline for the tabling of amendments is 10 a.m. tomorrow.
On behalf of our group, but also with the agreement of other group chairmen and colleagues, I propose that the deadline be extended to 6 p.m. tomorrow.
That might give us time to resolve one or two serious problems, including organisational ones.
Thank you.
A large number of group chairmen and representatives are nodding their heads in agreement with this proposal.
I can therefore assume that there are no objections and the deadline will be set at 6 p.m. tomorrow.
Community action programme in the field of health - Action to tackle cardiovascular disease (debate)
The next item is:
the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a second programme of Community action in the field of health (2007-2013) (16369/2/2006 C6-0100/2007 Rapporteur: Mr Trakatellis, and
the debate on the oral question to the Commission B6-0134/2007) by Mr OuzkÃœ, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on action to tackle cardiovascular disease.
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I call on you to give due attention to the question of promoting health, which must be seen not only as a valuable commodity and indicator of social prosperity, but also as an investment-generating parameter.
This approach is particular evident in the field of prevention, on which the programme under debate mainly focuses, because prevention means restricting morbidity and hence reducing the costs of treatment and hospital care.
There is no need to analyse the beneficial results of such a development for health insurance and, by extension, public finances.
Improving the health of the population undoubtedly drives progress, strengthens citizens, by guaranteeing them a longer, better and more productive life, and constitutes the precondition to economic prosperity.
By limiting the number of man-hours lost, prevention also helps to increase the productivity and employability of workers, two indicators which are in keeping with the Lisbon process.
Prevention, therefore, is the key issue for a revised, efficiency-orientated health policy and a preferential field of action for a Union programme.
That is why the European Union needs its second public health programme: because we must jointly defend ourselves against the health risks which have appeared so dramatically, with the possibility of a 'flu pandemic and with the bird 'flu epidemic, and that is one of the aims of the programme.
We must jointly promote a healthy lifestyle for our children, with a proper diet in a society free from smoke and stress and with proper socio-economic conditions in general that have a serious effect on health, and that is one of the aims of the programme.
We must jointly fight to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of serious illnesses which destroy the body and the mind, and that is one of the aims of the programme.
We must recommend that better medical practices, which are not only the most efficient way of combating disease but which limit further loss of health, be within reach of everyone, both of those working in the health professions and of simple citizens, and that is one of the aims of the programme.
Particular importance is attached to collating data on the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, which is currently the scourge of hospitals in Europe.
Particular importance is also attached to the effect of environmental factors on health.
It is also extremely important that we collate data and develop strategies on patient mobility.
I could continue by describing one by one all the aims of the programme.
I think that it is not necessary, because we are all convinced that we must act jointly and at European level, while at the same time giving the Member States the possibility of increasing their efficiency on health matters.
This is the second programme, which will apply in the years 2008-2013.
It is better, more comprehensive and more ambitious and is marked by an integrated perception both of health and of the means, mechanisms and practices for combating health problems.
It will assist convergence and the integration of the European Union, which we must look on not only in economic terms or foreign policy terms, but also in terms of convergence in the fields of education and health, because that is when the fabric of stability and prosperity of European society is really woven.
This sort of ambitious plan which, at the same time, is of exceptional benefit not only for the health, but also for the economy of the European Union, needs financial investments that will yield exponential results, because it will considerably reduce the onerous costs of health services in the Member States.
Unfortunately, the Council made huge cuts to the European Union budget in December, which for certain programmes, such as the programme under debate, were exceptionally painful.
One wonders how we can progress along the difficult path of European integration when the programmes which fundamentally build and create a European society of the future are subject to significant cuts.
The good news is that the need for adequate funding for the health programme has been understood by the Council and by the Commission and by Parliament and I believe that the arrangement brokered through unofficial consultations allows for adequate financing within a framework of the rules of the Community budget.
I call on my honourable friends to vote in favour of the agreed amendments brokered through unofficial consultations.
author. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my support for the words of my dear colleague Dr Trakatellis on the particular issue of cardiovascular diseases.
In my question to the Commission, I focused on a widely known issue, namely the seriousness of cardiovascular diseases, which in the EU alone kill almost two million people per year.
This is an established and universally acknowledged fact.
As long ago as 2004, the Council recognised the importance of providing decisive solutions to the problem of cardiovascular diseases.
There has been extraordinary medical progress in this field in the last 10 to 15 years.
The problem, however, is the dramatic increase in costs.
For the purposes of illustration, I always tell Czech citizens in debates - and I emphasise the point here in this Chamber - that treating a coronary thrombosis 15 years ago, using the methods of the time, cost around EUR 20 per day, and after streptokinase was introduced the cost rose to EUR 1,000 per treatment.
Nowadays, with the advent of stents and acute catheterisation, the cost has risen to EUR 10 000 for a single treatment.
In other words, there has been a huge increase in the financial cost.
On the other hand, there has been enormous growth in the range of opportunities for treating a significant number of patients who would previously have had to suffer and die.
Today, patients with acute coronary thrombosis, provided they are treated quickly and properly, can return home on the very same day and go back to work few days later.
The money we spend, therefore, can be recouped later.
A further problem is the differences that exist not only between the various Member States but also within individual countries.
According to one study in my country, the death rate from cardiovascular diseases rises according to how far from the clinic the patient lives.
In this regard, the EU varies enormously and what we are proposing is a path towards a more systemic solution.
Although I do not wish to go against the subsidiarity principle and tread on the toes of the various national governments, I should like to ask the Commission how it intends to bring about an exchange of information and experience, because we certainly have the resources for that, and it is one of the ways in which we can make substantial improvements this area.
What steps does the Commission intend to take to reduce the economic burden and the impact of cardiovascular diseases on the economies of the Member States?
What funding possibilities does the Commission have which can be recommended?
In one of the amendments to which I put my name today, I called for a study into the option of mass public provision of defibrillators.
We know that this has proved to be extremely effective in Japan, and I have also learned of defibrillators being made available in public places in a number of other countries, including the United States.
I am aware that this is a very expensive option, and that opponents of such an indiscriminate approach would argue that a certain amount of prudence is called for.
Yet this approach will in many cases save lives before the ambulance arrives.
This is why I should be interested in the Commission's response to this additional question.
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, I should like to start by extending my warmest thanks to all the honourable Members for the interest they have shown in the Commission proposal for the adoption of a second programme of Community action in the field of health.
I should like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts, which will allow us - and I am sure of this - to reach an agreement at second reading.
We have before us today an overall compromise which is the outcome of a number of very positive unofficial contacts between the three institutions.
The compromise amendments strengthen the text in numerous sectors which are of particular importance to Parliament, such as the follow-up to Community initiatives on cancer and the more accurate wording on action for the environment and health.
As far as the budget is concerned, which we have also had the opportunity to debate in the past, unfortunately the room for manoeuvre was very limited and the Commission is strictly bound by the agreed financial framework.
Nonetheless, according to the text of the tripartite statement, the special requirements of the programme will be taken into account during the annual budget procedure.
In addition, the present text will provide the legal basis, which will safeguard the more effective disposal of resources for achieving the aims of the programme.
I do not think that anyone can doubt that Parliament, the Council and the Commission made a great deal of effort to reach an acceptable compromise.
I honestly hope that the vote to follow will express this positive and constructive stand, so that we can start to finance plans relating to important new public health sectors from 1 January 2008.
I should like now to turn, on the basis of Mr OuzkÃœ's question, to a more specific aspect of public health and one of the most serious problems; I refer to cardiovascular diseases, which are certainly one of the main causes of early death and disability of the citizens of the European Union.
The causes and the risk factors are well known; they include smoking, a poor diet and obesity, lack of physical exercise and excessive consumption of alcohol.
I know that Parliament has an acute interest in this sector and that a motion for a resolution on cardiovascular diseases is being submitted to plenary by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
As you know, the Commission puts particular emphasis on prevention.
Within the limited resources at our disposal and within the balance of competences set out in the Treaty, we put particular emphasis and expend a great deal of effort on prevention.
We also do this on the question of smoking and you are all well acquainted with the 'Help' strategy, which has also been received in Parliament, the various laws and the Green Paper we have adopted on banning smoking in public places, and I really do impatiently await the view and opinion of the European Parliament.
As far as diet is concerned, we published very recently - in May - a White Paper on diet and obesity and, as you know, we have already started applying and implementing the strategy on alcohol, starting with the Alcohol and Health Forum, in cooperation with non-governmental organisations and private-sector undertakings in the aim of combating this new problem.
Through public health programmes, the Commission supports activities and networks relating to cardiovascular diseases, including an extensive catalogue of data on cardiovascular diseases in the Member States and the development of indicators for monitoring cardiovascular diseases.
The creation of centres of reference, the exchange of best practices, the combating of the inequalities which unfortunately exist in the European Union - not only from one state to another, but also within the Member States themselves - are the objectives addressed by the new programme.
However, I must emphasise for the sake of accuracy that we simply provide possibilities; they must be used by the Member States, which are responsible for providing health services.
As far as research is concerned (because the question also refers to research), the European Union has made over EUR 100 million available for research into cardiovascular diseases through the Sixth Framework Programme on research and development.
These diseases are still one of the priorities of health research within the framework of the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development which started this year.
Consequently, there is the facility to continue research in this sector under the Seventh Framework Programme.
I shall not comment in detail on the European Heart Health Charter, because an event and debate were held on the subject here in Parliament and we all remember the presentation event in Brussels last month.
However, this cohesive document is important, because it unifies all the bodies which can help to combat this problem and, of course, it is safeguarded by the public health programme.
More action to combat the decisive factors which cause cardiovascular diseases and inequalities in health will be included in the new health strategy of the European Union which I hope - and I am sure - will be adopted later, before the end of this year.
As far as the financial part is concerned - because this too is important - there is the European Development Fund for developing countries, where the Commission is responding to the priorities set by the countries themselves through dialogue and, of course, the health sector is one of the priorities.
The same applies to the Structural Funds which exist in the European Union for the Member States and which can be used for health even more extensively in this period than in the previous period, but there is still a need for health to be a priority issue in the take-up of Funds by the Member States themselves.
We provide possibilities, by which I mean that I do not fail to raise the issue with the ministers of health whenever we meet but, at the end of the day, the decision will be taken collectively by the governments of the Member States.
I advise and urge the Member States to make use of the Structural Funds in the health sector, but I must say that there is still a great deal of room for improvement.
However, it is also our priority to strengthen the national health systems which allow for the management of public health priorities, which cover not only communicable diseases, which of course are the first and obvious threat, but also non-communicable and I hope here that I shall have the support and cooperation of Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, there is no wealth without health.
That is the theme of this debate and the sub-plot is that we have both to care and cure, but also to prevent ill-health and promote wellbeing.
The Commissioner recognises this and has come forward with an ambitious programme, as our rapporteur has said, but the budget was savaged by two-thirds.
So it is clear we must do better on budgets in the future; it is clear we must use our limited resources now wisely; it is clear we must target the non-communicable diseases that cause 86% of deaths in Europe and devastate lives and families - cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes, respiratory and musculoskeletal conditions.
That of course links into the resolution that you have before you: 42% of deaths in the EU come from CVD problems.
Our emphasis must be on lifestyle.
Some 80% of heart attacks, stroke and diabetes, and some 40% of cancers could be avoided by changing lifestyle and cutting out the risks that come from a bad lifestyle.
We will sometimes need education or legislation on smoking, drugs, alcohol, salt, saturated and trans fats, lack of exercise, as well as things like stress management and all the causes of hypertension.
We need partnerships between people, governments, health services and employers.
And we need ideas such as the one on the defibrillator that my colleague referred to.
I could end by saying the road to hell is often said to be paved with good intentions, but the health promotion case studies show that, as in North Karelia, if good intentions are translated into action, then the road can lead not to hell but to health.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, my first thanks go to Mr Trakatellis for his excellent work on getting agreement today on a package of amendments on the public health programme.
It has not been easy: we have had lots of meetings over the course of the last few months, but we finally have a package that the Socialist Group welcomes.
We welcome the very clear commitment to tackling health inequalities which is contained in the package.
We welcome, as Mr Bowis said, the action on major diseases which are the biggest killers in Europe.
We want to see better use made of the centres of reference across Europe and we are also pleased that NGOs and patients' organisations will have better access to funding thanks to this programme that will see emphasis placed on the wider environmental determinants of heath.
We all know that health suffers because of environmental issues and we want to see that tackled.
Like the other speakers, I think it is regrettable that we have a lower budget than we had thought in the first place but, as the Commission has said on many occasions, there are other framework programmes where health can be investigated so this is not the only money made available for health research in the EU.
I want to draw your attention to Amendment 19, which the Socialist Group has tabled separately from the package.
In recital 14 we talk about increasing healthy life years, and we want to delete the words 'also called disability-free life expectancy indicator'.
We have had many approaches from disability organisations, which make the point that you can have a disability and be healthy and that, therefore, this terminology seems to suggest that if you are a disabled person you are automatically somebody who is unhealthy.
Therefore, we would like the Commission and the Council to look at that when they look at the final wording for the document.
Finally, I want to put on record my thanks as well to the German Presidency negotiating team who helped us to reach agreement today and took on board so many of our parliamentary amendments from first reading.
I look forward to getting the programme up and running on time next year.
That is what everybody wants at this stage and that is why we have been prepared to compromise on the budget, but we are very pleased with the content.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to express my congratulations to the rapporteur for his excellent report.
Professor Trakatellis has spent many years dealing with health issues, both as a clinician and as a politician; therefore, he knows the subject matter of this report very well and it is thus not surprising that he has tackled the issue with efficiency and wisdom.
Most of us share the rapporteur's views on the main issues brought up in this report.
One of the most important of these is the problem of health inequalities.
Such inequalities occur not just from one Member State to another but also within Member States.
They can be very substantial indeed and, in many cases, such differences exist right across the whole range of healthcare, from prevention and diagnosis to treatment.
It is well known, not just amongst medical professionals but also amongst ordinary citizens, that such discrepancies more often than not make the difference between life or death.
The right to life should be accompanied by the right to health - equal health, not one health for the rich and another for the poor.
In a fair and humanistic society such as the one we aspire to achieve in the EU Member States, all citizens should be equal in terms of healthcare.
I agree entirely with the rapporteur that this issue should become a very major aim of the health programme and I am sure that the Commissioner also agrees with this.
A second area referred to by the rapporteur on which I would like to offer some brief comments is that of cancer.
Cancer is the second commonest cause of death in Europe and the world in general, yet it is absolutely unthinkable why in this day and age no proper Community system for cooperation between centres of reference is fully functioning unhindered.
And it is shameful that shortcomings exist in the establishment of a Europe-wide register for those cancers which are covered by the Council recommendation on cancer screening.
The rapporteur addresses both of these issues and many others adequately and proposes appropriate amendments which we fully support.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Commissioner, we must indeed congratulate the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, on achieving today's compromise.
I, however, shall comment on the financial problem because, as we all know, the biggest bone of contention between Parliament and the Council from the outset was the budget to support this policy.
The compromise between the Member States in December 2005 on the new financial framework for the period 2007-2013 left funding for numerous policy areas at much lower levels than initially proposed by the Commission.
One of the policy areas which suffered the biggest cuts was public health and the biggest victim was the health programme.
The consequences of the negotiations between the Commission and the Council were very unfortunate in terms of financial support for the action programme.
The budget was reduced to EUR 365.6 million, a very small sum for such an ambitious programme.
Nonetheless, the rapporteur, with the support of the shadow rapporteurs, explored every way of improving the situation.
However, given the rigid stance of the Council, he accepted that the room for manoeuvre as far as the budget was concerned was very limited and accepted the compromise between the Council and the Commission.
Although the limited budget for the programme is not of course to our liking, we welcome the rapporteur's efforts in managing to keep a plethora of Parliament's recommendations and amendments intact and to avoid the conciliation procedure.
We are most relieved to see that the rapporteur's compromise includes the need to reduce inequalities in health and a reference to alternative medicine.
Nor does it omit the strengthening of cross-border care and patient mobility or better access for citizens to information, which will make them better able to take decisions which are in their interests.
It is worth noting that a large part of the budget will go to non-governmental organisations, which are non-profit-making and independent of industry, trade and the undertakings which specialise in the promotion of health and the aims of the programme.
Let us hope that it will be possible to meet the ambitious actions and expectations we all have of this programme, which will finally enter into force in 2008, despite the reduced budget.
Commissioner, I should like to emphasise at this point, as my honourable friends and previous speakers have indicated, the importance of prevention and of prompt diagnosis.
We must invest in this sector.
You cannot imagine not only the lives we shall save, but also the money that the Member States will save by applying programmes which address this specific sector, especially heart disease and cancer.
You mentioned cancer as the second cause of death.
I tell you with mathematical accuracy that, in a few years' time, cancer will be the first cause of death as a result of the progress being made with cardiovascular diseases.
Commissioner, we are with you and we shall support you in applying the programme.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the 2007-2013 Community action programme in the field of health aimed to set a course for European health services.
From the outset, however, the programme has generated controversy. This was due not only to the lack of clarity in the provisions on funding but also to other reasons.
The funds allocated relate only to international NGOs, and other programmes have been cut out.
Pursuant to the document, substantial sums amounting to 60% Community input and to as much as 80% in exceptional circumstances are to be allocated to non-governmental organisations at international level.
The programmes of many such organisations include pro-abortion policies.
In some cases the organisations are offshoots of pharmaceutical concerns.
Funding laboratories without establishing the type of research they are engaged in is also cause for concern.
Unfortunately the programme only deals in a cursory manner with access to health services and the care of the elderly.
It makes no provision for supporting the family, combating the diseases of contemporary society or for access to highly specialised advice.
The programme does, however, deal with healthy food and a healthy lifestyle.
The issue of cross-border health care arises again, along with its negative impact on certain health care systems.
It would seem that in view of the limited funding available, this programme cannot deal with the whole range of problems affecting European health care services.
- (SK) With regard to this report, I subscribe to all of the observations made by the rapporteur.
Out of an original budget of EUR 969 million, the Commission has cut healthcare allocations to EUR 365 million. It did so despite the fact that Parliament had not regarded EUR 969 million as sufficient and had topped it up to EUR 1.5 billion.
I view this cut of nearly 60% as highly irresponsible.
It is all the more shocking in the current climate, with healthcare systems across Eastern Europe weakened by the exodus of large numbers of physicians and nurses, who are leaving to seek work in the EU-15.
In a situation where other programmes have been cut to the tune of a mere 2 to 5% and when every third citizen in Europe develops cancer, I believe that in assuming this stance the Commission is ridiculing and disparaging the patients and citizens of the European Union.
It is therefore necessary to support the rapporteur in his efforts to have this small budget increased by at least 10%, that is, to EUR 402 million, while keeping the variation ceiling at no more than 5%.
At the same time, the programme should explicitly stipulate that structural funds, as you mentioned, Commissioner, can be used to finance healthcare projects, provided that Member States designate health care as a priority in their national programmes.
Until now, these funds have been primarily used to finance environmental projects or build up infrastructure, and only a few citizens know that the funds could also be employed to finance the modernisation of hospitals, purchase equipment and train healthcare professionals.
I very much welcome the establishment of European-wide registries for major diseases, notably cancer, which will be instrumental in collecting data and highlighting even more the fact that there are discrepancies of up to 30% between Member States in the survival rates of patients suffering from certain types of cancer.
On the basis of statistics such as these, I believe that the Commission will review its healthcare priorities and endorse the appropriate allocations.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the action programme on health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease are very closely related subjects.
I would like first of all to offer Mr Trakatellis my sincere congratulations on his tireless fight for this programme.
Prevention is better than cure.
Prevention means longer life, better life, better quality of life, less medical care, less sickness, lower sickness costs.
I am sure we would have liked more resources than 20 cents per head of population per year.
We are however modest and conduct many action programmes for little money.
We can only set priorities of course, and I must make it absolutely clear that we are talking here about prevention, about educating people, and not about treatment, which after all is a subsidiary matter and the responsibility of the nation states.
Prevention means stopping diseases from occurring in the first place, especially in the area of cardiovascular diseases, involving heart attacks and strokes, of tumour diseases and their causes, as with lung cancer and smoking, of unhealthy lifestyles such as the wrong kind of food or even doping in sport, of accidents and accident prevention, and of research and statistics, where the aim is to detect and understand diseases better in order to develop better guidelines for treatment.
I will now reply to the oral question from Mr OuzkÃœ, to whom I also express my thanks here.
Much can be done to prevent cardiovascular disease by changing one's lifestyle: exercise, health, sport, balanced nutrition and ultimately also avoiding trans fatty acids.
We also need a catchy slogan for cardiovascular prevention, so that people know what is at stake.
We could say, for example, 'Save your heart, save your life' or in German 'Herzlos kannst du nicht leben'.
EUR 325 million for prevention over five years is not much.
I visited a German heart hospital this morning. There, 200 million were invested in just one year!
Mr President, as my group's shadow on the motion for a resolution on action to tackle cardiovascular disease, I would like wholeheartedly to endorse this worthy initiative and thank Mr OuzkÃœ, Mr Andrejevs and Mr Bowis for all their hard work.
I feel I can but reiterate the content of the resolution and add my voice to the call for action and other points raised in the oral question.
I find it shocking that nearly half of all deaths in Europe are caused by cardiovascular disease and that it is the main cause of death for women in all European countries.
I welcome the specific mention of cardiovascular disease in the 2008-2013 health programme, but I am somewhat disappointed at the vastly reduced budget allocation given the fact that cardiovascular disease costs the European Union's countries EUR 169 billion each year.
The EU has so much to offer in terms of added value which would surely repay many times any money spent on combating it.
Nevertheless, I fully support the compromise reached and recognise that it is necessary to have this funding in place as soon as possible.
Any further delay in adopting the programme would not be desirable.
There is much action at EU level where value can be added and it is for this reason that we need a tangible European strategy on cardiovascular disease which can help Member States to improve and coordinate their prevention strategies, identify those who are at high risk, raise awareness, inform the public and promote exchange of best practice.
A set of clear political guidelines should form part of this strategy.
I would like to conclude by reiterating my support for the motion for a resolution and I urge the Commission to bring forward without delay a comprehensive and coherent EU-wide strategy on cardiovascular disease incorporating the European Parliament's suggestions.
(CS) I too should like to congratulate Mr Trakatellis and thank him for his report and his proposals.
I would also like to make one or two comments.
I do not want to go into financial details, because this has already been done.
I should merely like to point out, speaking as a doctor, that if financial resources are cut, the common programme that we are debating will simply be less effective.
I firmly believe that healthcare cannot, in budgetary terms, be a peripheral issue.
I should like to support Amendment 1, which contains proposals for Council recommendations as regards the necessary delivery mechanisms.
I feel that this is much needed, because we have often called for documents relating to healthcare or the fight against civilisational diseases, and we of course did not have the effective instruments needed to combat such diseases.
The second amendment that I should like to mention and support concerns patient awareness.
We need patients to be well informed.
This is not, however, solely a matter of improving access to information, it is also, in my view about access to better quality information.
Such information can help our citizens not only to become more interested in their own health, and in looking after themselves, but also to be less susceptible to advertising.
On the subject of advertising, I believe that we shall have a unique opportunity to show our fairness and honesty with regard to issues such as alcoholism when we debate the proposed measures in the Foglietta report on combating alcoholism.
On this issue, we will certainly table amendments regarding the advertising of alcoholic products.
I should like, if I may, to express my support for the initiative of Mr OuzkÃœ, which applies to his question regarding cardiovascular diseases.
As a former cardiologist, I feel I have a fair amount of knowledge on the subject.
I should like to say that cardiologists today know much more about the causes and have put the conditions in place for patients to receive very effective treatment and to return to a normal working life.
The problem is the extent of the desire to invest in such programmes, in particular when it comes to prevention.
At the same time, there is a failure to understand that these resources can certainly be recouped.
In this respect, the Czech Republic is a very good example.
I believe that as MEPs we have a duty to call for a level playing field in the healthcare sector as well as the economic sector.
This is a matter of financial solidarity between the EU Member States.
Mr President, yesterday's media revealed the shocking results of a study of children in a large area of England.
One in every 58 children has a form of autism.
How could a seriously debilitating condition have increased from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 58 children in 17 years?
Mr Trakatellis's work on the programme of Community action in the field of health 2007-2013 comes at a time when the need for some joined-up, collaborative thinking about Europe's major health threats is urgently needed.
One of the most important contributions Europe can make to health is statistical research and investigation, establishing the true situation of disease threats - contagious or not, chronic or acute - because, in comparing disease treatment in the Member States, we get the overall picture that helps us develop a standard of best practice and clues to both treatments and even cures.
The Commission, I am glad to say, has made a start by funding the European Autism Information System project to establish an effective method to be used by Member State health authorities to gather the essential information on the autism epidemic in Europe.
However, we are very late in this.
The USA has been tracking this epidemic for a decade now.
On foot of the figures, the US Congress has passed 16 pieces of legislation channelling billions of dollars, but Europe has done nothing yet.
I urge the Commission to find a way to foster the highest quality healthcare in the Member States, a system that will never again allow an epidemic like autism to go unchecked as it ravishes children, robbing them of their normal development.
(SV) The role and responsibility of the EU within the health sphere is, and must remain, limited.
Perhaps the most important contribution to be made by the EU, however, is to enable people to seek health care in other EU countries.
For many who are ill, health care in another EU country may be a matter of life or death.
It is therefore incomprehensible that so many Member States do everything they can to limit that very option.
European health care consumers should have access to the whole range of European health care, but that means having knowledge and information, and, where these are concerned, the health programme could play an invaluable role in disseminating information about health and health care to all patients throughout Europe.
I and many like me therefore think how unfortunate it is that, in many respects, precisely this area appears to have been curtailed when, for budgetary reasons, the Commission revised its proposal for a new health programme.
I understand, however, that there has been a very great deal of opposition to this happening.
Why, in actual fact, is increasing the transparency between different health care systems in the Member States such a delicate issue, however?
Why not focus on measuring the likely results in terms of health care and of how many people would actually be helped to get better, rather than focus on available resources such as beds and days spent in hospital?
The only explanation I can see is that there is a desire to keep patients uninformed and powerless.
It is equally incomprehensible that the EU Member States' compromise with our rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, should have called, for example, for the removal of the wordings I included precisely in order to give patients more power.
Why, for example, is there no desire to confirm that patients have rights also in their capacity as health care consumers?
They have deleted the sentence whose meaning was precisely to that effect.
I find that embarrassing.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, health decisions must be made at the lowest possible level.
For me, that means at patient level, irrespective of what is said by politicians and bureaucrats in the Member States.
We must therefore use European cooperation to strengthen the position of patients and give them more knowledge and more power.
In a nutshell, patients should be allowed to take control of their own illnesses.
(NL) Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Trakatellis and our shadow rapporteur, Mrs McAvan.
Health is a great good, as well as an important political topic.
In the first instance, health falls within the national remit but, for Europe, it constitutes clear and important added value.
At present, the access European citizens have to adequate treatment is very unequal.
Cancer patients stand a considerably better chance of survival in some countries than in others.
Treatment methods differ and access to the health care is imbalanced.
Patients' knowledge about their illnesses differs from one country to the next, and prevention does not in all countries have the attention it deserves.
This is why action is needed.
We must pool knowledge.
Member States, hospitals, patients' associations and general practitioners can learn from one other.
We should combine our knowledge about the prevention and treatment of the most important diseases, including cancer, rheumatism, diabetes, lung disorders and obviously cardiovascular diseases, and we should learn from other countries where improvements can be made.
Knowledge centres and networks, which should be dedicated to the most important diseases, can be a vital source of information for doctors and patients alike.
(SK) It is a proven fact that money invested in human health makes the best investment.
It offers the best return on investment.
I am therefore gratified that the Commission's original proposal for a joint healthcare and consumer protection programme to be established for the period up to 2013 has been defeated.
Parliament did well to increase healthcare allocations to EUR 1.5 billion from the initial level of EUR 969 million, thus sending a clear signal and message to both the Council and the Commission.
In the meantime, the budgets for new multiyear programmes in all policy areas have been the subject of negotiations concerning the new financial framework for 2007-2013; in this context, ladies and gentlemen, I must express great dissatisfaction with the fact that many programmes, including the health programme, have been allocated far less than the Commission originally proposed.
Even though the European Parliament later managed to remedy the situation somewhat, in the spring of 2006, the outcome is wholly inadequate from the perspective of some of the programmes, including healthcare.
I am referring to public health, where the topped up budget was cut to the scarcely credible figure of EUR 365.5 million.
It is a good thing that the political agreement in November 2006 for the area of health accepted the Commission's revised proposal, including the budget.
I believe that the specific programmes designed for people and for patients, such as the screening programmes for cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many other disorders, will not be jeopardised.
Nor will we put in jeopardy the necessary cooperation across the Community between specialised centres, or the establishment of Europe-wide registers of such diseases.
I fully support the approach taken by the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and I believe that Parliament will again take a wise decision.
(LT) I congratulate the rapporteur, who faced the challenging task of adapting the significantly reduced seven-year health budget to the growing expectations of EU citizens.
A coordinated Community approach in this field would significantly increase the effective utilisation of funds.
Now the programme has to be approved as soon as possible in order that at least the funds for 2008 are reclaimed in time.
In the expanded European Union, differences in medical care in various countries have become evident.
The programme under discussion ought to help reduce these differences.
Every EU citizen in any EU country has the right to receive quality medical services.
It is particularly important that the new EU countries participate in the European projects.
I would also like to underline the need for attention to preventive projects, which reduce the influence of risk factors and improve the health of the Community.
Preventing illnesses is always cheaper than treating them, especially at times like this, when resources are decreasing but needs are growing.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Community action programme establishes priorities for projects, funded at European and national level, to address the biggest causes of death in Europe, including cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer, digestive diseases and respiratory diseases.
We all have to die of something, especially when we reach a certain age.
The high quality of European medicine, along with improvements in living conditions, and in particular people's economic wealth, have led to longer life expectancy among Europeans.
There are fresh challenges that lie ahead of us.
One is how the health and social systems in Europe are to be funded in future from the public purse and the second is how to improve treatment for polymorbidity, which becomes more common as people live longer.
Such treatment is crucial to older people's quality of life.
Both of these concerns are common to all Member States, and yet neither has been included in any detail among the main goals of the Union's action plan in the area of health.
Perhaps next time.
Resolving the first of these economic concerns will entail, among other things, an assessment of priorities within the Community, both in terms of government programmes and in terms of people's private lives.
My professional experience has taught me that the main priority is to make people much more responsible for their own health and disease prevention.
Patients are not stupid and are capable of making up their own minds.
They do need adequate information for this, however, and it must be formulated in an appropriate way.
I therefore strongly support the proposals in the second reading, including Amendment 2, for example, which calls for the programme to provide citizens with better access to information, and Amendment 9, which concerns policies aimed at leading a healthier lifestyle.
As regards the second problem, I would like to believe that the Member States will actively support the coordination of scientific activities aimed at achieving the complex treatment of associated diseases, despite the large and regrettable reduction in the European budget for the action plan in support of health.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank the Members once again for a very interesting debate and for the support expressed.
I do not want to repeat what has already been said and what I said in my introductory remarks, but I shall make some clarifications.
On the issue of cancer, I should like to clarify that cancer remains one of the Commission's top priorities and is part of the health programme.
I referred specifically to cardiovascular diseases because that was in a question tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but through research and other programmes we support many initiatives regarding cancer.
We had an opportunity to discuss this issue in this House quite recently.
I should like to correct one mistake.
Mrs BelohorskÃ¡ is not here and I think that she did not follow the debate closely on how the financial perspectives were adopted and how it was decided who took the decision.
It was not the Commission who reduced the budget - we are not that suicidal.
As you know, it was the Council who decided unanimously that there should be a reduction, and the areas that suffered most, unfortunately, were health and education and culture.
I have to say that it is regrettable and I have had the opportunity to express this on many occasions in discussions here and I understand the frustration of Mr Trakatellis when he had to deal with this issue.
However, at the end of the day we want to take action, we want to help our citizens and we want to move forward, and therefore we have to make do with what we have and make the best possible use of our limited funds and resources.
That is why I agree with many of you, and it is our priority, that prevention is one of the main targets because it has added value and a multiplying effect so that we can make better use of the funds by concentrating on prevention.
That is one of my main arguments.
I have been trying repeatedly to convince Member States that spending on health is not a cost but an investment.
It has to be viewed as such.
We will benefit in the long run, and that is a disincentive for taking measures when benefits will appear sometime in the future.
Nevertheless, I think that the time has come when we cannot expect to solve the problems only through reforms of the health systems or through patient mobility or through increasing the insurance costs but we have to invest in prevention and on health and this is one of the main priorities.
I am looking forward to working with you all in the next period.
Perhaps I could refer to just one specific amendment, that raised by Mrs McAvan.
We have no objection to agreeing to the deletion of that sentence.
You realise that for us it is a big achievement to have the healthy life years included as an indicator and this was the purpose.
It was just a way of expressing it differently, but we see the point so we do not object to removing it, especially because it is the wording that is the problem and not actually the validity of the indicator.
Regarding the point raised by Mr Fjellner on the issue of patients' rights, we had the opportunity to discuss this issue in this House and we are looking into it through the healthcare initiative which should be adopted towards the end of the year.
There are different systems in different Member States so we do not always agree on a common approach, but at least the first step will be taken and many issues like information for patients and other aspects of patients' rights will be tackled through the healthcare initiative.
I should like to conclude by thanking you all, in particular the Environment Committee, as well as Mr Trakatellis for being patient and persistent.
I am looking forward to working with all of you in the implementation of the programme.
I have received one motion for resolution pursuant to Article 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 10 July 2007.
MON 863 - Risk Management (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on MON 863 risk management.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission has on many occasions declared - and, through its actions, proved - its commitment to ensuring that the legislative framework on genetically modified food and feed, which was approved by the European Parliament and the Council, is fully respected.
We have the obligation - and I believe we are delivering on this obligation - to make sure that the legislation is properly and fully respected.
Under the legislation, GM food and feed can be legally put on the market only if it is safe and appropriately labelled.
I would remind the House of how the legislation provides for the division of work between risk assessment and risk management.
The Commission has no discretion on the safety assessment of a GM product.
The legislation clearly distinguishes between risk assessment, which is carried out by EFSA, and risk management, which is carried out by the Commission.
This approach is defined not only by general food law but also by the Regulation on GM food and feed.
Whenever new scientific questions emerge, the Commission adheres to the separation of competences and asks EFSA to evaluate the information and its impact on the risk assessment of a product.
The Commission's role is to take relevant risk management decisions, provided that, and only when, such a risk is identified by EFSA as the European Union's body responsible for risk assessment.
In other words, we manage a risk once it has been identified and assessed by the body responsible.
It was a very specific decision, when the legislation was adopted, to give the risk assessment to a separate independent body.
However, if there is no risk identified by the Authority, then there will be no sound scientific basis for the Commission to take a risk management decision.
On this specific issue, MON 863 had already been evaluated twice in 2004 before the authorisation was adopted.
In both cases, EFSA concluded that MON 863 maize would not have an adverse effect, and this opinion was reached with the involvement of the national authorities of the Member States and was further reviewed and confirmed by the Authority in 2006 following a specific request to the Commission by the honourable Member Ms Breyer.
There were intensive repeated analyses, which were carried out as part of the authorisation procedure, and then there was the publication by Professor SÃ©ralini in March this year - that is the sequence of events.
The work presented by Professor SÃ©ralini was not a new study but only a statistical review of the existing rat-feeding study, which supported the authorisation of this product in the European Union.
Despite the fact that it was not a new study but only a statistical review, as soon as the Commission became aware of Professor SÃ©ralini's paper, it immediately asked EFSA to analyse it to verify whether the newly proposed statistical interpretation was well founded and, more importantly, whether the statistical differences were relevant for food and feed safety.
In order to take into account all new elements and thus to eliminate any possible sources of uncertainty, EFSA conducted a new review asking Member States to provide any relevant analysis or comments, set up a specific task force of internal and external statistical experts and held a meeting with the author of the statistical review.
In the Commission's view, the procedures set up by EFSA to evaluate the review of Professor SÃ©ralini's report represent a sufficient guarantee of independence and expertise.
EFSA first responded to the Commission request in March by discussing the issue at the plenary meeting of the GMO Panel, before issuing a statistical report and a scientific statement by the Panel on 20 June.
In particular, the Authority underlines that the statistical analysis made by the authors of the paper did not take into account certain important statistical considerations and that the assumptions underlying the statistical methodology employed by the authors led to misleading results.
The conclusion of the Authority is that the paper does not present a sound scientific justification to question the safety of MON 863 maize and, therefore, it sees no reason to revise its previous opinions that MON 863 maize would not have an adverse effect in the context of the proposed use.
Parliament will be informed in more detail of the background I have outlined in the replies to the written questions on this subject by Ms Breyer, which are currently being finalised following the recent EFSA statement.
Against this background, two conclusions emerge.
First, and most importantly, there is at this stage no scientific basis to question either the safety of MON 863 or its status as a legally commercialised product.
Second, the conclusions of the EU official body for risk assessment, made up of some of the best specialists in Europe, have been drawn after consultation of the national competent authorities as well as external experts.
By trusting the outcome of this work, which confirms the previous evaluations, the Commission has, I believe, acted as a responsible risk manger, especially within the context of the legislation and the apportionment of responsibilities as I explained them during my introduction.
The Commission will continue to work along these lines on the basis of a precautious and science-based approach.
The Commission, I would emphasise, has full determination to make a case-by-case risk management decision taking into account any scientific questions emerging during the evaluation procedure or even after the authorisation.
We will always be vigilant; we will always be ready to examine every new piece of scientific information that emerges.
But, of course, our final decision will have to be based on the risk assessment, which will be done by the body in charge of this responsibility based on European legislation.
We believe that our legislation and the Commission's approach offer the best way to provide our citizens with the high level of safety they expect and demand.
I hope that I can count on the trust and support of the European Parliament as we continue our rigorous and impartial approach.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, was it not us, was it not the European Parliament that wanted to have an independent European Food Safety Authority?
Was it not also the Council of Ministers that wanted to have an independent EFSA, an authority on whose findings you can rely, an authority where there is no risk of getting bogus studies?
Did the European Parliament not at that time charge EFSA with making risks assessments of GMOs, and did the Council of Ministers not back that very thing in codecision?
In April 2004, EFSA assessed MON 863 maize to be just as safe as conventional maize.
A second EFSA safety assessment in October 2004 came to the same conclusion.
That is not of course what the green souls among us want to hear, and because what the Greens do not want simply cannot be, they commission their own study.
Then this eventually finds, surprise, surprise, that genetically modified maize is lethal, and woe betide anyone who finds that suspect!
The EFSA experts then asked for a repeat of the trial on rats.
Again there was no sign of acute toxicological effects.
Incidentally, the Greens' study would have given the same result if the statistics had been evaluated correctly, but the statistical evaluation was not scientifically correct, as the Commissioner said.
Once again, the Green study's supposedly scientific findings were therefore deliberate scare-mongering, deliberately sowing anxiety in the minds of the public and pulling the wool over their eyes.
It is the typical ideologically motivated policy of obstructiveness that they so much like to use in election campaigns as well.
