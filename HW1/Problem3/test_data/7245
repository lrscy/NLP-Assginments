I also note with interest that in the future it will be Eurojust which will play a major role in ensuring that the mutual assistance system works smoothly.
Having made these comments, I can of course go along with the Commission and accept that the European Parliament should, in this exceptional case - without a report and in accordance with the urgent procedure - today approve the text which is before it.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
The item will be added to Thursday' s voting time.
White paper on reform of European governance
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the White Paper on Reform of European Governance.
Without further ado I will give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 September, I presented to this House the White Paper on Reform of European Governance.
Some Members gave me their immediate reactions then, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have started to analyse our proposals.
Today' s debate is therefore taking place within the context of a wider discussion that is already well under way.
I would like to make a few preliminary remarks in order to clear up some misunderstandings that have emerged during this debate - and I will, of course, be happy to reply to any further comments you may wish to make during this morning' s discussion.
As you know, the overriding aim of the White Paper on Reform of European Governance is to renew and reinvigorate the institutional triangle, which operates according to the Community method under the present Treaty.
This complements and reinforces the Commission' s and my own ongoing commitment to institutional changes that will strengthen the role of the European Parliament.
Indeed, the Commission has always maintained that this House, which directly represents the people of Europe, should play a central role in the institutional triangle, on an equal footing with the Council, representing the Member States, and the Commission, which represents the European public interest.
The Commission also supports the work of the Court of Justice to ensure that the European Union is based on the rule of law and respect for human rights.
We have been pursuing this commitment constantly and consistently.
It remains our objective to strengthen the legitimacy of this House and thus to consolidate representative democracy.
It was this same desire to consolidate representative democracy and to ensure that it functions correctly and efficiently that inspired our White Paper on Reform of European Governance.
In the past few weeks, a number of people have criticised that part of our proposals that seeks to clarify the distinction between the legislative and executive functions. These criticisms are, it seems to me, the result of a misunderstanding.
I have, for example, heard it said that the Commission is asking for a 'blank cheque' so that it can perform its executive tasks without the legitimate scrutiny of Parliament.
This is simply not true, as is clear from the White Paper itself.
What the Commission is suggesting, in fact, is that Parliament, the Council and the Commission should all take a step backwards and start concentrating once again on their institutional tasks.
The Commission, for its part, should table fewer proposals and target them better, concentrating on its executive function.
The Council should play its legislative role and not become an executive.
Parliament has primary responsibilities in monitoring the way policies are implemented and with regard to the Community budget.
It is thus much more than simply the co-legislator.
The White Paper' s proposals are, therefore, ambitious.
Their aim is to ensure that the existing rules are fully applied at last, and to give Parliament an equal role with the Council. This goes far beyond the power to 'call back' responsibility for executive decisions, on which some Members of this House have focused much attention.
The 'call-back' option is too limited, in that it merely allows Parliament to partially change the current system - which, we all know, is seriously deficient - but without making good the deficiencies.
As the White Paper shows, what we really need is a structural change that clarifies who is responsible for putting policy into practice.
This is vital if we are to know who is to be held answerable for policy implementation. After all, the principle of accountability is an essential part of the way democratic institutions operate.
The White Paper contends that the Commission should be responsible for implementing policy. It questions the need for the current system of regulatory and management committees.
The prospect of enlargement makes it all the more urgent to review our commitology.
However, the paper also states very clearly that the terms and limits of the Commission' s executive role must be laid down in the new legislation that you will discuss on the basis of the Commission' s final proposal.
It also states that we need a simple legal mechanism to allow Council and Parliament, on an equal footing, to monitor and control the actions of the Executive.
We are already giving thought to how this mechanism might work, but at this stage, before proposing anything, we want to listen.
We are expecting a major contribution from the Member States' advisory committees as well as from this House.
In the White Paper, the Commission has also committed itself to improving its consulting procedures when drawing up policy proposals.
Some have suggested that this would undermine the role of Parliament.
I sincerely believe this is not the case, and it is certainly not our intention.
Quite clearly, we have never proposed - and we never will propose - that Parliament or other democratically elected institutions be replaced by the voluntary civil associations we call 'non-governmental organisations' .
These associations play an important role in raising public awareness and integrating our society, and we therefore wish to enjoy a useful relationship with them.
This relationship, which, I repeat, has absolutely no connection with the role of democratically elected institutions, is, at the moment, unclear and lacking in transparency.
We therefore need to bring some order to current practice.
In particular, we need guidelines that make it transparent and more structured than now.
We also need guidelines on how to use expert advice in formulating public policies.
All this will improve the way in which the Commission exercises its right of initiative.
What we want, then, is a more structured and comprehensible system for interacting both with democratically elected local authorities and - in a quite distinct way - with civil society. This will ensure our consultation practices are more open and efficient than at present.
In any case, the Treaty will remain unchanged, all the decisions will continue to be taken by the appropriate institutions in accordance with the current democratic rules.
The White Paper thus opens the way for an inter-institutional dialogue on how all the institutions can improve their consultation.
We do not consider our proposals to be final and we are open to alternative suggestions, provided they are intended to achieve the same results.
I also understand there is some anxiety about the new forms of regulation proposed in the White Paper.
Some people fear they might weaken the role of Parliament.
A closer look at the White Paper should, however, convince you that, like you, the Commission is determined not to diminish but to increase Parliament' s role.
That is precisely why the White Paper proposes new forms of regulation such as self-regulation, among principles and practices that ensure democratic control.
The creation of regulatory agencies - which can only take technical decisions on a case-by-case basis - will, of course, need a legislative act.
Parliament will thus be fully involved in drawing up the rules and the necessary guarantees for adopting such an act.
We therefore have to find the right balance between the need to lay down essential elements and objectives in European legislation and the need to remain flexible and able to react to rapid social and economic change.
So the White Paper proposes, for the first time, to involve Parliament in the complex process of introducing the open method of coordination.
These forms of inter-governmental cooperation on matters that lie on the fringes of Community law must, of necessity, follow a logic that is compatible with the way the institutional triangle works.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the main challenge facing the Union today is political.
The Laeken Summit is approaching, and it should give us a roadmap towards the next IGC.
Governance is already a part of that debate.
Changing the way the institutions work (which is the subject of the White Paper) and changing the institutions themselves (which is the subject of the future proposals to amend the Treaty) are obviously two different issues which are, however, closely related.
That is why I have said that the debate on the options set out in the White Paper on Reform of European Governance is the first phase in the debate on the future of the Union.
This phase - which will take place within the current legal framework and thus within the restraints this entails - must not be reduced to a mere academic discussion. It must lead to specific proposals for action.
This is the way to give the citizens of Europe greater confidence in the way the EU works.
This is essential.
We urgently need to win back the trust of our fellow-citizens by applying the present rules correctly and efficiently.
If we do this, we shall have greater legitimacy when it comes to asking for the necessary Treaty changes later on.
However, swift action does not mean rushing. We need the kind of mature reflection that is characteristic of this House.
Clearly, therefore, I do not intend to make proposals until you have drawn up your opinions on the subject.
The Commission realises that the renewal process the White Paper has begun can be brought to a successful conclusion only if the European Parliament and the Council find the political will to start changing the way we work under the existing Treaty through a collaborative effort.
I would therefore welcome dialogue of different sorts between the European institutions, if necessary by setting up a joint working group Commission, Parliament and Council working group to look in greater detail at our proposals on governance.
I would like to thank you, most sincerely, in advance for your commitment and support.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in the 51 years of its existence, since the beginning of the European unification process and since the Robert Schuman Declaration, the European Union can lay claim to a considerable success story.
In addition to establishing the common market, the single currency and the beginnings of a common foreign and security policy, we have also become an area of peace, justice and security, and in this we are a model for many regions of the world.
But why is it that our citizens do not see the actions of the various institutions of the European Union in a proper light, as we might expect?
Why is it that they so often fail to evoke a positive response?
The question that immediately comes to mind is of course why the European Union has such a poor external image and why it is so bad at initiating and implementing its policies.
These questions of course provide the basis for the Commission's White Paper of 25 July of this year, and we are delighted that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is here to discuss this issue with us for the second time today and has just offered us cooperation within an interinstitutional working party.
I think this is an excellent suggestion that we should accept promptly and in a constructive spirit.
Another question is why our public image in the EU Member States is so patchy - I do not wish to say dismal - yet it cannot really be said that the European Union stumbles from one failure to the next.
I think that a key point here is what the Commission says at the beginning of the White Paper: it should go back to concentrating on its core activities.
The Commission should not allow itself to get tangled up in a mass of individual proposals and decisions so that in terms of overall policy strategy you cannot see the wood for the trees.
As I see it, there are a few more questions that we need to consider in some depth before we will find the appropriate answers.
We certainly recognise that the Commission - and I think that all the institutions need to do this - has subjected and is continuing to subject its actions to a critical review process, after which it can then adopt any changes necessary after discussion with us.
We also support the Commission's intention to focus on particular areas, but we have to say that the Commission should in that case undertake appropriate work with the press.
It should make it very clear to the public what European legislation consists of and how it has to be implemented.
There is also a second important issue here.
There is no point in the Commission setting up its own substructures in various fields, and I believe that it has in fact largely ceased to do this.
It should make use of existing public agencies at national, regional and local level to implement Community legislation.
There is no need for the Commission to arrange direct involvement in every local district and in every medium-sized town. Although it is important to keep citizens informed, suitable forms of interaction should be used.
Framework legislation produced by the Commission should provide for implementation at regional and national level, and it seems to me that the Commission's first proposal in the 25 July White Paper blurs the distinction between the various levels too much. So what is needed?
Joint regulation? Open coordination?
To what extent are European agencies needed? We need to address all these questions in our interinstitutional working party.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am very grateful for today's report.
We are moving ever closer and our views have more and more in common, but there is still a way to go, and there is one particular point on which I believe that we still differ.
Firstly, you have today clearly declared your faith in a form of parliamentary democracy that of course has important consequences for our work as a whole, and in particular for the role of 'civil society' .
That is another of those rather nebulous concepts rather like 'governance' , but 'governance' is used in contexts where there are no parliamentary democracies or cannot be, as in the case of 'global governance' .
In the case of civil society, and I think you were very clear about this, we need to stress that although it has a consultative role and a supporting function, it is the European Parliament and of course also national parliaments that are at the heart of democracy as we know it.
As you said yourself, they are an expression of the will of the people, and we must insist on that point.
The key point on which there are still differences between us is the issue of alternative forms of regulation.
We are not so presumptuous as to think that only Parliament can regulate and that only Parliament can create appropriate regulations, including detailed regulations.
However, the difficult thing is to decide on the framework, details, a political objective and technical implementation.
So I must insist that this Parliament is always consulted on this issue and that it is not the Commission that decides, but that there should be a joint decision, a kind of Interinstitutional Agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
This applies in particular to the issue of call back that we have also been discussing today.
Let me make this crystal clear: we need both things. We need a Parliament call-back procedure in connection with alternative forms of regulation, and we need to reform comitology.
We have nothing against the reform of comitology proposed in the White Paper, but it is not enough.
It is necessary if the decision-making process at parliamentary level is to become more democratic, but it is by no means enough.
Mr President, I hope I have understood you correctly in understanding that you will not present anything to the Laeken European Council unless it has been discussed with this Parliament beforehand and the views of this House have been sought.
You said this in general terms, and I welcome that, and I can see from your nodding that that is indeed your intention.
That represents a great step forward compared with the last time, and I would like to thank you very much indeed for that.
By way of conclusion, I would like to make one more thing clear. This is not about Parliament getting involved in the Commission's executive powers.
However, we very much reject any attempts on the part of the Commission - and they have been made - to get involved in the legislative process and to arrogate legislative powers to itself.
This emerges from many sentences and passages in the White Paper, and we must reject this.
The Commission has executive powers, but legislative competence is a matter for the Parliament and the Council and we absolutely insist on that!
Madam President, support for the European Union is decreasing in just about every Member State.
In the candidate countries, enthusiasm for enlargement is in decline.
There is little confidence in the European institutions, and the individual citizen can feel that the gap between 'those in Brussels' and 'those of us at home' is extremely large.
We are all painfully aware of this, and I am very pleased to find such a large measure of self-criticism in the Commission' s White Paper.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the White Paper on Reform of European Governance.
These changes are an important part of the major work of reform we are facing over the next few years to make the EU more easily accessible, efficient and democratic.
We are very well disposed towards the start made by the White Paper.
It points out the problems and shows where changes are required.
Some of the overarching proposals are entirely in line with what the Liberals have been pressing for over a period of quite a few years.
There must be an increase in openness and public control. The new rules adopted earlier this year in accordance with Article 255 are a first step on the way.
The decision-making processes must be simplified and made clearer.
There must be regional, as well as local, involvement at an earlier stage of the decision-making process, and we must discover mechanisms for regular consultation at these levels for it is, after all, regional and local authorities that will be implementing the majority of the EU' s decisions.
It is also very encouraging that the Commission wishes to work more with framework legislation and strengthen the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
There is little that is very specific in the White Paper, however.
What, precisely, can be done about this?
How is the individual citizen to be made to feel more involved in decision-making?
And how, in particular, is the Commission to set about promoting the change of attitude or cultural revolution that has to take place in the Commission if all the reforms are to become a reality?
We are aware that many of Mr Kinnock' s proposed reforms have come up against pretty formidable resistance.
Bureaucracies - and the Commission is a large bureaucracy - change slowly, and many people are impatient to see results.
We cannot afford to fail.
The White Paper is now under consideration. I hope that many will feel prompted to respond and present their views before part two appears.
Parliament will produce a report. In this connection, it was, moreover, extremely encouraging to hear Mr Prodi propose a joint working party, made up of representatives from the institutions.
I hope that the Commission, together with Parliament, will also be active in making the White Paper more widely known and not expect people just to find it accidentally on the Internet.
Thank you for this first part of the White Paper.
We look forward to seeing part two.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, almost everyone who has spoken has asked - as you yourself have also done - why the EU's image is not what we expect, and why people have ever less faith in it.
I am always surprised that this is commented on in a wounded tone as if we were misunderstood, as if all this were unfair, and even the answers on this subject have a very paternalistic ring about them.
They say that it is all about explaining things better to the public and presenting our policies to them more clearly.
Unlike Mr Swoboda, I do not think that we have really made any progress in this area.
The concept of good governance is very vague, and people do not really understand what you are promising them.
You are promising transparency, openness and consultation, but that is not what is at stake here, Mr Prodi.
The major misunderstanding - I might almost say a misunderstanding of historical proportions - is that this Commission does not have any conception of European democracy.
It has no conception at all of democracy at supranational level.
All these paternalistic ideas that you have presented here miss the point that you do not have the courage - and have not had the courage for years - to highlight the democratic deficits of the European Union with sufficient clarity, and to recognise that the Commission must forego some power if such a thing as European democracy is to exist, and that you need to work alongside this Parliament on many key issues, for example on preparing a constitutional process and the main elements of that process.
No, genuinely tackling the dissatisfaction that exists would mean addressing the state of crisis which exists as regards legitimacy.
We govern people with regulations because we do not have the courage to say that we have been making laws for years now.
We call them regulations because the democratic legitimacy of these laws is very fragile, because the separation of powers has not been achieved, because the principle of openness of legislation has not been achieved, because the process of committing the administration to laws has not been achieved, and because instead there is disproportionate scope for discretion, which cannot be reconciled with democratic principles, because we have an irregular administration in many areas, such as the committee structure.
It is not regular, there are no staff regulations, there are no clear loyalties, and the processes for appointing staff in these areas are by no means transparent and are easy to manipulate.
Mr President, you cannot reconcile the idea of a good technocracy with a debate on democracy.
Just as there is no such thing as a good dictatorship, there is also no such thing as a good technocracy.
You will have to address the issue of a European democracy and the position of the Commission in this process.
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I am very pleased that we have another opportunity today to discuss the White Paper together, because European governance is indeed a pivotal theme and I would like to make it very clear that I believe that the whole future viability of the European Union depends to a large extent on this issue.
I am bound to agree with Mr Voggenhuber on this point: as far as I am concerned, the issue at the centre of the whole debate around governance is the question of democracy - strengthening democracy and above all strengthening the public's rights, especially under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I say that because one thing is clear: the very best policy will achieve nothing if it does not impact on the public or if the present state of affairs continues, in which the public believes that what happens in Brussels is far removed from them and their day-to-day concerns.
I believe, Mr Prodi, that the public quite rightly expects two things: the first is transparency in decision making and the second is clarity as regards political responsibility for decisions.
I believe that this has to be the focal point from which our joint deliberations start, both for the Commission and of course also for the other institutions.
I would like to talk about transparency for a moment.
The White Paper talks about a cumbersome system of almost 700 consultative bodies supporting the Commission.
If I remember correctly, you yourself picked up this point in the White Paper on the reform of the Commission, and announced back in June that a list of these consultative bodies would be published. In the White Paper before us, you promise that details of these bodies will be published by the end of the year.
I am very much in favour of that.
This is a question of transparency, and it could help to remove some of the prejudice against the work of the Commission and the other institutions.
However, publishing details of consultative bodies is one thing, and, as I see it, accepting political responsibility for decisions is quite another.
A second point in the White Paper that I would like to mention is the 'culture of consultation and dialogue' .
I certainly regard that as a very good proposal.
I think that the Commission on the one hand and the Council and Parliament on the other would be well advised to jointly consider how a new culture of consultation and dialogue can be achieved in terms of greater involvement for civil society.
I think it would be better if the Commission did not propose a code of conduct on minimum standards for consultation for itself, but rather if we could jointly consider whether there is not some scope for all three institutions to make a joint commitment under an Interinstitutional Agreement.
You spoke earlier about a dialogue of this kind, about the possibility of setting up a working party, and I am keen to accept that suggestion.
Madam President, President Prodi, I speak on behalf of the radical Members.
Mr Prodi, what impression do you think the citizens of Europe can have if, after the attacks on New York and Washington, they have seen Chirac, Blair, Fischer and all the European leaders marching off to Washington, and then the President-in-Office and President Prodi a good last, or nearly so - through no fault of their own, of course - and it even seems on Monday - and that is saying something - even Berlusconi may go?
All this in itself reveals a deep-seated problem for as long as we give that impression (and we either give it or not). Therefore, in my opinion (and here I agree with Mr Voggenhuber), the Commission should stop talking so much and risking being misunderstood, especially in view of the Convention - which we hope will be a positive step and will give a boost to this Union.
Instead, it should concentrate on crucial problems like representation abroad, which is its own role; it should reassume its role as the driving force behind European integration, something it is losing and may lose forever. It should also be daring and make ambitious proposals, such as asking, for instance, what face Europe is showing to the outside world, since we cannot really have ten different faces on such international matters.
This, then, is my message to you, Mr Prodi: more concrete proposals, stronger proposals, particularly in view of the post-Laeken meeting.
Madam President, is not the real reason for this glossy brochure and this debate today the fact that the Treaty of Nice is dead?
The Irish people saw to that, and you know that if you ask them again they will reject it a second time.
It is interesting to note that they were the only people who were asked whether or not they wanted the Treaty.
That is why we have European governance and why you are seeking to push through the institutional changes, choosing a different method.
The only way that you will achieve the participation in this European project that you want is through consent.
By that I do not mean the consent of a House like this, but of the ordinary voters in Europe. Let us have more referendums in all Member States.
That is the only way to achieve democratic legitimacy.
The way to address the democratic deficit is to give people a chance to express their opinions.
Madam President, there is every reason for developing ideas around the subject of how Europe is to move forward, but there is also a need to know what it is that has to be developed.
Not everything has to be included, but just those things that cannot better be taken care of at national, local or individual levels, such as the internal market, the common currency, external and internal security, borders, customs and certain environmental issues.
So far, the proposals relating to democracy are not sufficiently concrete.
We therefore need cooperation across the institutions in order to move forward.
We must build upon a clear division of power in which political responsibility can be insisted upon.
The objectives need to be clarified and the initiatives adapted accordingly.
It is necessary to be able to hold people to account in a democratic system governed by law, and the prerequisite for this is a common basis of values with clear guidelines.
An effective European democracy requires discussions across linguistic and national borders, together with an education system and media adapted in the light of these.
The proposed multi-level democracy can contribute to legitimacy and greater confidence in the institutions, but it must not degenerate into a democracy characterised by bargaining or corporatism and which is so often marked by corruption.
Cooperation with civil society can make political measures better suited to their purpose, but the role of politicians must be clearly distinguished from civil society.
We now hope that the Commission will in future comply with the values in the proposal and, faced with each new initiative, ask four questions: Is the measure proportionate, that is to say appropriate to the problems that are to be solved?
Is the solution in keeping with European democracy?
Is the proposal in line with the EU' s vision and basic principles?
Can people be held to account?
The more people are involved in European cooperation, the better. Do not imagine, however, that legitimacy in itself creates democracy.
Rather, it is democracy which creates legitimacy.
Madam President, Mr Swoboda has clearly formulated the stance of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and has presented a clear proposal to the Commission.
In my capacity of shadow rapporteur for the PSE Group for the White Paper on Reform of European Governance in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would now like to explain our position from my point of view.
We welcome your proposal for efficient governance by setting up autonomous agencies, the proposals facilitating co-regulations and self-regulations, the will to consult representatives from specific sectors and the proposal on citizens' and the civil society' s right to information, participation and consultation.
We object, however, to a deal between the interested sectors and the European Commission without any parliamentary control.
That is not our idea of democracy.
We want to decide beforehand, in tandem with the Commission and the Council, when detailed legislation is necessary, when framework legislation suffices and when we can sanction a form of co-regulation or self-regulation.
It goes without saying that in many cases, it will be useful to delegate technical details to the comitology procedure, provided they are technical details, and the political component has been extracted completely.
Furthermore, the call-back mechanism, to which the European Parliament can refer, should this prove necessary, must be regulated in advance.
It is possible that the deployment of the social actors in the case of self- and co-regulation is a much more efficient way of working.
Not only should we consult the sectors about the decision-making process.
In certain cases, even social non-profit organisations could also play a role in the implementation.
But if the sectors are allocated certain tasks, the monitoring role by the European Parliament must always remain clear, and the European Commission must carry its responsibility.
Clarity always remains condition No 1.
The dialogue with social actors must be concrete and yield results, and must not become a talk shop which thrives on repetition.
For what the citizen and the PSE Group want is result: democratic control and recognisable political priority by the European government.
At present, decision-making in the EU is too diffuse and too sluggish, which leads to alienation.
The PSE Group, also in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is now offering to break this cycle.
That is possible and should be done before the Laeken Summit.
The Commission should then reach an agreement with the European Parliament which can be implemented by the end of the Spanish Presidency.
The ball is now back in the court of the Commission.
We count on you, Mr Prodi.
Madam President, President Prodi, at first sight the White Paper might seem tied down to its essentially technical content.
If, instead, we consider the reasons why it was drawn up - reasons that should have been given greater coverage in the text itself - we realise that it has a very solid and highly relevant political core.
In the G8 debate here in this House, I pointed out that, while globalisation is proceeding apace in all fields, it is hard for it to involve politics, which thus remains inadequate and slow compared with what is happening in other sectors.
This is undoubtedly one of the basic reasons for citizens' widespread mistrust of institutions at all levels, from local to European to worldwide.
Besides, what do the people of Seattle, Gothenburg or Genoa, leaving aside the more extreme positions, want of politics, if not to control globalisation?
What answer are we in a position to give, today, apart from our own inadequacy?
The European Union project is, of course, still the only concrete example that can meet these demands, but it has not yet expressed its democratic potential to the full.
The White Paper is thus a valuable instrument, provided Parliament shows the same willingness to specify those substantial organisational reforms that will enable it to reconstruct and revive European democratic citizenship.
Madam President, I would like to move the debate on to ground which has not been much talked about and to the remarks Mr Prodi made in his introductory statement about the regional element.
I would like to do so particularly from the standpoint of my own constituency, Scotland, but not only from that point of view.
It is interesting to note, when you reflect on Scotland, that about 80% of the competences exercisable by the Scottish Parliament concern domains in which the European Union has a shared competence.
When we make laws here, the Scottish Parliament and government are bound by them and have to put them into effect; that is quite right and it is the same across other similar regions.
But sometimes it can produce ridiculous results, for example when environmental laws are too detailed to allow sensible local discretion in adapting common principles to local situations.
The water problems of the Island of Islay or the Glen of Strathspey are hardly comparable with those of the Rhine basin.
A one-size-fits-all approach to water law can have absurd results, for example in respect of the Scotch malt whisky industry, despite its established environmental friendliness over 200 years.
The White Paper says, as did Commissioner Prodi this morning, that the Commission will consult regional and local government early in the policy-formation process and will seek to legislate so that local knowledge is effectively deployed in the implementation process.
That is quite right and very welcome, though it was a pity he only devoted one sentence in his opening speech to it.
Many of us had expected that the White Paper would contain a far stronger statement, especially in relation to the so-called partner regions exercising their own constitutional powers of legislation.
Europe will fail to regain or retain the affections of the citizens of the Union - and that includes the people in Scotland and our counterparts in many similar lands such as Catalonia, Flanders, Wales, Galicia, the Basque country - unless the regional and local governments with whom people there finally identify are fully respected partners in the governance of Europe.
We are the same size and population as many of the existing Member States, the same as many of the adjoining States and we are bigger than quite a few of them.
It is often said that big, important regions of large countries do better in the Union than small Member States.
I doubt it and nothing in the White Paper has yet persuaded me that is true.
Mr Prodi, your paper on European governance is an important milestone, but on a technical issue my colleague, Mr Dell'Alba, pointed out to you in a previous debate that, while the word 'governance' may be very common in the English and French languages, in Italian political culture it is to some extent opaque.
If that is the case, it may well be that we have to get the message through in each of the EU languages.
Perhaps attention could be paid to those languages in which the word 'gouvernance' , first used by Sir John Fortescue in England in the fifteenth century when the English political class spoke French, is less clearly understood than in English and French.
We ought to look at that point.
Reading your paper, it struck me that in a sense the first stage of recovery in the building of Europe is for the Commission itself to recover its self-confidence and poise.
I pay credit to you Mr Prodi, and to your colleagues Mr Patten, Mr Barnier and others, for having succeeded in restoring this poise after the resignation of your predecessors.
However, as you know - and you drew attention to this in your speech - there is concern in Parliament about giving respect to the institutional triangle.
There are fears about your use of civil society, which we all know really means consulting lobby groups.
The most effective lobby groups do their job, which is not to represent society at large - that is this elected Parliament's duty - but to represent their own vested interest.
So I am afraid the fact that you drew attention to this concern has not allayed our fears and we will continue to insist that it is we, the elected Members of this House, who represent the interests of society at large and you should not set up groups meeting directly with the Commission, evolving policy and then handing it down to us to rubber-stamp.
That is not our understanding of parliamentary democracy.
I am sorry that Mr Farage has left.
He obviously does not believe in parliamentary democracy.
He wants a referendum every five minutes.
It is absurd that in my own country, once the Prime Minister, Mr Blair, summons up the courage to confront the Chancellor, Mr Brown, we will be asked in a referendum to decide whether or not to join the single currency.
Can you imagine our financial and economic future being discussed in public houses up and down the country?
This is a job that elected politicians should do.
As regards your paper, the European Parliament and the Commission should be partners in the construction of Europe, not rivals.
If we remember the days of Jacques Delors, your predecessor, he had a clear programme, a vision: the 1992 single market.
He set out a time frame and turned that vision into reality.
We must do the same with enlargement and constitutional reform, widening and deepening.
Lastly, Mr Prodi, will you organise a public platform for the leaders of the candidate countries that will be joining the EU?
I know you have already met the new Polish leader, but the public at large needs to be able to see in practice that we have a vision of a fully complete, united Europe and that you, Parliament and the Council are working together to achieve this.
Madam President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Beazley on his excellent speech.
Mr Prodi, I would like to thank you for making it clear here today that you will not be bringing forward any proposals to amend the constitutional position unless you have the consent of the European Parliament and without a clear vote by Parliament as a directly elected body.
That is more than we have been told so far, and I am delighted about that.
At the same time I would like to thank you for trying to clear up any misunderstandings.
However, there are some things I am still not clear about.
I hope that you will be able to deal with those in your reply as well.
You said that fewer proposals would be emanating from the Commission.
There can be no objection to that, as long as you can tell us how this new vacuum is to be filled, because you know - just as my fellow Members and I do - that the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice stipulated very clearly the legislative role of the European Parliament and the roles of the Commission and the Council.
If you are now telling us that the Commission will be making fewer proposals, one of the implications of that is that you will be presenting framework proposals.
If that is what you intend, Mr Prodi, then you will have to ensure that there is a call-back mechanism and a comitology reform.
This is not just a drawback of the present system, as you just suggested, but rather an absolute necessity in the context of the ideas or proposals that you have for the future.
No one in this House wants framework proposals, but if you want them, then you must make sure they go hand in hand with proper democratic measures that do not adversely affect Parliament's rights.
You say that you want more modern measures such as voluntary commitments; no one in this House wants that.
However, if you still want that, you will have to protect democratic rights within the European Union and ensure that there is an Interinstitutional Agreement that leaves the rights of Parliament, the Council and the Commission intact.
You also said that the White Paper opens up the way for an interinstitutional debate.
It certainly does that.
But I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to state clearly before us that you do not intend to go back on the Treaties of Maastricht, Nice and Amsterdam, and that you share the views of the majority of the Members of this House about what I have said.
Not a single piece of legislation should go through without the European Parliament being involved.
There should not be any voluntary agreements and there should not be any framework agreements unless democracy is protected.
Mr President, I have three points.
Firstly, this paper is slightly more modest than its title suggests.
When you first titillated us with the prospect of presenting this White Paper over a year ago, we were all very excited at the idea of having some great constitutional blueprint.
In fact, you have very wisely produced a paper on good administration rather than a blueprint on governance or constitutional government as a whole, and that pragmatic and focused approach has much to commend it.
Secondly, I very much welcome your announcement today that you wish to establish an interinstitutional working party.
I have always felt it was a mistake to try to treat governance as if it were a piece of legislation which was first presented by the Commission and then batted between the institutions.
This is not normal legislation, but an intensely political debate that requires an intensely political and cooperative approach between the institutions.
My final point is one that you touch upon quite politely in the White Paper.
I will be less polite: we can do as much as we like at European level - in Strasbourg and Brussels - to improve administration and governance and make our decisions more comprehensible, legitimate and understandable.
However, as long as national political institutions and national political cultures remain frozen in the 19th-century mould and pretend that either the EU does not exist or is some far-off spaceship, we will never make great advances in this honourable enterprise of improving governance.
Governance can only be built brick by brick from the bottom, from the ground floor, from our nations and regions.
That is where we should all start.
Mr President, I think that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has expressed Parliament' s concerns in her main point.
Parliament does not think it is a bad idea for the Commission to set up all the consultative bodies it wants, that it should meet with all the non-governmental organisations it wishes, that it should consult everyone through the Internet, or that it should talk to all citizens on a personal level.
This seems like a good idea to us and we should probably do the same thing.
What worries us is the second part of the White Paper; or to be more precise, the proposals to improve Community regulations.
The Treaties of the European Union - as Mrs Roth-Behrendt pointed out - are based upon the principle of the division of powers.
Article 6 of the Treaty makes reference to national constitutional principles.
All national legislations are based upon the principle of the division of powers, by which legislative prerogatives are under the control of bodies elected by the people.
In the case of the European institutions there are two such bodies: the Parliament, directly elected, and the Council, comprised of Ministers responsible to their own national Parliaments.
The role of the Commission of the European Communities is to be the Community executive, and the role of Parliament is to support and strengthen the claims of the Commission to be an authentic Community executive.
However, if the Commission enters into the regulatory framework and endeavours to take on competences or powers that have been conferred or that should be conferred on the European Parliament by the Treaties, in these areas - as Mr Swoboda and Mrs Roth-Behrendt have stated - the Commission must remain in close contact with Parliament.
To be precise, Mr Prodi' s suggestion that the Commission could present the Laeken European Council with proposals on improving Community regulations, without waiting for Parliament to deliver its opinion, seems to me to be a dangerous thing.
I hope that the Commission, before putting forward any proposal to the Laeken European Council on improving Community regulations, enters into close contact with Parliament with the aim of listening to our point of view and in this way conveying to the Laeken European Council the Parliament' s concerns and interests in this matter.
Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the Commission's White Paper on European Governance in some ways comes at a bad time, and in other ways at a good one.
It is a bad time because any debate on the internal structure of the European Union and the way it functions, and on the legitimacy of the European Union itself will at present be dwarfed by the need to protect Europe's citizens against international terror and violence, with more arcane subjects being overshadowed.
However, it is also a good time for the same reason, by which I mean that the European Union has an opportunity at this precise moment to respond to people's fundamental need for safety within the EU, and for legitimacy combined with an ability to act outside its own borders.
Transparent, open and accountable decision making can accordingly help to make Europe's citizens more aware and at the same time conscious of the added value Europe can bring.
Your White Paper is a contribution to that added value, Mr Prodi.
Against this background, I particularly welcome those proposals in the Commission's White Paper that aim for a systematic dialogue at regional and local level, at a more active role for the Committee of the Regions, and the proposal that from 2002 onwards there should be an annual report on the implementation of the Amsterdam Protocol on Subsidiarity and Proportionality.
Subsidiarity and the Community method are not after all mutually exclusive.
The division of tasks between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament must be clear, just as a balance between the Member States, the regions and the EU needs to be struck under their institutional triangle.
It is obvious that the European Parliament and the national parliaments should play a central role in the public debate on the future of Europe.
That is why I find it amazing that in its White Paper the Commission does not consider the idea of a convention as requested in the report by Mr Leinen and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
An open convention which works out the decision-making basis for the Council, with representatives from the Commission and from national parliaments and from the European Parliament, together with representatives of the Member States and the candidate countries and from the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee sitting as observers, is an appropriate and essential forum for bringing the Union closer to its citizens and achieving transparency, and it must supplement and support internal reforms.
Mr President, it is indeed a shame that Mr Farage is no longer with us.
He obviously has learned nothing about public policy if he thinks that we can run the whole of Europe on a series of referendums.
This discussion is probably one of the most important that we will have before enlargement.
It is neither as hallowed nor as sexy as an IGC, but until we get the actual delivery mechanisms of democracy and public policy right, the boring, tedious administrative detail, then we do democracy an injustice.
We have to reform our governmental processes.
There are many proposals in the White Paper that cause nobody any problems, but issues like co-regulation and the delivery of public policy by external agencies do cause problems.
We cannot afford not to address these issues.
Our institutional overload, as we all know, is quite dramatic in the Union and with enlargement it will get worse.
We need to ensure, however, that when we reform those processes - whether it be issues concerning co-regulation or external agencies - we see democratic control as the key factor, democratic control in a democratic framework.
This will not be a resource-free exercise.
It will also require significant person power to deliver it, at least in the early stages.
The Commission has to face this.
It will not be a cost-cutting exercise by any means.
Finally, if there is a criticism that has to be made of the Commission, and I am glad it has realised the importance of this criticism, it is that its White Paper did not address the role of Parliament.
Now I realise that the Commission might be sensitive about doing so, in case it brings the wrath of this House down on it.
That represented a fundamental failure in the early discussions between the Commission and Parliament.
So I am very pleased that this has now been rectified and we can move forward to produce the sort of governmental structure which we require.
Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in support of what Mrs Stenzel has just said, I would like to add that it is never too late and never too soon to hold a debate of this kind.
At this particular point I believe that the events of recent weeks have brought more seriousness into politics and that the public is making greater demands on politicians.
This provides an opportunity to contribute to a renaissance of political matters and also to a significant renaissance of cooperation between leaders, those in positions of responsibility and the representatives of the people, that is to say the parliaments.
That is how we should approach this debate.
When you say in the introduction to your paper that the public feels greater distrust, more apathy and more powerlessness, I agree with you. However, in your second paragraph you say that this problem is acknowledged by national parliaments and governments alike, and that it is particularly acute at the level of the European Union.
I have a problem with this wording.
We - Parliament and the Commission - are acting as if national governments and national parliaments were on one side and the European Union on the other.
The public is particularly aware of this contradiction, with the Member States and the European institutions apparently on opposite sides.
We need to make it clear for once and all that we collectively are the European Union!
There is virtually no such thing as a European decision without the participation of the national governments, but there are a good many European decisions without codecision by the European Parliament.
Codecision leads to transparency and openness and facilitates dialogue, and is therefore the starting point for a clear separation of powers and allocation of tasks.
Your report talks about leadership.
I wish to call for more Commission initiatives based not so much on a minimum Council consensus but rather on what Europe needs.
It talks about cooperation with the regions, yet in the Belgian Presidency's proposal for the convention the Commission of the Regions is not even a full member of that convention.
Yet that is what we need.
We talk about more information, but our actions are limited to giving the Member States more money for their information work, while the Member States do not give their own parliaments sufficient information about their decisions in the Council, and therefore exclude their citizens from European decision making.
By way of conclusion, I wish to call for proposals for sanctions in the case of misuse of EU funds, because that leads to distrust about the institutions on the part of the public.
Wherever the EU is involved, that must be made evident, from the European institutions themselves to the smallest local council.
Mr President, Mr Prodi, the White Paper calls on Parliament to enhance its role in feeding the views of its electors into the political debate.
But this means, Mr Prodi, and I must stress this point, that in the twenty-first century democracy will continue to be associated with the word 'parliamentary' and not with the word 'consultative' .
We do not want to go back to the pre-parliamentary democracy era and the White Paper should not be associated with that idea.
Framework legislation and the use of other regulatory mechanisms can only be something positive if they are linked with appropriate guarantees.
In the case of framework legislation the effect of these guarantees should be to ensure that the power to define is not handed over to some agency or other, but is reserved to Parliament.
It is not only Parliament's privilege to insist on this, it is Parliament's duty.
You say that you want more transparency and consultation, but whom are you excluding and whom are you including?
Associations and non-governmental organisations that can pay for expertise will be better off than those who do not have these resources.
And in practice some people will surely be better able to make their voice heard than others.
Will this not mean that we are making the playing field for the various parts of civil society in the European Union still more uneven?
I believe in a level playing field for the various actors and institutions.
I believe that the White Paper is not clear enough about this.
I call on you to make this clear, because I have to say that when it comes to financial market legislation, the implementation of the Commission's financial action plan tends to give one co-legislator a stronger position than the other co-legislator, the European Parliament.
That does not seem a very promising road to go down.
This imbalance needs to be rectified, and at the next intergovernmental conference Article 202 of course needs to be amended by creating a call-back right.
However, the Commission could also demonstrate its good will at this stage and make it clear that it does not intend to surreptitiously change the balance between the institutions.
We, as a parliament, owe that much to society, because parliamentary activity does not just mean controlling things, but also shaping them.
I do not want to leave that task to a variety of committees chaired by people without any democratic legitimacy and who are not co-elected by Parliament, as is the case in the United States for example.
(Applause)
Mr President, I am very glad that you are being very tolerant on time this morning.
It is a well-known saying that 'if you don't know where you're going, then you won't get there' .
First and foremost we need to be very clear in Europe about what we are doing; our aim is not to create a single State of Europe, but to have a union of sovereign States that are cooperating when and where necessary.
Unlike Mr Farage, I believe there are many occasions when it is important that we cooperate in Europe.
Equally we all know that the none of the institutions are held in high regard.
That is not because they are bad.
It is because they are complex, remote and not understood.
Frankly, we will continue to face the same problem, whatever specific reforms we come up with, if they remain obscure, complex and unexplained.
I say to my colleagues in this Chamber that one thing the people of Europe do not understand is why we oscillate between Brussels and Strasbourg.
It is up to us to listen to some of the problems that people express to us.
I was disappointed in President Prodi's White Paper.
He virtually neglected the role of the ombudsman.
After all, the ombudsman is in the front line of dealing with the complaints and concerns of citizens.
I was also disappointed last month by the response of Commissioner de Palacio, whom I normally respect, who was quite dismissive about the code of good administrative behaviour.
We must make sure that we have good administration.
That means that we must have an enforceable code common to all of the institutions.
The Committee on Petitions has asked the Ombudsman to report to us on the problems that citizens are presenting to him.
We want to listen to citizens.
I extend an invitation to President Prodi, if he really wants to understand what the citizens of Europe are finding difficult with the European institutions, European rules and regulations, to give up one afternoon and come along to the Petitions Committee to listen to what citizens are saying.
He would certainly have an afternoon's entertainment hearing what people really think.
In brief, what I am saying is this: listen to people; listen to those who know what they are talking about; be clear about your objectives; and then explain yourselves in clear and simple language.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Prodi for having clarified in his speech certain points which, from a reading of the White Paper, could have given rise to misunderstandings.
Today' s debate on governance is important because it aims at encouraging broader discussion on the meaning of European integration and its goals.
It complements the debate on the future of the Union, and thus it should concentrate on the connection between general objectives and the concrete actions seen by the citizens.
As we all know, what really lies at the basis of this deliberation is the realisation that the long-term credibility of European integration is undermined by the lack of mutual recognition between public structures and civil society.
We must therefore involve numerous sections and expressions of civil society to the greatest extent possible, because in this way the citizens will also be playing a greater part in policy- and decision-making. This is an important task that the institutions of the European Union must all make a real effort to carry out together.
To this end, I would recall that during the last Parliamentary term the European Parliament itself, and in particular the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, recognised the need to initiate and formalise a dialogue with civil society.
To do this an effort must be made to identify the most representative groups, so as to avoid an excess of consultations and overlapping.
We therefore ask for an Interinstitutional Agreement on this, which will lead to a division of labour and, at the same time, collaboration between Commission, Parliament and Council.
A second important point, which has already been hinted at, is the need to simplify Community legislative procedures, distinguishing, that is, between political and legislative decisions, which must not become detailed technical instruments; and distinguishing between Parliament' s prerogatives and competences that belong to the executive.
Something that you, Mr Prodi, have mentioned is therefore important: the need to specify a call-back mechanism for secondary legislation which can safeguard and strengthen the role of the European Parliament.
Mr President, as the last speaker from my group and as coordinator of the group, it falls to me to try and summarise the positions that have been expressed.
Listening to the debate I feel that our group's views are very much the centre of gravity of Parliament as a whole on this question.
If I could try and summarise this in two sentences, it would be to say 'yes' to better information, consultation and more systematic consultation of non-governmental actors and so on, but 'no' to delegating decisions to a sort of cosy deal between the Commission and industry.
We would say 'yes' to delegating technical and implementing legislation, but only if there is an adequate procedure to bring things back if they go wrong.
In other words, there is considerable sympathy in Parliament for much of what the Commission intends to achieve in its White Paper but genuine concern about what might be the real effects of some of the proposals therein.
Let me take the example that has come up recently of the self-regulation on pedestrian safety, where the Commission has made a deal with the automobile industry.
This is a very good deal in many ways and a lot of what has been agreed is a good step forward for pedestrians' safety.
But what if it were not very good?
What if it contained some outrageous things that would not be acceptable to this Parliament representing the citizens?
We represent all the citizens of Europe not just those who are organised in NGOs.
What if the automobile industry subsequently does not apply the deal, because it is not enshrined in legislation?
What can we do to remedy the situation if one or the other manufacturer does not respect the deal?
That is the sort of concern that is being expressed in this Parliament.
I welcome the commitment of the Commission only to take this forward once Parliament has given its view and to explore these issues further in an inter-institutional working party.
That is a very welcome development.
I am very glad you gave that undertaking today and I look forward to taking this matter further.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased with today' s debate, since it has shown that our positions are converging, we agree on most points and, most importantly, we share working methods.
I would say we have laid the groundwork so that, together, we can conclude this period of reforms under the present legislation.
A common concern has also emerged which, even though it was not part of today' s debate, is closely associated with it: a common concern for a Europe that should speak with a single voice and interpret people' s growing anxieties about the institutions. These anxieties affect not only our Member States but also the enlargement States, where there is a growing problem of distrust towards the European institutions.
In this respect, many criticisms have been raised concerning the plurality of the voices of Europe, a plurality which Europe took to Washington after the tragedy.
Let us not confuse this with plurality of presence.
The content was absolutely identical: in Washington we spoke with a single voice, and after the discussions we left President Bush with the European position, which was a highly operational position, with specific areas for collaboration in justice and internal affairs and the financial problem of money recycling, fields in which we proposed lines of action on which Europe should come together.
I believe part of the citizens' anxieties derive from the complexity of our working procedures and the fact that they are hard to understand, problems that the White Paper attempts to address - partially, at least - through enhancements to the democratic system and transparency and through greater efficiency and speed in decision-making, while fully respecting or rather increasing the prerogatives of Parliament.
I confirm, then, at the end of this short debate, that we intend to arrive at a clarification of our respective functions, but no one questions the role of the European Parliament and the Council in holding political control over the Commission' s executive work.
Not only do we acknowledge this control but - I recall what Mr Corbett said in the last speech - we believe this control is absolutely essential.
I also confirm - and here I must confess that the misunderstanding arose from a mistake by the Commission, something it expressed poorly - that the Commission does not intend to take any decision, either prior to Laeken or at any other time, without first listening to Parliament.
We had insisted on the need for decisions to be made quickly, but in every case we must first consult Parliament fully.
Anyway, today we have made some progress.
Mrs Kauffmann and others have made some extremely useful suggestions.
The idea of organising a joint Parliament-Council-Commission working party to establish a code of institutional behaviour in the framework of the existing rules is a path I think we should explore.
We need to be clear about this aim; that is, we must set up a procedure to streamline the decision-making process, because, I repeat, it is slow and poorly understood. The new procedure must make it unnecessary to systematically resort to committee procedures without detracting at all from the powers of Parliament and the Council, but rather enhancing their political responsibility.
The Commission is willing to examine this path.
With all honesty and without any ulterior motive, I wonder whether the Council will be willing to do so; we, in any case, are.
For this to happen, I ask Parliament to be politically determined and insist on this approach.
This discussion also prepares for the debate on the future of Europe, which is to be organised by the Convention.
If we start out now in the directions outlined here, I believe it will help us later to find the institutionally most appropriate solutions.
Today there was one point of formal divergence that we should discuss in the area we have described, which is the procedure termed 'call-back' .
I believe the current committee system is a distortion of democracy, which is why we have looked at it critically.
It mixes legislative and executive functions, without there being any real political control.
The call-back proposal apparently improves the situation, but in fact it makes the system more confusing because it makes it more difficult to separate our functions and see the difference between them.
I think this is an area we should focus on in a future meeting of the bodies we have proposed, in order to clear up this point: we must work together for a system in which the Commission executes and the European Parliament and the Council exercise political control before measures are adopted.
If there is always this possibility of call-back, Parliament will obviously end up taking on a strictly executive function.
I repeat: let us work on it, because not only am I being perfectly sincere but it is absolutely clear in my mind that this is an extremely delicate point of democratic control.
We should use the same methodology with the agency problem.
The Commission believes that in some cases they are necessary, but we must not multiply them ad infinitum. We should turn to them only when there are highly complex technical roles and they have an autonomy of their own.
We agree with you that democratic control over these agencies is needed, control that should take three forms: when the agency is set up, and Parliament plays a fundamental part in this decision together with the Council; when its budget is checked, and it is Parliament that checks it; and when a check is made on the workings of the Commission, which is the body responsible for these agencies.
This, then, is the Commission' s position.
Two other points have emerged here: these are points included in the White Paper or connected with it although not actually included in it. They are participation by civil society and the problem of participation by the regions and autonomous local areas.
I believe it is essential for the regions and local administrations to play an active role, and in the forthcoming Convention too.
If we really define Europe as the Europe of subsidiarity, we must be consistent to some degree at least, and on this I have no reservations at all.
On the problem of consulting with civil society, if we read the White Paper carefully there is no expropriation of Parliamentary, democratically elected bodies.
On the contrary, there is a different discourse: whereas now civil society is consulted privately and indirectly, we are proposing that such consultation should be transparent and in the open, so that everyone can see where particular ideas and positions arose or where certain suggestions come from.
This, to me, is a step forward.
I understand I may have created concern because, when faced with such clear evidence of a process, Parliament may say, 'But that is our job!'
I can assure you that we have the opposite objective: we must consult civil society because it is useful for us and it is useful for you, but consulting means consulting; it is absolutely unacceptable that this should be seen as an alternative form of decision-making that could be confused with or compared to that of Parliament.
I say this quite clearly because you will never have heard the Commission proposing, for instance, to bring civil society into the Convention in a role involving decision-making aspects.
I do think, however, that transparent, clear consultation is a step forward that we really should take.
I repeat: it has never been our intention to attribute an institutional or constitutional role to consultations with civil society, even though we are concerned to understand what is happening within that society, and thus to keep our eyes open and ears tuned, ever alert to whatever is happening.
In a certain sense it is like the suggestion made by Mr Perry to attend the Committee on Petitions, in order to keep our eyes open.
In any case, please remember that the Commission' s proposal has two objectives: first, a more parliamentary democracy; and secondly, a more efficient democracy.
In the discussion on the relationship with Parliament, the call-back problem lies in this context.
We want a more parliamentary democracy in which the role of Parliament is clear and precise, but also more efficient, one in which the executive role is not continually called into debate by procedures.
I believe this could be clarified with the proposal of working together on these issues over the coming months. This may be beneficial and lead to progress in future in our way of working, under existing legislation for the time being, in expectation of the great institutional reform process which should start after the Laeken Summit.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
If I may, I would like to add that with the Charter of Fundamental Rights we had very positive experience of involving civil society, but we did not have any Members in the Convention.
Mr President, there has probably been a translation problem.
I shall repeat the sentence which is the key to the latter part of my speech: we have never said - and I confirm this today - that civil society can play a decision-making role.
That is reserved for Parliament and the Council - our institutions.
We simply want consultation to take place more transparently, more clearly and more comprehensively.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi!
I think that really does make things clearer.
A few Members were actually somewhat surprised, but I think that we all know what was meant now.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you now have the floor.
As you know, if the Commission President wishes to add anything else, we will of course be happy to agree to that.
Asylum and immigration
The next item is the joint debate on asylum and immigration policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister, today' s debate has come at a crucial time: we are two weeks away from the European Conference on Migration, which has been organised by the Belgian Presidency, and two months from the Laeken European Council, which is tasked with carrying out the mid-term review of the Tampere agenda.
Both of these should be essential stages in the process of drawing up common immigration and asylum policies.
In adopting the two resolutions which are on the table today, whose quality and balance should be saluted - and I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Pirker and Mr Evans - the European Parliament will, I am sure, express clear and forceful priorities in good time.
Since the tragic events of 11 September, the European Union has been confronted with a new political agenda in the fields of justice and home affairs.
Thanks in particular to the determination of the Belgian Presidency, it has so far been facing up to this remarkably well.
The European Council of 21 September sent out a very clear message to us.
We should adopt as a matter of urgency the measures necessary to reinforce the internal security of our Member States and their nationals while making the fight against terrorism a priority.
At the same time, however, the European Council of 21 September emphasised that neither should we stop working on other issues set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam and thus towards our objective of safeguarding and developing an area of freedom, security and justice.
I am delighted that the European Council underlined the need to strike a political balance between stepping up police and judicial cooperation with a view to combating crime and terrorism, on the one hand, and establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, that is protecting the fundamental rights of the public, on the other.
I have always stressed in these debates here with the European Parliament, but also with the Council, that we need common immigration and asylum policies more than ever.
The relevance of both the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions has been repeatedly reaffirmed.
I am convinced that the public genuinely expects, and even demands, the addition of European value to national policies whose limitations are becoming ever more apparent, whether they be security policies or policies to protect civil liberties.
To achieve an objective of this kind and identify the European added value which we can bring to national policies, I believe that we should take into account both the security imperatives and the respect for values which are the common defining values of our European Union, including the freedom of movement which is guaranteed by the Schengen Agreement.
The Council has asked the Commission to evaluate its proposals on asylum and immigration in the light of the terrorist attacks in the United States of America.
We have already buckled down to this task.
The political will to move forward on these matters which was reaffirmed by both the European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council should give us new hope.
As the Minister emphasised just now, it is true that the slow progress and the difficulties which we have encountered on certain dossiers could cast serious doubt on our ability to take substantial decisions within the very strict deadlines in the Commission timetable.
This new momentum should benefit all aspects of our cooperation on justice and home affairs, provided that the Member States recognise that it is impossible to have European legislation which is a faithful copy of fifteen national laws and that they will each have to give some ground in the search for a common solution from which they will all benefit.
As far as the substance of today' s debate is concerned, I note that there is broad convergence between the Commission' s views and those of Parliament, as reflected in the two excellent reports by Mr Pirker and Mr Evans.
Whether they concern the principles on which the common European asylum regime should be based or the components of a coherent approach towards the migration phenomenon, we do not have any difficulty in going along with most of your recommendations.
In some cases we have even anticipated them and several of your requests are already taken into account in our proposals on the legal status of long-term residents and on admission for employment purposes, or again in our communication of last July which followed on from the one of November 2000 and went into more detail on some of the guidelines.
In other cases, we are preparing to follow them up, for example in the communications which I intend to propose to the Commission for adoption in the coming months, the first of which concerns the fight against illegal immigration and the second repatriation policies and external border checks.
I also share your concern about the need to develop practical proposals to build a real partnership between the Union and the countries of origin and transit.
We have started work on this by setting up a high-level group, whose mandate will be extended thanks to the implementation of a new budgetary instrument with the strong backing of the European Parliament.
Nevertheless, people may feel that this work and the implementation of the action plans adopted by the Council are not bearing sufficient fruit.
I therefore agree that in general we should recognise the significance of these migratory phenomena by giving them greater consideration when we are formulating the European Union' s external policy.
To a certain extent we have to recognise that we are hostages of the division between the second and third pillars, which is completely unjustified because on closer inspection the very close links between the European Union' s development and migration policies become apparent.
I should also insist on the fact that a genuine European policy on immigration and asylum will not exist - over and above the legislative framework - unless national policies also converge in practice and in pursuit of common objectives.
This, then, is the aim of the Commission's proposed open coordination policy, which is similar to the method already used - incidentally with success - for employment, for example.
An open coordination method of this kind seems to me to have the advantages of flexibility and transparency as well as respecting subsidiarity, while providing a powerful incentive to harmonise legislation and national practice - even spontaneously I would say - and being a good indicator of the areas in which Community intervention is really essential.
It requires the Member States to agree in the Council on common guidelines proposed to them by the Commission after a broad process of consultation.
They will then have to implement them at national level using the national legislative and administrative means at their disposal.
The Member States will be invited to draw up national reports every year in which they will have to take stock of the progress which they have made in implementing these common guidelines.
The Commission's summary of these reports should make it possible to identify, on a case-by-case basis, the weak points in the essential convergence exercise and, if necessary, to refine and add to the common guidelines.
In July, we put forward a first set of guidelines concerning the management of migratory flows, the admission of economic migrants, partnership with third countries and the integration of third-country nationals into our societies.
Further proposals will be made for asylum when we publish the first report on the follow-up to our communication of November 2000, which will be sent to you in the coming months.
The Commission hopes that the Council and the European Council will give these new guidelines their blessing so that implementation can start immediately and a first complete round be conducted in the course of next year.
In conclusion, I should like to come back to some fundamental principles which in the current circumstances it is, more than ever, important to reiterate.
First of all, asylum is a right which is guaranteed and regulated by international instruments and confirmed by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
No one will dispute the fact that it may be abused.
And it is up to us, as politicians, to put a stop to this, not by further weakening the position of those who really need international protection, but - and this is a better bet - by aligning the procedures and criteria applied at national level and making them more effective.
The introduction, in the medium term, of a one-stop shop, which you support in your resolution, would, therefore, unquestionably be a significant step forward in my opinion.
In the meantime, it would seem to be essential to endeavour to improve the quality of initial decisions, as recommended in our proposal on asylum procedures.
Secondly, we cannot deny that immigration occurs.
It would be eminently regrettable if some people were to take advantage of current feeling to revert to a policy of slogans.
Slogans will not resolve the immigration problem.
Above all, name-calling, which is an accessory of racist and xenophobic sentiment, must be avoided.
What we do have is a genuine policy to manage migratory flows at both national and European level.
And the terms of reference would appear to me to be obvious.
Legal immigration channels need to be clearly identified and the possibilities which they represent need to be quantified, not on the basis of the unexpected whims and uncertainties of the economic cycle, but on the basis of a realistic assessment of our societies' structural needs and how many immigrants they would be able to accommodate.
A dialogue with the countries of departure is necessary and it is important to take into account the different types of immigration with which we are faced.
Some immigrants are long-term and are expected to stay in their host societies for good, but others - and there are increasing numbers of them - are part of cyclical migration flows, which implies - and this should be encouraged - that they will maintain a stronger link with their region of origin.
Finally, the credibility of a proactive immigration policy must be consolidated by an effective campaign to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings which is associated with it.
We should give serious thought to creating a major new Community instrument, alongside those which are designed to combat exclusion, which might, for example, address the specific problem of integrating immigrants.
Today, cultural pluralism is becoming a characteristic of our societies, particularly in urban areas, which raises very serious challenges.
It may inject real dynamism into society if it is based on genuine mutual tolerance.
But it may also be the source of confrontation and social division.
This mutual tolerance and respect will be one of the keys to social balance and cultural progress in our European societies.
I should like to thank the European Parliament for helping to enrich this debate, which I sincerely hope will be brought to a positive conclusion.
Through the impetus given by the Belgian Presidency and with the personal commitment of the Minister, Mr Duquesne - whom I should like to thank and whose efforts to reach compromises in a true European spirit I can vouch for - I hope that Laeken will constitute a major step towards establishing the area of freedom, security and justice.
This is not a dream; it is a reality which the public is increasingly keen to experience.
Mr President, as we all know, the last few weeks have been very difficult and we will continue to live in challenging times for many months and years ahead.
Therefore, this is a very important debate, and I am delighted that not just the Commissioner but the President-in-Office, Mr Duquesne, are here in person, recognising the importance of this issue.
As Mr Duquesne implied in his contribution, if the recent happenings have shown us anything, it is that we cannot turn a blind eye to events around the world and hope that they will go away.
The problems of people wanting asylum, the situation and the plight of the people of poor and troubled countries all over the world are our concerns and they manifest themselves on our doorsteps, on our shores and in our parliaments if we do not address them.
At one level these problems manifest themselves as debates in this and other parliamentary assemblies.
At the worst level we find bodies in lorries at Dover, on the beaches of Spain and other countries.
This is the plight of desperate people seeking desperate measures to start a new life.
But these people are not resorting to this sort of action lightly; they are escaping from terror, war, torture, rape, vile regimes posing as governments and, of course, in some cases, poverty.
So there can be no more appropriate time for countries to be working together to confront these humanitarian challenges.
I congratulate the EU Heads of Government for having brought asylum into the Community competence and setting a progressive agenda at Tampere.
I congratulate the Commission on these proposals, which have started the debate on how a common asylum policy should be shaped.
In my report before Parliament today I am asking for a common and wider interpretation of the Geneva Convention of 1951, a clearer definition of who should be recognised as a refugee and one that is consistent across all 15 countries.
Let us also harmonise the treatment asylum seekers receive; let us establish Europe-wide common standards and then make sure that we enforce them.
If we adopt this report we can start to establish minimum basic rights, as the Minister and the Commissioner have said, for refugees, for access to welfare, housing, education, health care - things that we in the privileged world take for granted.
In recent years it sometimes seemed that EU countries were competing to become the least attractive to potential asylum seekers.
Common, Europe-wide standards will inevitably create a more balanced distribution of asylum claims throughout the EU.
That must help my city, London, and all the major cities of Europe.
It must also stop countries being able to lower their standards, which will be good for asylum seekers, who can be more confident of a fair hearing.
That is something of which we should be proud and not ashamed.
In addition and crucially, Europe must collectively do far more to address the root causes that lead to people seeking asylum and becoming refugees.
Governments must make concerted efforts to help create peace in the troubled parts of the world, however difficult, and to increase aid to developing countries - strong measures that in time will work towards countering the pressures that force people to migrate.
It is for the same reasons that we must press ahead with the enlargement of the European Union.
As Commissioner Verheugen said recently, we cannot ask ourselves the question: can we afford enlargement of the European Union?
Instead we should put the question: can we afford not to enlarge the European Union?
In committee, many centre-right and right-wing Members voted against my report in whole or in part.
I challenge those Members who are sitting opposite today, not to just give a prepared speech or ignore what I am saying now but to tell us why they are opposing certain parts of it and why they want to diminish the rights of a fair appeal, which is Amendments Nos 6 and 8 by Mr Schmitt.
How will this make the system better?
To those - perhaps the British Conservatives - who will vote against this report in its entirety, if they were here I would ask them to explain to Parliament how we can address the current asylum situation in Europe without Europe-wide policies.
They must recognise that this is a global issue and one that cannot be dealt with on an individual basis in each country.
I sympathise with Amendments Nos 11 and 12 by the Green Group, but I cannot support them.
We could support them in another report dealing with those escaping from hunger or environmental disasters.
However, this is a compassionate report, one with which we can be satisfied but not complacent.
In conclusion, I should like to thank my colleagues from my own and other groups for their help and support for this report and for their cooperation.
I thank my own group staff for their hard work and I pay tribute to the NGOs that have contributed valuable ideas.
I commend the report to Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to start with I would like to say, Mr Duquesne, that I regard it as very positive that you are taking part in this debate yourself as the Minister for the Interior and are not being represented by your Minister for European Affairs.
We have noted that you have a good grasp of the issue and are interested in really achieving something here.
If this can be done in conjunction with the Commission and Parliament, then we can look forward to some real progress.
The European Union is now clearly taking things seriously and is for the first time making a genuine attempt at a systematic approach toward migration policy. We have accordingly clearly established that there are three groups of migrants requiring different measures and different legal arrangements, and that there are also issues which cut across the three groups.
Let us look at the three groups first.
We have economic migrants, and my report addresses how they are received in the individual Member States, depending on the facilities and needs of those Member States.
Then we have asylum-seekers, who are recognised as refugees under the Geneva Convention.
I firmly believe that the Geneva Convention should on no account be watered down or departed from, either by extending or by diluting the grounds for granting refugee status.
What we need are swift and safe decisions for refugees and European minimum standards for the procedures involved.
The third group covers war refugees, that is refugees who come to us temporarily and need a different kind of help again.
Issues which cut across the three groups include family reunification and combating trafficking in and smuggling of human beings and illegal immigration.
That means that we have a complicated system before us.
My report is concerned exclusively with immigration on economic grounds and was adopted with six votes against, so that it achieved a fairly broad consensus.
I would like to express my sincere thanks for the extremely constructive and positive cooperation between the wide variety of political groups in this House, which made it possible to create a broad basis for a new approach to immigration into the European Union on economic grounds.
What is at stake here is controlling the immigration of workers and maintaining social, economic and political stability in the European Union.
However, in view of the events of 11 September, we also need increased vigilance when it comes to the hospitality, aid and freedoms offered by the Union, to make sure that these are not abused by individual elements to breach the security of Europe's citizens or of the world as a whole.
It should also be clear to us, as I stated at the beginning of my report, that we cannot counter demographic trends by means of immigration alone, but that the only really good and meaningful approach is, of course, an enhanced education policy and family policy.
It must also be clear that we have to give the integration of third country nationals living here legally higher priority than new immigration.
What are the core issues in my report?
It is evident that when it comes to immigration the European Union can only take on certain tasks and that a great deal must remain a matter for the Member States.
Another issue that must remain in the hands of the Member States is what workers and how many workers should be given residence permits and work permits for a particular Member State, depending on that State's needs and facilities.
It is also evident that if integration is to be successful, factors such as the availability of suitable work and housing must be taken into account.
Another important issue for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is what we expect of immigrants, by which I mean their willingness to integrate and to recognise the Community of values.
Conversely, there should also be an obligation on the Member States to provide an appropriate level of support for integration.
At EU level it is a question of determining conditions for the entry and residence of these migrants and drawing up a coherent system for granting visas, of regulating the ability of third country nationals to move between Member States and the introduction of measures to counter trafficking in and smuggling of human beings and illegal immigration, and also cooperation and information campaigns in and with the countries of origin.
The committee in principle welcomes all the Commission's proposals on the immigration of workers.
I hope that the broad consensus that we achieved in committee will be repeated when we vote here in the plenary.
. (NL) Mr President, when the report by Mr Evans was being written, we were still oblivious to the tragedy of 11 September.
In the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Defence Policy to this report, however, a number of recommendations were made which, precisely against the backdrop of 11 September, are very pertinent indeed.
This Parliament has often called for a common and unambiguous policy on evaluating whether or not countries are safe.
It is not acceptable that some Member States should declare countries safe, therefore refuse to receive refugees and asylum seekers, while other countries do.
The security services and embassies of our Member States should join forces in this respect.
Since 1992, there has been a structure in place, comprising CIREA and the High Level Working Group, but they do not operate well together.
And they certainly do not work well with the Member States.
We are therefore asking for an improved and transparent structure to be introduced in this field.
In addition, in a Union with open borders, discrepancies in admissions policy are untenable, and a joint foreign policy is also totally inappropriate if we fail to sing from the same hymn sheet.
In that sense, I would make an urgent appeal to the Commission to do something about this.
Afghanistan is, in fact, a good illustration of how things can work.
A second observation pertains to the aid to those countries that receive large groups of refugees.
We should provide far more aid to those countries, and especially the UNHCR.
In principle, it is better for people who flee to remain in the vicinity of their own country, so that they can return quickly.
But they do need support.
However, the UNHCR resources have been cut back drastically by the European Commission, and we believe that this situation should be improved promptly.
Moreover, we also believe that people should receive more education in the camps so that they do not fall victim to radicalism and crime.
Finally, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to point at the need to be a lot more pro-active in terms of conflict prevention.
It would be of great benefit to us if we could close the ranks better in the EU in this respect.
In that way, conflict could be prevented.
The recommendations made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have been adopted unanimously in the committee.
It would be unfortunate, in my opinion, if Mr Evans' report would lead to diversity.
I would like to dare him to work closely with the other groups in order to reach unanimity.
We would then, at least, be able to support his report.
Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy welcomes the Commission' s communication on Community immigration policy and unanimously saw fit to recommend the inclusion of a set of measures based on five premises:
One, to take on Europe' s shared historic responsibility for this problem.
Two, to consider immigration as a positive and irreversible phenomenon.
Three, to consider the harmony that should exist between the free movement of capital and goods on the one hand, and the free movement of persons on the other.
Four, the application of the whole range of human rights in political, social, economic and cultural terms to all people, including, of course, immigrants.
Five, to take advantage of the opportunity for the European Union to play a positive role in eliminating international inequalities, strengthening the economic links of countries in which immigration originates.
From this, again briefly, the Committee drew five main conclusions:
One, to have an EU immigration policy based upon human rights and mutual benefit with countries from which migratory flows originate.
Two, to promote multiculturalism, respect and positive regard for the contribution immigrants bring to our society and economic development.
Three, to speed up the legalisation of all immigrants and in this way fight against the mafias involved in the illegal trafficking of people.
Four, to have a coordinated common European foreign policy that serves as an instrument for eliminating poverty in countries in which immigration originates.
Consequently, five, to increase the B7-667 budget line and its effectiveness with the aim of limiting illegal immigration and strengthening democracy and the rule of law, in addition to launching integrated development aid programmes.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. (ES) Mr President, I think the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission have given us two very good speeches.
The President-in-Office of the Council told us in all honesty that Council is at present rather confused about asylum and immigration policies.
Commissioner Vitorino, who has undertaken magnificent work in this field, told us that, in the area of immigration and asylum, Community institutions currently find themselves caught between two stools: that is to say between the first and the third pillars.
That is to say that immigration and asylum policies, at this moment in time, appear on the one hand in the Treaty establishing the European Community and yet there is no clear Community competence in the field of asylum and immigration.
Also, it is very strange that the Heads of State and Government in Tampere made grandiose statements about a European immigration policy, but we do not know if these will actually be converted into Community Law.
We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, have highlighted the inconsistencies between the declarations by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere and the commitments given in the Community Treaties.
I think that the Conference on immigration, which the President-in-Office of the Council informed us would take place within the next two weeks and at which I think there will be significant participation by Members of the European Parliament, will be an opportunity for the three Community institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - to formulate, or to at least start to formulate, the need to give a Community legal basis to the problem of immigration, for, in this case, we have a genuine Community-wide problem.
With regard to immigration we cannot talk of subsidiarity.
The problem of immigration is, at this moment, common to all European countries, and Commissioner Vitorino, in carrying out the work on the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy, is moving in the right direction.
I think that the Commission' s strategy is suitable, but we need to strengthen it from the constitutional angle with the appropriate modification of the Community Treaties.
Mr President, as the Vienna Monitoring Centre showed last year, there is a need for a progressive policy and leadership in both areas under debate today.
I welcome the recognition that a restrictive approach to immigration has not worked and is counter-productive.
We have only to look at the increase in trafficking and the difficulty in recruiting skilled professionals to demonstrate this.
It is obvious that there is work available in the European Union for people from third countries.
In many of our countries they are crucial to agricultural production and many major companies employ third-country nationals in senior executive posts.
Yet there is still an attitude around that we are doing such people a favour by allowing them to enter the EU to support our economy and our social security system.
Let us be honest: we want them to help maintain our standard of living.
If we get it right, it should be a mutual benefit.
As part of that, we need to ensure equal treatment for third-country nationals, not least in the workplace.
The implementation of the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination is also crucial.
Why work here, if you then face racism and xenophobia?
Business tells us that recruitment needs to be made easier and more flexible at all skill levels.
This calls into question work permits attached to a particular job and company.
Unfortunately, the lead committee did not take this on board.
Recruitment is also hampered by restrictions on family reunion, business tells us.
My political group has tabled amendments relating to that human factor.
The working rights of partners also need to be improved.
We have also to recognise the fact that some migrants will wish to stay and settle.
This is important in terms of continuity and stability for individuals, society and business.
A constant turnover is problematic on many levels and we have to remember that we are human beings, not cogs in an economic wheel.
Mr President, immigration over recent decades, which is measurable in millions, has taken place largely despite the arrangements put in place by the Member States.
In most cases, the hallmark of national policies on immigration is a lack of vision and creativity and a fear of domination by foreign influences.
However, there is now no disputing that immigration has taken place on a substantial scale and that immigration will and must take place in future.
The detailed reasons for this are to be found in the 28 pages of the Commission communication.
The Commission's shift to an active immigration policy is very much to be welcomed.
The Commission recognises that pressures to migrate will continue and that regulated immigration can be advantageous for the EU, for the immigrants themselves and for their countries of origin.
This change in policy does, however, also mean that decisions will have to be taken and that it is not sufficient merely to administer immigration by hiding behind general political guidelines, or, in the words of the rapporteur, on the basis of the cornerstones of immigration policy.
That would mean that we would never achieve a Community migration policy as laid down in the Tampere conclusions. Instead, immigration would remain a national responsibility for Member States, with all their shortcomings, with just a basic framework at Community level.
Overall, a long-term immigration policy can reduce the pressure from illegal immigration, from trafficking in human beings, from illegal employment and from the economic exploitation of migrants.
Third country nationals must be given the same rights as EU citizens, as the Commission assumes in its communication, and they should be able to contribute to the local economy through their work; only in this way will the sort of integration we want take place.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy with common standards and a common status for recognised asylum-seekers has provoked a much-needed debate and you deliberately arranged for an open debate at the outset, Commissioner Vitorino.
Various possible scenarios have been presented and the possibilities for a common procedure and common principles have been investigated.
I deeply regret that in contrast to the Pirker report it was not possible to achieve a broad compromise in committee.
Unfortunately, in the case of the Evans report, instead of a reasonable consensus emerging, it was ideology that won the day.
It is intended that both the grounds on which asylum is granted and the procedures involved should be extended across Europe. This is despite the fact, as you mentioned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that at present some 90% of asylum-seekers apply for asylum on purely economic grounds and are therefore rejected, and despite the fact that the present checking procedures can take up to eight years.
I am sure that it is only possible to agree to extensions of this kind if you have totally lost sight of the position in your own country.
What will the impact on us be if arrangements of the kind Mr Evans is presenting to us today become a reality, and if in future persecution by non-State agents and gender-related persecution are recognised?
In practice this would amount to granting an unlimited right of residence in the EU to most families in the Islamic world.
Why is that?
Let me explain.
No one would deny that in every Islamic country there are fundamentalist groups that use Islam to discriminate against women's rights, from the perspective of our system of values.
Which means that any woman in an Islamic State can make a valid claim of persecution by non-State groups.
If this were to be recognised in the EU, she would then be able to bring her entire family to join her.
So the question we need to ask here is this: do we want to and are we able here in Europe to solve the problems of the Islamic world and the problems of the Islamic view of women?
I have a clear answer to that: no!
And the picture is even clearer now that we are all aware of the problems and risks that have arisen over the last few weeks.
At the same time, Mr Evans, contrary to his original statement, wishes to abolish the concept of a safe third country and thus burden the in any case protracted procedures with additional checks.
My own conclusion is therefore that in its present form the Evans report is irresponsible.
It gives the Member States sufficient arguments for refusing to give us the right of codecision when further EU reforms in this area are being considered.
It is evident that there is a majority in this House that is not yet mature enough to be given such responsibility.
Mr Evans, if you are advocating an extension of the right of asylum here, then I would ask you what steps your own party, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, has taken in this direction in recent years?
I can tell you that it has certainly not dealt with things in this way.
That is because it does not have the support of a majority of the population for such steps and Labour could otherwise expect to be voted out.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to be quite explicit about this, and it is obvious in any case: if we try to standardise every detail of the right of asylum across Europe in future, we will be unable to achieve agreement on this in the Council of Ministers.
That is why I am specifically asking you and advising you to limit harmonisation to the necessary minimum standards.
Mr President, Europe is experiencing tension between low population growth and a genuine demand for manpower in the labour market, on the one hand, and a population that is distrustful of immigration on the other.
Faced with this situation, political decision-makers can react in two ways: either by exploiting people' s fears to their own advantage, at least in the short term, or by attempting to manage the different aspects of immigration as best they can, bravely explaining the reasons for this phenomenon, the benefits it brings our societies, its more problematic aspects and the policies that are necessary.
We have seen some examples of this first approach right here this very morning.
In its two communications, the Commission has, fortunately, positioned itself firmly in the second camp, and we can only congratulate the Commissioner for this and show our approval.
It has also achieved this - I would like to stress - in accordance with the agreements and mandates reached at the European Council in Tampere.
Whilst I fully subscribe to everything my friend and colleague, Mr Evans, said about asylum, I would like to focus during the short speaking time available to me on the communication on immigration and the report.
Both define a clear path to be followed.
The communication discusses, and the report also focuses on, the external and internal causes of immigration, the need for codevelopment policies and a new partnership with the countries of origin, a common European legislative framework to organise entry in a fair, transparent and straightforward way, residency and integration, which to me means rights.
Only after this does it talk, once these standards have been established, of addressing the subject of illegal immigration, because we need legal channels to do this.
Lastly, the report speaks, and we shall be discussing this here in detail when we see the legislative proposals, of establishing new immigration policies in the twenty-first century for a new society and a new economy, that cannot simply be a rehash of guest worker policies from the industrial societies of the 1960s.
I hope that the Council will also align itself with those politicians who want to broach this subject clearly and courageously.
I really hope this will be the case and I say this in the full knowledge that, on the subject of immigration, we are speaking with both our minds and our hearts - I say this knowing that listening to me today are EU citizens, some by birth and others through choice, all invited by my colleague Mr Aparicio, and who have high expectations of this debate.
Parliament will try to prove equal to events, and, despite the fact that on occasions events make things difficult for us, we are going to try, and this is something that has never been done by the PPE-DE Group with regard to asylum, to give strong support to this Commission communication and we hope in exchange, Mr President, that the European Council at Laeken will be able to once again initiate a dynamic and robust policy that will allow us to tackle this much needed common immigration policy.
Mr President, my group strongly supports the report by Mr Evans and welcomes its call for a high-quality common asylum policy.
It is a curious feature of the construction of Europe that more opportunities for cross-border cooperation have been taken by commerce and criminals than by civil servants, and it is about time our national public administrations made a real effort to get out of their bunkers.
The situation at Sangatte, near Calais, has featured often on television screens in my home country in recent months.
The UK can reflect on why so many people wish to come to our country and especially to my city, London.
I like to think, at least in part, that this is a compliment to our free and diverse society, but we cannot just have an open door, and maybe the French authorities need to reflect on whether their system could be improved.
There must be an equal balance of effort and sharing of responsibility to prevent both forum shopping by asylum seekers and 'pass the parcel' by Member States.
We also need consistency.
It is illogical to be dismissive about people fleeing Iraq or Afghanistan, implying that they are undeserving scroungers, when by common agreement the regimes of those countries are deemed brutal and depressive, and even deserving of military attack.
Even if not everyone from such countries can be judged refugees under the strict Geneva Convention criteria, but only as escaping mere misery, there is no call to demonise them.
We must also be consistent about our attitude to women.
If we think, as we do, that women's human rights in Afghanistan are grossly denied, we must take account of that in deciding asylum claims.
Finally, we must not weaken or lower the standards of our asylum systems under the guise of fighting terrorism, as the British Home Secretary is threatening to do.
There are adequate powers to detain and deport if security is threatened.
Speedy decisions are those based on high-quality procedures and efficiency such as that offered by the functioning immigration service computers which the UK lacks - not on removing appeal rights for all applicants.
Mr President, when a Community competence in immigration and asylum was enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam it certainly raised hopes, chief among them that of seeing a policy on immigration and asylum founded on values associated with democratic freedoms and respect for human rights, especially fundamental rights.
In this respect, we welcome the two Commission communications, which examine these complex issues in great depth.
Thus, instead of ineffective, inappropriate immigration policies which make illegal immigration an inherent part of the system, they propose a flexible approach with provisions for managing flows and integrating third-country nationals.
It is regrettable that our rapporteur on immigration should have focused on exploiting the management of migratory flows for the economic and demographic ends of the countries in the Union, without showing concern for the human factor.
To implement these proposals on an intergovernmental basis, as Mr Pirker wishes, would not only be a step backwards compared with the Treaty of Amsterdam; it would also show contempt for the need to make immigration and asylum policy a Community instrument and above all it would be a refusal to recognise what is really happening on the ground, which can be seen every day at Sangatte and elsewhere.
Furthermore, we urgently need to correct the misconception that, 'immigration equals workers' .
The notion of a 'migrant worker' does not actually take account of what really happens when people immigrate with members of their family, including students or retired people.
Let us remember that the right to live as part of a family is a fundamental right which no country can deny.
There is therefore a strong case in favour of talking about 'residents' and - why not - 'European citizens' , assuming that they participate fully.
It is the Member States' duty to take the necessary measures to ensure that all European residents are fully integrated; they achieve this by making sure that everyone has the same rights, including political ones.
As far as illegal immigrants are concerned, the only solution that we know of is for the Member States to be responsible for legalising their situation so as to combat all forms of crime, including that committed by traffickers and unscrupulous employers.
Mr President, while stating that our Group is fully in agreement with the Evans report, I should, however, like to highlight two aspects. First, the procedure for examining refugee applications needs to be speeded up.
Member States should be aware that many of their problems, but especially many of the immigrant refugees' problems, would be overcome if these applications were dealt with quickly.
A great many refugees - a great many people who have every right to be recognised as such - wait for months or years without receiving aid, deprived of work, gradually sliding towards illegality and often sucked into areas of organised and other crime.
It is therefore necessary to shorten these excessively long time periods.
Secondly, it is important to understand and establish the fact that the notion of a 'safe country' is one that may be overturned by specific evidence of the treatment an individual receives in his or her country.
I mean that the notion of a safe country must be a relative assumption, because many refugees flee from a safe country because they are personally persecuted.
This notion must not, therefore, be an absolute notion, but the conditions to which the individual refugees have been subjected - in other words, the conditions that have led them to flee to another country - should be examined on a case-by-case basis, and they may lead to the above-mentioned notion of a safe third country being overturned.
Mr President, I should particularly like to thank Mr Pirker for the work he has done.
Now more than ever, as the rapporteur has stressed, it is essential to reformulate Community immigration policy: not just aseptic rules allowing or forbidding entry, but a broader and more responsible approach based above all on economic and demographic assessments and evaluations of social and cultural integration.
We therefore need to lay down a strategy for a sustainable immigration policy in which national and local institutions can play a major part in using objective criteria to identify occupational needs and the availability of jobs, accommodation, social services and training for all those who ask to come and live and work in our Member States.
Setting limits and strict rules means ensuring they get the best possible welcome and are fully integrated, with mutual respect and benefits for both European citizens and the immigrants. It means avoiding painful social conflict, and it also means being tough on illegal immigration, which all too often is associated with crime and exploitation.
Above all, Europe cannot confine itself to taking a passive role and attitude towards immigration as if it were just a traffic policeman directing traffic.
Europe must act with greater political awareness so that it can also interpret fully the strong motivations underlying these phenomena.
Very often, or almost always, people from third countries come to Europe out of desperation, poverty, hunger or marginalisation.
Their desperation is such that there are mothers who leave their own children and come to our countries in order to earn something for them.
For this very reason, and also because of its geographical situation, Europe cannot play a merely bureaucratic role, encouraging or limiting immigration.
Europe must choose to play a strong, responsible, political role, aware that behind the policy choices to be made regarding immigration there lies the possibility of also being a player in the serious international crisis we are going through.
We must be aware that it is only by making greater efforts through Third World development programmes and by preventing the so-called brain drain that we can implement the best peace policy of all, which is the fight against poverty and injustice.
In conclusion, Mr President, we must be aware that well regulated immigration can bring great benefits to the European Union, to the immigrants themselves and to their countries of origin.
But we must be wary of the demagogy of those who propose too permissive an immigration policy, a policy that would encourage Europe to open its borders indiscriminately, reduce controls and extend the right to asylum to an absurd degree, but then to selfishly close our eyes - as we have been doing for years - towards what is happening in the Middle East and the southern countries, as if it had nothing at all to do with us.
September 11 showed that what happens in those parts of the world affects us closely, and so we should really be convinced, with a little consistency...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, seeing as there is no rule guaranteeing to the inhabitants of one country the right to enter another if the second country is opposed to this, I would like to voice some considerations and one deep concern on the subject of immigration. This concern springs from having seen communities, and individuals belonging to communities of immigrants, celebrating after the tragic attacks in the United States, and from the knowledge that terrorist cells have been sheltered and supported by certain communities on ethnic and religious grounds.
At this point, with the greatest respect for the majority of immigrants who are respectable and honest, I feel that it would be appropriate, in future, to adopt more stringent criteria when assessing immigrants, based on the precautionary principle, in order to avoid even just the potential risks which some immigrants could introduce into our Europe.
With regard to Europe, in Italy, we are preparing a fairer, more severe, more appropriate law on immigration.
We need to prevent European legislation conflicting with our national laws because we do not want left-wing permissiveness, which was rejected by the Italian electorate, to penetrate our legislation via Brussels.
In Denmark, it has recently become public knowledge that Danish authorities have provided residence permits to outright war criminals, in particular the General responsible for the massacres of the Kurds under Saddam Hussein in 1988.
This is, of course, scandalous, as the Danish right wing also acknowledges, but ought not the right wing to be content with the fact that the Danish NATO government has obtained military and political benefits from giving shelter to a war criminal?
Ought not Saddam' s General to have earned his fare home long ago?
Naturally, he has been debriefed by the CIA.
That goes without saying. Very discreetly, of course, just as more and more crucial aspects of political life take place in ever more hermetically sealed rooms.
This baroque situation reflects one of the ambivalent features of Mr Evans' s report, which is otherwise full of engaging features.
The report endorses and further develops the finest legal principles we know.
The Evans report centres upon persecuted human beings in a way that Mr Pirker' s, which is of course an expression of undisguised worker imperialism, does not.
This is appealing and necessary.
The problem is that these sound principles are part of political and legal contexts which will in practice reduce them to ideological window dressing.
The common asylum and immigration policy is being used first and foremost as an engine for homogenising countries' extremely different legal traditions by creating an area of freedom, security and justice that is the crucial link in the European superstate.
The loser in this disagreeable game is democracy, and the benefit for refugees is doubtful unless one is a general in Saddam Hussein' s army.
Mr President, the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy is extremely disappointing.
I am talking about the written communication, because both the oral statement which Commissioner Vitorino has just made and that given by the Council were very interesting and much more balanced than what we are accustomed to hearing in this House, and they give us hope that there will be a change in policy following the attacks of 11 September.
The written communication in any case is marked by a certain lack of a sense of what is really happening on the ground, the same shortcoming which is responsible for discussions in the Council on the proposals on family reunification being at a standstill today, a fate which may well be reserved in the future for the proposals on asylum which I have criticised, in particular during our last part-session.
The written communication focuses on legal immigration, but - apart from a few allusions - it minimises or forgets illegal immigration and the essential fact that today one in every two people emigrating to the industrialised world does so illegally.
Of course, I am aware that papers have already been tabled on illegal immigration, in particular on trafficking in human beings and on the liability of hauliers, but these are specific texts, tabled, moreover, for the most part by Member States by virtue of their right of initiative, which they still have for the time being.
These texts do not show any evidence of an overall grasp of the problem; they are not equal to the challenge.
The Commission has just announced that it is going to table further papers following the attacks of 11 September.
So much the better.
In the meantime, however, if anyone wants to read a good document which clearly sets out the real problems associated with immigration and their possible solutions, they have to refer not to the Commission communication which is being examined today, but to the strategy paper on asylum and immigration, the amended version of which was tabled by the Austrian Presidency on 19 November 1998 - yes, I did say 1998.
I would invite listeners of good faith to compare the two texts; they will be staggered by the differences in approach.
For example, reading from the Austrian document: Generally speaking, it is no longer only issues related to asylum and the problems of temporary protection but also, and especially, general migration issues, the problems posed by the fight against illegal immigration networks and issues related to expulsion which are at the heart of the political debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ought to read it to you in full, but time does not allow and this sentence on its own shows what the real priorities are.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, taking as a starting point the reports by my esteemed fellow Members Mr Evans and Mr Pirker, I would like to talk about the communication from Commissioner Vitorino which is at the heart of this. He is a colleague whom we hold in extraordinarily high regard on the basis of our joint work in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and whose opinion I have very little in common with!
A fundamental debate is taking place about asylum and immigration in Europe.
It is about guidelines for asylum and immigration in Europe.
We need to be clear about two things: first about the quotas to be applied and secondly about the content.
As far as the methodology is concerned, European directives on asylum and immigration can only set minimum standards.
It is only possible to oblige the European Union as a whole to accept minimum standards.
Anything going beyond that will not be accepted.
One example of this is that Commissioner Vitorino's proposals on family reunification may suit some people, but it is not possible to stipulate a binding solution for the entire Union.
Some revision is needed here.
As regards content, we need to limit and control immigration.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned the concept of 'fortress Europe' .
It is precisely because we do not want to erect a fortress Europe and could not do so anyway that we must control and limit immigration.
The approach proposed by Commissioner Vitorino does not meet these requirements.
A couple more examples: by adopting the concept of the safe third country, we in Germany have been able to reduce the number of asylum-seekers from some 450 000 to well under 100 000.
Commissioner Vitorino has virtually given up this concept, by making its use dependent on conditions which make it almost impossible to apply in practice.
My second point is that binding material grounds for granting asylum are laid down in the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
It would be giving asylum-seekers an incentive if we go beyond the binding framework of the Geneva Convention, as in the case of persecution by non-State agents for example.
There are some very worthy individual arguments in favour of this, but we cannot allow a higher level of asylum than at present.
The problem of asylum is with the procedure.
It is still a fact that 90% of all asylum-seekers in Europe are not victims of political persecution.
So we need to get the procedure under control.
If we can manage to bring the procedure to a rapid conclusion, we can be more generous when it comes to grounds for the granting of asylum.
However, this does not sit well with the three-stage asylum procedure that Commissioner Vitorino is proposing, for example.
Commissioner Vitorino, if Mr Schily, the German Minister for the Interior, who as you know does not belong to the same party as I do, behaves in the same way in Council as he does in Germany then your proposals have no hope at all!
Mr President, notwithstanding the events of 11 September, the Commission communication on asylum basically remains not only appropriate but more necessary than ever.
The Evans report, for its part, is no less topical or relevant.
This is not the time to step back and it is, therefore, crucial to work towards a solution common to all the Member States with regard to the criteria for assessing requests and to cooperation between national administrative systems.
I can see that we will have to confront certain challenges in order to come up with effective regulations.
This effort must not only involve the European dimension, however, but also cooperation with third countries, specifically with the asylum seekers' countries of origin.
In order to avoid the 'Kafakaesque' situations often described in the European press, it is crucial that we adopt - and we are not asking for much - minimum standards that will ensure faster and simpler procedures for granting asylum so as to prevent the demoralisation and uncertainty that beset asylum seekers.
The creation of a space of freedom, security and justice will inevitably involve the need for the mutual recognition of judgments.
In order to reach this stage, however, we must first of all harmonise asylum procedures.
Mr President, this communication, for which Commissioner AntÃ³nio Vitorino is responsible, is making a timely appearance on the agenda.
On the basis of the framework defined in Tampere, we are committed to create a common policy in the field of asylum, which I am sure will have the support of the Council and of Parliament.
Through a joint effort by the Community institutions and civil society we will achieve a platform of understanding, so that by 1 May 2004 the objective outlined by the European Council will be complied with.
Mr President, we have a historical responsibility to take this decision and there is no time for hesitation.
I wish you the best of luck, Commissioner.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the immigration policy that the European Commission has presented to this Parliament.
The proposal to agree common admission conditions for migrants and to set up, in addition and alongside this, a policy instrument whereby Member States indicate target figures for work migration, receives the support of the ELDR Group.
My group would like to make a few observations with regard to the proposed system.
Firstly, we reject the policy of zero immigration, but we also reject the policy of completely open borders.
A responsible compromise must be struck.
Secondly, the immigration system must be flexible.
Quotas should not be forced upon the Member States from above.
Thirdly, we must take account of subsidiarity, that is to say regional and national differences with regard to the labour market.
Fourthly, a common immigration policy must also be accompanied by a common fight against illegal immigration.
Fifthly, we must strike the right balance between the need for work forces in industry on the one hand and the unemployed within the European Union on the other.
In summary, the ELDR Group calls for a balanced European immigration policy.
The Pirker report, for which I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, is on the same wavelength.
Mr President, these will be my last words in this House since I have now been appointed member of the Council of State in the Netherlands.
I would like to thank the fellow MEPs for their kind cooperation and wish them all every success.
The European Parliament is a very important institution, which I will always continue to support.
Mr Wiebenga, we wish you all the best, and I am sure that the State will be in good hands if you are a member of the Council of State!
Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask you to stick strictly to your speaking time, as we are dreadfully behind schedule!
Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to Commissioner Vitorino, because I believe that it is thanks to his tireless work that today we are able to draw a clear distinction between asylum-seekers and immigration, and this is to be welcomed.
I would also thank the representative of the Belgian Presidency, who has just definitively abandoned the idea of a fortress Europe, which it is neither feasible nor desirable to achieve.
Finally, I should like to thank our colleague, Mr Evans, for his painstaking work.
I believe that it is by applying clear, fair and precise standards that we will not only ensure that refugees are protected but also fight to release them from the grasp of criminal organisations.
In my opinion, Mr Evans's painstaking work is in stark contrast to the partisan vision presented by Mr Pirker.
Mr Pirker poses some complex questions, but the answers are inadequate and even dangerous.
This internal report by Mr Pirker, comprising reflection, analysis and proposals, is one of the weakest which we have had to discuss in this Parliament.
Firstly, it contains a series of commonplaces.
After a time, it says, immigrants adopt the birth-rate pattern of the host country.
As I see it, this is a sign of integration and proof that attitudes change.
Instead of being delighted about this, however, Mr Pirker expresses concern about the fact that the destiny of women from the third world, female immigrants who have come from the South, is not confined to having children.
He also recommends a policy to recruit a set number of workers which, he says, is supported by the Member States as a way of reducing the labour shortage in certain sectors.
For him, immigrants are like Kleenex: you use them and when you no longer need them you throw them away.
This is a vision of the human being, more particularly black and African, or dark-skinned, human beings who come from the South, which I do not share.
Mr Pirker's report deplores family reunification.
Mr Pirker's report does, I believe, in many respects, stand in total contradiction to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice.
Faced with an issue of this complexity, instead of saying that the tragedy in Dover opened our eyes to the possible consequences of immigration, we would have preferred him to consider taking measures against the hauliers who are the real proponents of modern slavery and against the slum landlords ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events in New York have, it seems to me, made us free to discuss certain subjects which have, until now, been taboo.
Those who claimed to forbid any value judgments on civilisations are suddenly waging war on Islam.
Others, who rejected any criticism of immigration, are suddenly seeing a potential terrorist in every foreigner.
I can tell you straight away that this is not the position of the group of right-wing Europeans.
Immigration is a phenomenon on a scale such that it cannot be seen on the same level as acts of terrorism, on which immigrants do not in any case have a monopoly.
It is not the immigrants who are guilty, it is those who bring them here for economic reasons, and it may perhaps surprise you to learn that, on this point, I agree in part with what our colleague, Mr Sylla, has just said.
It is also those who let themselves sink into a policy of fait accompli, and Mr Pirker' s recitals - I am thinking of recitals M and N - alas give us an example of this, alongside making some positive points.
I note in particular, for example, that Paragraph 13 of the report, "takes the view that the various historical, economic and social features in the individual Member States make it impossible to lay down a uniform requirement in labour from third countries which would cover the entire territory of the Union and that, furthermore, the Union has no powers in law in this field."
So, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why are conclusions not drawn from this Paragraph 13?
And why not restore sovereignty to the Member States in this regard and with it the legitimate right to protect our borders? After all, the dramatic events which we have witnessed have quite clearly shown that protecting borders was key to security, because this is what the government of the United States immediately did when it found itself in an emergency situation.
Finally, I will close by saying that immigration should not be seen as a solution to the falling population which we are seeing in Europe.
If the people of Europe abandon to others their duty to give life to new generations, they also abandon their right to live as free nations on the territory of their ancestors.
We do not accept this.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, I would like to do something that I rarely do for reasons of time, and congratulate Mr Pirker on his well balanced report, although I believe that he is at present not in the Chamber.
Social integration of economic migrants in the Member States is, as he stressed, absolutely essential if we are to avoid social tensions.
And a greater degree of contact between immigrants and the indigenous population will perhaps also help us to recognise 'sleepers' and so help to fight terrorism.
I also believe that in view of all the measures proposed it is important to give the Member States the option of fine-tuning the entry and residence of third country nationals in accordance with the requirements of their own labour markets and demographic trends, because these questions in particular can only be dealt with at local level.
It will also be important to take into account the imminent enlargement of the EU when planning immigration policy.
The rapporteur took all this into consideration.
I wish his report every success, and we will certainly be supporting it.
Mr President, for the first time ever in this Parliament we are talking about economic migration and asylum in distinct and separate terms, which could be considered to be a wise move by the European Commission in its respective communications for it will help us to give the debate a sense of order and clarity.
This was one of Parliament' s requests that has now become reality.
I would like to briefly share two thoughts with you on the issues that are the subject of this debate: firstly, that the migratory movements toward Europe we are now seeing correspond to a mass exodus of citizens who, in their own countries, do not enjoy the minimum conditions necessary for survival and who are being tragically exploited by the organised mafias who traffic in them.
This has already been discussed here in Parliament.
The cases in Dover and on our own Andalusian coast are clear examples of this.
However, illegal immigration of this nature is fertile ground for the social exclusion of this immigrant population and for the exploitation of their labour, in addition to the outbreaks of xenophobia and racism that are taking place in certain parts of Europe.
This problem can only be resolved by close cooperation and collaboration with the countries of origin, otherwise, any policy in this field will be condemned to failure.
Community programmes such as PHARE, TACIS, MEDA, or the immigration and asylum action plans themselves are absolutely necessary.
Yet at the same time, and I would like to put particular emphasis on this point, it must also be stressed, from a political angle in particular, that the countries of origin should make the most of their natural and human resources and, most of all, guarantee political and social stability so that their citizens can have confidence in their own leaders.
This is, therefore, an issue of shared responsibility and not only the responsibility of the Member States or of the European Union itself.
Countries such as Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia are an example of what I have just been referring to.
On the other hand, with regard to the communication on the common asylum procedure, the main problem with which Member States are confronted is that of asylum seekers whose claims are unfounded. The Commission and this Parliament should, therefore, make a great effort to remove the major obstacles blocking the standardisation of solutions between Member States.
On this subject, it does not seem to be the right occasion to talk about a common procedure, distinct from the mandate contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam that refers to a common asylum procedure.
It is not the same.
Furthermore, both the communication and the Evans report fail to define concepts such as persecution by third parties, persecution in cases of conflict or gender related persecution, for example, given that the difficulty sometimes lies more in the definition of the concept of the refugee than in the process of identifying it.
To be precise, we are on the right track: faced with a phenomenon such as asylum and immigration, a concern for many of us, cooperation, solidarity, clear legislation and realism are the necessary prerequisites for addressing one of the major challenges for the European Union in this new century.
Mr President, at a time when we have all, I hope, been scandalised by Mr Berlusconi' s statements, demonstrating as they do such suspicion and hatred of foreigners, I believe that now, more than ever, it is time to combat racism, and to combat it in all its most insidious forms.
The Commission' s communication on a Community immigration policy, and the vote on the Pirker report, give us an opportunity to do just that.
In that respect I welcome Mr Vitorino's statements.
We must not forget that for Europeans the Tampere Summit in October 1999, which sought fair treatment for nationals of third countries in comparison with citizens of the Union, was a very important event.
We must start from one important established fact, which we were reminded of just now: the myth of zero immigration can no longer be a realistic concept, and in any case demographic problems and labour shortages will have to make us change our ideas about immigration.
This is why, today, we must give our strong support to the Commission' s communication, because this future Community policy on immigration has a great many virtues, in particular that of combating all forms of criminal activity.
It has to be said that the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, has adopted a rather critical position regarding the Commission' s communication.
Unlike Mr Pirker, we socialists are convinced that our approach to this question must be a humane approach rather than an economic approach, because we are talking here about the fate of human beings, not about common merchandise.
We must also remember, and we can never remember it enough, that if people emigrate and suffer the pain of separation from their country and their loved ones, it is because they are obliged to do so. They are not simply doing it for pleasure.
The Commission' s position is fundamental inasmuch as it proposes a framework.
I shall end by saying, in addition, that in a European Union which is constantly becoming more integrated, and which now has the benefit of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, no Member State can now claim that its policy on admission is nobody' s business but its own.
I therefore reiterate my full and wholehearted support for the Commission' s proposal, at the same time taking a critical view of the content of Mr Pirker' s report.
As far as I am concerned, I defer the vote of the French socialist delegation on this report.
Mr President, I wish to discuss Paragraph 15 of Mr Pirker' s report which says, among other things, that immigrants are expected to respect the community of values - as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - and to show a willingness to integrate.
How is this to be interpreted?
A wave of Islamophobia is passing over Europe at present.
In several EU countries, Muslims have been persecuted.
The most rancorous debate I have been able to follow is taking place right now in Denmark.
Quite a few politicians have made astounding statements.
Mr Camre, a Member of this House, has said that all the countries of the Western world are being infiltrated by Muslims and that, while some of them are friendly enough with us, many of them are in favour of getting rid of us - in Danish, fÃ¥ os fjernet - that is to say, removing us.
That is a prejudiced and irresponsible statement.
My concern, as I address this House, is that the wording of Paragraph 15 might be in danger of creating further scope for this type of inflammatory statement.
Is Europe not in danger of losing its diversity?
Are we not in danger of tampering with freedom of religion and freedom of expression?
Could not Paragraph 15 be understood as saying, 'Adapt, full stop. Otherwise, gather your belongings together and go!'
I wonder if Mr Camre might respond to this.
Mr President, I want to begin by fully endorsing both Mr Olle Schmid' s description of the political situation in Denmark and the request with which he concluded.
I also want to say that I think there are an incredibly large number of good things in the Commission' s proposals in this area.
It would of course be marvellous if we were to use our cooperation to strengthen the principles we talk so much about - democracy and human rights and, I might add, humanitarianism - instead of dragging each other down to the lowest common denominator.
I think there are quite a lot of good things in Mr Evans' s report. I intend to support it and shall call for a vote in favour of it.
I think, however, that there are still a lot of problems with Mr Pirker' s report. It was improved quite considerably by the committee' s reading of it.
It is also, of course, reasonable to hope that it will be further improved in the course of today when we vote on it.
However, a lot more is required before I shall support the report, which is based principally upon the EU' s wanting to show solidarity with itself.
Mr President, Mr Evans has put a great deal of thought into his report.
Quite rightly, he raises the issue of the safe-country concept being based on human rights considerations, not on diplomatic links.
He underlines the lack of common approach between the Member States with regard to the concept of safe countries.
This is no longer acceptable.
Mr Evans concludes that the concept of safe countries needs to be defined unequivocally.
Although I agree with his motivation, we must admit that this approach is not a safe one.
I recall that our colleague, Mr Pasqua, as France's French Minister of the Interior, once said that 'La dÃ©mocratie s'arrÃªte lÃ  oÃ¹ commence la raison d'Etat.'
Mr Evans: as long as la raison d'Etat exists, there is no safe country.
Mr President, I am really sorry about this, because the debate is an interesting one which I believe demonstrates not only the complexity of the issue, but also its political dimension.
It would be unreasonable to think that it is merely a question of settling technical problems in the context of a generalised consensus, and I believe that these difficulties also demonstrate the urgent need to reach a consensus, at European level, on a certain number of essential measures.
First of all I think that it would be unreasonable and irresponsible to deny the extent of clandestine immigration and the fact that it is getting worse.
I believe that that would be unreasonable and politically tactless.
It is therefore very important, in addition to having measures of a regulatory nature, to develop an active policy of combating trafficking in human beings, because such trafficking constitutes, above all, the exploitation of a great deal of misery, poverty and fear, by organisations which are highly efficient and who not only traffic in human beings but also engage in other criminal activities.
For this reason, policing measures, and in particular the intensifying of border checks, are essential if we are to remain one step ahead and ensure that our future external borders will be protected.
I would remind you that the largest police operation that has ever been undertaken in Europe is now underway, on our future external borders.
Thirty countries are involved, from Finland to the Mediterranean.
I am sure I do not need to tell the European Parliament that, to us, asylum is a sacred concept, that it constitutes the dignity of Europe, and that is why, throughout the world, Europe still acts as a beacon and an example.
We cannot preach in favour of democracy and liberty if we do not set an example ourselves.
However, at the same time we cannot ignore the fact that this important value is being abused by a considerable number of people, who probably have, in human terms, legitimate reasons for doing so, but who do it to the detriment of those who are fleeing real persecution.
It is therefore a matter of urgency that we should first of all agree on the conditions for receiving would-be refugees into our territory, and not add still further to the attractive prospect which our prosperous and - though we tend to forget it - happy countries pose to those who know only wretchedness and poverty.
We must therefore agree quickly on the rules for allowing people to come in, if we want to avoid the phenomenon of asylum shopping.
Asylum is, of course, a right, but is it necessary, in order to have legal guarantees, that things should be complicated, thereby allowing procedures to be dilatory and resulting in a situation in which, in some countries, even after four, five or six years no one has proved capable of taking a decision, so that it is necessary to take measures to regularise the situation?
Respect for the law is not incompatible with rapid and effective procedures.
These were the questions we raised at the last Council, and I was pleased to find that, among the Fifteen, there was a very broad consensus on the need to reach a consensus on this issue.
Finally, of course, we must define a certain number of rules at European level. I was going to say minimum rules, but I shall not do so because to some people that would mean 'no improvement' .
What I am trying to say is essential rules which do not necessarily go into matters in detail but which translate into practical terms the fundamental political consensus that there has to be on this subject if we are ever to succeed in overcoming this problem.
We need to do this quickly, and that is why I said that we must, at the Laeken Summit, try to re-launch the European dynamic, because otherwise the outcome would be negative and not a true reflection of our opinions.
We must also decide how much solidarity has to be agreed on at European level because the mere fact that one country happens to be situated at an external border should not mean that that country should necessarily have to bear the whole burden of any measures that are agreed on.
It is true that immigration is another problem, but it is also true that we cannot claim that if we had a more or less unrestricted immigration system all our problems would be solved; nowhere in the world is there any example of such a policy being implemented, and even where the system is the most liberal, it is still not possible to solve all the problems, especially those that are still linked to illegal immigration.
It is therefore necessary to ask a certain number of pertinent questions, and this is what we shall be doing at the conference which will be taking place in a few days' time in Brussels. How is Europe' s population going to develop?
Do we still have any requirements at economic level and if so, of what kind?
Will the situation be the same everywhere?
Does immigration have to be subject to conditions?
Is it to be permanent or for a limited period?
Should we demand a certain number of qualifications, risking savage consequences for the countries of origin, which often have a need for precisely those qualifications?
Would there not be the risk of an increase in the number of unemployed people, at least in the long run, which would only make budgeting more difficult?
If we want to find successful solutions to all these questions, we must have the courage to ask them clearly and to come up with some serious answers, and I hope that that is what will happen at our conference.
Finally, I must tell you that the Belgian Presidency - we may be a small country but we are, I think, a realistic one - would like to draft proposals that bear the stamp of realism, because we believe that such realism is the only thing that will enable us to make the progress that is so essential.
If we get lost in ideological or technical considerations, we shall still be debating the question fifteen years hence and we shall still not have made any significant progress.
However, there is an enormous risk, because the people of Europe are waiting for some answers. They have confidence in Europe.
They believe that this is a useful, perhaps even essential, dimension in the solving of such problems.
If we do not succeed in finding answers for our people, I fear that there is a dangerous risk that they will take matters into their own hands, and I am also afraid - and I hope that we in this House share this feeling, at least most of us if not all - that Europe may not be able to remain a Europe of rights and freedoms, a Europe that is welcoming and open, and also, because this is what our fellow citizens are concerned about, a Europe that is prudent and takes precautions, and a Europe that expects all those who find themselves in its territory to respect the rule of law.
Mr President, I am aware that the subject before us is extremely sensitive, particularly at this moment in history.
We have been working - and I refer to this legislature, of course - over the past two years to establish positive relations between citizens and immigrants, to make equal opportunities possible and to create a form of social cohesion.
Now, everyone can see the need to revise certain parts of the agenda we have been working on and, in particular, to identify how the revision of these points can be converted into positive Community legislation allowing us to grow into the kind of Europe we all want.
I would now like to make three points.
Firstly, we need to focus more on defining framework legislation to promote actions at regional and local levels, always in agreement with the Member States, in situations where an initiative is certainly needed to make it easier to balance the three factors which have always been the basis for our analyses of the issue of immigration and asylum. These factors are migration flows, which must be regulated and continuously monitored, integration, and the fight against illegal immigration which is often, sadly, a source of the more major concerns of crime and the exploitation of human beings.
Secondly, we need a thorough debate at European level on the issues which we consider to be vital for our policies such as cooperation between police forces, judicial cooperation, common forms of control and common information systems.
We must make it quite clear what financial resources we should consider adequate and quantifiable in these areas.
Thirdly, we may well have disregarded or underestimated the importance of one of our tasks.
We must insist on the need for the major educational programmes which are the foundations of our culture, and of multiculturalism, in particular: there must be schooling and education starting with foreign children, especially, irrespective of their legal position.
These programmes are fundamental for the policies of integrating and building the societies we want.
In my opinion, we must establish a substantial educational and cultural programme, a major part of which promotes communication between cultures, for that would be the first step along a path which will certainly bring about the sort of integration we desire.
Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Vitorino.
Commissioner, you have listened seriously to the demands made by many experts on migration and NGOs and have made it clear in two communications how policy on refugees and traditional migrants is to be handled.
With your communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status valid throughout the Union for persons granted asylum you have brought forward some excellent proposals for harmonising asylum policy.
Your proposals will now help us to find some concrete solutions.
The rapporteur, Mr Evans, has made a fine job of this.
I regard the additions he proposes as enhancing the current debate on concrete directives.
You have also succeeded, Commissioner, with your communication on a Community migration policy, in making it clear how important it is that future migration in the European Union should be jointly controlled and regulated throughout the Union.
