This is not empty rhetoric: I am expressing my awareness of the responsibility we bear in saying 'yes' or 'no' in this matter.
We are gradually restoring Europe's integrity and unity, reintegrating and reunifying its culture, traditions, peoples and children.
We have not yet completed this major building project.
Yesterday, we received a visit from the President of the Republic of Macedonia, and our thoughts are already turning to the Balkans, to that region in which we helped to achieve peace and which is starting to establish democracy, the rule of law, the welfare state, an economic fabric and international relations. Then Moldova and Ukraine are potential candidates, assuming that Bulgaria and Romania will join the Union in four years' time.
The process will require more work where Turkey is concerned, for Turkey's idea of society will have to be brought into line with ours.
Lastly, we cannot fail to consider Russia, with which the European Union will have to have an increasingly close, organic relationship.
All the seeds we are sowing will take root if the Community method prevails.
The European Union will only survive and develop if, I reiterate, the Community method prevails in the Convention.
The most recent position adopted by the Budget Council is evidence of a completely opposite trend and is to be deplored.
If the egotism of the Member States leads to the intergovernmental method prevailing, Europe will suffer a heart attack, a setback, but history will continue regardless.
I therefore call upon the ten new Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder with Parliament in advocating a different line from that taken by the governments of the current Member countries, which have a pessimistic view of the Union.
Dear people of Slovenia, dear people of the other nine acceding countries, help us to build new European institutions in which we can all be equal and develop with full respect for the dignity of the individual.
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few moments, we shall vote on the ten Accession Treaties of the new Member States of the Union.
This is a huge step, and I am happy to be experiencing this moment, which is an extension of the long accession process to the European institutions that began 12 years ago, when Hungary was the first post-communist country to join the Council of Europe.
Like many other Members, however, I feel a kind of vertigo on the verge of taking this decisive step, particularly because the state of the Union itself is far from satisfactory.
Personally, in the name of the deep friendship that I feel for each candidate country, I also want to tell them that we are aware that we still have a long way to go and a great deal of effort to make before we understand each other fully.
It is true that the Copenhagen criteria have been met and I would congratulate them on accomplishing this.
The economic and democratic criteria, however, while necessary, are not enough.
We do not really know each other yet.
We do not yet view the world in the same way. We do not yet have the same vision of our security, our international relations, our foreign policy - in short, we still need to fill the gaps in our hearts and minds that have been created over fifty years of separation.
All in all, we should be optimistic today.
A new door is opening to allow a large family reunion with members coming home from far and wide.
Mr President, the June Movement wants to allow the candidate countries to decide for themselves whether they wish to be part of the EU.
We are therefore voting in favour of enlargement today, but we would recommend that the conditions be renegotiated.
The agricultural agreement would make the new countries desperately dependent and make it difficult to abolish what amount to lunatic arrangements where agriculture is concerned.
The agreement would force the candidate countries to sell agricultural land and summer houses, even though the price of land in the Netherlands is 30 times what it is in Poland.
The new countries would have to pay the full quota, while my own country, rich though it is, was given an 80% rebate in the first year.
The majority of inhabitants of the poor countries would become net contributors, even though they are the people whom we are supposed to help.
The Treaty of Nice and the EU regulations have not been published in the languages of the candidate countries.
It is a democratic scandal that the candidate countries are in no position to know what they are voting on and that the Commission devises propaganda instead of making factual information available.
Those of us in the rich countries should be more generous towards our poor neighbours so that they might have something to thank us for and so that I might not just vote in favour but do so with gratitude while welcoming a Europe of democracies.
Mr President, we stand today at the brink of an historic process as we vote to finally reunite in democracy, peace and prosperity our divided continent of Europe, with the accession of ten new members.
The EU will now have a GDP of over USD 10 trillion.
As my group's shadow rapporteur on Slovakia it gives me particular pleasure to support its candidature.
This small but proudly independent new country has made huge progress, since the Velvet Divorce ten years ago, in modernising its economy from a command one to a functioning market.
It has reformed its system of government and civic infrastructure and sensibly accommodated its problems with its Roma and Hungarian minorities.
It has confounded the pundits who said it would never survive without the Czech Republic, and today I proudly salute their combined cooperation with the Allies in Kuwait, where they are providing chemical warfare decontamination expertise.
I deplore the actions of those in this House who voted against certain candidate countries joining the EU because of their assistance in the war effort.
Instead they should remember the free Czechs and Poles who helped my country free the continent of Europe from another similar tyranny sixty years ago.
Slovakia will become an EU frontier country, and it must not be forgotten that there are Slovak minorities still living across the border in Ukraine with whom Slovaks share common historic links, since that territory was part of Czechoslovakia until 1945, just as other large parts of Western Ukraine were historically part of Austria-Hungary, Poland and Romania.
We must ensure that this factor is not overlooked in the Commission's new framework document for relations with our new European neighbours of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, which have a legitimate right to join the Union in future if they so wish.
Lastly, as a British Conservative, I welcome in particular Malta and Cyprus, two Commonwealth countries whose historically rich and entrepreneurial cultures will provide a new and valued contribution to the Union.
Mr President, as a pan-European, I have had the good fortune to have been able to work towards this day since the 1970s and to assist Otto von Habsburg in ensuring that an empty chair was placed here in 1979 in protest against the exclusion of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe from the European Communities and as a signal for the process of reunification, the final stage of which we are initiating today.
I had the good fortune not only to help prepare the pan-European picnic which was mentioned a few moments ago but also to play a part in the democratic revolutions in almost all of the applicant countries and in the declarations of Estonian and Slovenian independence.
For this reason, let me state quite clearly that if we - a whole group of fellow Members and myself - deliver a critical vote on the SchrÃ¶der report today, we are neither rejecting enlargement nor spurning the Czech people but are protesting, as people protested at the time, against injustice, against an injustice that still persists, against a serious infringement of human rights and its perpetuation through the continuing discriminatory effects of unjust decrees.
For this reason, my friends, we say categorically that the European Union must continue to aspire to a common system of law.
As a community rooted in the rule of law, we must ensure that unjust decrees are not brought into our legal system in the same way that viruses are introduced into computer systems.
The virus endangers the entire system, which is why we, together with the countries that are about to accede to the Union, must fight in the period following today's complex vote and after the accession of the new Member States to identify injustices where they still exist and to ensure that crime is recognised as crime and injustice as injustice. At the same time, we must cooperate in a spirit of partnership to create a Europe, a pan-European entity, that is built on the foundations of justice, peace and freedom.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the stands which have been taken are the best possible expression of the historic importance of this moment, which is why I do not think there is any need for me to add a single word to what everyone has said about enlargement and how important it is.
I asked for the floor merely in order to reply to Mr Crespo's proposal that the presidency should consider making a statement on the role of the UN and humanitarian aid in Iraq on 16 April.
I should like to thank Mr Crespo for this very interesting proposal and to say that we have already taken the initiative of inviting the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, on 17 April, when 40 Heads of State and 40 ministers for foreign affairs will be attending the European summit in Athens, precisely so that we can discuss the question of the United Nations and humanitarian aid and make the best possible use of this major meeting.
I hope that Mr Annan has already accepted this invitation.
We are in the process of finalising the arrangements for the meeting.
I hope that it will indeed manage to get these political messages across.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it only remains for me to offer my sincere thanks to everyone who has participated in this debate for the clear and convincing welcoming signal they have given to our new members.
I believe we have done enough talking now.
The time has come for action.
Allow me one last attempt to appeal to those honourable Members who still harbour doubts by putting this one point to them: in thirty years' time, no one will remember what Parliament and the Council have been arguing about during the last two weeks.
I also believe, Mr Posselt, that no one will be talking about the Bene? decrees thirty years from now.
But in thirty years' time the decision taken here today will still be remembered.
(Loud sustained applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
In principle, we support the enlargement of the European Union, provided that this is the wish of the peoples of the applicant countries.
We cannot, however, allow Portugal's interests to be called into question.
In the current context of enlargement, two negative aspects of the negotiations must be highlighted: the discriminatory way in which the applicant countries are treated, particularly in the areas of finance and agriculture, and the consequences of enlargement for Portugal.
Although we welcome the increase of around EUR 500 million, achieved as a result of the pressure exerted by the European Parliament, this sum is clearly inadequate for taking us towards economic and social cohesion.
We therefore have the medium-term prospect of reductions in the Structural Funds and in farm aid for Portugal, when all known studies state that whereas Germany will gain the most, our country will lose the most, given our remoteness and given the greater competition we now face from countries which offer lower salaries and a more highly-skilled workforce.
The most recent data produced by the Commission clearly show that, of all countries, Portugal has the weakest production structure and the most serious socio-economic shortcomings, which means that it could suffer very damaging consequences unless due care is taken to protect its interests in accession negotiations.
This is why we have abstained overall and have voted in favour in the particular case of Cyprus.
At this historic moment, it falls to the European Parliament to be the first of the European institutions to approve the accession of ten new Member States.
The euphoria of this momentous decision, however, must not cause us to lose sight of the current state of EU policies and of the challenges that lie ahead.
Many of the reforms on which the survival of the Union is believed to depend, such as the reform of the institutions, the Structural Funds and the common foreign and agricultural policies, have still not been enacted, financial commitments have not been made to the acceding countries, and the quest for deeper European unity is faltering.
For years the Greens have been campaigning for enlargement and consolidation of the EU.
We want to see the powers of the Union increased in the realms of environmental policy, social policy, foreign policy, etc.
The Iraq conflict, however, has cruelly exposed the discord that exists within the EU.
The position adopted by representatives of the governments of some applicant countries has also been surprising.
Be that as it may, the people of those countries must not be made to suffer for the lack of political courage shown by the EU leaders or for the statements made by their own Heads of Government.
For this reason I shall be voting today in favour of the accession of ten new Member States.
The real challenge for politicians in the EU - and for civil society too - consists in rallying the necessary majorities within the Convention behind a sustainable European Union.
As far as the Iraq conflict is concerned, what applies to Spain also applies to Poland: other political solutions must be found at the next elections.
The next item is the vote.

Report (A5-0117/2003) by Reimer BÃ¶ge and Joan Colom i Naval on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on: 1. The adjustment of the Financial Perspective for Enlargement presented by the Commission in accordance with point 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on Budgetary Discipline and Improvement of the Budgetary Procedure (COM(2003) 70 - C5-0053/2003 - 2003/2025(ACI)); and 2.
The review of the Financial Perspective (COM(2003) 185 - C5-0161/2003 - 2003/2025(ACI)
Before the vote:
President.
I should like to inform the House that on behalf of the 15 Member States this morning, at a meeting of Coreper, the declaration was formally and unanimously adopted by the Council.
We are aware of the painstaking work which has been put into this over the recent weeks by our colleagues - work which would have been unnecessary if the Council, in the first instance, had not unilaterally stepped outside the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Before we proceed to the vote, as President of Parliament I want to make it clear, particularly to the Council, that we will hold it to every word and every paragraph, and to all the meanings of every word and every paragraph of this declaration.
Should it deviate from this in any way, we will then revert to our rights under the Treaty.
(Applause)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0081/2003) by Elmar Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the conclusions of the negotiations on enlargement in Copenhagen (2003/2014(INI))
Before the vote on Amendment No 19:
Mr President, we had an agreement with the rapporteur. His intention was to submit an oral amendment, whereupon we would withdraw our own amendment.
I ask that Mr Brok should be given the floor.
Mr President, I want to propose that we should adopt item 6 in the following form: '? recognises that peace and security have been crucial factors in the decision of the candidate countries to join the European Union and that special responsibilities consequently lie with the Union to strengthen transatlantic ties on the basis of European strength and equal rights.'
I can imagine that we would then be able to lay to rest the misgivings others have, and come to a common position on this.
Mr President, my delegation would like to protest at the services' ruling that Amendment 8 is inadmissible.
This amendment, which opposes Strasbourg sessions, is consistent with the Treaty obligations, enables Parliament to choose the place of its own sitting for once, and puts a stop to this travelling circus backwards and forwards between here and Brussels, which will become even more difficult post-enlargement for those countries given the poor communications by air to Strasbourg.
Finally, it will save the European taxpayer EUR 150 million a year.
(Mixed reactions)
Mr Tannock, the ruling of inadmissibility is a dispute that you have with me and not with the services.
I point out that we are voting on a calendar.
It is not the custom in this House to substitute a long text for a calendar.
You are entirely free to state your position as you wish, but this is about dates and calendars, not about texts and preferences regarding location.
(Parliament's calendar of part-sessions for 2004 was thus established)
Mr President, the consequence of this vote is that next year we will have only ten plenary part-sessions and not eleven.
(Loud applause)
May this be a signal to the European Convention.
We want to determine our own seat.
(Loud applause)
I should point out that if I interpreted the vote correctly, we have removed the session that had been proposed for the end of April and 1 May 2004.
I should also like to recall that on 1 May, the states for which we just voted shall enter the Union.
Parliament will need, as some point, to ratify the nominated commissioners.
I shall have to take this back to the Conference of Presidents because we cannot ignore our constitutional obligations as a House.
Report (A5-0086/2003) by Carmen Cerdeira Morterero, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the amended proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification (COM(2002) 225 - C5-0220/2002 - 1999/0258(CNS))
Before the vote:
Mr President, with regard to Amendment No 32, I would like to clarify that the correct version is the Spanish version, not the German version - in which there seems to be a degree of confusion in the translation - and that it refers exclusively to minors, not to other relatives of the person in question.
.
(FR) The Turco report raises the issue of control of Europol. So too do the initiatives by the Danish and Greek Governments.
The report argues for the latter to be rejected, however.
It emerges from all this that there is no democratic control of Europol. This is not at all remarkable, as there is no democratic control over any national police force.
In this respect as in many others, the European Union is a mere juxtaposition of states.
The European institutions simply replicate the lack of democratic control of state institutions.
Representatives are indeed elected, but I would challenge the House to name a Member State of the European Union in which elected institutions exercise real control over the police and the army hierarchy, or a State where the population as a whole exercises such control, which is far more important.
There have been some attempts at proposals to change the situation, but these are doomed to failure. In such circumstances, the European Parliament is reduced to manifesting its impotence.
We therefore abstained on this report.
. (PT) We have supported the rapporteur's position, recommending the rejection of the three initiatives of the previous Danish Presidency on protecting the confidentiality of Europol information, on amending the Staff Regulations applicable to Europol employees and on amending the Europol Convention.
The Danish positions would have prevented any democratic control by national parliaments, would have provided no prospect of keeping the citizens informed and would have consolidated the centralised approach to decision-making.
The rapporteur himself explained in his report that the proposals ignored all requests and proposals tabled by Parliament in the aim of genuinely increasing its democratic control and powers over Europol.
The proposals instead erred further on the side of secrecy.
Furthermore, they failed to take account of the Commission proposal to create a joint EP-national parliaments committee, or even of the opinion of Europol's Director advocating greater democratic control.
We consequently support the rejection of these initiatives, although we do not support all the alternatives proposed by the European Parliament.
. (NL) It is striking that the initiatives of the Member States' governments are often aimed at keeping information secret, at screening off their fellow countrymen from 'dignitaries', and at other phenomena that we thought had finally been consigned to the past.
Particularly after the attacks in New York on 11 September 2001, the fear of terrorism was so great that all kinds of suggestions were made which had no place in a democracy.
Fortunately, the panic has peaked, and such authoritarian initiatives are often rejected by a majority of this Parliament.
In this case, the Danish Government is suggesting limiting free access to documents and not giving Parliament the necessary say in respect of Europol's budget.
The opportunities for control by the national parliaments are also not being reinforced.
Even the director of Europol is of the opinion that democratic control is inadequate, but the Council does not want to change that.
The Council must get out of that habit.
The rejection of the Danish initiative in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was therefore the first step in the right direction.
. (PT) In an area in which there is complex tension between the efficiency of a centralised European police force, the powers of the Member States, the effective framework of the Treaties and of Community law in force, and the problems of democratic control, the solution of the rapporteurs charged with evaluating the Danish and Greek initiatives on Europol is simply to urge the European Parliament to reject these initiatives and to push the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to make a maximum overall draft recommendation.
I consider this approach to be clearly misguided and to be based on dangerous and hasty premises.
These are premises that take their inspiration solely from imposing a federalist ideological agenda on the attempts made by the Council, using the current institutional framework and the framework regulated by the Treaties, to make real progress in this area.
Furthermore, if any subject calls for the utmost prudence and cooperation between Member States, it is precisely that of the exercise, powers and monitoring of transnational police activity.
We might not like the current pillar-based structure, but, while it exists - and this is the structure that exists - this is the framework in which we must work - and work responsibly.
I have therefore rejected the rapporteur's proposal.
The best thing to do would be for Parliament to follow up the three initiatives in question, by responsibly suggesting the amendments that it has decided on, whilst complying with the legal framework...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) The observations I made in the explanation of vote on the Turco report also apply in this case.
In fact, the misguided ideological reasons underlying the issue that has been raised stand out even more clearly here.
It is quite astounding that Mr von Boetticher claims expressly in his explanatory statement, that he 'acknowledges the significance of the Danish proposal as it seems to take a step in the right direction' - only then to conclude that he must recommend rejecting it!
Why?
Because he believes it would be a mistake to adopt amendments to the Europol Convention 'prior to the ratification of the European Constitution'!
This assessment is misguided.
It is both possible and necessary to move ahead within the current framework and this is where we ought to participate responsibly and, incidentally, keeping to the method of taking small steps, since this is the method that has ensured the success of European integration.
This was precisely the approach adopted in the proposals put forward by the Danish and Greek Presidencies.
The rapporteurs, however, would have needed... a Constitution.
The line that is proposed constitutes a serious deviation from the agenda.
I have therefore rejected it, as a way of expressing my support for pursuing the Danish initiative.
The radical approach that has been adopted is extremely negative and clearly disregards the interests of the European citizens.
Parliament should pursue the initiative, suggesting responsibly whatever amendments it considers appropriate, whilst strictly respecting the current legal framework.
This is precisely what the rule of law is and we could do worse than show an example.
.
(FR) The European Parliament recently played a part in a ridiculous psychodrama. I would remind the House of my speech and my explanation of vote on 26 and 27 March.
A stop has now been put to this, as was only sensible.
Nonetheless, it involved a joint declaration with the Council, in which the latter accepts the idea of codecision for the adoption of future financial perspectives. Further, it takes advantage of the opportunity to place financial aid to Turkey in the 'pre-accession' heading.
We do not agree with any of these points. I therefore voted against the BÃ¶ge report.
I would also like to emphasise that enlargement should call for a major financial review.
Structural Funds should be done away with in the interests of economy.
Each country should regain control of its town and country planning.
Only part of this finance would be retained. This would be for the benefit of new Member States only and for a limited time, with a view to assisting them to reach the standard required.
This is precisely what the British Government has just wisely proposed at the Convention.
We have actually been arguing along these lines for some time. I refer the House to the White Paper published by the UEN Group in 1997 assessing the value of a Europe of the nations as against a welfare-state Europe.
.
(DE) I did not vote in favour of the report by Mr BÃ¶ge and Mr Colom i Naval, which reflects the result of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament.
My concerns are not allayed by the result of the trialogue, which was intended at least to limit the damage that the Council has done to democracy in the EU.
Annex XV remains in the Accession Treaties and will thus become primary legislation.
Everything else, I regard as empty words.
Only after years have elapsed will we be able to begin to prove that the opposite is the case.
The Council, though, has already demonstrated that it is acting against Parliament.
See also my explanation of vote on the Accession Treaties.
Mr President, enlargement of the Union is essentially a political necessity. Personally, I am in favour of uniting Europe in a geographical sense.
I am also in favour of strengthening political and economic ties within Europe. Clearly therefore, I did not support those opposed to enlargement of any kind.
I was unable to vote in favour, however, because the enlargement decided on at Copenhagen will not be implemented in an open and systematic manner. We shall instead descend into confusion.
In time, European integration is likely to grind to a halt as a result of enlargement. The economic and social situation of almost all the new Member States is precarious, to say the least.
Calculated in terms of purchasing power, their standard of living is about 40% of the Community average. Nonetheless, accession aid amounted to only 0.03% of Community GDP, according to the report by Mr Wim Kok.
In other words, it is a pittance.
The SAPARD appropriations intended to facilitate structural adjustment of agriculture in the candidate countries disappeared into a maze of Community red tape. Only 6.48% of the EUR 1.04 billion initially allocated for 2000 and 2001 was implemented.
Mr President, I abstained from voting for three important reasons.
First and foremost, Europe must try to solve its own problems before taking the decision to enlarge.
Secondly, the accession of the new Member States must be made conditional upon the results of referendums in the current Member States, and thirdly, the fact is that the new Member States are not yet ready for this enlargement.
I would furthermore like to underline the fact that this enlargement is coming at a time when Europe has never been as divided as it is now.
We still have a great deal of work to do, particularly in the area of foreign policy.
It is essential that Europe develop its own identity in that area.
Furthermore, we must put an end to the profligacy of the European agricultural policy before we can proceed with enlargement.
To conclude, let me point out that there are still far too many socio-economic differences between the European Union and the candidate Member States.
Today, Mr President, I too voted in favour of the accession of the Czech Republic.
It is self-evident that the Czechs are part of Europe, in the heart of which they live.
I would no longer have been able to look my friends and relatives in Prague in the face if I had voted against them joining us.
My 'yes' vote, though, is intended primarily to strengthen those in Czech public life, in political parties, parliament and government, who have come to recognise that, rather than having to drag the ballast of history into the future, a people that finds the strength to face up to the whole of its own history reaps honour rather than humiliation.
Reconciliation is the fruit of truth and of any person's willingness, for a moment, to put himself in another's position.
I know as a German that even we, who overran almost all our neighbours in wartime, regained the esteem and respect of all by not repressing these aspects of our history or treating them as merely relative.
Let the Czechs try it too; it is a liberating thing to do.
Mr President, I voted for the accession of all these Eastern and Central European countries and the accession of Malta and Cyprus because I hold out great hopes of having, in the future, a Parliament with a greater number of representatives of pensioners and pensioners' parties from these Member States.
I was therefore disappointed to see that there was a great demonstration of protest during this vote from European Union employees, whose future pension payments are to be reduced.
Therefore, while I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to them, I hope and pray that the future Parliament, including the Members from the Member States, will guarantee the citizens, starting with European Union employees, a peaceful future in which the elderly are duly respected.
Mr President, I would like to preface my remarks by saying that I am a great supporter of enlargement and, having been, among other things, chairman of the delegation to Slovenia, have been a convinced defender of this policy.
Turning to the subject of the Czech Republic, I would like to state that I had always hoped that the Czechs would, in good time, cast aside the dead weight of history and make it possible for us to vote for the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union with joy and a clear conscience.
It is unfortunate that the failure of many Czech politicians' courage has prevented that; hence also my vote against, in solidarity with Mr Ferber.
I hope that the Czechs will in future get round a table and find there a way of working through the past together.
Mr President, I abstained during the various votes and voted against the Brok report.
I did not therefore vote for assent concerning the Accession Treaty for 10 new Member States to the Union.
This was a painful decision for me, in both emotional and political terms. For over a decade I have worked tirelessly in the European Parliament, in France and across Europe so that enlargement could take place on the date planned and on the terms needed to ensure its success.
I voted as I did because I have become convinced that separating the process of the geographical enlargement of the Union from that of deepening its institutions is the unfortunate result of current and future Member States becoming resigned to a weaker Europe with a fossilised institutional system. Sadly, divisions within Europe have become more marked in recent months.
Sadly also, the Convention has failed to make progress during that period.
It is now resigned to achieving no more than cosmetic changes to the current system.
All are resigned to the signature of the constitutional treaty not taking place in December 2003 as originally planned.
There is no mistaking the signs.
The enlarged European Union will be obliged to operate under the provisions of the Treaty of Nice.
It will therefore be fatally flawed and condemned to failure.
I did not vote for assent because I want enlargement to succeed.
Mr President, as a European federalist and a Catalan independentist I abstained on the votes concerning the accession of the 10 new Member States, even though my colleagues in the European Free Alliance are in favour.
Allow me to explain the reasons for my vote.
It emerges from the Convention's current work on the constitution that a stateless nation such as Catalonia has nothing to gain from enlargement. Its representation in European institutions will continue to depend on the good will of the relevant Member States.
The House will however be aware of the attitude adopted by the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of France. The Convention has not led to any breakthrough regarding explicit recognition of the right to self-determination and internal enlargement.
It has not promoted the cause of Catalan becoming an official language at European level either. In these circumstances, the accession of new Member States will only aggravate Catalonia's relative position within the Union.
For example, it will lose representation and its contributions will be increased. Several of the new Member States have fallen far short of compliance with the Copenhagen criteria on respect for the rights of their minorities, for example the retention of the Bene?
Decrees by Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Lastly, the stance of most of these new Member States on the terrible war in Iraq appears to put a question mark over the whole process of European integration.
All those aiming at a Europe capable of countering the irresponsible supremacy of the United States must roll their sleeves up and get to work on a European Europe.
At present, enlargement seems reminiscent of lemmings rushing to the sea.
Mr President, I voted against the Brok report, although I am in favour of enlargement.
This was not of course intended as a personal affront to Mr Brok.
The reason was that his report fails to take any account of the essential link between enlargement and deepening.
There is no reference whatsoever to the delays regarding deepening, nor to the Convention probably becoming bogged down.
The link it had been hoped to establish has been severed.
This is why I voted against the Brok report.
In my view however, it is unfair to penalise innocent parties for a delay that is entirely our fault.
Consequently, I voted in favour of assent.
I support enlargement and strengthening, and I am against agreeing to give up on strengthening.
There is a danger that the Europe we are committing ourselves to will be an enlarged Europe but not a strengthened one. It will be fettered from the outset.
Mr President, the reason I voted against the Brok report is that I am opposed to such fettering.
Mr President, I also voted against the Brok report despite my own, and my party's, long-standing commitment to a wider Europe.
The terms that we have offered the applicant states are unimaginative and mean.
More than anything, the nations of Central and Eastern Europe should be able to exploit their natural advantages of low costs and cheaper exports and so price themselves into the market.
But we are forcing them to join the euro, the forty-eight hour week, the common agricultural policy and the Social Chapter, while at the same time forcing them to devalue their recently-won democracies.
It is for the peoples of these states to decide.
In the cases of Malta and Slovenia, where they have already done so, I also voted 'yes'.
But I cannot help feeling that we ought to have offered them a more generous and flexible deal.
A further elaboration is provided in the ten-point explanation of vote submitted in writing by SOS Democracy.
Mr President, I voted against the Brok report and abstained on assent. This was not because I wish to close the doors to Europe against the 10 new entrants.
They do indeed have a rightful place amongst us. Undeniably, this is their Europe too.
I am, however, concerned about the structure of the European edifice they hope to enter. I wonder whether Europe will rise to the challenge of equipping itself with institutions strong enough to regulate the activities of 25 Member States, soon to be increased further.
Such institutions must be open and understood by each and every citizen. In my opinion, only a constitution can guarantee this.
I fear the current enlargement may be used to justify weakening. I am extremely concerned about sailing into the unknown through an institutional fog.
My vote was intended to express this concern.
Mr President, I voted in favour of assent but abstained on the Brok report. This was because of the ambiguous nature of the wording concerning independence of the foreign and defence policies of a future enlarged Union from the United States.
The institutional and financial provision for enlargement is not good.
There is a real risk of losing ground as regards political integration, and financial programming is patently inadequate.
Our own shortcomings cannot, however, justify our holding 10 nations hostage as we struggle with the Council, nor can they justify our slamming the door against the prospective entrants.
More than 10 years have passed since the fall of the Iron Curtain. It is now our historical duty to welcome these countries into the Union.
We alone are responsible for the delay in institutional reform. Following the unsatisfactory Treaty of Nice, the backlog made it necessary to convene the Convention in order to give Europe a constitution at last.
At the earliest, the latter will be adopted after a short IGC in the wake of the Convention, and before 1 May 2004.
There should be no mistake about what is at issue today, however.
We are not taking decisions on institutional matters or financial perspectives.
We are saying yes or no to entire peoples taking up their rightful place in the Union. We are deciding the future of peoples whose historical fate it was to be excluded from the process of building a democratic Europe for half a century.
From now on the new entrants will fight alongside us for the future of the Union.
They have to help us stop drifting towards a free trade area and set our course towards creating a high quality social model.
They will join us in the struggle for a political Europe able to speak with one strong voice in the world. They will work with us on a constitution allowing interested countries the freedom to establish a joint foreign and defence policy, thus breaking new ground for Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, being a farmer in Lower Austria, and having myself managed for forty-three years - right up to the rending of the Iron Curtain - a farm on the border, it was with great conviction that I voted today for the accession of ten new Member States and for the Brok Report.
I know that, for agriculture, enlargement means not only competition, but also opportunity, and that Austrian farmers will take up these challenges, and do so on the basis of the measures taken in the run-up to accession.
I have therefore cast my vote in favour of a peaceful, tolerant, and social future for our children and grandchildren.
I am voting against the Brok report within the framework of the resolution by the GUE/NGL group.
Not because I am against the accession of the new members, but because the resolution does not mention material issues relating to enlargement: the promotion of an elitist policy in central and eastern European countries servile to the Americans; the break-up of the public sector and of public property; the enforced liberalism which creates social unhappiness; the lack of significant Community resources to help these countries with the integration process; the failure to organise referenda on enlargement in the Member States.
Members of SOS Democracy (and the Democracy-Forum in the Convention) have voted differently on enlargement but share the following critical views.
The applicant countries should have been offered more flexible conditions, including different types of association agreements with mutual influence and mutual obligations instead of the colonial style EEA-agreement.
Membership should have been offered with variable geometry, lasting derogations, long-term derogations and derogations dependent on the future economic development towards cohesion, fully taking into account the different levels of economic development.
The applicant countries should be allowed to decide on their own regarding the buying and selling of agricultural land and second houses, at least until their incomes are comparable to ours.
Waiting for agricultural reform and a fair deal, the applicant countries should be able to have the amounts provided for in the agricultural budgets as lump sums, instead of being bound to use the money in the silly, wasteful and inefficient way we have done.
Instead of paying full contributions from the first day of membership, they should at least have been offered the five years' rebate that was offered to the UK, Denmark and Ireland, or free membership until they reach a certain income.
Many civil servants from the applicant countries will now be offered lucrative jobs in the EU institutions with salaries far above the salaries offered to their own prime ministers.
The applicant countries shall have a possibility to tax their nationals, employed by the EU and in the EU countries to avoid unfair inequalities, where their citizens are asked to pay contributions from poor budgets to fellow citizens, e.g. paid 20 times the normal salary at home.
The applicant countries should be offered more flexibility in the application of EU rules.
They should adopt the rules gradually by following our rules, such as when they export their products to our markets, but not apply all the rules to their home market, e.g. we should accept the sale of sausages in local markets, when they comply with local laws.
The fulfilment of common environmental standards should be financed by Community funds so that environmental protection is not spurned in the applicant countries or postponed for better times.
The applicant countries should also be allowed to keep their standards, especially when they are higher than ours.
The applicant countries should take full part in the Convention with full membership and have their fair share of the posts in the Praesidium and the Secretariat.
Also, the treaty resulting from the Convention should be adopted by an IGC with the eastern countries as full members.
All EU treaties and rules should have been translated into the applicant country languages and been made available for the citizens through libraries and the Internet in good time before the referendums.
The Yes-side and the No-side should have equal public funding.
The governments and the EU institutions should not be allowed to interfere with biased information before the referendums.
These critical remarks have made some of us vote against enlargement or abstain while others have voted 'yes' to allow the voters in the applicant countries to take a free decision, even if the conditions are not fair.
Green light - On behalf of my group I would like to express my total support for an early enlargement, stressing the principle of equal treatment with regard to the Copenhagen criteria.
I hope that the signature of the Accession Treaty will represent the final unification of our continent, leaving behind the wars which desolated our peoples and drew up borders by force.
The new and strengthened Union will be a continent with a shared destiny of peace, democracy and freedom.
Solidarity - This unprecedented enlargement brings new challenges for the Union.
We will need an even greater spirit of solidarity in all our common policies, and we will have to strengthen the institutional capacities of the Union.
The current and future Members will have to make the greatest possible effort, replacing national egotism with Community solidarity in order to find, as the Treaties demand, a united European voice in world political fora.
Budgetary conflict - Although an agreement was reached at the last moment, I must strongly criticise the Council's unilateral action of including budgetary figures in the Accession Treaty.
This is an unprecedented action which constitutes a serious attack on the budgetary competences of our House and the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999.
.
(FR) The only question put to the House concerned assent to the request for the accession of 10 new countries to the European Union. Nonetheless, the House is being requested to endorse the content of the draft treaty on accession.
We are in favour of uniting the whole continent and doing away with the borders fragmenting it. We are therefore obviously in favour of the right of these countries to accede to the European Union if such is the wish of their people.
On the other hand, we are totally opposed to the spirit and the letter of the draft treaty the European institutions seek to impose on them.
Regarding the content of this treaty, it formalises the unfair divide between the richer and poorer parts of Europe.
The word integration is a euphemism for a relationship in which imperialist Europe will impose itself on the new entrants. The latter are mostly countries in Eastern Europe perceived as fair game by the financial and industrial groups in the former.
As to the form, the new Member States are being blackmailed into accepting this treaty. The only choice open to them is one between accepting the treaty or remaining outside the Union.
This treaty provides for a two-speed Europe as far the budget and politics are concerned. It heralds a Europe where some will be more equal than others.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Those who oppose the European Union would like to use the events of the last couple of months to highlight disagreement and discord between the existing Member States of the European Union.
We all know that the last two to three months have been an enduring exercise for political leaders within the EU.
But the enlargement of the European Union is a real success story.
We all have a right to be proud to be in a position today to formally approve the Accession Treaties for ten countries seeking to join the European Union.
EU Enlargement is a win-win situation for the European Union and for the people of the applicant states.
I believe that EU Enlargement will help to build a more effective European Union.
It will certainly consolidate democratic structures in Europe, while at the same time strengthening the economy of an expanding European Union.
This historic process will have a positive impact for the actual cohesion of the European Union itself.
I am hopeful that the ten applicant countries will be in a position to fully join the European Union on May 1st 2004 next.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
This is one of the most important issues to be dealt with by Parliament in the last few years.
I am a great supporter of the Enlargement process, not only because of our responsibility to our fellow Europeans who suffered under totalitarian regimes but also because I believe that the new accession countries will bring a wonderful dynamic to the future development of the European Union.
As we look to the future, we must also remember 'the past', the ideals of the founders of the European Economic Community.
Peace, democracy and prosperity are as important today as they were fifty years ago.
We now have the opportunity to revitalise the process and bring a positive message to the peoples of Eastern Europe.
From the outset, they will be equals, they will have the same rights as the existing members.
Lastly, in giving my support to this report and the accession process, I also wish to see the accession countries, national parliaments and governments having the same voting rights at the European Convention as the existing Member States of the Union.
As John F Kennedy said in his inaugural speech 'we stand today on the edge of a new frontier, but the new frontier is not a set of promises, it is a set of challenges.'
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(FR) The accession of these 10 new Member States has to be supported by all those wishing to stabilise the continent as a whole, consolidate democracy and peace, strengthen the economy and sustainable development and be part of a cultural and human dimension based on shared values of freedom, respect for fundamental rights, good governance and the rule of law. These new Member States have a vital role to play in building an even stronger and more efficient European Union.
This represents an unprecedented challenge on the political, economic and social levels.
It also should be borne in mind that if this challenge is taken up, tremendous potential for strengthening and developing the European Union will be unleashed. We will indeed be able to aspire to a European Union speaking with one and the same voice on the world political stage and playing a leading role.
I have no wish to hold up this historical process in any way. Nonetheless, if Amendment No 1, the second part of Amendment No 13 and Amendment No 19 are not adopted, I shall abstain.
I will, however, vote in favour of the accession of each of the 10 candidate countries when it comes to the vote on the various recommendations.
I trust this will help lay the best possible foundations for our shared future.
.
(FR) The circumstances in which enlargement is currently proposed are disastrous. Promises given have not been honoured.
The Union's structures have not been adjusted to allow for smooth functioning with 25 Member States in the near future. It will be even more difficult to function in the more distant future when there are 40 Member States.
To make things worse, the necessary finance for enlargement as provided for in the treaty is not guaranteed. This contravenes the agreement reached at the Berlin Summit.
Consequently, the Community will soon stall. The chances of creating the social Europe we sorely need will therefore be reduced.
Territorial cohesion will also be threatened, when it is now more essential than ever. Moreover, the Community we longed for and worked towards for 50 years will not survive this enlargement, but will be replaced by a bland and featureless Union.
We set out to build a cathedral and ended up in a department store.
We are actually being urged to maximise the danger of stalling the Union at the very time when essential international mechanisms are disintegrating, starting with the United Nations.
This is why I shall vote against the resolutions on assent, even though I endorse the resolution accompanying the Brok report following the improvements made in the House.
. (EL) I voted against in the case of Poland because I find its overall stand on the issue of war with Iraq unacceptable.
I voted against in the case of the Czech Republic because I find its overall stand on the issue of war with Iraq and on the question of the Bene? decrees unacceptable.
.
(FR) This fifth enlargement represents a giant step forward at geopolitical level. It amounts to giving tangible form to a significant stage in the great task of European reconciliation in the shape of a Union based on full liberal democracy.
That means democracy in politics, economics, social and defence issues. It will prove a catalyst for peace and stability and help raise the standard of living for Europeans.
Enlargement will also allow the European Union to respond more effectively to the challenges of globalisation. The Union will bring universal values to bear whilst remaining true to its historical duty to all the countries of the Mediterranean basin.
.
(DE) Today, the European Parliament has approved the accession of ten states to the European Union.
This is an historic day for Europe.
Europe is united in freedom.
This is a development that the CSU members in Parliament welcome.
For many years, we have played a leading role in bringing about this historic event, but, despite all the rejoicing that attends this day, doubts still remain as regards the Czech Republic.
European constitutional thinking knows nothing of the idea that one injustice cancels out another.
It was the European Parliament that, alone, in the course of negotiations on accession, brought to European public attention Czech law's failure to deal with the past, and, over a period of years, demanded that this be sorted out.
Parliament's initiatives have been taken up neither by Commissioner Verheugen, who is responsible for these matters, nor by the German Government.
In vain do we wait for a political gesture in a spirit of reconciliation.
It is the opposite that has happened, for, on 24 April 2002, the Czech parliament unanimously passed a resolution to the effect that the legal consequences of the Bene? decrees were 'unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable'.
The Czech Republic is, of course, a country at the heart of Europe, but we have nonetheless voted against its accession with the intention of sending Czech politicians the message that the wounds inflicted in the past on the expelled Germans are still open, and that we must heal them together, in dialogue with one another.
.
(FR) We have said 'no' to the treaties of accession presented to Parliament for assent. This is because we actually wish enlargement to succeed and because we are committed federalists.
Enlargement is in danger of becoming a dog's dinner as a number of preliminary conditions have not been met. Some of these are detailed below.
Turning first to institutional conditions, clearly the Convention will not lead to a major overhaul of the institutions. It will therefore not enable them to become more democratic and comprehensible.
It will not allow for secularism to be declared a fundamental principle of the Union either.
Moving on to social conditions, so far there is no provision for a social treaty to accompany the draft constitution for Europe. Such a treaty would contain guarantees to help deal with the danger of business relocation together with assurances regarding public services.
Further, the agreement cobbled together at the eleventh hour violated the rights of the European Parliament. It sets enlargement in an unrealistic financial framework that discriminates against the accession countries.
It threatens the success of the whole enterprise, notably that of the CAP. Readjustment of the CAP to focus on rural development is also at risk.
The candidate countries are set to join an integrated system that is merely a market. This is not how the European socialists conceive of Europe.
. (ES) We have just written a page in the history of our continent: by voting in favour of accession, we have taken a definitive step in the process of reconciling the people of Europe; we have repaired an historical injustice; we have made it possible for politics to triumph as an instrument at the service of peace at a time when the horror of war is returning, reminding us that peace is not a given, but that we have to preserve it.
In order for the stage we have reached today to really represent a reunification of Europe it is essential that the Union acquires a Constitution which guarantees the effective and democratic functioning of its institutions and its political dimension.
Only in that way will we ensure that Europe continues to be the dream of freedom and well-being which the countries we have said yes to today have signed up to.
It is essential that we do not forget the profound significance of the European idea and that we confirm the continued existence of those values which have made the union of the continent possible; the supremacy of the human being and respect for their dignity, solidarity, social justice and the quest for the common good.
.
(DE) Today's vote on the accession of ten Central and Eastern European states sees us laying the foundation on which the historical division of Europe into East and West will be overcome.
The historical division into masculine and feminine worlds persists, however, both in Eastern and in Western Europe.
My 'yes' to the accession of Cyprus, Malta, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is coupled with the expectation that the acquis communautaire will be adopted without reservation, and given life, as it applies to the area of equal opportunities for women and men.
I will not deny that I found it very difficult to say 'yes' to the accession of the Republic of Poland, which, along with the United Kingdom, is a participant in war against Iraq, a war of aggression and contrary to international law.
I therefore see it as my responsibility as a German social democrat to set today's European date of 9 April 2003 against the nationalist date of 1 September 1939, at the same time hoping for peace and prosperity for all and for a European social model based on partnership.
.
(DE) I did not vote in favour of the Brok Report, because at least one of its paragraphs does not make adequately clear mention of the Council's blatant breach of the law.
See also my explanation of vote on the Accession Treaties.
. (FR) A glance at the troubled history of Europe, full of internecine wars between Europeans, must help us to appreciate the significance of today's vote in the House on the report on enlargement of the European Union.
This enlargement of the Union is best understood as the reunification of the peoples of our continent. At long last all Europeans are coming together to share common fundamental values such as freedom, democracy, solidarity and respect for human rights and the environment.
As Members of the European Parliament we should rejoice in having played a part in this process, and commit ourselves to ensuring its success.
Nonetheless, we must regret that the budget allocated to this enlargement is inadequate for the scale of the project and for our common future.
It is derisory. I would recall for reference that between 1948 and 1951 the United States contributed the equivalent of EUR 97 billion to help Western Europe recover from the devastation caused by war.
That amounted to 1.5% of the GDP of the United States.
Between 1990 and 1999 EUR 600 billion was invested to finance recovery in the former East Germany.
The European Council is only prepared to allocate 0.15% of the Union's GDP to enlargement.
From now on we must demonstrate solidarity as we respond to continental challenges of this kind. It is worth bearing in mind that our future will henceforth be inextricably linked to that of our new friends and neighbours, and that it is up to us to make that future a reality.
.
(DE) It is with joy and satisfaction that I note that, in the vote referred to above, the Czech Republic received the worst result and thus a 'Parliamentary shot across the bows'.
Present-day Czech politicians must wonder why they did so badly, with 489 votes in favour, 39 votes against, and 37 abstentions.
As a member of the EU/Czech Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee, I experienced, over the past four years, the Czech's intolerable arrogance at first hand.
Over and over again, I appealed to Prague to meet us halfway in the matter of the wretched Bene? decrees, and in this way draw a line under the unpleasantnesses of the past.
On each occasion, the politicians in Prague refused categorically to do so.
My yes in the vote today is therefore a signal to today's young Czechs, who will, it may be hoped, soon be calling the political tune in Germany's neighbouring republic.
I wish the present holders of political office in the Czech Republic much joy from the arguments in their own country as to why the vote in the European Parliament in Strasbourg was such a poor result for them.
Perhaps it is only now that the open dialogue that Parliament has been striving for will begin.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the accession of the ten countries from a sense of solidarity with their people, who have no reason to celebrate.
On the contrary, it was clear in the run-up to accession (when public corporations and their wealth were sold off to big business abroad, any socialist achievements were abolished, sovereign rights and national independence were restricted and so on), that they have every cause for concern.
Only multinationals and their representatives in the European Parliament have any reason to celebrate.
The 'ten' are joining a Union of small and medium-sized imperialist states which serves the interests of the major capitalist states, thereby exacerbating the exploitation of their people and anyone else they can get their hands on, in both competition and cooperation with the 'big brother' and acknowledged ruler: the USA.
As was apparent from the crime against Iraq, the differences between certain Euro-unionist imperialists and their American buddies in the war lie not in the end but in the means.
We also voted against the accession of Cyprus because, in addition to the foregoing, it has been used to exert pressure and legitimise the outcome of the barbaric invasion and occupation, to which the 'sensitive' European imperialists are turning a blind eye.
The workers - the people - do not need imperialist organisations to hammer out their common fight and will bar the way to the ruin they are leading them to by changing the course of mankind towards a future worthy of it, a socialist future.
- (DA) The basic problems concerning what is termed enlargement towards the east have not been solved.
There is therefore no doubt that, given the economic realities, the tradition, going back many years, of Western European exploitation of our Eastern European neighbours, in the light of the different situation where wages and capital etc. are concerned, will continue into the future.
The adjustments they will make in order to comply with existing Community law will cause the new countries quite a few problems, but that fact is not examined in detail in Mr Brok's report.
The People's Movement Against the EU cannot support Mr Brok's paternalistic exposition and conclusions, but at the same time is refraining from voting against the report out of respect for the candidate countries' right to decide for themselves - through fair and impartial referendums (we hope for the best but fear the worst) - whether they desire EU membership.
. (FR) We are charged with making a decision on enlargement of the European Union to include 10 new members.
From the outset, we did not wish to hinder the choice of the peoples of Eastern Europe in any way. They were to be free to decide whether or not to accede to the Union.
If existing Member States put up barriers, this would be interpreted as the construction of a so-called fortress Europe for the richer countries. The latter would be criticised for failing to show solidarity with other peoples wishing to accede to the Union.
We do however wish to speak out against the conditions of this enlargement on the cheap. It does not provide for equality between the members.
No proper account is taken either of the increase in poverty and unemployment in the candidate countries. These social problems were caused by the policies adopted over the last 10 years in order to meet the criteria for accession.
It can readily be understood that the peoples affected are now seeking compensation in the form of rights and structural and agricultural funds.
Unfortunately, the European Union tends to regard the new members as second class countries.
It waxes eloquent over the reunification of the continent, deeming it a political and historical achievement. At the same time it prevents the free movement of people.
It heralds democracy and pluralism, but the aims of the changes imposed and the means used to achieve them smack of dogmas leading to social regression. The conditions imposed on appropriations and aid are examples of this.
The countries of Eastern Europe are particularly affected. We voted against the Brok report for all these reasons.
My VVD delegation was and is in favour of the enlargement of the European Union by the addition of the twelve countries with which we are currently negotiating, particularly for historic, economic and politico-strategic reasons (such as, among other things, stability along the eastern border and democracy throughout Europe).
We are voting for the accession of Malta, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland.
The big bang was an unjust procedure that put unnecessary pressure on the internal cohesion of the Union as well as on the objective assessment of the candidate Member States.
We must not choose this way again in future, not even with a small bang.
Every candidate Member State must be evaluated on its own merits.
As soon as Bulgaria and Romania are ready, they must accede without having to wait for the others.
As far as we are concerned, therefore, accession before or after 2007 is indeed possible.
With regard to the accession of other countries such as Croatia or Turkey, the institutional form of the European Union will first have to be adapted (efficiency, transparency and democratic control) before they can be considered.
No promises can therefore be made until the Intergovernmental Conference has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
To participate in peacefully reuniting a once fractured Europe is a remarkable privilege.
I voted for this with great satisfaction today.
As a representative of the Scottish National Party, I was also very conscious that many small countries, which only recently re-established their independence, were among those we voted in today.
By contrast, however, Scotland, one of the most ancient small nations in Europe, remains no more than a 'region' of a Member State as things are viewed from Brussels.
In this new enlarged Europe, Scotland must surely aspire to more than that.
The people of Scotland will pass a judgement about that on 1 May in the Scottish Parliamentary election.
Enlargement from the outside is taking place.
It may also take place from the inside.
As the European Convention proceeds towards its conclusion, it seems clear that a future constitution will place no barrier in the way of internal enlargement.
I hope this process will commence soon.
.
(DE) Never before have I seen so many Members of the European Parliament put massive pressure by their national party leaderships.
It is for that reason that the result of the vote does not correspond to the honest convictions that many of us have.
What I say now I say also with those in mind who dared not follow their conscience. The EU must become democratic before it can be enlarged.
That is what we promised our electorates in 1999.
Yet the EU has not done its homework, and the Treaty of Nice is a mockery.
That is why the EU can work only if the Convention and the governments decide on a real constitution, one that is democratic and transparent.
Although I am very much in favour of the EU's enlargement, the accession of ten new members at once means that it is at present taking on too much.
The reason why I voted against the Brok Report is that it presents us with a world of illusions.
I could not even vote in favour of the accession of Poland, where too much is getting out of hand, and the Polish Government is playing an active part in the abhorrent war of aggression in Iraq.
I abstained in the votes on all the other states, my primary concern being the question of whether the West is ready for the East, the answer to which question is in the negative.
Today is an historic day for the European Union and I am delighted and proud to play a small role by voting yes on all the enlargement reports before us.
Today we begin the European twenty-first century.
The last century in Europe was marked by war in its first half and division into East and West in its second.
That Europe is put behind us as we vote today to reunite our continent in peace, democracy and prosperity.
Ten new flags appeared in our Chamber today.
I look forward to welcoming our new colleagues from these countries to our Parliament next month so that we can begin building together the Europe our 500 million citizens deserve.
. (NL) There are plenty of arguments as to why we should reject the ten countries whose governments wish to accede to the EU.
Some, such as Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, discriminate against the large Roma populations there.
There have been complaints against Hungary and Cyprus for discrimination against homosexuals.
Poland, just as Ireland once did, wants to retain the freedom to deny women the right to abortus provocatus for all eternity.
Estonia and Lithuania have tried to deny equal rights to their large Russian minority, whom they hold responsible for the former occupation.
Cyprus could involve the European Union in a war against Turkey.
The current Member States are furthermore complaining about corruption, labour migration and the high cost of relief funds.
I believe that it is at least as important that these countries are being subjected to a neoliberal acquis, that public services are breaking down and large sections of the population are being condemned to the long-term perpetuation of the poverty that has arisen over the past ten years.
Yet it is the inhabitants of these countries, and no one else, who must determine whether they want to belong to the European Union.
They are being given the opportunity to speak out on this in referendums everywhere except in Cyprus.
I do not want to take that right away from them in order to protect ourselves or by knowing what is good for them better than they do themselves.
By rejecting the Brok Report, I am upholding my agreement with enlargement, which I announced on 20 November 2002.
. (DE) Today, the European Parliament has voted to accept the accession of ten states to the European Union.
This is an historic day, not only for Europe, but also for me personally.
The calamitous division of Europe is being overcome, and Europe is being united in peace and freedom.
The peoples of Europe now have the opportunity to join together in shaping their future in freedom and under democracy.
I have nonetheless voted today against the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, and I would like to explain why I have done so. I have voted today against the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, and I would like to explain that this was not a 'no' to the Czech people, but rather a deliberate sign to the political office-holders who, despite many demands that they should do so - from their own people, among others - were unwilling to abandon passages in the Bene? decrees that are contrary to human rights.
My electoral district is in the Oberpfalz, a border region which shares some 140 kilometres of border with the Czech Republic, and one where many have built up a new life after being driven from their homes in Bohemia and Moravia.
I know how strong are the ties that bind these expellees to their former homes, and to family members and friends who still live in the Czech Republic and to whom the Czech 'Immunity Act' remains applicable.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(DE) I welcome the accession, on 1 May 2004, of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, as well as of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and the islands of Cyprus and Malta.
This will put an end to the calamitous division of Europe.
I rejoice to be able to be present at this historic moment.
However much I may rejoice in the accessions, I continue to have doubts about the Czech Republic.
Whilst I want the Czech Republic to join the EU, I cannot close my eyes to the fact that the Bene? decrees, which legitimised the expulsion of individual ethnic groups, continue to be in force there to this day.
I cast my vote against the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union.
I do not regard it as acceptable for the Czech Republic to continue, to this day, to fail to distance itself from the Bene? decrees in an appropriate manner and thus to acknowledge that the expulsions were an injustice.
My vote is intended to be a signal.
I especially want to draw attention to the so-called 'Immunity Act', which continues to give legitimacy to the gravest offences and crimes of the post-war period.
Years ago, on the initiative of CSU/CDU MEPs, Parliament called on the Czech Republic to suspend the decrees and laws still in force, in so far as they related to the expulsion of specific ethnic groups from the former Czechoslovakia.
The Czech Republic did not comply; quite the contrary.
In addition, in April 2002, the Czech Parliament even unanimously declared the effects of the Bene? decrees on law and property rights to be 'unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable'.
I see that as clear evidence that the Czechs are not willing to make a gesture of political reconciliation.
It is this background that makes it urgently necessary to complete this chapter of history.
The European Union is a community of laws and values, and one of its elementary obligations is that of protecting minorities.
This must be recognised by every country desirous of acceding to the European Union, and for the Czech Republic to ignore this fact is unacceptable.
I consider that the enlargement of the ?U with another 10 countries from our continent is an historic enterprise which - whichever way you look at it - was sorely needed following the collapse of the two-pole system in Europe and the world.
Its deeper meaning was and still is that we hope to welcome the people of these countries into a well-formed entity, a community that unites its members' economies and has proclaimed its will to move towards closer and closer political cooperation and union between the states, nations and citizens of Europe.
We have no historic, moral, political or strategic right to refuse the freely and democratically formulated request of the ten nations to participate on an equal footing in the construction of this entity.
On the contrary, it is in all our interests to respond positively, with initiatives and solidarity.
We expect the same wish for convergence to be expressed, generally and specifically, by these countries and their governments, over and above the sorry and forced divergences demonstrated recently on the subject of the plan to invade Iraq, divergences that will soon prove to be pointless and bereft of practical value for those who decided on them out of either naivety or selfishness.
Enlargement as it has taken place clearly also has negative aspects and dangers both for the acceding countries and for the historic enterprise of European unification, given that it has preceded the greater institutional and political unity needed...
(Explanation of vote pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(FR) Ever since the former Soviet bloc began to collapse, I and many others have striven to facilitate the swift accession of the countries about to join us. I am therefore delighted this is about to happen at last, after so many delays caused intentionally by the European federalists.
The candidate countries have shown themselves capable of introducing the necessary changes in order to join the Union. The latter, however, is currently seized by a dangerous paralysis and I am concerned about the situation.
The rapporteur referred to strengthening the Union's institutional capacity.
I hold the opposite view.
As I see it, enlargement must involve moving away from the old Community method. The stance adopted by future Member States on the eve of military intervention in Iraq confirms my view.
Our concept of European solidarity dates back to the early days of European integration. The new Member States understand solidarity quite differently.
Those are the facts and we must accept them.
There is no point in calling for more integration, a supranational level and uniformity.
If we attempt to create a Europe of 25 Member States as the rapporteur suggests, everything will grind to a halt.
Europe needs freedom and flexibility. It can do without ideology.
It must draw its strength solely from the diversity of the nations it encompasses.
. (FR) I voted in favour of the treaty on the accession of the 10 new countries to the European Union.
I thought carefully before doing so, because it means committing the Union to a long and difficult process. It should be borne in mind, however, that creating the Union has always been a difficult process.
We must expect it to be long too. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe wishing to accede to our Union have made tremendous efforts in order to join.
They modernised their economies quickly and reformed their social systems. Their political systems became democratic.
All this was achieved in a few short years. They are to be commended on their courage and the sacrifices they made.
The peoples of Central and Eastern Europe have a very unsettled past. Its memories are still fresh in their minds.
We cannot reject these people simply because we do not want to slow down our kind of Europe. We have no right to do so.
The unification of Europe is a historical challenge.
We do not have the right to miss this opportunity. We shall pay a heavy price if we do.
The enlargement process must go hand in hand with a deepening of the institutions. We are well aware that deepening would not be taking place if enlargement were not on the horizon.
All those who earnestly hope for the success of enlargement will have understood that it is essential to vote for assent today. We will then be able to offer the hand of genuine fellowship to the peoples of these 10 countries.
The European Union was created to promote the cause of peace. We are charged with keeping the spirit of peace alive and working for a better future for us all.
.
(DE) I very much welcome today's vote in the plenary of the European Parliament in favour of accepting the ten countries that wish to accede to the European Union.
The enlargement of the European Union represents a gain both for the European Union and for the candidates for accession and is an indispensable prerequisite for peace, stability and prosperity in a reunited Europe.
It is with reference to this, though, that I would like to reiterate the urgent necessity of establishing, as soon as possible, an EU-wide harmonised system of common safety standards for all present and future EU Member States in the field of nuclear energy use.
The following steps need to be taken without delay:
Revision of the Euratom Treaty by the Convention on the Future of Europe, which is currently in session; the drawing up and enactment of the directives already proposed by the European Commission on the improvement of nuclear safety; and the establishment of an independent authority at EU level to inspect controls in the area of nuclear safety in the Member States, in close collaboration with the IAEO.
Having voted as I have done today, I will redouble my efforts towards a just political solution, as soon as possible, to the problem of the Bene? decrees and, in particular, of the Immunity Act, No. 115 of 8 May 1946.
.
(DE) Despite my serious misgivings, I voted to approve the reports on the applications by Cyprus, Malta, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
My misgivings have nothing to do with these countries, but with the fact that the Treaty of Nice has not made the European Union sufficiently capable of enlargement.
As we do not yet know the outcome of the Convention or of the Treaty amendment resulting from it, any decision on enlargement is basically premature.
I abstained from the vote on the Republic of Poland, as this country is currently playing an active part in a war that is contrary to international law.
. (FR) Our opposition to the Brok report is consistent with our opposition to how the whole enlargement process has been conducted.
We have always been strong advocates of the reunification of Europe.
We have always tried to reverse the unnatural division imposed at Yalta. We have done all in our power to enable Europe to regain the use of both its lungs.
Unfortunately, the European Union began by missing an historic opportunity. The countries of Eastern and Central Europe should have been offered the opportunity of acceding to the intergovernmental part of the treaties immediately after their liberation.
Following this formal event, each state should have been allowed to opt for accession to one or other of the common policies. Appropriate timetables should have been devised to take account of local conditions.
It could have been possible to eliminate corruption and avoid social upheavals.
None of this happened.
Instead, after endless negotiations conducted by the Commission in its usual bureaucratic style, the same straitjacket and timetable were imposed on all. Borders and protection are to be done away with in one fell swoop, and a multiplicity of safeguard clauses appended to the treaties.
The European Union will therefore have achieved something quite special. It will have contrived to replace delight in the renewal of old acquaintances with generalised concern.
It would be irresponsible not to acknowledge that this delayed and uniform enlargement is now perceived as a threat rather than an opportunity by many in both East and West.
. (NL) The European Parliament has today voted for the accession of ten new Member States to the European Union.
This does not mean our work is done of course.
There is still much to be done in the accession countries, including the development of a properly functioning administrative and legal organisation and the combating of corruption.
Monitoring too must be taken seriously.
I regret that we, who for many years have been helping to prepare and encourage enlargement, have not revised our competence and decision-making mechanisms to make ourselves efficient and effective, both within the European Union and in the area of common foreign and security policy.
I regret that in Nice we missed the opportunity to implement this treaty change.
And yet I voted in favour.
The political scope we had in 1994 to put the Council under pressure with the European Parliament and to demand deepening of the European Union prior to its enlargement no longer exists.
This enlargement, which is of a different order, is again essentially a matter of the basic principles of the European project: political stability, peace and prosperity.
The accession countries and their populations have been preparing for this day for many years, in difficult conditions and with many sacrifices.
These efforts and the prospect of accession have brought stability and peace in Europe.
We must not upset this result today.
After all, political stability, peace and security create the conditions for all other policy objectives.
The consultation regarding the review of the Treaty is under way and it is in good hands.
Our hope lies in the Convention.
Since I have confidence in it, I am also expecting much of the next IGC and I can today vote for it ten times with conviction.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) I support the accession of the ten candidate countries today, in spite of the fact that some of them do not yet fully meet all the criteria.
Careful external control will have to be exercised on all these points.
This strict control must remain because we have a mutual interest in it.
I have to say in this regard that it would have been better if a European referendum had been laid down at the start of the process.
But it is too late for that now - you cannot move the goalposts during the game.
I also very much regret that countries such as Poland - without proper European consultation - are taking part in the war in Iraq.
But I regret it too in the case of the United Kingdom.
I am in favour of a common European foreign policy.
That is the only way to ensure that Europe does not become a permanent victim of the crisis in Iraq.
We also lack a democratic and powerful government for Europe.
Our bodywork is unfortunately not yet 2004-proof.
That is the great challenge for the European Convention in 2004.
My final important point is the reform of agricultural policy.
The present policy of product subsidies is outdated.
Yet I vote for enlargement today because citizens in candidate countries cannot fall victim to our negligence.
We voted for assent to the Accession Treaty for 10 new Member States to the European Union.
There could be no question of casting doubt over enlargement today, which was what really was at stake in the vote. Old Europe and new Europe will disappear in 2004.
They will be replaced by a Union covering its rightful territory at last. I understand this to be the whole of our continent.
This vote did indeed take place against the backdrop of a tense international situation. It should not, however, cast doubt over enlargement.
Today, we reaffirm our confidence in the ability of the candidate countries to come back into the European family. The current tension in diplomatic spheres apart, we also recognise the tremendous political, economic and social efforts they have made.
There is concern in some quarters that the Europe of the 25 is likely to begin operating in a context of institutional uncertainty. The future European Constitution may well not be in force on 1 May 2004.
There was a case for delaying today's votes, given that the work of the Convention is proceeding so slowly.
It does not, however, seem fair to make the candidate countries bear the consequences of our inability to take decisions and reform the European institutions.
We certainly do not think it is fair to do so. Confirming enlargement on the date planned makes it incumbent on us to keep to the timetable for institutional reform.
This is the strong political message the House is sending out to the Member States. The message also has the advantage of being positive.
As explained in my speech to the plenary I support the enlargement process and wish to see the applicant countries as part of the EU.
But the inclusion of Annex XV in the Accession Treaty means that voting for enlargement endorses its inclusion.
That I cannot do.
I consider Annex XV to be a direct infringement of Parliament's rights.
The worst part of Annex XV is that it enshrines in the Treaty the Agriculture ceiling from 2007 to 2013: the outcome of a shabby deal that was cobbled together by President Chirac and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der, that was endorsed by the other Member States in Copenhagen and is now to be part of the Treaty.
As chairman of the Committee on Budgets I find that to be an anathema to everything we have fought for.
As someone who wants to see real reform of the CAP I find it to be an unbearable burden and something I just cannot agree with.
This may seem to some to be a minor issue, but for me it is a point of principle that has to be made.
Hence the reason for my abstention on all the final votes.
Mr President, for me, as a German MEP, the reunification of Europe, for which we have voted today, is of comparable significance to the restoration of the unity of my own country.
It is for that reason that I approved today's applications for accession with all my heart, including that of the Czech Republic.
I do, however, profoundly regret the Czech Republic's failure to annul the expulsion decrees and, in particular, the Immunity Act, which is contrary to every principle of law.
I have therefore declared my approval of the accession of the Czech Republic as well in the conviction that, if the Czech Republic becomes a Member State of the European Union, we will be able to represent better and more effectively the interests of the German expellees and of the German minority in the Czech Republic, to whom I feel a sense of obligation.
Mr President, in order to comply with Parliament's Rules of Procedure I am required to present my explanation of vote in instalments.
I shall now give the second of these.
The Copenhagen Council set a limit of EUR 40.8 billion on transfers from the Union to the new members up to 2006.
In 1999 the Berlin Council had allocated 43 billion for the same time period, but for six countries.
It follows that the Union now has less money with which to help more countries.
Try to get your minds round that one!
Furthermore, this budget of EUR 40.8 billion for three years is not quite what it seems. The 10 new Member States will have to contribute to it to the tune of EUR 15 billion.
Mr Kok calculated that net transfers to the new countries will be restricted to about EUR 10 billion per year. That amounts to less than 0.1% of the GDP of the Union.
Such generosity is bound to encourage the new Member States to restate their case again once they have seats on the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have for very many years been an advocate of the enlargement of the European Union coming about by the accession of the Central and Eastern European states - and thus of the Czech Republic.
I have, however, not voted to approve the accession of the Czech Republic, essentially for the following reasons. The first is that the Bene? decrees, on the basis of which, in 1945 and 1946, 3.2 million Germans were expatriated and deprived of their civil rights, are not obsolete.
The second is that the Immunity Act, which is current law in the Czech Republic, is an offence against human rights as understood both in Europe and throughout the world.
Thirdly, the European Union's human rights policy would cease to be credible if we were to accept a current law that exempts from punishment crimes committed against the German and Hungarian civilian population in the aftermath of the War.
This is not about history, but about present-day politics.
This is about the European Union being a community of values in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad that the accession of the Czech Republic has today been approved.
It is unfortunate that my parents could not live to see this event.
My mother died in January.
They were expelled from their home, and lost a very great deal.
My uncle was murdered in a Czech camp in 1946.
Having, however, been brought up in a spirit of tolerance and forgiveness, there is one thing I can tell you, and that is that those who - to some extent justifiably - have voted today against the Czech Republic's accession because of the Bene? decrees, have forgotten the decisive truth that it is peoples who are accepted.
We have to look forward rather than revert to the old politics of revenge; I see it as very, very important to stress that.
In view of how certain members of the CSU have just voted against it, that is, alas, again no doubt attributable to elections in Bavaria, where they want to have air sovereignty over certain beer gardens where expellees gather.
I cannot go along with that.
I find it very regrettable that there are those here who were not big enough to take a forward-looking view of history, but remain imprisoned in their old feelings of desire for revenge.
Mr President, I voted for the report on the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, although a majority would have been obtained in this vote even without my contribution.
I voted for the motion because I hope, expect and pray that, in the next Parliament, elected in 2004, which will include representatives from the Czech Republic, there will also be representatives of the Czech Pensioners' Party, to swell our numbers and make us more effective in protecting pensioners' rights. More would be achieved in this area in Parliament if there were more representatives of the pensioners' parties of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am well aware of the historic significance of today's vote, which is also, though, the most difficult decision I have had to take in my political career to date.
I did not make this decision easy for myself.
I brought myself, after mature consideration, to vote in favour of the Czech Republic's accession, something I did despite my rigorous position on the Bene? issue.
The Immunity Act remains part of Czech law.
It is an unjust law and a stain of dishonour.
There is no place for it - none whatsoever - in a new Europe that takes seriously its affirmation of common values.
It is with great regret that I note that the Czech Government has not, to date, been magnanimous enough to make a gesture.
Despite that, I have voted in favour of the Czech Republic's accession, thus demonstrating a trust that may, for all I know, be misplaced.
I would, though, like to help break the vicious circle of misunderstanding and help break down entrenched positions, and I trust that this positive signal will also meet with a positive response from the Czechs.
Those who reject an outstretched hand have not understood the spirit of the enlarged Europe.
.
(FR) I voted in favour of all the reports concerning the accession of the 10 new Member States. The reunification of Eastern and Western Europe is for us an historical challenge.
It can no longer be delayed.
Minor differences must not be allowed to obstruct it.
Enlargement has already taken too long.
As we suggested, the newly liberated countries of Eastern Europe should have been admitted to a kind of Greater European Confederation back in the early 1990s. This confederation would have been a forum with a variable geometry type of approach.
It would have allowed specific types of cooperation to be developed to suit each country.
This approach would have required a U-turn in the process of European integration however, to bring in flexibility. The Commission expressed its opposition.
It found ways of imposing a different approach. The Eastern countries were forced to wait until the superstate was ready before being allowed in.
We wish to reiterate that this is the wrong approach.
It has embittered the candidate countries and has failed to enable them to reach a good standard.
Nonetheless, we need to say 'yes' now, in the hope that these countries will help us to change the Union from the inside.
I am voting against, but not against the Czech Republic itself. Rather, I am voting against the circumstances in which this enlargement is set to take place, as I made clear in my explanation of vote on the Brok report.
I have allowed myself a couple of exceptions, however. One is to vote in favour of Cyprus for two reasons.
Firstly, not to hinder in any way a peace process all Europe hopes will be successful. Secondly, because the economic impact of this accession on decision-making procedures will only be slight.
My other exception involves abstaining on the accession of Poland. There has always been a role for Poland to play in the building of Europe, but others have prevented her from developing it to the full from the outset.
.
(DE) The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance, but whether the Czech Republic is founded upon the European order is a matter of doubt.
Czech Prime Ministers have described the post-World War expulsions as 'just' and 'necessary', and have even held them up as examples in present-day conflicts.
This must be set against the statement in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to the effect that 'collective expulsions are prohibited.'
It was for that reason that Parliament's resolution adopted on 20 November 2002 stated, under heading O, that 'ethnically-fixated policies leading to collective expulsions and the destruction of cultural goods are a flagrant breach of fundamental human rights and the common European legal culture'.
This is an unambiguous verdict.
It is not aimed at exacting restitution of any kind, but makes it clear that Czech positions such as those referred to are an offence against the most fundamental principles of law, which the EU exists to maintain.
Although we note with satisfaction President Klaus' statement that the 'events full of violence and human tragedies', which had also befallen the Bohemian Germans, were 'unacceptable acts from today's point of view', nothing comparable has been said by the Czech Government, or by its parliament, or by groups or parties in it.
They have therefore failed to dispel the doubts as to whether the Czech Republic has its roots in the ground of European legal culture.
This means that not all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU have been complied with, so that we are unable to vote in favour of it doing so.
.
(DE) I voted to approve the Accession Treaties only under protest and out of solidarity with my future colleagues.
Despite the Commission's warnings and reproaches during the course of the negotiations, the Council has insisted on committing what is without doubt a breach of the law.
The Council's controversial retention of Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and consequent wholly unilateral alteration of the 2004-2006 financial framework amounts to a breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament and the Council.
By doing this, it has trodden Parliament's budgetary rights underfoot.
At the same time, it has forced upon Parliament the choice between fighting for its rights and approving the enlargement treaties.
Such behaviour by the Council puts an end to our loyal cooperation with it.
.
(DE) I approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, even though its accession leaves open questions the resolution of which the European Parliament has demanded, in a spirit of reconciliation, for many years.
This is particularly true of what is termed the Immunity Act, No. 115 of 8 May 1946.
Any justification that this decree has for its existence will become more speedily and more lastingly obsolete in the EU's common system of law than it would in the event of this application for accession being refused.
.
(DE) I approve the accession of the Czech Republic because I take the view that the reunification of Europe and thus also the return of the Czechs to the European family must not be halted by the irresponsibility of those Czech politicians who have still not yet grasped how a modern state functions under the rule of law.
It is to be hoped that the lasting injustice of certain of the Bene? decrees continuing in existence will be able to be done away with more speedily within the EU than if we refuse to admit the Czech Republic to it.
.
(DE) I abstained when the vote was taken on the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU.
What was decisive in my doing so was the fact that the government in Prague does not think it necessary to distance itself from the decrees of the one-time President Bene?, which declared to be lawful the gravest offences - including murder - committed against Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in the course of their being expelled.
It is not acceptable that the Czech parliament, in April 2002, should affirm that this sort of expulsion was 'unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable'.
An essential part of my work in the European Parliament has to do with ensuring that human rights are secured, the rule of law defended and minorities protected.
These principles are among the Copenhagen criteria, which have to be met by all states desirous of joining the EU.
It is compliance with these conditions - not only with those of the acquis communautaire - on which their ability to accede depends.
As the Czechs have not met these conditions, a no vote on my part, directed at the actions of those who hold political responsibility in their country, would be absolutely justified.
As, though, we are not voting on governments, but on states and their peoples, I abstained today.
I hope that the citizens of the Czech Republic will, after their country's accession, gain a deeper understanding of the community of values and laws that is the EU.
.
(DE) I approve the accession of the Czech Republic because I take the view that the reunification of Europe and thus also the return of the Czechs to the European family must not be halted by the irresponsibility of those Czech politicians who have still not yet grasped how a modern state functions under the rule of law.
It is to be hoped that the lasting injustice of certain of the Bene? decrees continuing in existence will be able to be done away with more speedily within the EU than if we refuse to admit the Czech Republic to it.
.
(DE) I have abstained from voting on the accession of the Czech Republic.
I am of the opinion that the country has not yet fulfilled all the conditions required for it to be able to accede to the EU.
The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance.
It is founded upon a common system of law and upon reconciliation between Europe's peoples.
It is a matter of great regret to me that the Czech Government has not, as yet, changed its stance on the expulsions and continued to affirm them, in the parliamentary resolution of 24 April 2002, as being 'unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable'.
This makes it all the more welcome that the Czech President, Vaclav Klaus, should, on 20 March 2003, state that the expulsion of Czechoslovakia's German population, and acts of violence against Germans even after the end of the war, were not acceptable from a present-day point of view.
It should be added that society in both countries has seen many efforts made towards a final reconciliation.
In the meantime, no change to the existing legal position has been either made or announced as a result of the President's statement.
The attitude of the Czech Government and parliament is contrary to the spirit of reconciliation and of respect for human rights and the rule of law, which characterises European integration.
I would like to give voice to my personal hope that the imminent enlargement of the European Union will enable the Czech Government and parliament to reconsider their position, and that the necessary gestures and actions will follow.
.
(DE) Today, I have voted against the Czech Republic's application for accession to the European Union.
It is my conviction that the most important foundation for the unification of the European peoples is the unconditional obligation on the part of all to the principles of a state ruled by law.
It is on this basis alone that a united Europe has a future.
It is this obligation that the Czech Republic is failing to discharge by retaining the decrees of the former Czechoslovak President Bene?, in particular the Immunity Act (Act No 115 of 8 May 1946), which to this day has not been repealed.
The effect of this law is to accord general legitimacy to the gravest crimes and offences committed in the post-War era.
There is no room in the common system of European law for any state that has such laws on its statute book.
A decision in favour of accepting the Czech Republic as a Member State would also create a precedent that could be prayed in aid by potential future applicants.
The creation of a precedent would do lasting and profound damage to the credibility of the European Union.
.
(DE) The reunification of Europe is an historic opportunity, and Czechs and Germans in particular have the prospect of a rich cultural heritage.
I do not regard all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU as having been met, my specific concern being the Bene? decrees, which have survived to the present day.
Despite these misgivings, which for me are considerable, I have voted to approve the Czech Republic's accession.
The young people of Europe share in but one common future - Europe!
This is an opportunity that I do not want to deny to the young generation in the Czech Republic.
Mr President, I shall now present the third part of my explanation of vote.
According to the Kok report, the cost of enlargement could increase from 0.03% of the Union's GDP in 2003 to 0.23% in 2013. That would still be very little.
It should be borne in mind for example that over the last dozen years or so Germany has been devoting some 3% of its GDP to the new LÃ€nder to facilitate their structural adjustment. The Member States see themselves as net contributors.
They will most certainly not agree to increasing the Union's budget.
In any case, the latter has a fixed ceiling of 1.27% of Community GDP. Consequently any future increase in structural aid to the new countries would have to be at the expense of current Union policies.
Mr President, I voted for the entry into the European Union of the Republic of Estonia because, as the only representative in the European Parliament of the Italian Pensioners' Party, I hope and pray that the next European Parliament will also include a representative of the Estonian Pensioners' Party, who I hope will be able to come to this House and help me to promote respect for the elderly in Europe's future.
.
(DE) I voted to approve the Accession Treaties only under protest and out of solidarity with my future colleagues.
Despite the Commission's warnings and reproaches during the course of the negotiations, the Council has insisted on committing what is without doubt a breach of the law.
The Council's controversial retention of Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and consequent wholly unilateral alteration of the 2004-2006 financial framework amounts to a breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament and the Council.
By doing this, it has trodden Parliament's budgetary rights underfoot.
At the same time, it has forced upon Parliament the choice between fighting for its rights and approving the enlargement treaties.
Such behaviour by the Council puts an end to our loyal cooperation with it.
Mr President, I have reached the fourth part of my explanation of vote.
The Kok report outlines two approaches to reducing the cost of enlargement.
The first of these involves strict application of the rules concerning structural support. This would bring down the cost of enlargement to 0.11% of the Union's GDP.
It is likely that Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece would oppose such a course of action.
The second approach involves reducing direct aid to agricultural income to 85% of its current level. The cost of enlargement would then be 0.10% of the Community's budget.
It would require sacrificing the common agricultural policy, however. There is certainly scope for reform of the latter, but it would be unfortunate if it were practically written out of existence.
In principle, the cost of enlargement has only been set up to 2006. Subsequent years may therefore become a free-for-all as far as the budget is concerned.
The Union's decision-making process will not have been significantly improved, so blocking is only to be expected.
Mr President, it was with great enthusiasm that I voted for the entry into the European Union of the Republic of Cyprus.
As the only representative of the Italian Pensioners' Party elected to this House, I hope and pray that two representatives - in this case - of the Cypriot Pensioners' Party will be elected from the Republic of Cyprus too: one to defend the interests of what I hope will soon be the former Greek Cypriot community and the other from what I hope will soon be the former Turkish Cypriot community.
This will give us more power to defend the interests of the elderly throughout Europe.
Mr President, I would like to put on record some of the reasons why I voted for the Poos report on Cyprus.
I am delighted that Cypriots are being supported in this House.
It is vitally important that their wish to join the European Union should be respected.
I have some reservations about aspects of the European project, but I am absolutely certain that those countries that wish to join should be allowed to join.
Today is an historic day for Cyprus, as well as for the European Union.
For too long Cyprus has been the victim of power politics in Europe.
It has often suffered at the expense of decisions made by larger and more powerful nations.
I know that accession to the European Union is seen by many Cypriots as a path to security and stability and will lead to a situation where Cyprus is at the heart of decision-making in Europe, with a seat at the top table of European decision-makers.
I hope that the next few weeks will see the finalisation of the accession of Cyprus and that we will see this small island, which was once a victim in European politics, becoming an equal, respected and influential voice in shaping the future of our shared continent.
I am voting in favour of the accession of the Republic of Cyprus.
This is an important moment in the history of Cyprus.
The long-standing fight by all the Greek MEPs and many of their honourable friends has finally ended in success.
Our honourable friend and rapporteur, Mr Poos, has made an important contribution.
In my opinion, it is a good thing that an unworkable American/British plan was not ultimately imposed in a forced manner.
Today a free Republic of Cyprus and member of the European Union is being given the chance to negotiate a fair political solution to the Cyprus question with the occupying force, Turkey, and its local representative, Mr Denktash; a solution that the overwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriots, together with the Greek Cypriots, rightly hope for.
.
(FR) Legally, the Republic of Cyprus is in an impossible situation. This is because Turkey has illegally occupied the north of the island.
The occupation has actually been condemned both by the United Nations and by the European Union.
Nonetheless, I felt it best to vote 'yes' to accession.
A 'no' vote would have penalised the people of Cyprus twice over. Already under Turkish occupation, the people would be rejected also by the Union.
It would have been best to adopt a strong position in dealings with Turkey.
After all, force is what it understands best. It should have been made clear to Turkey that it would lose its status as an associate of the European Union if it did not leave Northern Cyprus immediately.
I very much regret that no such declaration was made in the past and trust it will be made in the future.
Unfortunately, this is not the approach currently adopted by the Union.
The Union is still invoking conciliation.
Furthermore, the accession of Turkey is now on the cards. Financial aid to that country is to be doubled and it has been granted pre-accession status.
In light of these circumstances, we insist all the countries of Europe hold a referendum before opening any future accession negotiations with Turkey. Allow me to emphasise once again that such a referendum must be held in advance of any negotiations.

(DE) I voted to approve the Accession Treaties only under protest and out of solidarity with my future colleagues.
Despite the Commission's warnings and reproaches during the course of the negotiations, the Council has insisted on committing what is without doubt a breach of the law.
The Council's controversial retention of Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and consequent wholly unilateral alteration of the 2004-2006 financial framework amounts to a breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament and the Council.
By doing this, it has trodden Parliament's budgetary rights underfoot.
At the same time, it has forced upon Parliament the choice between fighting for its rights and approving the enlargement treaties.
Such behaviour by the Council puts an end to our loyal cooperation with it.

On 8 April I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen saying that the Cyprus border, which is soon to be an external border of the Union and consequently of the Netherlands too, is sufficiently secure.
We further trust that a solution to the conflict in Cyprus will be found through the EU.
. (FR) We abstained on the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, but this does not mean we hold any grievance against the people of Cyprus.
Rather, we reproach the leaders of the European Union for their irresponsibility.
We have resigned ourselves to admitting a divided country to the European Union. This country has unresolved problems relating to its very existence.
We regret this situation, which is further proof if any were needed of the European Union's inability to demonstrate real political will.
The accession of Cyprus clearly ought to have been dependent on its reunification. Instead of making this a condition of entry, and using the accession of Cyprus as a lever, the European Union contents itself with supposedly deploring the fact that it is opening its doors to a divided country.
The mind boggles!
This is yet another wasted opportunity.
It means that a country under foreign occupation will be allowed to join the European Union. It will give Turkey another way of continuously blackmailing the European Union.
It will fix the de facto external border of the Union at the green line.
The latter is not recognised by the European Union, or by any other country other than Turkey!
Mr President, I will now proceed with the fifth instalment of my speech.
For years the European Union held the belief that we needed a deeper Union before an enlarged Union.
On many occasions the heads of state and government held forth that we needed to adapt the Union's decision-making structures and mechanisms before the current wave of enlargement, or any subsequent enlargement.
This was the objective of the Treaty of Nice, but the treaty failed to make any progress on the issue.
In fact, it made the Council decision-making process more complicated.
We therefore needed the European Convention. This should lead to a new treaty on the foundation of the Union, a European Constitution in other words.
The signing of the Accession Treaties on 16 April will set enlargement in stone before the work on the Convention has been completed.
Enlargement will go ahead when the situation of the institutions is still shrouded in uncertainty. This has been made even worse by the crisis in Iraq, which has shattered our aspirations for a common foreign and security policy.
Mr President, I voted for the entry of Latvia into the European Union.
As the only representative of the Italian Pensioners' Party in this House, I hope and pray that, in the next European Parliament, expanded to include the Republic of Latvia too, among the representatives elected by the Latvians there will be a representative of the Pensioners' Party who, together with the - I hope, numerous - representatives of the pensioners' parties of all the states who will be entering the European Parliament for the first time in 2004, will be able to help to defend the interests of the elderly.

- (NL) Regarding the accession of the ten current candidate countries, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party feels that candidate countries should actually have completed their preparations and that there should be individual country-by-country testing.
On the question of whether all the countries met the criteria, there were doubts, which have been expressed repeatedly by the European Parliament. On 8 April I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen saying that even the countries in which he himself identified the most failings, among them Latvia, will meet the Copenhagen criteria sufficiently at the time of accession.
The warnings from Commissioner Verheugen intended for a number of candidate countries, the decision of the Commission to publish a Comprehensive Monitoring Report six months before accession, the peer review of new and old Member States proposed by the Liberal Group in the area of human rights, corruption, administrative capacity and independent financial control (MalmstrÃ¶m/Maaten amendment), the capability of the Commission to take measures directly for a further number of years against disruption of the internal market (the safeguard clauses) and also the Mulder initiative report on the reform of the approval of agricultural expenditure are therefore of overriding importance.
Now for the sixth instalment of my speech, Mr President.
I am not one of those who want to punish Poland and the other countries that prefer US solidarity to European solidarity.
Every state, every government, has the right to decide whether or not to support Mr Bush's bellicose policy.
It has however become clear that the majority of the countries about to join the Union prefer an alliance with the United States and NATO to closer European integration.
This has delighted British Government representatives to the European Convention.
In an interview with the Times, Peter Hain clearly stated that he is building an alliance with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe against any moves towards the creation of a European superstate.
The United Kingdom and other countries will therefore not hesitate to use their veto at the intergovernmental conference to ratify the conclusions of the Convention.
This veto risks destroying any suggestion of establishing qualified majority decision-making procedures for matters such as the common foreign and security policy, fiscal and budgetary policy, and economic and social policy.
There will be a ban on using the word 'federal'.
It will not be possible to invoke the Charter of Fundamental Rights for legal rulings in favour of an individual citizen.
Mr President, today, 9 April 2003, I voted for the entry of Lithuania into the European Union.
Moreover, I hope that a representative of the Lithuanian Pensioners' Party will join the European Parliament to support me in upholding the rights of all the elderly throughout Europe.

I would now like to make my last point, Mr President.
In view of the confused state of the European institutions I criticised a few moments ago, I believe an enlarged European Union can be no more than a large market.
It will, in fact, become a free trade association, likely to be extended to the other side of the pond.
It is no coincidence that the greatest proponents of this premature enlargement are former members of EFTA.
I do not want to see an enlarged European Union becoming a large market for rich countries, shaped by the consensus of the United States. Therefore Mr President, with a heavy heart, I resigned myself to abstaining on the votes concerning the accession of all the candidate countries.
Nevertheless, I would like to extend a warm welcome to them.
Mr President, I voted for the entry of Hungary into the European Union.
Since there will be at least 200 million pensioners in the enlarged Europe, I hope that, when the Hungarian representatives join the European Parliament, it will be possible to have a number of MEPs which is proportional and proportionate to the number of pensioners in Europe.
I therefore hope that the pensioners of Hungary will send a representative to Parliament too, to help us protect the interests of the elderly throughout Europe more vigorously and more effectively.

.
(DE) I have today voted against the application by the Republic of Malta for accession to the European Union.
The reason for my decision is Malta's persistence in shooting migratory birds.
In the course of accession negotiations, Malta had flatly refused to fully implement the European Union's protection provisions in the form of the EU's bird protection directive, and managed to negotiate a transitional period permitting the Maltese to hunt birds up to the end of 2008.
This arrangement is a license for poachers and for those engaged in the illegal trade in animals.
European jurisprudence strictly prohibits hunting on the high sea, the hunting of songbirds with nets, and the mass shooting of rare songbirds.
These are legal fundamentals that a candidate for accession must acknowledge.
Mr President, voting against the accession of a country for which I have particularly great respect involved a difficult decision, but it was one that I took for myself alone, without attempting to influence my group, nor allowing myself to be influenced by them.

I cannot give my vote to a candidate country that, by providing combatant troops, is participating actively in an illegal, immoral and sordid war in Iraq, thereby not hesitating to break international law, and sharing in the responsibility for the murder of thousands of innocent civilians.
Poland is on the wrong track; its government certainly is, and in that they are not alone.
The Polish people, too, preferred to follow the American Secretary for War rather than the Polish Pope.
The Poles are more proud of their special unit, GROM, than they are of their Catholic bishops, who are campaigning for peace.
In doing so, they are excluding themselves from the community of values that is the EU.
I hope that they will soon come back.
Today, after mature consideration and in complete accord with my conscience, I have voted 'no'.
Mr President, I hope that Poland too - and I voted for its accession - will send a representative of the Polish Pensioners' Party to the next European Parliament, who will stand shoulder to shoulder with me in this House so that I have more power to protect all the elderly throughout Europe.
. (EL) There are two reasons for my symbolic vote against the accession of Poland.
One is the so-called 'ethnical declaration' attached to the Accession Treaties, which covers and legalises the position against abortion.
The second is the participation of Polish soldiers in the war against Iraq, in a show of servile pro-Americanism and highly insolent anti-Europeanism.
I consider that I espouse the hopes and wishes of the proud Polish nation, which will become a member of the European Union as an independent country, bringing to an end the period during which this large, historic country was used as a satellite, now by the USA and previously by Russia and Germany.
- (FR) We agree that Poland and all the other candidate countries should be entitled to join the European Union.
The conditions imposed on Poland however exemplify the inequality of the Accession Treaty.
For example, Poland will not be entitled to the same agricultural subsidies as current Member States, even though a large section of the population works on the land.
The institutions of the European Union however prefer to subsidise their capitalist agricultural systems to ensure profits, rather than helping the poor people of Eastern Europe who work the land to make a living from their work.
Furthermore, Polish workers will have to wait seven years before they can work in the European Union, despite the juggling of the legal aspects of the issue.
The European Union has demanded many sacrifices from the working classes in Poland. It is unacceptable for the Union to be quite prepared to make concessions to the church in Poland.
Not only has the Union agreed to the ban on abortion, so restricting the rights of women, but it has also imposed a pre-emptive ban on any Community legislation to amend Polish legislation on the matter. Consequently, the European Union has left the women of Poland in the grip of a particularly reactionary church!

(DE) I justify my vote against the accession of the Republic of Poland to the European Union at the present time by reference to the fact that Poland is the only one of the candidate countries whose elite troops are playing an active part in the war currently in progress in Iraq, which is contrary to international law.
. (NL) Regarding the accession of the ten current candidate countries, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party feels that candidate countries should actually have completed their preparations and that there should be individual country-by-country testing.

Mr President, considering that a Pensioners' Party - called DeSUS - already exists in Slovenia and is part of that country's coalition government, I hope that it will be able to send a representative to Parliament so that the pensioners not just of Slovenia but of all the states of the new Europe which emerge from the 2004 European Parliament elections, will have a huge number of representatives from the Pensioners' Parties of all these states, including Slovenia, upholding the rights of the elderly.

- (NL) As a member of the delegation for relations with Slovakia, I know the problems of that country in more detail than those of other accession countries.
I see unstable political parties emerge and disappear, a largely collapsed economy with mass unemployment in the east and the refusal of successive governments to rectify wrongs previously committed against members of national minorities.
The new division into provinces takes absolutely no account of the fact that the southern edge of Slovakia is Hungarian speaking and that most people there want to have administration and education in that language.
The villages in the east occupied by a majority of people from the Roma population group are still administered by a Slovakian elite that thinks that street lighting, waterworks and parks are only for themselves.
It may be that many people from Slovakia will choose to seek work in nearby Vienna.
With the arrival of Slovakia the EU is importing the environmental problems of the nuclear power stations and the Danube dam.
Yet accession to the EU is far less controversial in internally divided Slovakia than in the neighbouring countries of Poland and the Czech Republic, where the majority will perhaps shortly vote against in a referendum.
Various groups are expecting improvement as a result of this accession.
As far back as 5-9-2001 I expressed the expectation that they will be disappointed, but I respect their choice.
.
(FR) Yet again, the vote on Parliament's calendar of sessions for 2004 has been exploited by those who are against Strasbourg. They want to reduce Parliamentary sittings in this town.
Yet again, this vote contravenes the Treaty.
The protocol on the seat of the institutions states that 12 monthly plenary sessions are to be held in Strasbourg.
According to precedent, this is reduced to 11 in election years.
Nevertheless, the anti-Strasbourg contingent has gone even further this time, only allowing for 10 sessions.
This stems in part from the absurd action of the Socialists who wanted to cancel the last session in April because they do not want to work on 1 May.
There is an even greater paradox in that the calendar adopted provides for 5 mini-sessions to be held in Brussels in 2004. In theory however, these should not be scheduled unless the agendas of the 12 normal sessions to be held in Strasbourg are full.
We call on the French Government to take this illegal vote to the Court of Justice.
Parliament is not actually a sovereign body.
It only has at its disposal the specific powers conferred by the treaty. It must comply with the latter.
In our view, given the particular significance of 1 May, International Labour Day, there is no question of working on that day.
As for the rest of the calendar, we do not have any strong views and have not adopted any particular position on it.
. (FR) As is our policy, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group will again oppose any attempts to reduce the duration and/or the number of plenary sessions held in Strasbourg.
In recent years, as the number of different lobbies has grown, there have been moves to transfer Parliament from Strasbourg to Brussels permanently. Most importantly, we have seen plenary sessions reduced to four days and an increase in the number of extraordinary sessions held in Brussels.
The treaties state that 12 sessions per year are to be held in Strasbourg.
The UEN group intends to ensure that the letter and the spirit of the treaties are respected.
In election years of course one plenary session held in Strasbourg is normally cancelled.
At the same time however, it is unbelievable that the number of extraordinary sessions remains unchanged.
This is a completely abnormal situation. I therefore proposed that the two additional sessions on the 2004 calendar be cancelled in order to restore the twelfth session held in Strasbourg, in accordance with the relevant legal provisions.
I am sure you will appreciate that this will require everyone to assume their responsibilities. In our opinion, the situation is clear.
Strasbourg should not be relegated to an annex of Brussels. Strasbourg is and must continue to be the seat of the European Parliament.
The outcome of the vote on Parliament's calendar of sessions for 2004, means that only ten plenary sessions will be held in Strasbourg.
The treaties and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice make it clear that the calendar of the European Parliament must include twelve plenary sessions held in Strasbourg every year, before provision is made for any additional plenary mini-sessions in Brussels. In electoral years of course, the number of plenary sessions held in Strasbourg can be reduced to eleven.
It is therefore clear that one Strasbourg session is missing from the calendar adopted for the election year of 2004.
We are also faced with the absurd situation that the House has voted to cancel the plenary session in Strasbourg when we were to have welcomed the elected representatives of the new Member States. The House voted to cancel this session on the very day on which we have approved the Accession Treaties for these countries.
As Parliament's vote must be deemed illegal, the French delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on President Pat Cox to deal with the repercussions of this by immediately annulling the vote.
We call for a Conference of Presidents to be convened as a matter of urgency to arrange for a new vote as soon as possible, in accordance with Community law.
- (DA) We have chosen to vote in favour of the report because we believe it is necessary to guarantee fair treatment of third-country nationals resident lawfully.
We believe as a matter of principle, however, that these rights are best safeguarded by the Member States' national legislative provisions, which are very different from one country to another but which have a democratic basis.
What is more, we are aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area that is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the EC and that does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position.
.
(FR) Although members of Mouvement pour la France and a large section of the right voted against the Cerdeira Morterero report, Parliament adopted it a few moments ago. The report approves the directive on family reunification proposed by the Commission and includes many substantive amendments.
Significantly, these amendments broaden the definition of the family members who can benefit from family reunification, allow individuals to apply for family reunification more quickly and restrict the grounds on which Member States can refuse applications.
In our opinion, the Commission's initial proposal already had many serious shortcomings, relating both to its principles and its provisions.
This vote should send a clear message to the Council.
The Council is of course not obliged to adopt Parliament's amendments, as Parliament is only to be consulted on this matter. If however the Council concedes in principle that there should be European regulations on family reunification, the Council should realise it is starting down a very slippery slope.
It is clear that tomorrow the Commission and its allies will continue to push for this supposed right of the Council to be increased further. They lack a true appreciation of what is in the best interests of Europe.
- (DA) We have chosen to fall in with our group and vote in favour of the draft resolution in Mrs Cerdeira Morterero's report.
We are, however, aware of the fact that the resolution concerns a state of affairs covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the EC and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position.
We are all aware of the disparity between the declarations made at the Tampere Summit and the content of the proposal for a directive before us, which has reached us after more than three years of discussion in Council and two amendments to the Commission's initial proposal.
It was stated that any integration policy should aim at granting immigrant citizens rights and obligations that are comparable with those held by EU citizens.
The text that has been presented takes the opposite direction.
The outcome of divisions within the Council, this proposal is for common standards that are harmonised down towards the lowest common denominator, with a reductive vision of the concept of family and with a number of derogations that leaves some crucial aspects unresolved.
For this very reason, we support the proposals contained in this report, which broaden the concept of the family, guarantee the principle of non-discrimination and prevent the overturning of more favourable legislation.
On our initiative, the report now includes provisions for not adding the examination of applications to the normal workload of administrations and for eliminating the subjective concept of a long-term relationship. It also excludes illness or disability suffered after the issue of the residence permit as grounds for refusing to renew the permit.
By introducing such amendments, the report distances itself in qualitative terms from the initial proposal and therefore deserves our favourable vote.
I would like to congratulate my colleague and fellow member of the Parliament's Anti-Racist Intergroup, Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, for her work on the important and difficult issue of family reunification.
I have voted for this report and support it in line with my past work on immigration matters - particularly my work on secondary immigration issues like the 'primary purpose' marriage rule in the UK.
It is important for Member States to authorise the entry of close relatives - parents, spouses or partners if there are no other means of support.
The transposition of the directive should not lead to a lower level of protection than is currently provided by individual Member States.
. (PT) Immigration is a serious problem, which requires a realistic and responsible response from the Community Institutions.
Abstaining from taking appropriate and balanced measures in this field is precisely the cause of the damaging effects of which all European citizens are aware.
The least that these serious and now universally acknowledged problems require is that we do not make them worse.
In the words of Commissioner AntÃ³nio Vitorino, '...it should be clearly stated that the reception capacity of Europe's cities has limits'.
The issue of immigration cannot, it is true, be addressed by sacrificing the right to family reunification.
This is quite clear to me, because I recognise the importance of this concept.
We can and must, however, only see the right to family reunification in serious terms, without the reason sustaining its existence being compromised.
This is not the approach adopted by the report and the resolution on this Directive, which unreasonably extend this right to personal situations that do not involve family relationships.
This leftist irresponsibility serves only to increase suspicions and resistance to a natural fundamental right.
It is for all of these reasons that I felt obliged to vote against the report.
The explanations of vote are now closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 2.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the report (?5-0111/03) by Mr Morillon on the new European security and defence architecture - priorities and deficiencies.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy began work on this report six months ago. We never imagined back then that we would publish it at such a dramatic and painful time.
We have sought to update the previous report by our fellow Member Catherine LalumiÃšre. This update was necessitated by the events of September 2001 and our desire to make our own contribution to the work undertaken by our colleagues in the Convention.
We may be attempting the impossible in assessing any kind of European security and defence architecture. At present everything leads one to believe that, for the time being at least, such an architecture has totally disintegrated.
My fellow members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy took a different view however. On 25 March, at the height of the crisis, they adopted the report we will vote on tomorrow in plenary.
I think there are at least three reasons for this.
The first is that we have a responsibility towards our electorate.
The second relates to our awareness that, on the eve of enlargement, the present crisis must serve as a lesson for us. The third stems from our desire to clarify the policy on transatlantic cooperation.
We feel Member States want to continue to pursue this policy. Many of us hope that the current differences are not as serious as they might appear at first sight.
