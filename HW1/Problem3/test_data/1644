Many thanks, Commissioner.
We will certainly need energy and patience.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am the rapporteur for the so-called remaining sections of the Budget.
This subject matter will seem somewhat dry after the eloquent presentation delivered by the Chairman of our Committee on Budgets.
I believe that whilst the small budgets may not be quite as fascinating in terms of policy areas, they are not without interest when it comes to the question as to how organisational and staffing resources can be used to guarantee the effectiveness of the institutions of the European Union.
I have a few comments to make on the Council' s first reading in this respect, which I have already submitted to the Committee on Budgets in the form of a discussion paper.
I will start with the European Court of Justice.
The Council has recognised the difficult situation facing the Court in relation to the translations backlog, and has proposed that 47 new posts be created.
At the same time, however, the across-the-board cut was increased from 2.5% to 5.1%, which means that these newly created posts cannot be filled.
I believe this is a contradiction-in-terms which has still to be resolved.
As rapporteur, I will duly prepare proposals to this end.
The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the funding for the freelance translator reserves, which we need so badly in order to clear the backlog, have also been cut.
In other words, for all the Council may have recognised the problem, this is not reflected in the budget in concrete figures.
I have taken a very detailed look at the promotion systems of all the institutions, and I have noticed that the Court of Justice has now followed suit and established a promotion model based on demonstrable merit.
Switching over to a new system at the European Court of Justice will necessitate creating a large number of higher grades, which is something we have no hope of achieving within a year.
However, we must tackle this over the next few years.
This is another issue that the Council failed to take into account at first reading.
Turning now to the European Court of Auditors.
The only question that remains to be answered here, relates to the financing of the Court of Auditor' s new building in Luxembourg.
For reasons that are beyond me, the Council has cut the funding for 2001 from EUR 7 million to EUR 5 million.
During discussions at the Court of Auditors, I was assured that the total cost requirement of EUR 25 million at 1998 prices will not be exceeded.
I therefore think it would be of more benefit to the European tax payer if the payments were to be made once the respective invoices have been received.
I will propose to the Committee on Budgets that we redeploy the Court of Auditors' proposal.
I shall now move on to the Economic and Social Committee.
My guiding principle for the budgetary procedure for 2001 can be summed up by the following new High German expression: value for money.
Needless to say, the same holds true for the Economic and Social Committee.
The ECSC' s working method and public image are extremely dubious.
Hence my proposals are geared towards raising the productivity of the Economic and Social Committee.
In particular, the promotion policy of the Economic and Social Committee requires careful scrutiny.
I hope that, as budgetary authorities, we will be able to put our heads together and come up with ideas that will lend the necessary weight to the ECSC' s endeavours in this field.
We should also reflect on the role of the Secretariat of the Economic and Social Committee.
The ECSC currently derives all its expertise from outside experts.
However, I ask myself whether that should be the aim of such an institution' s work.
That is something else we need to discuss.
The same applies to the Committee of the Regions.
Here too it is my goal, under the 'value for money' maxim, to promote the overall productivity of the committee through a variety of measures.
I am only able to mention one interesting aspect.
The committee has asked for an increase in the funding required to cover the travel and subsistence costs incurred by regional representatives of candidate countries attending plenary sittings as observers.
We have placed part of this money for the financial year 2000 in reserve.
To date, there has been no application for us to release these funds.
At the same time, however, the Committee of the Regions has declared that it has need of more funds for the year 2001.
My response will be to propose that these funds should also be placed in reserve, because the need for funding allocations is evidently by no means as pressing as we are always given to believe during budgetary negotiations.
I only have a very brief comment to make in respect of the Ombudsman.
There is not a great deal to add here.
The Council has grasped the nettle and we support them in this.
I will not submit any further proposals on this matter.
To sum up: overall, we are being very sparing with the European tax payer' s money in performing our role as part of the budgetary authority.
It is imperative that we take the same line for the administrative budget.
There are major tasks in store for us over the next few years.
We are in a position to create financial leeway for 2001, which we will hopefully be able to turn to good account when it comes to dealing with the administrative side of enlargement.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, Commissioner, honourable members, as the last person to speak on this agenda item, all I can do of course is make a few points and reiterate a few things that have already been said.
But as you are all yourselves aware, repetition is the only way to learn.
First of all, I would like to thank the Council for the constructive cooperation it has provided throughout the year' s trialogues and in all the conciliation meetings.
However, it is not just the current Council Presidency that I should like to thank, but also the previous one, the Portuguese Presidency, for creating a thoroughly cordial atmosphere despite all the differences of opinion.
I shall therefore deliver the good news first: compared with this year' s budget, both the Commission and the Council - albeit only temporarily - have proposed a total reduction of EUR 144 million in the budgetary lines for employment.
But Parliament has already made it clear in its guidelines that the issue of job creation is very close to our hearts, and that one of our first priorities in internal policy is to fight unemployment in Europe.
This is our determined aim, our goal, and we gave renewed expression to it in our resolution of July.
We have always found the Council ready to listen, both under the Portuguese and now under the French Presidency.
Accordingly, not only did the Council declare, in the course of the conciliation procedure, that it was willing to support our job creation initiative through suitable instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises, we have also agreed to come to an understanding, in the course of the budgetary procedure, on an amount within the meaning of number 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, which we intend to use to achieve our goal.
So far, so good.
So what exactly are the problematic areas?
Where do Parliament and the Council differ?
In view of the limited amount of time available to us all, allow me to mention just two.
Firstly there is the manner in which the Council seeks to finance those policies where there is fundamental agreement.
As Parliament made clear last year, we believe it is necessary to undertake a multiannual revision of Category 4 in order to meet the requirements for reconstruction aid in the Balkans in a stable and secure manner.
The Council flatly refuses to countenance such a revision of the Financial Perspective.
It obviously prefers a hand-to-mouth existence.
No revision!
That is the name of the game.
The Council has obviously made this its guiding principle, for how else are we to interpret the fact that it persists in refusing to commit the funds for the pre-accession countries Cyprus and Malta to Chapter 7 of the pre-accession strategy?
After all, that is where they belong logically, and in terms of content.
But the Council does not want there to be a revision, even if it is not bound up with a financial amendment.
As a Parliament, we now have an extremely difficult decision before us with respect to Category 4.
The second major bone of contention is the Council' s tendency to focus time and again, in the course of its budgetary readings, on payment appropriations alone.
The Commissioner made the same point.
I cannot say whether it is because of our institutional view, or whether it also says something about our personally held views, that we both majored on this in our criticism.
The Council' s declared aim was an increase in expenditure for 2001 of only 3.5% in comparison with the figures for the current budget.
The outcome is a draft budget in which the ratio of commitments to payments is no longer sound.
For example, on closer inspection, it is possible to discern that the commitments for 2001 are not matched with adequate payment appropriations.
In category 2, for example, the commitments are covered to a mere 2.1%.
In categories 3, 4 and 7 the situation looks better, but still not good.
In many lines of the draft budget, the payments do not even cover a quarter of the commitments.
In quite a few lines, no payments whatsoever have been earmarked for the commitments for 2001.
This no longer has a great deal to do with serious budgetary management.
I need hardly emphasise again that the Interinstitutional Agreement - which, incidentally, we concluded only 1ÂŒ years ago - sets out as a matter of course, at various points, that there should be an orderly working out of the European Union' s expenditure, which should be regarded as being closely linked with the working out of the commitments.
In fact it means that a strict relationship should be preserved between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations.
The Council is neglecting this close relationship in the most criminal way.
Its aim is to reduce expenditure.
It argues that, at the end of the day, the Member States have to put their national budgets in order too.
That is all well and good, but it must not be allowed to bring our own common European budget into disorder from the very outset.
Aids
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Aids.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, I shall indeed try to do as you say and talk about Aids.
Well, as you know, the Aids pandemic currently affects 33.6 million people, the majority of them living in developing countries.
According to UNAIDS, 5.6 million new cases and 2.6 million deaths were notified in 1999, including 50% women.
The epidemic has already wiped out the achievements of thirty years of development aid in the most affected countries.
The most tragic consequences are in Africa.
The African continent finally had the professionals and experts it so lacked at the time of independence.
Now the disease has taken a heavy toll among those trained adults of working age.
We cannot ignore the immense loss of human investment this first generation of victims represents, a loss which goes beyond the personal tragedy suffered by the sick and their families.
Nor do we forget the poorest and most destitute who are still deprived of treatment.
No one can forget the testimony of Judge Edwin Cameron, a white, homosexual, HIV positive man on the bench of the South African High Court. He courageously came forward at the opening of the plenary session of the International AIDS Conference in Durban last July.
Only his social standing and income give him access to the treatment which is unfortunately inaccessible to the majority of his compatriots.
His testimony illustrates African injustice.
For around a decade, Africa has committed itself courageously to a difficult process of reform and structural adjustment.
But the epidemic is putting a heavy burden on the care system, making the modernisation of the health sector even more difficult.
Just when attempts are being made to establish methods of funding to guarantee better, more permanent services, the monstrous burden of AIDS falls on communities already assailed by the economic crisis, underdevelopment, an inadequate health structure and the lack of a social security system.
So the issue of HIV-AIDS lies at the very heart of sustainable development.
Aids decimates societies, threatens future generations and compromises economic growth.
The members of the UN Security Council now regard the issue as an absolute priority.
Beyond Africa, the pandemic is global.
Thirty-five million people live with the virus, but fewer than 500 000 have access to antiretroviral treatments.
It has to be recognised that, even here, there is a deep gulf between rich and poor.
Inequality of opportunity in terms of access to treatment, intolerable in itself, is all the more repugnant today because information circulates, and circulates fast, on this planet.
Today everyone knows these treatments exist.
Humanely, morally and politically it is not only desirable but crucial to seek solutions jointly with developing countries, which are suited to their situation, take account of their potential, and help them improve accessibility to these treatments, while pursuing cooperation in the areas of education, health, prevention, and the training of local medical staff.
The European Union has been aware since the beginning of the 1980s, of the need to give the developing countries practical assistance in the fight against HIV-AIDS, putting respect for the people affected, in particular the most vulnerable, at the centre of its concerns.
Hence it has participated in implementing actions in the areas of transfusion safety, information campaigns, raising young people' s awareness, creation of documentation and information centres, as well as training and medical and social security benefits.
Some countries, France in particular, are also involved in initiatives to facilitate access to treatment.
The International Therapeutic Solidarity Fund has obtained encouraging initial results for the two access to medication programmes started in 1999 in Ivory Coast and Morocco.
New programmes are now being launched in Senegal, Vietnam and South Africa.
Even though these only affect a few individuals out of the millions of people in need, we feel sure they are contributing to international mobilisation and bringing in their wake the benefits of partnership and shared know-how.
Their effects are already apparent in the mother-child prevention programmes set up by UNAIDS and UNICEF.
So the international context is evolving.
The United Nations, its agencies and the World Bank are mobilising to strengthen international therapeutic solidarity.
An important, even historic, agreement has been concluded between WHO, UNAIDS and five pharmaceutical companies.
It means the price of medication used to treat Aids can be reduced.
Similarly, the recent decision to make nevirapine, an antiretroviral molecule effective in the prevention of mother-child transmission, freely available adds credibility to that agreement, because it proves that this is not just an announcement, and the pharmaceutical industry really can take practical action.
Finally, many countries are recognising that the indebtedness of developing countries is an intolerable burden on their economies and acts as a brake on their capacity to combat poverty effectively, let alone the pandemic.
France has taken specific steps to cancel that debt, while encouraging development and health education.
Such initiatives show that the mobilisation of the international community is strengthening, and it must not slacken.
But this is just a first stage in the struggle against the Aids pandemic.
At the international congress last July in Durban, on African territory, researchers, health professionals, non-governmental organisation campaigners and political leaders, were all unanimous in emphasising the urgency of the situation.
Contact with helpless health professionals, the resigned distress of mothers who have infected their own children, the powerlessness of the health authorities to act, visiting a paediatric hospital - all that further convinced me of the extent of the gulf between the inhabitants of the countries of the South and their fellow human beings who chanced to be born in our own countries.
New commitment is necessary.
We are convinced of that.
International aid must be strengthened urgently in the fight against HIV-AIDS.
Coordination of all resources at all levels remains one of the top priorities for international aid within the framework of the strategies defined at international level, in partnership with national Aids programmes and other donors.
We must urgently strengthen prevention programmes, improve the research effort geared to developing countries and give all patients real access to treatment.
Besides making antiretroviral medication available at reasonable prices to local health systems, access to treatment implies strengthening training actions, structural aid and support to patients' associations.
Admittedly, mother-child transmission prevention programmes remain essential, but there is still a need for massive implementation of projects to provide access to treatment for chronic infection, because who is going to raise these children after we have saved them from infection?
Access to medication poses complex ethical, medical and socio-economic problems, even political and cultural problems, which we must try to overcome by respecting the people we are dealing with and regarding them as partners to cooperate with.
Major cooperation must be established between donors, recipients, the pharmaceutical industry and associations to provide the operational systems for access to treatment.
Several initiatives have been launched.
First, a Commission round table will be held in September on Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.
A Japanese conference will also be held in the context of the G8 this autumn on these three diseases.
Finally, there is a proposal for a United Nations General Assembly Special Session to be devoted to Aids before May 2002.
The presidency will support these initiatives to find lasting solutions to the problem of global and respectful responsibility for people suffering from the disease, by means of practical projects and partnership agreements with the countries concerned.
Guaranteeing access to quality treatment, information and the necessary resources for all must be the aim of the European Community.
Consideration of access to treatment is not new.
The road is hard, but it must be travelled.
We cannot succeed without everyone' s participation: the pharmaceutical industry, the bilateral and multilateral donors, and the countries involved.
We know now that the epidemic can only be overcome through long-term commitment.
That commitment is all the more necessary because it would not be just immoral and dangerous for development and the progress of humanity, it would threaten world peace and equilibrium if recent advances, especially in treatment, were just to benefit the richest countries.
The Commission attended the 13th International Aids Conference, which took place in Durban, South Africa, from 7 to14 July 2000.
The theme of the conference, 'Breaking the Silence', provided a framework which helped to strengthen national and international action against HIV/Aids.
The conference welcomed scientific progress in addressing Aids, especially news of the first efficacy trials for an Aids vaccine and the evidence that transmission of HIV from mother to infant could be largely prevented by cost-effective use of anti-retroviral drugs.
Also welcome was information on the many small-scale condom and safe sex empowerment education programmes that have proved their worth in stemming the spread of HIV/Aids.
I believe that the conference could have given more attention to the lessons of success stories as regards improving and expanding these prevention strategies because information and prevention is in fact the most important ways of fighting Aids.
Prevention is central to a successful long-term national, international and global response to Aids.
At the same time a full spectrum of care from basic treatment of opportunistic infections to entry retroviral therapy for HIV infection can no longer be denied to the vast majority of the millions of people infected with the virus.
The Commission welcomes the new initiatives being taken against HIV/Aids by some countries to produce cheaper generic drugs and would like to offer its support to help such countries provide technical assistance to other developing countries to enable them to pursue such initiatives.
Possibilities will be further discussed with the countries involved.
We recognise that the production of generic drugs could greatly improve access to care and treatment for HIV/Aids.
The statistics of the epidemic are frightening and still getting worse.
For example, one in four Zimbabweans will die from HIV/Aids, including one in three in the capital, Harare.
More than a million children are already orphaned by HIV/Aids in Zimbabwe, almost 10% of the population.
More than half the pregnant women in some areas in Botswana are infected with HIV, and a third of them transmit HIV to their new-born babies during delivery.
The conference opened up exciting new opportunities and partnerships that will enable people who are vulnerable to HIV infection to gain access to technologies and procedures to make care more affordable for HIV/Aids sufferers and invest in new technologies and products to prevent and treat HIV/Aids.
These opportunities must be exploited immediately, and the Commission intends to play its part.
It is accordingly discussing innovative approaches with its developing country partners as well as with other donors.
We can and must be doing all that we should do about HIV/Aids.
We can and must also do everything possible to combat other major killer diseases affecting poor people.
Malaria and tuberculosis, both of which kill more than a million people a year, must assume new importance in our work to reduce poverty and ill-health.
Accelerated action on the three key communicable diseases - HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis - has been addressed this year by a number of high-level meetings.
The Commission will shortly submit a communication to the Council and Parliament outlining proposals for accelerated action to improve access to proven key measures and commodities to develop active and effective delivery structures and systems for drugs and increase investment in research into and development of priority drugs and vaccines.
The communication points especially to the value of bringing condoms, bed nets and other preventive procedures to the poorest and most vulnerable more rapidly and on a sufficiently large scale.
The European Union accounted for 55% of global development aid in the social sectors in 1997 and has increased its support for health, Aids and population programmes from 1% of our total assistance in 1986 to over 8% at the present time, compared to an OECD average of 5.5%.
We are therefore focusing more and more on this field.
Total commitments of EUR 3.4 billion were earmarked for health, Aids and population between 1990 and 1998, none of which was offered as loans.
This is in clear contrast to the recent offer from the United States to southern Africa.
The Commission is holding wide-ranging consultations on options for accelerated national and international action and innovative approaches to address these diseases.
On 28 September, in collaboration with the WHO and UN Aids, it will be hosting an international round table.
The meeting will consider how a comprehensive approach at national and international level might tackle these three diseases and how we can make a difference.
Madam President, I should like to express my thanks to the President of the Council and Commissioner Nielson for the statement they gave today with regard to the huge issue of Aids, especially in Africa.
When, in the early 80s, the full extent of the problem of Aids became clear, the Western world adopted a large number of policies in order to curb the illness and provide sound treatment to those who had contracted the disease.
A great deal of consideration was also given to prevention and consequently, in most Western countries, the illness failed to develop into the pandemic which was predicted in the 80s.
Each Aids victim, in Europe too, is one too many, but thank God there are not as many as was feared twenty years ago and survival rates have gradually increased.
How different is the situation in many Third World countries, especially in Africa!
There the tragedy has now exceeded everyone' s expectations.
Out of the 18 million casualties this illness has claimed worldwide, the majority lived in sub-Saharan Africa, where the average life-span has fallen to under 50 years and will fall still further to 45 years.
Millions of African children are already having to go through life without parents, millions of families have broken up, millions of children and elderly people are having to manage without the support and care of an ever dwindling part of the generation in between.
And this is only the humanitarian tragedy.
Then there is the socio-economic tragedy.
Economic development is faced with more and more difficulties, investments are not being made because staffing levels are insufficient, schools are losing their teachers and hospitals can no longer cope with the problems.
In fact, we have to conclude that much of what has been achieved over the past 25 or 30 years in terms of development has been cancelled out by the Aids tragedy, and this is something which should alarm us all the more as the largest provider of aid to Africa.
What could Europe, the Commission, the European Union do to help Africa?
I believe it is not helpful to try to copy European policy in Africa.
The situation in many African countries does not lend itself to European solutions.
Instead, we should start with a few positive examples, such that those in Uganda and Senegal, where there are opportunities to stabilise the extent of the illness to some degree.
And in our opinion, three key concepts apply: information and prevention, affordable treatment, and care of those left behind.
Information and prevention are essential, and the use of condoms is extremely important in this context.
As far as treatment is concerned, I believe it is important for the pharmaceutical industry to find affordable alternatives to the medication which is of some help in our Western countries, also where transmission of the illness from mother to child is concerned.
And as for the care for those left behind, I would draw your attention to the many orphans this illness has already created.
Finally, the Commission has announced that it will produce a memorandum to solve the problems but, to my mind, we have done too little so far, and the unit which is responsible for this care is too small.
I therefore hope with all my heart that the memorandum which Commissioner Nielson has announced will offer us a new perspective, with more people at the European Commission who are prepared to tackle this issue, with more coordination at European level and, more than anything, with more funding, because that is what is needed to help Africa leave this misery behind.
Madam President, in my view an important step was taken at the Durban International Aids Conference: although prevention also remains essential for combating this plague, the issue of access to treatment was finally placed at the heart of the debate.
Durban made it possible to approach the essential issues - the price of medication and the development of generic medication - frankly, and move forward in our thinking about intellectual property rights and compulsory licences.
It was about time. The conduct of the big drug companies has too often contributed to imposing a two-speed treatment system: medication for the rich and despair for the poor.
That is why the initiative from the pharmaceutical laboratories on the price of medication, launched on the fringe of the conference, constitutes an encouraging beginning, as long as it was not just announced for effect.
The G8 Summit at Okinawa has also made it possible to set the seal on the commitment of the rich countries and set targets to lessen the ravages of Aids in Africa over the next ten years, but, unfortunately, the issue of resources was not really dealt with.
This very day a meeting should be taking place in New York, under the auspices of UNDP, between public and private operators to sign up to and finance the Aids action plan for South Africa.
There really is a feeling that people are finally beginning to ask the right questions.
Now perhaps the right answers should be provided.
Obviously the European Union is not standing on the sidelines of this mobilisation but I think we should step up a gear, and I heard the French Presidency express that hope.
We eagerly await the Commission' s communication, with guidelines and proposals for combating the major transmissible diseases: Aids of course, but also malaria and tuberculosis.
Aware that the time has come not just for reflection but for action too, we expect really concrete proposals permitting very rapid progress.
I am thinking, in particular, of the debates on industrial property rights and compulsory licences.
I am thinking of the development of the International Therapeutic Solidarity Fund launched to raise international funds to give poor countries access to the new therapies, which must expand.
I am thinking of the organisation of an international conference involving poor countries, the pharmaceutical industries, the NGOs and the donors.
Perhaps the round table of 28 September, organised by the Commission, in liaison with WHO and UNAIDS could be the first stage in setting that up?
Madam President, I am not going to repeat what has already been said, and said very well, and with very laudable intentions.
Rather, I am going to try to talk about facts.
I think the facts, today, are simple.
The facts are access to treatment and patient care.
UNAIDS itself acknowledges the ineffectiveness of the programme announced by the pharmaceutical laboratories, which were only trying to improve their image, in fact, and are now withdrawing when it comes to genuine negotiation of a reduction in the price of treatment.
The issue is no longer donations of medication, necessarily limited in time and subject to the selective interests of the laboratories, but adapting treatment price to purchasing power in the developing countries.
The European Union must urge the pharmaceutical multinationals to grant voluntary licences, a first step towards access to treatment for the deprived populations.
If that is not done, the European Union should impose respect for the agreements in case of medical emergency, and require the granting of compulsory licences, which would finally mitigate the problem of the price of treatment.
I think the agony of a whole continent takes precedence over special interests.
Madam President, I agree with Mrs Carlotti that the merit of the Durban conference was to make it clear that Aids is not being fought in the same way in Europe and in Africa.
Aids lays bare all the economic and social deficiencies of developing countries and grafts itself onto the more general problem of destitution.
Prevention cannot succeed unless it is accompanied by access to treatment.
So, and here I agree with the previous speaker, the pharmaceutical companies with the monopoly of manufacture and marketing of triple therapy and even AZT charge a high price for them.
We would not be having this debate if triple therapy cost a dollar.
And as the director of UNAIDS recognises, we need to increase the amount currently invested tenfold even to make a start on a real policy of prevention and social security.
Besides, medication cannot be distributed like sacks of rice.
Doctors, dispensaries and social support structures are needed.
And, by IMF dictate, poor countries are cutting public expenditure, in particular on education and health.
The European Union must contribute towards the rapid cancellation of the debt of African countries, which costs them 15 billion annually, so that those resources can be allocated to establishing the health infrastructure and new social programmes.
Finally, the research priority must be to perfect a vaccine.
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List.
I have taken note of the words of the Council representative to the effect that France will allocate part of the African countries' debt to the fight against Aids.
This is a major initiative which we hope will be echoed by all the countries of the Union and countries outside the Union as well.
We call upon the Union to make a contribution as well so that more funds are invested in the fight against Aids in Africa, where 95% of deaths caused by the HIV virus occur.
It is true that we currently spend USD 300 million per year on Africa, but, at the same time, Africa has a debt of USD 15 billion owed to the industrialised countries.
I would like to end by drawing attention to the great pervading silence and condemning it: I refer to the campaigns which aim to deter people from using condoms on religious grounds.
They are requesting people not to use condoms in the name of life, but that is to condemn the children to certain death.
Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to express my distress at the outcome of the 13th Aids Conference in Durban, South Africa, which is at the very least alarming, and my deep concern for the future of the developing countries, particularly the African countries.
This new resolution supplements the resolutions tabled last year in Lusaka, Zambia.
However, sadly, the situation is tragic and has shown no improvement at all recently. On the contrary, it is assuming huge proportions if we consider that, in Africa, five people die of Aids every minute.
The statistics presented by the experts are tragic, including the substantial population decline and the dramatic decrease in life expectancy in Africa, which will fall below the age of 45 by the year 2015. In the sub-Saharan area, as many as 10% of the population will be affected by the virus.
I therefore feel that there is a need for the Commission and the Member States of the Union to make an ad hoc intervention, in consideration of the European Union's major responsibility precisely towards developing countries.
Indeed, I would argue that we should relate the cancellation of the external debt of the poor countries to the fight against the Aids epidemic, and it is precisely with a view to this that we support the request of the specific programme Debt for Aids contained in the resolution.
The Cairo EU-Africa Summit on debt cancellation procedures and the Durban Conference are, in fact, closely related.
The grievous impact of Aids on economic growth and the close relationship between the fight against poverty and the fight against Aids requires coordination and closer and more effective cooperation between the WHO, the World Bank and the United Nations, with the involvement of the civil society of the countries concerned, the local Churches and the non-governmental organisations.
Madam President, despite significant scientific progress in treating Aids, the Aids epidemic is still ravaging more and more poor countries, thereby compounding problems in dealing with its multiple and serious consequences.
There is no doubt that preventive measures and treatment over recent years have considerably improved patients' chances of survival in developed countries; however, the same cannot be said of poor countries.
The spread of the disease has exceeded every worst-case scenario, especially in Africa; as has already been mentioned, five people a minute die from Aids, which has now reached the point at which it is a threat to public health.
Every day, children infected with this virus are born in these countries due to a complete lack of suitable programmes for mothers-to-be.
Similarly, the cost of treatment is so high that few patients receive this, their rudimentary right.
In this context, I think that the proposed reduction in the price of drugs for the victims of Aids in these countries is extremely important and I should like to urge the Commission and the Council to support this endeavour by exerting pressure on pharmaceutical companies.
Similarly, a concerted effort must be made to develop integrated educational, preventive, treatment and welfare programmes for developing countries, at least until the vaccine is safe to use, which is what we are all hoping for.
Until then, prevention and therapy are the most important factors in controlling the spread and dealing with the disease and these are services which all citizens should receive, irrespective of where they live.
Madam President, everyone in this debate has emphasised the importance of preventive measures.
As we know, there is an old saying, prevention is better than cure.
With the approximately 15 years' experience we have had of this epidemic - I myself have been active in connection with both the UN and the Red Cross - I can, however, see that we have not listened especially carefully to that saying.
As long as ten years ago, it was extremely clear how serious this epidemic could become in certain developing countries, but too little was done both in those countries and by the international community.
It is debatable what the reasons are why this epidemic hit poor countries especially hard, compared with how it affected countries in our own part of the world.
It obviously has to do with poverty, with lack of information and education, with patterns of sexual behaviour and, specifically, with young girls' lack of education of a kind which would better enable them to resist sexual advances. It also has to do, of course, with the shortage of money within the health care sector.
I welcome the fact that both Commissioner Nielson and the French Presidency now regard and describe the work on combating the HIV epidemic as a main priority.
Money is not enough, however.
Instead, we must ensure that the Commission obtains a sufficient number of qualified staff so that it is not isolated employees who are trying to push ahead with these issues.
It is also important to have new kinds of cooperation with the pharmaceuticals industry so that we can produce not only vaccines, but also medicines.
This applies not only to HIV but also to malaria.
We need to be guided by innovative thinking in this area.
When, finally, we talk about partnership, it is, as Commissioner Nielson said, extremely important to seek out whatever proves to have worked and to support it.
There is a whole host of programmes which are crying out for money and where contributions from the EU could be of use.
We talk a very great deal about Africa.
I am afraid that, in five to ten years' time, the situation will be similar and very serious in parts of Asia.
I welcome Commissioner Nielson' s conference on 28 September 2000 and hope that it will lead to something of a crash programme for tackling these problems still more vigorously in the future.
I have received seven motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to wind up the debate on this statement.
Before closing the debate, I invite the President-in-Office to reply to the debate or at least conclude it.
Thank you, Madam President, for giving me a moment to say how moving it is to hear such powerful words spoken in this Parliament today, clearly demonstrating that we are of one mind in recognising that Aids truly reveals the state of poverty and injustice reigning on our planet.
We Europeans have a moral obligation to mobilise and it comes through from all these speeches that we are ready.
We are very grateful to the Commission for preparing its communication which we impatiently await and which will allow us to pool our energies and unite in a determination to act.
The time for thinking really is over.
We must act without delay because this is an emergency, and the French Presidency stands ready to put that determination to act into practice at European level.
To respond to the immense challenge we face, we need to mobilise all the partners, as I said in my earlier remarks, which drew a wholly positive echo from Parliament.
I can tell you that the presence on the Durban platform of the Director General of WHO, the European Commission representative and the President of the Health Council created immense hope.
We have no right to disappoint that hope and I will be at your side.
We will meet the challenge together.
We must denounce campaigns of disinformation, combat obscurantism, but not abandon any field of action.
I believe we must be conscious always of the need to promote information and training, prevention, access to care and treatment, and research - particularly into vaccines and medication.
. I just want to thank you for these contributions.
We are aware of the enormous challenge facing us.
Prevention works, but it takes time.
Uganda is a good illustration of this.
For us as donors, this means that we have to be able to show what I would call donor stamina.
We have to be able to continue and to support the right strategies.
Mr Mantovani said that we should forgive debt and use the money instead to combat Aids.
When we forgive debt, we have used the money.
You are suggesting that we use it twice.
That is a good innovative approach, but still not that easy.
This is, in fact, why I mentioned that the offer the United States has made is to make available on a loan basis USD 1 billion for buying medicine from US companies.
That is in my view not the right approach, because it will actually increase the already double problem of Aids and existing debt in African countries.
That is why I made the point that Europe is actually providing funding that does not increase the debt of our partner countries.
Finally, I would warn against the dream of a quick fix in terms of new medicine.
We are supporting this.
We are trying to crack the code of protective rights for the companies but it is not easy.
In the meantime, the scale of the costs here makes it more necessary to emphasise prevention rather than cure. A cure is still far too expensive.
I want to thank the President and the Commissioner for their understanding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at12 noon.
Creating a monitoring centre for industrial change
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on creating a monitoring centre for industrial change.
I invite Mrs PÃ©ry to speak on behalf of the Council, and I know she will feel at home in this Chamber as she served as Vice-President of Parliament for many years.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say how delighted I am to be speaking here, discovering these acoustics, as this is in fact the first time I have spoken in this Chamber.
First, I must present apologies from Martine Aubry who very much regrets not being here personally.
I want to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and the parliamentary Group of the Party of European Socialists for the draft resolution to be debated, and the rapporteur, Mr Hughes.
I very much hope that our debate will contribute to progress on setting up European arrangements for monitoring industrial change, something the French Presidency takes a particular interest in.
You will note, Commissioner, that I said European arrangements, and I am deliberately non-specific about the name, because it is the principle that is important.
Before talking about the arrangements themselves, I think it is useful to give a brief review of the context in which this proposal was born.
The Special European Council in Luxembourg on 21 and 22 November 1997 tasked a high level group of experts with analysing industrial change in the European Union and looking at ways of anticipating and managing change as well as its economic and social repercussions.
The closure of the Renault Vilvorde plant is still a vivid memory.
All of us, in our own countries, are experiencing the radicalisation of certain social conflicts reflecting despair - I do mean despair - and incomprehension before the challenges of globalisation.
In its final report to the European Commission, the group of experts drew up an inventory and made recommendations.
These include the interesting proposal to the Commission to create a European monitoring centre for industrial change.
This centre would be a tool to help identify and analyse change in order to anticipate its consequences and ensure positive management of those developments.
This recommendation was received without comment as to the principle, the monitoring centre being perceived as a tool to assist restructuring, but debate arose around the work on its creation.
I believe there was also debate in the Commission and amongst both sides of industry.
I am now being told that positions have moved very close together on both on the tasks and on the structure of the centre, and I think that is a highly important factor.
Recognising this, and with your help, ladies and gentlemen, we need to create the conditions for rapid establishment of the European monitoring centre for industrial change.
The acceleration of the process of mergers and acquisitions in Europe is forever prompting us to think about the social and legal aspects of the issues raised.
The emergence of new information and communication technologies in the organisation of relations between the great principals and their sub-contractors - I am thinking of aeronautics, the motor industry - is bringing in its wake new ways of organising work liable to alter the industrial fabric substantially and promote the arrival of new territorial systems going beyond national frameworks.
As regards the future of employment, we need clarification to be able to make real forecasts successfully.
But clarification is also needed for developing vocational training both for learning a trade and for lifelong learning, which should become a right for everyone.
I very much hope, as the draft resolution underlines, that this will be included in the Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The nature and importance of the social dialogue accompanying these transformations goes hand in hand with the extent of restructuring or technological evolution.
The European monitoring centre for industrial change may respond to this problem if its tasks and structure are defined in that way.
The centre should identify and collect information relating to economic, technological, and labour market developments.
It should also identify and disseminate positive practical solutions to be implemented at various levels and promote exchange of experience on the evolution of and adaptation to change.
These tasks should respond to the needs of the European institutions, the social partners at all levels, the national and regional institutions and business.
There remains the question of how this monitoring function should be organised.
It is useful and necessary to remember that this centre should be a tool, not a place for political decision-making and industrial negotiations, and should be available to the publics I mentioned earlier.
It must be organised so as to fulfil its missions, and in our opinion that means a light, flexible structure.
For logistics it could rely on the existing European institutions.
In our opinion, European social partners and the Commission should naturally be involved in the management of the centre in appropriate ways.
A scientific council could determine the main guidelines and underwrite the work done.
A proposal that this European monitoring centre and the Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin should be close together makes sense and would receive our support.
In fact, the experience of that institution, its scope, the results of its work and its tripartite management, represent solid foundations for launching the centre.
In the view of the French Presidency, that proposal for a foundation should facilitate the rapid establishment of the centre.
France will do everything possible to ensure that it can be in place before the end of this presidency.
Madam President, I have not forgotten how precious time is in this institution, so I have made a point of respecting my speaking time.
Thank you, Madam President.
In 1997, the closure of one Renault factory near Brussels employing 3 200 people focused public attention on the negative consequences of industrial change.
After this, in response to the European Council, the Commission invited a high level group of experts to report on the economic and social implications of industrial change and make recommendations on ways to prevent consequences of the kind witnessed at the Renault factory.
In its report the high level group recommended the creation of an observatory.
This report has been endorsed by the Council.
It is true that mechanisms and structures for the anticipation of change exist in the majority of Member States.
But at European level there is no kind of observatory or mechanism to support policy makers and social partners in responding to these changes.
I am convinced of the need to provide European social partners and policy makers with a tool which enables us to adopt a forward-looking approach where industrial change is discussed at European level, with a view to managing it through positive and preventive action.
We have already discussed it three times in Parliament.
We really believe that there is an urgent need for a new structure, an observatory or whatever we like to call it.
The Commission has already proposed in the social agenda presented in 28 June 2000 to invite the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin - which is an existing structure - to put in place an information mechanism for change.
This mechanism could also serve as a forum on change.
What is the role of this mechanism?
This information mechanism should assist the social dialogue between employers and employees and it could support public authorities by providing information data and analysis of existing information on industrial change.
We all agree that it must be a lightweight and cost-effective structure and that it must be established as quickly as possible.
The social partners indicated their interest in this mechanism in the forum of 15 July and committed themselves to finalising their approaches and presenting their ideas on the possible structure for this mechanism.
Of course we shall take their opinion into account before our final proposal.
My last point is that anticipation of change and response to it must be multidimensional.
Coordination across all policy areas has been central to the Commission's deliberations in this area.
So what we could say is that we can ensure that the employment DG will collaborate with other DGs, in particular the internal market, education, culture and enterprise DGs, to present an integrated approach for this mechanism.
We believe that the output of this mechanism will be available to support the decisions of EU institutions and EU partners and this could be done in a flexible way within the European Treaty.
Mr President, may I say from this side of the House as one who served in the last Parliament that it is a great pleasure to see Mrs PÃ©ry here in this Chamber in Parliament.
I would like to make several points about this issue of an observatory or monitoring centre.
First of all, existing bodies within the EU institutions are already doing this work and are capable of doing it.
It seems curious to me to propose another agency, more machinery, and more budgetary expenditure to duplicate work that is already taking place.
For example, the Joint Research Centre Institute in Seville that deals with prospective future technologies is looking at this area.
The Dublin Institute has been mentioned already.
Secondly, governments and other types of public sector organisations do not have a particularly good record or an aptitude for predicting change in industry, in commerce, in business and in enterprise.
Nor, in my view, should they try to do that.
Let the economy and market forces get on with it.
I am curious about the socialist emphasis on industrial change when we in the developed economies now live in a situation in which 20% or less of the work-force is employed in conventional industry and everyone else works in the services sector in the new economy.
I am surprised because that emphasis denotes unawareness of this particular form of change.
In other words, it is all happening, it has happened already and furthermore it has happened probably despite, rather than because of, the fact that governments second-guess what is going to happen and how it should happen.
Moreover, if there is a need for study on an academic or research basis, then it is surely better to use existing bodies.
By all means involve the two sides of industry in the research work, but let us not set up yet another EU agency or body.
In short, we should not try to reinvent the wheel.
Instead, we should leave the economy and the market to get on with it, since this is the best way to promote change and renewal and create new jobs.
I too would like to welcome Nicole PÃ©ry back here in the Chamber and perhaps I could say, Nicole, that we miss you particularly when we have extremely difficult votes to transact.
Perhaps you could pop back periodically.
I would like to say that the compromise resolution tabled by my group and others has been cut down to the bare essentials to make it absolutely clear what we are calling for, but even so there seems to be a tremendous amount of confusion over exactly what we are calling for and I would therefore like to spell out two things that we are not calling for.
First, we are not calling for the creation of a new expensive agency or institute.
The tasks we want a monitoring centre to undertake can be handled at the Dublin Foundation and/or the Seville Joint Research Centre at little extra cost.
Second, we are not seeking to stop mergers, transfers, restructuring or globalisation itself.
That would be a ludicrous notion, but we want to see a socially responsible and anticipatory approach to these developments.
We want the establishment of a coordinating centre for the monitoring of industrial change as a contribution to a more pro-active approach to the management of medium and longer-term industrial change in terms of its impact within the European Union and I would draw Mr Chichester's attention to the fact that service industries too are industries and we are looking at industrial change overall.
This would be a centre to gather information and intelligence from all possible partners and actors, business itself, institutions of higher and further education, the employment services both public and private, the social partners from all relevant actors and again I would say to Mr Chichester, we are not saying here that governments should try to predict change.
We want to work with all partners including business itself to try to assess the direction of change.
The task of such a centre then should be to channel relevant information on anticipated changes to decision-makers at all levels to help increase our overall capacity to prepare the policy changes necessary to harness the opportunities to be gained from the perceived direction of change.
This is not an idea we have plucked out of the air.
As both the minister and the Commissioner have said, this follows on from the Gyllenhammar High Level Group following the Vilvoorde closure by Renault.
The recommendation to create an observatory is one in fact that has been picked up in several EPP resolutions in recent months and I am therefore very surprised to see such a hostile resolution from that quarter here this week.
The Liberal and EPP resolution says that such a centre would try to interfere in the markets and in commercial decisions.
That is not the case at all.
This is not about interference in commercial decisions but about making sure that we maximise the chances of us all being winners rather than simply the passive victims of change.
But who knows, Mr Chichester, maybe even the world of commerce would benefit from the improved intelligence such a centre could provide.
My final point is this: the resolution by the EPP and the Liberals is factually incorrect.
It states that both Council and Commission have pulled back from the decision to create such an observatory, such a centre.
We have heard from both the presidency of the Council here today and from the Commission that they are actively pursuing the idea.
Your resolution is factually incorrect.
It is missing the point and I hope even that at the eleventh hour you will recognise a good idea when you see it, withdraw your resolution and support ours.
But perhaps I am a hopeless optimist.
Mr President, the debate is most interesting but, as you can see from the screen, Question Time is due to start at 6.10 p.m.
It does not matter if Question Time is late starting but can you guarantee that it will last one and a half hours because otherwise we shall run out of time and numerous questions on the agenda will not be discussed.
And, while I have the floor, I too am delighted to welcome the representative of the Council presidency to the House.
I greatly regret the situation, just as you do, because I am inheriting the problem.
The fact of the matter is, however, that I can only guarantee us one hour here.
I will communicate this problem - and you will probably do so as well - to the Conference of Presidents and to Parliament' s Bureau, because it may occur once as an exceptional case, but when it happens more than once we must tackle the problem and find a solution to it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and Mrs PÃ©ry, it was agreed at the Lisbon Summit that fifteen European Member States would be developing a common strategy for a smooth transition to a new economy.
This is in the interests of our citizens as well as industry.
The Liberal Group is totally against the setting up of a new administrative body that will further increase European bureaucracy.
A European Monitoring Centre for industrial change is at odds with the liberal principle that governments should not interfere in commercial decisions.
Do not pick the winners and let the winners pick.
That was also the conclusion at the Lisbon Summit.
I was therefore amazed to learn that less than three months after the event, both Mrs PÃ©ry, on behalf of the presidency and Mrs Diamantopoulou, on behalf of the Commission had completely changed tack.
I was really taken aback by this.
And there was I thinking we were dealing with reliable partners.
Remarkably, European government leaders, including those of social-democratic persuasion, do embrace the liberal principles and the new economy while in this House, the left wing falls back on old reflexes time and again.
The spectre of the repairable society is on the loose once again in Europe.
Therefore, my group has also failed to achieve a compromise with the Socialist Group on the resolution before us.
Europe and the European economy are doing well.
The blessings of the internal market and particularly the introduction of the euro have given employment a shot in the arm.
However, some large Member States are fearful to take the required measures, as a result of which they lose out on the benefits to be gained from economic growth.
A new Monitoring Centre is no antidote to this.
This is not the first time that this Parliament is discussing political interference in industry and business management.
The same arguments crop up time and again.
I do hope this time is the last time.
Mr President, the European Union is facing far-reaching changes in our economy, globalisation, the new economy, the expansion of new technology and all kinds of demographic factors as well.
These developments have a major impact on employment, the balance between rich and poor, social exclusion and the environment.
There are all kinds of frictions within the labour market, we will have to adapt our education system and, at the end of the day, these developments also have all kinds of effects on individual companies, some of which are closing down while others are being set up again, etc. However, one minute we are pulling out all the stops to fight unemployment and the next we are attracting employees from third countries in order to solve the problems within the labour market, for example in the care or ICT sectors, just to quote a couple of odd examples.
What we have noticed is that sometimes the policy is ad-hoc or belated and, in a sense, Lisbon, with its "dotcom approach" , is a good example of this.
We need to take a more consistent line.
Secondly we need involvement, involvement in the support networks, and this is the social implication that needs to be developed.
We are of the opinion, therefore, that in order to accommodate this development within industry and sectors of industry, the advice of the working party must be followed at a high level and a coordinating centre set up to observe these changes. This centre should not be an unwieldy, new body but rather fall under the remit of an existing body.
This type of industrial change relies completely upon the full involvement of social partners, citizens and politicians at local, regional and national level.
Success will depend critically upon how well this change is managed. From this perspective, the Commission and Council should also ensure that topics such as the right to information and consultation, revision of the law on works councils and the role of employees and citizens in mergers and business closures with their serious social consequences can be brought up for discussion sooner rather than later.
This too seems to us to be essential for the purposes of managing industrial change.
We are not going to oppose the creation of a monitoring centre for industrial change.
The right' s unanimous opposition to it only confirms their rejection of the slightest transparency on the disastrous consequences for society of the factory closures and redundancies people have the nerve to present to us as inevitable responses to change.
But this monitoring centre can only be a statistical instrument, and not even an objective one, in this class society.
A monitoring centre cannot replace the political will to prevent big business sacking workers to make bigger profits.
Calling for social cohesion amounts to asking workers made redundant by a firm which is closing down, and unemployed people who are victims of restructuring, to endure their fate patiently.
Most of the mergers or restructurings are financial operations quite unrelated to industrial change.
And it is always the workers who have to pay the price, never the shareholders.
That is why I say to the workers that they can and must defend themselves, in particular by imposing a ban on redundancies on any company which is making profits.
Accumulated profits should be used to finance the distribution of work amongst all, with no decrease in wages, no precariousness and no flexibility.
I have received 7 motions for resolutions to close this statement, tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
My group would have preferred it if we had not concluded this, in itself interesting, debate with resolutions.
This is in response to the comments made by Mr Hughes.
I believe that the Council has indeed introduced new elements today.
Judging from the discussion, the Council has made some progress.
The Commission statement was also extremely clear and, in my opinion, we should all examine it very carefully once again.
This would be the best way forward.
Secondly, it is true that we need to avoid excessive bureaucracy.
I fully share the view of my neighbour, Mr Chichester on this matter.
This is a key point.
However, I was also reminded of what happened to the Titanic.
It sank because there was no observation system for icebergs in those days.
Needless to say, after the sinking of the Titanic, such a system was introduced without delay.
Surely over the past few years, we have seen a few cases, also in respect of industrial changes, where a little prescience might have prevented the worst from happening.
I personally take the view that we could explore this route a little more, provided it does not lead to further bureaucracy, especially in our host country.
We are constantly being faced with all kinds of states of affairs, blockades and such like, and I believe it would be of great benefit if more objective information on future changes could be provided so that we could perhaps prevent a few mistakes from being made, as might have happened in the case of the Titanic.
I like the film, but I would hate to see it time and again.
Mr President, let me start with a quotation: 'Unregulated mergers, based merely on dominant capitalist concerns, have a devastating effect on the Union's social cohesion.
That face of the European Union is unacceptable to men and women who wake up one morning to discover that the company they work for has changed hands and that they are at the mercy of their employer's economic strategy options.
The effect on the lives of those people, their families and their entire region is traumatic and, let's face it, inhuman.
Among Parliament's various proposals, the idea of setting up an observatory for industrial change is of particular interest. In so far as such an establishment will be independent and will have appropriate resources to carry out its research, and its work is made public and can serve as a basis for democratic debate, it can make a powerful contribution to developing intergovernmental cooperation which, in this area of social policy, remains predominant.'
That is not a quotation from some irresponsible or lunatic left-winger.
I am in fact quoting our President, Mrs Fontaine, who made those statements at the Lisbon Summit on behalf of us all.
Now, listening to certain leaders of the uptight right, here, today, I wonder if these honourable Members of Mrs Fontaine' s group really want to spend their time giving the lie to what our President said before the Heads of State and Government in Lisbon.
Of course, Mr Chichester and Mr Plooij-van Gorsel tell us, respectively, to 'leave it to the markets' and 'not pick winners' .
We know the old refrain only too well, privatise profit and nationalise losses.
My friend Steven Hughes has explained that the Socialists and the two other political groups tabling a joint resolution do not want a bureaucratic monster.
We do not want a new institution or agency but - as Mrs PÃ©ry, the representative of the presidency, says, and I welcome her too - a light arrangement, a light structure, which could coordinate the existing work.
In fact, the Commission has plenty of documentation available, and Eurostat can provide very interesting statistics on industrial evolution in Europe and beyond.
There are the national governments and research institutes.
There must be no duplication of existing work but coordination of it and a report, at least every six months, which can be debated in the Council and in the European Parliament.
We do not want to be mere spectators of the progress of industrial and social change.
We want to shape the future, and shaping the future does not mean fighting a rearguard action or useless protectionism, but accompanying change.
We are for the new technologies, we are for the new economy, but we also want to help the old sectors adapt. Our aim is a pro-active policy.
We want to anticipate change, because the future, and especially the economic future, is being built now.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to put this debate into context.
As a native of Auvergne, I would remind you that just about a year ago we were debating the Michelin crisis in this Chamber.
Michelin announced massive redundancies in its European factories at the same time as record profits on the stock exchange.
At that time, in this very House, we were collectively engaged in reviewing European regulations on company mergers.
I would suggest to the Commission that it might be worth having another look at Directive 94/EC and Regulation 4064/89 to strengthen information to and consultation of employees before major change - a euphemism for redundancies - whether due to restructuring or merger.
A year later, as a first concrete step, we are offered a monitoring centre for industrial change.
Fine, but let it really serve the cause of the employees.
For that, two conditions seem indispensable. The Commission must be allowed to evaluate the implementation of the directive on collective redundancies and closures of companies, and make proposals so that effective sanctions can be applied in case of non-respect of regulations.
The two sides of industry must be associated with this initiative by means budgetary resources allocated by the European institutions.
Minister, it is a great pleasure to see you here again.
The new economy and globalisation are producing an acceleration of industrial change and Parliament has several times discussed this issue and has established -I myself was the rapporteur - a certain number of procedures and the European works councils, and has done work on information to and consultation of workers. We are awaiting the results of these, Commissioner, because you know we are very committed to them.
We have also established procedures like the participation of employees in the capital, profits and results of the company, all indispensable procedures during industrial restructuring and change.
Of course there is still a great deal to be done in this field, but it seems to me that if we need to improve this type of procedure, as my colleagues have said, and it is not uptight to say so - we now have bodies in Europe like the Foundation in Dublin and the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao, with which our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs cooperates, that are in a position to evaluate the consequences of these industrial changes effectively.
And we should not forget that both sides of industry also have an indispensable role to play as regards industrial change at the European and the social level.
More particularly, I hope the existing bodies will be required to contribute to making industrial change increasingly transparent and, Commissioner, I hope the texts we are waiting for, on information to and consultation of workers, and the European company, will one day be submitted to this Parliament.
Mr President, Mrs PÃ©ry, Mrs Diamanopoulou, I would like to start by thanking Mrs PÃ©ry for the clarity with which she outlined the Council's proposal, which I fully support.
As has been said, the European Parliament has on several occasions, at times of crises, restructuring or conversion of production plant, decided by a large majority on the need for the European institutions and social dialogue partners to intervene early enough to be able to find all the possible solutions in order to avert avoidable serious social conflict and prevent the deindustrialisation of entire territories and the triggering-off of processes of serious social exclusion.
What Parliament was complaining of was the lack of information which would have made it possible to analyse these processes in due time and, more generally, to examine the changes taking place in production and employment in these firms before such an analysis lost its value due to the precipitous adoption of irreversible decisions.
I feel that the creation of a monitoring centre - a centre coordinating all the information useful for predicting restructuring and conversion processes - could be a valuable service for the Community institutions and facilitate social dialogue at European level.
For we are talking about a service activity, not a new institution, a service activity which would contribute to producing a high-quality, timely intervention which is the responsibility of the Union institutions alone.
Therefore, I call upon all those Members who voted on the resolutions on the restructuring processes, from Verwoord onwards, and especially those who voted on the Michelin affair in a resolution which explicitly provided for the establishment of a monitoring centre for industrial change, to show consistency on this occasion.
Mr President, with a tool such as this, it will, indeed, be possible not only to inform the workers concerned in advance and to explore the possibilities of averting or reducing redundancies - as stipulated by the Community Directive of 24 June 1992 - but also to facilitate at local and Community level dialogue which would make it possible to ascertain the existence of alternative solutions to those put forward by the companies. These could be partly implemented through public intervention as well as through initiatives to find alternative employment for workers whose jobs are under threat and, in particular, initiatives for the vocational retraining of workers.
This is the only way we will be able to ward off the danger represented by restructuring processes or mergers of large companies for large numbers of workers and for certain areas which are undergoing a radical process of decline or exclusion, particularly affecting young workers.
Without such a tool and without such preventative analyses, Parliament is destined to remain a centre of belated, ineffective claims.
Mr President, Mr Hughes says he does not want a new agency and yet his resolution plainly calls for a new agency and to deny it is merely playing with words.
He says he wants no interference in industry, and yet Mrs Diamantopoulou talks about preventive measures.
She clearly thinks that change is a bad thing.
She wants to keep loss-making industries on life-support systems when we should be releasing the resources of labour and capital so that they can work in viable new enterprises.
If we want to survive and prosper in the 21st century then we must welcome and manage change.
We must not monitor and prevent it.
So I was deeply disheartened to hear of this proposal for an observatory.
The rule seems to be: another day, another quango.
For the benefit of colleagues I should perhaps explain that a quango is a recently-coined English word short for "quasi non-governmental organisation", in other words, a new piece of bureaucracy, more money spent, more jobs for the boys, more patronage for their bosses.
And all for what?
To produce fat reports which will be translated into 11 languages but which nobody will read.
We seem to have only two responses in the EU to any real or imagined problem.
We either create a new regulation without any concern as to whether existing regulations are working properly or we create an observatory.
Then we stand back proud and happy that we have solved the problem.
But we have not solved the problem.
We have simply postponed it. We have wasted time and money and we have raised expectations which will not be fulfilled.
As with so many EU initiatives - I am thinking particularly of the proposed food standards agency - this observatory will simply duplicate the work of other organisations, of innumerable private research companies and accountancy firms, of academic and university institutes, of trade unions and chambers of commerce, and national and local government.
I put two questions to colleagues.
First, do we need this observatory at all?
I think not.
But if we do, would it not be far quicker, cheaper and more cost-effective to commission one of our great European accounting firms to do the work?
I am sure it would.
. (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, just two sentences.
I have listened carefully to the debate which has taken place in this Chamber.
What I want to say is that all those who support the idea of a European monitoring centre agree on its mission and its form.
I find that approach interesting.
A mission of information, a mission of exchange, and as to the form, the structure, a flexible, light, efficient structure, relying on existing structures.
I see Parliament, the Commission and the presidency united, so I shall leave here quite optimistic that the monitoring centre will come into being.
Mr President, I shall be brief because I know time is short.
It was a very interesting debate and there were two dimensions.
The first is the political one and the second is the technical one.
The political debate raised the question whether we should intervene in the new economy or not and I will make just a political point.
The new economy is not a natural phenomenon, it is a political phenomenon.
That is why there is a need for mechanisms and institutions - not to stop the changes but to manage the changes and to prevent their negative social consequences.
As regards the second dimension, the technical dimension, I agree with the EPP Group that there is no need for a new structure and I agree with all the others who say there is a need for a lightweight and flexible mechanism.
This is why we are not proposing a new institution or a new structure.
We are proposing to cooperate with the Dublin Institute and to take account of all the other resources (the resources of the Commission and other European institutions such as EUROSTAT and the European Employment Observatory, the evaluations and other studies we have); all these will be taken into account and this mechanism will support the social dialogue between partners, employers and the public and will support policy makers in managing this change.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0535/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.
You know that we have very little time.
According to the Rules of Procedure, for supplementary questions - which are not obligatory - you have 1 minute, but there is a Parliament recommendation that only 30 seconds be used.
I am not going to insist on 30 seconds, but I would ask you only to ask questions that are essential.
I must point out that Question Nos 1, 3 and 4 were included on the list of questions for the July Question Time but could not be replied to by the Council, because there was not sufficient time to translate them beforehand into all languages, and they are therefore being presented once again at the beginning of this part-session.
Since they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 1 and 2 will be taken together.
Question No 2 by (H-643/00):
Subject: United Nations General Assembly Special Session for Children What action does the Council intend to take in order to ensure that the EU makes a positive and constructive contribution to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session for Children, in September 2001, when all states will review commitments and goals set ten years ago at the World Summit for Children?
Does the Council agree that it is important that Member States, the Commission and the Council have a coherent approach to this Summit?
Mr President, I would like to answer the questions from Mr Theonas and Mrs Kinnock together, because they both deal with the need to ensure that child labour is abolished for once and for all.
As regards Mr Theonas' question, I must emphasise that the European Union fully recognises the importance of abolishing the exploitation of children, which deprives them of their right to a normal childhood and education, and their right not to be subjected to forced labour.
The European Union actively supports the action of the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations Children' s Fund, better known here as UNICEF. It salutes the adoption of the ILO Convention concerning immediate prohibition and action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, ratified by the United States on 2 December 1999, and it will work to ensure that this convention does indeed help eliminate the most intolerable forms of child labour.
The European Union regrets that the United States has not yet ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Our representatives have been urging the United States to ratify it in bilateral contacts.
The Convention has been ratified by the Member States and is of capital importance for the European Union which is actively involved in the current preparations for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, scheduled for September 2001, to assess progress achieved in the field of the rights of the child over the last ten years.
The European Union often raises human rights issues in the context of its political dialogue with the United States and the Council takes note of the case raised by the honourable Member.
On Mrs Kinnock' s question, the Council entirely agrees with her on the importance of good preparation of September' s UN General Assembly Special Session devoted to follow-up of the World Summit for Children.
The European Union has started actively preparing for the event.
It is one of our priorities for the 55th session of the UN General Assembly.
Although the success of the event depends in large measure on the commitment of the international community as a whole, the Council recognises that the European Union can and must play a major role in the preparations, a role encouraged during informal contacts held with representatives of UNICEF.
In addition, the Council is constantly attentive to the rights of the child wherever issues relating to human rights are dealt with.
The preparations for the special session are on the agenda of the Council' s human rights group, and it intends to devote a special section of the European Union' s annual human rights report to this issue.
Finally, the French Presidency has proposed holding a European Day of the Rights of the Child to its partners, possibly on 20 November 2000 - but I say that with reservations, because it has not yet been made official.
One last point: the Council is promoting the signature of two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted and opened for signature by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 May 2000, and we hope a lot of countries will sign at the Millennium Summit, which opens tomorrow and will implement these two optional protocols.
Mr President, I really must thank Mr Moscovici for the quality and content of his reply and for the fact that the European Union feels that the international conventions of the United Nations Organisation, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, should be ratified.
I should just like to observe, by way of a supplementary question, that ratification is extremely important, but often it is not enough.
Because, if I am not mistaken, the United States have ratified the new International Labour Organisation Convention on Child Labour but the convention is not being applied.
And where I think the minister needs to add to what he has told us is on whether the European Union, whether the Council will also demand at a practical level during the two days of contacts that the United States apply the provisions of the International Labour Organisation Convention and the United States convention on the Rights of the Child.
. (FR) It is true that the important thing is implementation, but it is difficult to implement a convention which has not been ratified.
That is why we want to start having a much more determined political dialogue with the United States on this issue and press for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by the United States.
We will also hold informal consultations to try to convince them of the need not just to ratify that convention but to adhere to it.
Question No 3 by (H-0627/00):
Subject: Involvement of labour and management In various Member States there is no dialogue of substance or effective cooperation between government bodies and representatives of labour and management on employment-related issues or, in a broader context, efforts to modernise the European social model.
The conclusions of the European Council held in Santa Maria da Feira referred to the need for labour and management to play a more significant role.
How does the Council envisage strengthening the role of labour and management?
How will it monitor their involvement more effectively?
The Council has always regarded social dialogue as enormously important.
But you will appreciate that it is not up to the Council to advocate any particular model of social dialogue at national level, because that lies entirely within the competence of each Member State.
However, in terms of the social dialogue at European level, both sides of industry in Europe are already heavily involved in two aspects of Community action: coordination of economic policies, and the effort to implement the European strategy for jobs.
On the latter aspect, both sides of industry participate, with the Council and Commission, in the work of the standing committee on employment with a view to facilitating coordination of employment policies in the Member States by harmonising them with Community objectives.
Our social partners are also associated with the work of the committee on employment, consultation of both sides of industry in this context being informal.
As regards the efforts to strengthen the European strategy for jobs, when the employment guidelines are revised in 2001, both sides of industry, including those at national level, will be invited to play a more important role in their definition, and in implementing and evaluating the guidelines which fall within their scope.
The stress will be on modernising the organisation of work, education for lifelong learning and raising the employment rate, especially for women.
There are also grounds for suggesting that it is up to the Commission, pursuant to Article 138 of the Treaty, to consult both sides of industry on the possible orientation of a Community action before presenting proposals in the area of social policy.
As an example, the Commission has recently consulted its social partners on the possible orientation of a Community action on modernising and improving working relations.
As regards the modernisation of the European social model, both sides of industry will be associated with the work of the new committee on social protection, just as they are already associated with the work of the old committee on employment and the labour market and its successor, the committee on employment.
Following the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, the Fifteen are due to adopt a European social policy agenda at the Nice European Council in December 2000.
That is an important priority for the French Presidency.
The working document for that agenda is a communication from the Commission adopted on 28 June.
There will be contributions to it and consultations on it under the French Presidency, and naturally both sides of industry are expected to be closely associated in drawing up the social policy agenda.
Mr President, I should like to thank the minister for his reply; I naturally endorse the fact that the importance and value of the social partners in shaping a new model are much greater than anyone can imagine.
But what I should like to ask is this: when a tripartite dialogue takes place between the two sides of industry and the national government, how far can the national government ignore what was jointly agreed and proposed by the social partners?
Or, taken the other way, how binding on a government are proposals decided jointly by the social partners, who know better than anyone what the problems of society and the causes of unemployment are and what problems need to be solved in order to deal with unemployment, or how binding should they be on any national government?
Council. (FR) Mr Folias, it would certainly be desirable to make things more restrictive, but this is not the route which has been adopted within the European Union.
On the one hand, there is the subsidiary nature of social problems and, on the other, the selection of a method we call the open method of coordination.
We are currently succeeding in reconciling the problems of economic coordination, the major objectives of economic policy, the problems of coordination in social terms, the guidelines for employment and the various methods, and the various bodies working on it.
I think that this is an approach which must be continued because, as we know, Europe is very diverse.
Europe must not and cannot interfere in everything.
At the same time, the involvement of both sides of industry must be continually intensified.
Mr President, the social partnership should be a forward-looking partnership.
The first priority should be to implement what both sides want for themselves, and I believe that dialogue is an essential and important prerequisite in this respect.
What do you perceive the role of the existing Economic and Social Committee to be in this context, and what changes do you think will need to be made here, to enable it to become more actively involved in the work in future?
The Council does not have any response to this question at this stage.
Question No 4 by (H-0697/00):
Subject: Professor A Pelinka and Austria Is the Council aware of the case of Professor Anton Pelinka who has had his work in the European Monitoring Centre deliberately impeded and sabotaged by the Austrian Government and who has consequently had to resign from his position as Vice-President and member of the Management Committee of the Monitoring Centre?
Does the Council not believe this to be a clear case of political interference of the kind many of us believed would follow from the entry into government of the Austrian Freedom Party?
Does the Council not believe that this case justifies the imposition of sanctions and makes it all the more important for the sanctions to be maintained?
The Council is indeed aware of Professor Pelinka' s resignation from his post as Vice-President of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia on 31 May this year.
However, the measures adopted by the 14 Member States on 31 January, which are going to be reassessed, or, at least, which are due to be reassessed in the light of the report of the Wise Men, are of a strictly bilateral nature.
As such, they do not implicate the institutions of the European Union and, consequently, the Council is not justified in declaring an opinion on whether or not they should be maintained.
As you know, three experts were designated by the President of the European Court of Human Rights on 12 July in order to check specifically whether the Austrian Government had contravened common European values since taking office on 4 February, and also to look into the decidedly unique political character of the Austrian Freedom Party.
The Member States will, of course, be very interested to peruse the experts' report when it is published, which, according to my information, should be very soon.
Mr President, I had the privilege of being a member of the Council of Ministers' Consultative Committee on Racism and Xenophobia, along with Professor Pelinka.
He was a highly valued if not slightly boring member, who tried to prevent us going too far in our recommendations and acted as a brake on some of us who were more enthusiastic about pushing forward.
Is the Council aware that the management committee of the Monitoring Centre has passed a resolution expressing regret at the resignation of Professor Pelinka and the events leading to that resignation and is the Council prepared to draw the attention of the Wise Men to this particular incident and ask them to include that in their report because it clearly seems to be a possible example of how our common European values are being undermined by the current government in Austria?
Mr Ford, I have my own personal opinion on the matter.
I imagine that you know something of my views as a member of the French Government.
They are known to Austria at least.
The fact remains, however, that I am speaking right now on behalf of the Council and, let me repeat, these measures are bilateral measures, not measures undertaken in the context of the European Union.
As far as the report of the Wise Men is concerned, it is, by definition, a matter for them alone. I have no doubt but that in the detailed study they make of the Austrian situation, after a number of consultations, they will be able to take the diversity of individual situations into consideration, or, at least, I hope so.
That, in any case, was the mandate given them.
I have listened to the French Presidency' s answer with a great deal of interest.
The Pelinka case is a very serious legal case which may be said to constitute direct interference with freedom of expression in so far as the legal apparatus is being used in practice to silence political criticism.
The Council has now explained that it cannot comment "in its capacity as the Council of Ministers" , but the French Government may perhaps comment in its own capacity.
Is this matter not thought to be serious and to need to be included in the assessment being made in the Wise Men' s report?
I believe that the stance of the French Government and even the French authorities on this matter has been known from the outset.
We were by no means the last to demand the bilateral measures which were taken.
The fact remains that I am speaking right now, let me repeat, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and that those measures are not measures undertaken within the context of the European institutions but rather a set of bilateral measures undertaken by 14 Member States with regard to the fifteenth.
That, sir, is all I wished to say, and I repeat, once again, that, by definition, if we want the Wise Men' s report to be truly wise, we must allow them to work wisely, and not try to influence them one way or the other.
I place my trust in these important political and legal figures, especially the former Finnish President, Mr Ahtisaari, since he has shown in the past that he is capable of assessing complex situations.
Question No 5 by (H-0597/00):
Subject: Request for a documented assessment of the education of children in the countries applying for EU membership In view of the economic crisis and profound structural changes that the majority of the applicant countries in the enlargement process have undergone, will the Council say whether all children in these countries are receiving an education? To what age is education in these countries compulsory?
Is there any means of guaranteeing that all future citizens of the EU receive an education?
The Council is in possession of the latest statistics provided by Eurostat. I have them here and I am willing to offer them to the honourable Member.
The data refer to the now distant school year 1997-1998, and show that in 11 countries which are candidates for membership of the European Union, the duration of compulsory schooling is nine or ten years, i.e. until the age of 15 or 16, depending on the case.
It is therefore possible to estimate that the percentage of young people in education at 16 is approximately 90% and at 18 approximately 60%.
Reliable statistics are not yet available for Cyprus and Malta, and Eurostat has not yet begun to collaborate with Turkey on educational statistics, but it is, understandably, not a simple matter where retrospective data is concerned.
If she requires further details, the Honourable Member can also consult a collection entitled "Key Data on Education in the European Union" , produced by Eurydice in collaboration with Eurostat and published by the Commission in French, German and English.
Let me do a little advertising by announcing that the 1999-2000 edition is now available.
Finally, on the subject of the education of all European citizens, you should remember that it is up to every Member State and every candidate country to ensure that this objective is achieved.
Once more, I should like to make the statistics, in the form in which I have them, available to Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines.
In fact, I have consulted the statistics and I have consulted the information provided by the European Foundation for Education, and I am surprised by the rosy picture they paint of the situation in the countries of the East.
The news we ourselves have received all indicates that, while the system has fallen, an enormous crisis has been declared.
There are problems in very many places. In rural areas, many teachers are in practice not being paid, and I do not believe that, with the crisis of structural change suffered in the rest of the system, education has been kept in the wonderful state indicated in the statistics.
It therefore concerns me that there is no way of searching or taking soundings.
It is clear that, beyond subsidiarity, even beyond formal legitimacy, there is a moral legitimacy, which is based on our commitment to ensure that in the rural areas, in the new Europe, in the new countries which are going to join us, not a single child should remain without access to education or be deprived of the right to education which they deserve.
I was basing my answer on the facts available to me, i.e. the statistics.
I am not willing to make a qualitative judgement which might not be justified.
Let me repeat to the honourable Member that I have available a table which, in effect, shows that what I have said includes the disparities.
There is an average, of course, but there are also cases of greater or lesser advantage, which undoubtedly illustrate situations at grass roots level which are not at all equal.
I can give you this summary table if you wish, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines.
Mr President, I should like to take advantage of the question by Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines to touch on an aspect of tertiary education in candidate countries which affects young people not from these countries but from other Member States of the European Union, such as Greece, who attend universities in candidate countries in large numbers.
My question to the President-in-Office is this: is there any thought, are there any prospects, are there any plans to extend the scope of the directive on the mutual recognition of tertiary education diplomas which applies to the Fifteen to the candidate countries?
And if so, when?
Will this be done once the accession procedures have been completed or could it be done earlier in order to solve the present problems?
I understand that the President-in-Office may not be able to give me an answer right now but perhaps he could inform us if or when he has an answer.
At this stage I can give you an initial answer, to the effect that one of the objectives of the French Presidency, as you perhaps already know, is what we call the European Research Area.
It is something we are working on together with Jack Lang, the objective being to remove all obstacles to the mobility of students, teachers and researchers. This, of course, also involves harmonising the recognition of qualifications.
This is what we wish to do for the European Union.
It is not an easy task.
I think that, as far as we ourselves are concerned, it would be ambitious to set a target of five years.
For the rest, however, it is a complicated matter to attempt harmonisation with countries which are not yet members of the European Union.
It must be considered, however, that if this is made a requirement within the European Union, then this is the requirement within the body to which the candidate countries wish and are going to accede.
The question of whether it should be an approach like that used for the internal market or like that in use for the Schengen countries can be posed at a later date.
The fact is, however, that we still have a few years to consider the matter.
Question No 6 by (H-0605/00):
Subject: Negotiating mandate covering the agricultural section of the free trade agreement with the Maghreb The Commission has submitted its proposal for a negotiating mandate for the free trade agreement with Morocco, Tunisia and Israel to the Council' s 'Maghreb' Working Party.
The proposal covers all theoretically possible liberalisation measures, from increasing quotas to reducing customs duties, with various formulas for handling entry prices.
What are the scope and substance of the mandate?
Morocco, Tunisia and Israel are the three partners of the European Union whose Euro-Mediterranean association agreements have entered into force.
These agreements include a periodic review clause for agriculture, according to which the parties undertake to plan for the increased liberalisation of their agricultural trade, with this process complementing the gradual dismantling of the tariff system in preparation for the setting up of the industrial free trade area due in 2010.
It is strictly limited to agriculture.
It does not, therefore, concern, for example, fisheries products which are dealt with as part of other negotiations.
The Morocco, Tunisia and Israel association agreements make provision for examination of the agricultural trade situation, as of 1 January 2000, with a view to the establishment of gradual liberalisation measures, beginning on 1 January 2001.
The negotiations which are due to open must therefore make it possible to strengthen this Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
They are also designed to achieve a better balance in agricultural trade with the three countries concerned, with regard to which the Union has a structural deficit.
The European Union is the prime outlet for the agricultural production of its partners, and takes up two thirds of their exports.
Currently, 95% of exports of agricultural products from Morocco, Tunisia and Israel to the European Union are exempt from customs duties.
On 20 July 2000, the Council approved the Commission' s negotiating mandate, which comprises general guidelines.
It is a matter of facilitating improved access to the markets of the partner countries for Community products and of greater balance in mutual preferences, including by means of exempting new products from customs duties.
It also defines the room for manoeuvre the Commission is allowed in restoring balance in trade and concluding negotiations.
At the request of the Member States, the measures which may give rise to concessions are strictly delimited.
The mandate therefore authorises the Community negotiator, if necessary, to grant the Mediterranean partners tariff preferences for new products or to improve existing concessions, while, however, taking the vulnerability of certain products and the mechanisms of the common agricultural policy into consideration.
In this respect, it specifies that the Commission is, in collaboration with the Member States, to carry out an assessment of the potential impact of the concessions on the economic and commercial interests of the European Union, and obviously the Council will not take a decision until it has consulted the results of this assessment.
Mr President, I am happy that the Council is also taking account in this negotiation of the sensitivity of certain regions and certain products, especially in the agricultural sector.
At the moment there are agricultural sectors in the Mediterranean and also in the outermost regions of the Community, which could be threatened as a result of the very generous proposed concessions by the Commission.
I would just like to repeat what I said and encourage the Council to persist in maintaining the greatest possible vigilance so that those sectors are not fundamentally damaged by overly-generous concessions.
I believe that this is exactly the philosophy which will be guiding our negotiations.
I can therefore only endorse what is more a compliment than a question.
Question No 7 by (H-0610/00):
Subject: EU-Turkey partnership In the process of adopting Regulation EC/764/2000 regarding the implementation of measures to intensify the EU-Turkey customs union, on a proposal from the Commission, Parliament's amendments concerning democratisation, respect for human rights and the rights of minorities in Turkey were effectively rejected.
This development has given rise to fears as to whether the 'partnership', which will reportedly be discussed in the Council at the end of the year, will abide by the political terms and conditions laid down by the Helsinki Summit.
Does the Council, therefore, intend to adopt the proposal for a Regulation (COM(2000)169) regarding the implementation of measures to promote economic and social development in Turkey, together with the partnership?
Can it give assurances that the Helsinki political criteria will be clearly defined within the partnership and that the mechanisms for monitoring Turkey's progress towards democratisation will operate as they do for the other states applying for membership?
Following the adoption, on 10 April this year, of the regulation regarding the implementation of measures intended to intensify the EU-Turkey customs union, on 13 June this year the Council adopted its common position on the proposal for a financial regulation on the implementation of actions to promote Turkey' s economic and social development.
This common position was sent to the European Parliament for second reading at the July 2000 part-session.
The Council awaits Parliament' s opinion with interest.
You know that, in December 1999, the Helsinki European Council recognised Turkey' s candidacy on an equal footing with the other candidates in terms of rights and obligations and decided to implement a pre-accession strategy for Turkey.
In Feira, the Heads of State and Government invited the Commission to submit proposals regarding the single financial framework for aid to Turkey and the accession partnership as soon as possible.
As you know, at the end of July, the Commission approved a proposal for a Council regulation on launching Turkey's accession partnership. It is on the basis of this regulation that the Commission will, at a later date, submit its proposal for partnership, but it will include the short- and medium-term priorities and objectives to prepare for accession in accordance with the model adopted for the other candidates.
The Commission will present its proposal on the implementation of a single financial framework at a later date.
It goes without saying that, in working out this partnership, the Council will pay particular attention to compliance with the political criteria for accession, particularly in the areas of human rights, rule of law and the legal system.
It will also ensure monitoring to verify that Turkish legislation is made compliant in this and in other areas, in order to ascertain that this is carried out in the same way as in the other candidate countries.
In this connection, it should be noted that preparations for the examination of Turkish legislation in all the areas of the acquis communautaire have been undertaken within the EU-Turkey Association Council.
In addition, the Feira European Council requested that the Commission submit a progress report to the Council on the work undertaken in this area.
I would like to thank the minister for his reply; however, I note that, whereas I specifically asked if the Helsinki criteria would be defined within the partnership, he evaded the question.
I should therefore like to repeat and specify and update my question.
The 15, and first and foremost the presidency, received a letter from Mr Gem a few days ago asking for the partnership between Turkey and the European Union which is now on the drawing board not to mention Helsinki Articles 4 and 9 relating to Greek-Turkish relations - in his words, border differences - and the question of progress on the Cyprus issue.
I should therefore like to repeat my question to the minister and again raise the issue which he evaded: will mention be made of the Helsinki criteria on the Cyprus question and Greek-Turkish relations or will Mr Gem' s proposals be accepted?
What is the Council' s reply to Mr Gem?
I do not have a specific answer on this issue.
What I do recall is the European Council in Helsinki, as I took part in this discussion there, having just a short time before been on a brief diplomatic mission to Turkey and Greece, and the Helsinki conclusions are the ones which are binding upon us and upon everyone.
That is the general rule.
That is the basis on which we conducted our negotiations.
Minister, nine months after Turkey was granted candidate status in Helsinki, and irrespective of my opposition to Turkey' s accession, do you believe that there has been any progress with democratisation, which was one of the criteria for accession, or have you concluded that what we forecast at the time has come true, i.e. the Helsinki resolution has encouraged the Turkish regime to continue its inhumane policy?
What we have concluded, as you too can see, is that there has been no progress whatsoever in democratising the constitution and the penal code, parties such as the Communist party have been banned, the prison situation is festering, political prisoners are being treated inhumanely, new F-cells have been created for harsh, inhumane solitary confinement, lawyers who defend political prisoners are being humiliated, Kurdish villages in Iraq have again been bombed, more beatings have been carried out and arrests have been made in Diyarbakir, Istanbul and elsewhere for the events of 1 September, which is the international day of peace.
Similarly, not only does Turkey continue to occupy 38% of Cyprus following its barbaric invasion in 1974, contrary to repeated UN resolutions which Turkey disregards in the most provocative manner, but Mr Ecevit states that the Cyprus question was resolved in 1974 and refuses to apply resolutions to pay...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I do not share the viewpoint which seems to underlie your question, namely this opposition to the candidacy of Turkey.
Turkey' s candidacy was in fact made possible by a welcome rapprochement between Greece and Turkey, which, I hope, will continue, particularly under the enlightened leadership of the two great diplomatic leaders, Mr Papandreou and Mr Gem, both of whom I consider my friends.
Having said that, let me repeat, Turkey' s candidacy has been accepted on equal terms with regard to both rights and duties.
In order for Turkey to become a member of the European Union, it must respect its values and therefore make the necessary efforts.
At the same time, we must greet its efforts positively.
Nine months may be a long time for a human being to develop before birth, but it is an extremely short time for a candidate country.
Question No 8 by (H-0614/00):
Subject: US farm subsidies Has the Council of Ministers considered the recent substantial increases in agricultural subsidies provided for its farmers by the US Government, which now represent more than EUR 16 000 per farmer.
Are these subsidies in violation of WTO agreements and does the Council propose to take any action on this?
The United States have not yet notified the WTO of the measures to which the Honourable Member refers, which could warrant investigation under Article 18 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture.
Moreover, I should point out that agricultural subsidies are among the subjects dealt with in the WTO negotiations which commenced in June 2000.
The implementation of the reduction commitments agreed at the time of the 1994 Marrakech Accord is also scheduled for examination in the course of these negotiations, which are based on the principles outlined in Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
The relevant Council bodies receive regular progress reports from the Commission with regard to the negotiations and other activities undertaken within the WTO' s agricultural bodies, and if the Commission considers it useful, the matter of the compliance of the United States' subsidy policy with the commitments signed in the Uruguay Round and other measures to be taken in this respect will be referred to the Council.
I wish to raise the question with the President-in-Office of the change in American policy since we in the European Union changed the whole direction of the support we give to agriculture following the last round of GATT negotiations.
The United States Government has more than doubled the level of subsidies per farmer.
At the same time the European Union, in pursuit of its policies which were forced on us by the clearance group and the United States, has reduced its share of world markets in the dairy sector, in the cereal sector and in the meat sector.
I consider that since the American Government has doubled the level of aid that it extends directly to its farmers the European Union has in fact been wrong-footed and that the policy which has led us to a reduction in our share of world markets is in fact outdated and should be reviewed.
I shall not go into the details, but these are, in fact, the sort of considerations which justify our rejecting attacks which may have been made on the common agricultural policy and our own system, and that is also the reason why the European Union adopted an overall negotiating mandate designed to safeguard the social model and the farm model, not to mention the European cultural model, with regard to the WTO.
Rest assured that, as far as we are concerned, the mandate is still the basis for further negotiations.
It is true that extending qualified majority voting to European Union sectors of activity which currently require unanimous votes is indeed one of the major issues of the Intergovernmental Conference currently taking place.
This is a crucial issue of democracy.
In a democracy, decisions are agreed by the majority not by unanimity.
In this context, Article 151 is one of the provisions likely to be converted to the rule of qualified majority voting.
I am sure that Mrs Zorba would agree that it is still too early to ascertain what direction the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference are going to take, even though I would hazard that, quite possibly, consensus will be reached quickly regarding Article 151, for not everything can be a source of disagreement.
As regards the manner in which Article 151(4) of the Treaty has been applied, I shall simply respond by saying that respect for and furtherance of the diversity of the cultures of Europe remain at the heart of the entire Community structure.
Minister, everyone who knows that we urgently need a cultural policy in the European Union also knows - and I agree with you - that the Intergovernmental Conference represents a huge chance to change the unanimity rule.
The Intergovernmental Conference is not a procedure which is foreign or bears no relation to the Council and it obviously takes account of all points of view and all types of need.
It does not operate in a vacuum.
My question therefore is this: is the Council doing anything to change the unanimity rule and push for a change at the Intergovernmental Conference.
The more economic policies progress, the more we need to study their cultural impact and develop a structural cultural policy.
That was the meaning of my question; I do not think we should just stand around and wait because it may be too late by then and an agreement may not be so easy to reach.
The Council as such is not, by definition, a member of the Intergovernmental Conference.
I would urge you to trust the French Presidency of the Council and the European Council to further the cause of extending qualified majority voting.
Let me abandon my official role for a second to say that we would like to see qualified majority voting become the general rule and unanimous voting the exception, rather than the opposite, which is the case at present.
Question No 10 by (H-0617/00):
Subject: Cost of enlargement and Mediterranean agriculture In the light of forecasts and the most recent legislative proposals on Mediterranean agriculture, which concern products such as cotton, rice, fruit and vegetables, tomatoes, nuts and olive oil, among others, and will have adverse effects on employment and social development in these poor regions of Europe, and bearing in mind also the budgetary plans for EU enlargement, what will the Council do to ensure that Mediterranean agriculture does not end up bearing the brunt of the costs of the forthcoming enlargement?
I understand the concerns behind the honourable Member' s question.
I feel, however, the question itself contained observations of quite a different kind.
Regarding your preliminary remark: the ongoing reforms of the common market organisations for predominantly Mediterranean products are intended to enable these markets to adapt to competition outside Europe, which is often extremely fierce, and to stabilise the production of these items within the European Union.
The desired aim is, therefore, indeed to maintain employment in areas which generally offer few possibilities for conversion to the cultivation of other crops.
This is the spirit in which the Council will declare its opinion on the legislative proposals put forward by the Commission, when the time comes.
Moreover, the European Union' s Ministers for Agriculture, whose informal six-monthly meeting has been held from Saturday until today in Biarritz, have just stressed their determination, now more clearly than in the past, to focus in agricultural policies on boosting product quality and diversity.
You then went on to make reference to the impact of European Union enlargement on the budget. In my view, this is not directly related to the adoption of the CMO reforms I was talking about just now.
The impact of enlargement on the budget was the subject of intense discussion at the European Council in Berlin in March 1999 when the financial perspectives for 2000-2006 were drawn up.
For each year in this period, and for each heading, the financial perspectives give the expenditure totals as commitment appropriations, and the commitment appropriations laid down under the various headings of the financial perspectives are not interchangeable.
There is hence no question of enlargement-related expenditure being funded at the expense of agricultural expenditure under heading 1 of the financial perspectives.
I therefore do not see how future enlargement can be carried out at the expense of Mediterranean agriculture under the financial perspectives for 2000-2006.
When the time comes, most probably by 2005 at the latest, we will, of course, have to establish a new institutional agreement on the future financial perspectives, but I am sure you will agree that this date is still too far away for us to be expected, reasonably, to discuss the matter today.
Would you be prepared to make some sort of recommendation with a view to preventing the negative impact of enlargement on the Mediterranean?
In truth, through his actions and proposals, Mr Fischler, the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture, has made the anti-Mediterranean impact of enlargement a reality.
It is a fact that the whole of the Mediterranean area is frightened about this.
As I can see that the Council is standing firm in its political will, and in order to prevent - as you say - anything like this happening, not through good intentions but through facts, I would like to ask you whether the French Presidency, before it ends, would be willing to make, in the way it considers appropriate, some kind of recommendation which would dispel these concerns, that is to say, which would ensure that Mediterranean production would in no way pay the price for enlargement.
This is not a subject that I am prepared to make impromptu comments on.
I can assure you of just one thing, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, and that is that, as far as we are concerned, the financial perspectives, which were the product of tough negotiating in Berlin, represent a framework which it would be extremely difficult for us to shift.
We do not wish to do so, and so, once again, we shall discuss the matter again in 2005.
Question No 11 by (H-0619/00):
Subject: Attack on Greek minority in the village of Dervitsani in Albania The Greek inhabitants of Dervitsani, a village in Albania, passed the night of 3 to 4 July 2000 in shelters after being attacked by anti-tank missiles from the neighbouring village of Lazarati.
The police who arrived on the scene failed to make any arrests.
This is not the first attack against the Greek minority.
The previous week the Council of Europe had recommended that the Albanian government take measures to protect the minorities living in Albania.
Given the fact that the Council of the European Union adopted the action plan for Albania on 13/14 June 2000, will the Council say what political measures it intends to take and what immediate measures it will promote in order to strengthen security in the region and ensure the physical safety and the fundamental rights of minorities in Albania?
The Council is aware of the armed attack upon the village of Dervitsani from the village of Lazarati which occurred during the night of 3 to 4 July 2000, during which automatic weapons and explosives were used.
According to the information available, the firing was carried out by a small group of people allegedly wishing to prevent the Albanian policy carrying out arrests in their village.
Even though the Greek minority was not the target of the attack in question, the attack nonetheless contributed to creating a climate of insecurity in the region.
The European Union supports the efforts of the Albanian Government to restructure and modernise its police forces in order to increase the security of Albanian citizens and of the region.
The Multinational Advisory Police Element in Albania, formed under the authority of the WEU Council and deployed in Albania since 1997, has widened and developed the scope of its mission following the adoption, in March 1998, of a joint action on the European Union' s contribution to re-establishing a viable police force in Albania.
Following the adoption of the action programme for Albania and the neighbouring region, the Council is currently examining the proposed measures in order to identify those which can be implemented speedily.
The action programme is basically devoted to matters relating to problems of migration and asylum.
The proposed measures do, however, include projects in the field of human rights and the protection of minorities.
The European Union is, moreover, already active in these fields.
Since Albania is eligible for an association and stabilisation agreement, its performance in terms of respect for democratic principles and human and minority rights and in terms of public order and the rule of law, are closely monitored by the European Union, I can assure you.
I should like to thank the Council representative for his reply.
However, the purpose of my question was to draw attention once again to the huge problems in the Balkans, problems caused by economic and social deprivation and, more importantly, the fact that there is no democratic infrastructure.
The attacks on the Greek minority were just one in a series of incidents which occur in Albania on a daily basis.
My question therefore, minister, is how far are you prepared to give real support to Albania so that the rule of law can operate?
We saw no such support in the action programme decided for Albania.
You place greater emphasis in the action programme on how to stop immigration and how to send refugees back to Albania, which is clearly not a safe country, than on how we can give his country the means to develop.
We seem to have promised the Balkans a great deal but are unwilling to put our promises into practice.
I should like answers to these questions, minister.
I share your view, Mrs Karamanou, that the incidents mentioned appear, at first sight, to indicate a general problem of security and public order in Albania rather than a campaign of deliberate attacks on the Greek minority.
This is a general problem which must be dealt with as such.
The action plan for Albania to which you refer is a High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration action plan for Albania and the neighbouring region, adopted by the General Affairs Council on 13 and 14 June this year, intended, in effect, to define and coordinate European Union resources with a view to responding to the problems of asylum and migration in Albania and the neighbouring countries and, as such, it is not intended to promote the rights of any particular minority.
Nonetheless, the suggested actions do include projects or programmes seeking to step up democracy and respect for human rights and minority rights in general.
The Council working groups are currently proceeding to examine the various measures proposed in order to identify which of them could be implemented in the near future.
An interim report is expected for the European Council in Nice in December.
Question No 12 by (H-0622/00):
Subject: Reduction of TACIS aid to Russia The European Union has punished Russia for its military action in Chechnya by reducing aid paid under the TACIS programme.
At the Feira European Council it was decided to relax sanctions.
Under what conditions does the Council consider that the TACIS funds should be granted to Russia for this year and next year?
In the wake of the Feira European Council, the General Affairs Council on 10 July this year requested that the Commission resume preparations for an indicative TACIS programme in favour of Russian, to cover the years 2000-2003, and to draw up a proposal for a TACIS action programme targeted at the year 2000.
The relevant management committee is scheduled to examine these proposals on 17 October this year.
The priority objective of this programme will be to support the rule of law in Russia, complying with the democratic requirements of a modern democracy and benefiting Russian society as a whole.
Special attention is to be paid to supporting institutional and economic reforms, schemes undertaken for the democratisation and reinforcement of civil society and the protection and development of independent media.
Moreover, the Council has agreed to adopt further decisions on guiding cooperation with Russia and the use of the available instruments, in the light of the development of the situation in Russia.
I would thank the President of the Council for that answer.
I should like to ask a follow-up question: What conditions are being laid down for in fact providing this aid?
Does the Council believe that the present situation in Chechnya is such that it is reasonable to provide this aid to Russia?
Yes. In 2000, only EUR 34 million have been committed to date, following the reorientation of the Helsinki programme.
A second tranche will be allocated to aid in support of the reform process initiated by the Russian authorities recently in order to establish a genuine rule of law, which will bring the TACIS appropriations allocated to Russia in 2000 to EUR 92 million at the most.
The only answer I can give you regarding the budget released in 2001 is that it will depend on the decisions the Council is induced to make at a later stage in the light of development of the situation in Russia.
This situation will be assessed in relation to the criteria for the progress to be achieved in terms of institutional reforms, democratisation, the strengthening of civil society and human rights protection throughout the territory of Russia.
Examination of the situation in Chechnya will thus clearly be part of the assessment process.
Question No 13 by (H-0624/00):
Subject: Incidents at the Matosinhos market During the night of 22 June 2000, various groups - probably coastal fishermen from Poboa de VarsÃ­m and Matosinhos according to various sources - used blunt instruments to break open the doors of four Spanish lorries containing sardines in front of the premises of the company Docapesa S.A. at Matosinhos market.
They then removed the fish from the lorries and sprayed it with diesel oil or similar products in order to damage it permanently, while uttering threats.
Apart from the damage caused to the four companies concerned - one of them calculated that the damage to the fish amounted to nine million pesetas and the damage to the vehicles to 300 000 pesetas - incidents of this kind should not be allowed to happen (a similar incident involving mackerel occurred in 1998).
What steps will the Council take to prevent any recurrence of such incidents, which are against the law but in particular are contrary to the spirit and principles underlying the European Union?
Does it plan to make any arrangements to compensate for the unfair and deliberate damage caused?
Mr President, the Council deeply regrets the incidents which occurred at the Matosinhos market during the night of 22 June 2000 and the losses incurred by the victims of these acts of violence.
It is important to stress, however, in this connection, that it is up to the individual Member States to ensure compliance with the regulations of the common fisheries policy and the free movement of goods, and to take appropriate measures within their national legislative systems. The offences in question should be punished in accordance with the terms of the criminal and civil law of the Member State concerned.
To this end, let me remind you that on 7 December 1998 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 on the functioning of the internal market in relation to the free movement of goods among the Member States, establishing procedures for the Commission to take action to require Member States, who alone are responsible for maintaining public order, to quickly remedy serious barriers to the free movement of goods caused by the actions of private individuals.
Mr President, first of all I would like to say that relations between Galicia and the North of Portugal have always been special, because the MiÃ±o river has never marked a boundary, it has not separated, but rather united.
However, unfortunate events such as those which took place on 22 June, caused by a small number of people, must not become the general rule.
It is therefore important to adopt measures which will prevent, in all events, their repetition and that the sanction adopted by the competent parties shall serve as an example.
Therefore, those of us from the other side of the river - and we are all Europeans - wanted to know how this issue is being dealt with and whether exemplary decisions have been taken so that these events will not be repeated in the future.
I can only repeat my previous answer, namely that the maintenance of public order and any application of penal sanctions are a matter, respectively, for the jurisdiction of the police forces and the legal authorities of the Member State concerned.
Let me quote the relevant part of the Regulation, which stipulates that, "Where the Commission considers that an obstacle is occurring in a Member State, it shall notify the Member State concerned of the reasons that have led the Commission to such a conclusion and shall request the Member State to take all necessary and proportionate measures to remove the said obstacle."
I therefore feel - and I am not saying that in order to duck the question, as we say - that the honourable Member would do better to address the question to the Commission, which does have the necessary means to provide a reliable and up-to-date response.
Mr President, Mr Moscovici, very serious attacks have also taken place in Finland on one certain means of livelihood, namely fur farming.
The principle of the freedom to pursue a trade is firmly upheld in the European Union.
Now, however, one Member State, Great Britain, has just banned fur farming in its territory.
Do you not think this might have harmful repercussions for the internal market in fur goods?
I would ask you to reply now, as President-in-Office of the Council, and not so much as a representative of the French Government. The French Government has already expressed its own views on the matter in the Agricultural Council.
I am answering on behalf of the Council and not on behalf of the French Government.
The situation you mention may share some of the features of the previous situation, but it is not the result of the same regulation, which is to do with fisheries issues.
I consequently feel entitled to ask you, please, to submit your question in the usual manner, i.e. in writing, and the Council will be pleased to respond.
I am not going to respond ad hoc to a question on such a difficult subject.
In support of the President-in-Office of the Council, I must point out that the Rules of Procedure for this Question Time state that supplementary questions must be closely related.
Question No 14 by (H-0625/00):
Subject: Public Council meetings One of the three goals of the French Presidency is to bring Europe closer to its citizens.
The logical consequence of this aim should, therefore, be to make Council proceedings more open.
How many fully public Council meetings will be held during the French Presidency from 1 July to 31 December 2000?
The French Presidency attaches special importance to ensuring that Council proceedings are accessible to the European citizens and that its legislative decisions are made in a transparent manner.
The public debates are, moreover, an established practice.
They lead to the European Union' s long-term evolution towards greater openness towards civil society.
Moreover, Rule 8 of the Council's Rules of Procedure provides for the organisation of public debates.
One of the top priorities of the French Presidency was, therefore, to draw up a list of public debates, covering a wide range of subjects, which was adopted by the Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER) on 5 July 2000.
Two debates were held in July, a debate on the presentation of the presidency' s programme at the General Affairs Council on 10 July 2000, and a second debate on the presidency programme at the ECOFIN Council on 17 July.
I must specify that six further public debates are scheduled to take place before the end of the French Presidency: a debate on general interest services on 28 September 2000 at the Internal Market, Consumers and Tourism Council - I shall have the honour of chairing this council meeting; a debate on maritime safety on 2 October 2000 at the Transport Council in Luxembourg; a debate on noise protection on 10 October 2000 as part of the Environment Council; and a debate on information, consultation of workers regarding employment on 17 October 2000, as part of the Employment and Social Policy Council, again in Luxembourg.
On 9 November 2000, there will be a public debate on young people and Europe as part of the Education and Youth Council.
Finally, on 20 November 2000, there will be a debate on food safety as part of the Agriculture Council.
I should like to draw the attention of the Members of the European Parliament to the fact that a substantial effort has already been devoted towards informing the public about the Council debates organised.
Over 3000 detailed reports of the public debates have been delivered by post.
Furthermore, any interested parties will easily be able to access the Internet networks which deal with this subject.
In addition, television channels have the opportunity to broadcast these debates, in total or in part, via the 'Europe by Satellite' channel.
Finally, the French Presidency strives to make as much information as possible on all Council proceedings available to the public on its Internet website, as well as subject indexes for the main topics under discussion.
I want to thank the Council for its detailed answer.
In an ordinary democracy it is, of course, the rule that all decisions concerning new laws are made publicly in a parliament and that the debates too are held in public.
The curious situation in the Council of Ministers is that the public only has access to certain debates.
There is therefore an obvious risk of meetings being closed in cases where more controversial subjects are being dealt with.
I therefore wonder whether the French Presidency, given its high level of ambition, will hold any entire meetings in public, that is to say ministerial meetings which, from beginning to end, with all the debates and all the decision-making, take place in public, without the doors being closed for any part of them.
Quite the opposite. I think I have shown that the French Presidency is determined to open debates up to the public as much as possible, and I believe that our programme is perfectly sound.
I should just like to remind the honourable Member of the different roles of the various institutions of the European Union.
It is true that the Council is co-legislator alongside the European Parliament, which does not fit into the pattern of the clear separation between executive and legislative power in the form that it may exist in a parliamentary democracy in the context of a State.
Let us be aware, at the same time, however, that the European Council is not just a legislative body but also an executive body, a function which, this time, is shared with the Commission, and that it undertakes a whole range of debates which have nothing to do with the legislative process.
Consequently, in the same way that these things are managed within a government, for that is what we are talking about here, the intergovernmental aspect, debates often take place in camera.
I am fortunate enough to be a member of the cabinet in the government of my country.
The French Council of Ministers in the ElysÃ©e Palace is not open to the press, nor is it filmed.
I consider this to be reasonable, as it is a context in which decisions must be taken which are then passed on to the citizens quite openly.
So there you are. It is because of this concept of the separation of powers that debates are designated as either open or closed.
I think that it is, quite frankly, to the Council' s credit that they have opened up some of these debates, running counter to what I was saying earlier about the operation of a government.
This is the situation we have, if we take the hybrid nature of the Council into due account.
Thank you very much, Mr Moscovici, for showing such dedication to Parliament this afternoon.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Question Nos 15 to 40 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Question to the Council.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.).
Economic and social development of Turkey
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Mr Morillon (A5-0206/2000) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation regarding the implementation of the measures to promote economic and social development in Turkey [7492/1/2000 REV - C5-0325/2000 - 1998/0300(COD)].
Mr President, the Council common position whose aim you have just stated has been referred back to Parliament for a second reading, not because of its content, but because of its form.
This could seem ridiculous, but it is not at all.
With regard to content, Parliament has agreed to commit EUR 135 million over the next five years to measures aiming to compensate Turkey for the sacrifices it has agreed to make in order to enter into a customs union with the European Union, and on this point there is no divergence with the Council.
With regard to form, we wanted to specify a number of areas in which the corresponding measures should be agreed as a priority, and the Council did not want to accept three of our proposals regarding the wording of a precautionary principle on the development of nuclear energy, in particular in earthquake zones.
The protection and recognition of the cultural identity of minorities and support for measures seeking to abolish capital punishment and, finally, perhaps most importantly, the development of any form of cooperation seeking to resolve the Kurdish problem.
I say that these matters of form are not trivial in a debate that precedes the one which is due to take place on accession in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in October, and following which, in November, I shall have to present the report on the state of progress of the work and any changes in attitudes within the European Union and Turkey.
Since the way to accession was reopened in Helsinki, nobody has been able to say where this newly-cleared path will lead, nor how long it will take to reach the end.
I think I can say that there is a broad consensus for granting Turkey a privileged position for geographical, historical, economic and political reasons, but I would also say that this privileged position can and must be envisaged within the European Union itself just as much as in close cooperation with the Union.
I say that this choice belongs, by democratic right, to the citizens of the European Union whom we represent here, and to the Turkish citizens themselves.
I understand that this was probably your opinion, Commissioner Verheugen, and I think I can guarantee you the support of a large majority of my colleagues in this area.
The decision on Turkey' s accession is too important for the future of the European Union and Turkey for it to be made in veiled silence, or even in secrecy, behind closed doors.
Long debates will be necessary, both here and in national parliaments, which is why everyone agrees that the road will be long and hard.
As rapporteur on enlargement, I was convinced of this, not only by the richness and passion of the debates that have already taken place in Parliament, but also by observing the reactions in Turkey itself, both in government circles and in civil society.
I shall come back to these contrasting reactions in detail when I present my report.
Today, I shall simply come to the main conclusion.
The people of Turkey consider that entry into the European Union will require not only a painless revision of their legal arsenal and the partial loss of their sovereignty, to which they remain attached, but also a radical change in their habits and mentality, for which they do not seem prepared.
This is why Parliament has proposed the creation of a Euro-Turkish forum, bringing together qualified representatives of the Turkish community and those Members of the European Parliament that have been given the task, for in-depth discussions.
I shall repeat this proposal in my report and I think I can say that the Turkish Government is not hostile to this, but quite the opposite, it would seem.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this long road, aware of the realities, I think the time has come to leave hypocrisy behind and not to continue to ignore the most important obstacles, including the Kurdish problem.
It would not occur to the French today to deny that a Corsican problem exists, even if the French citizens and their government are divided on the solutions.
There is a Kurdish problem in Turkey.
The Council must not forbid the European Parliament to propose its contribution to the solution.
If the text of this regulation is referred back for a second reading, it is not purely for a matter of form, but because Parliament refuses to accept this kind of political sleight of hand.
Mr President, I wholeheartedly concur with Mr Morillon' s suggestion that we abandon the hypocrisy with which we sometimes deal with certain real problems for reasons of political or other expediency.
There can, in my opinion, be no doubt that the issues covered in the three amendments rejected by the Council are real issues and that the Council position, or the sub-text at least, indicates a hypocritical disposition to sweep them to one side or underestimate their importance.
And yet, these three amendments, which reflect the firm views of the European Parliament, are all of fundamental importance and the rapporteur is right to insist that they be adopted: they contain a safeguard against the Turkish authorities' constructing nuclear power stations in earthquake zones, an express reference to the death penalty and a clear indication of Turkey' s obligation to recognise and protect the cultural identity of minorities, within the wider context of its obligation to respect the rule of law and human rights, and they highlight the undisputed Kurdish problem and the need to resolve it - but not, of course, by dropping Turkish bombs on civilians, as in the most recent bombings in the Kendakor region on 18 August.
I should like to hope that Parliament' s insistence on certain points being adopted will also help the Turkish side to understand, even if - as Mr Morillon rightly comments - it appears to be somewhat unwilling to understand, that the road towards Europe is not a one-way street of determination and patient understanding on the part of the European Union in the face of Turkey' s so-called special circumstances; it requires the same measure of determination on the part of the Turkish authorities and Turkish society to adjust to the rules of law and ethics which govern the European Union and which apply indiscriminately to all candidate countries; rules which, unfortunately, continue to be violated by Turkey, not only when it comes to the Kurdish problem and its democratic shortcomings, but also in numerous other cases, such as the Cyprus question and Greek-Turkish relations.
A real sea change in Turkey' s behaviour and attitude would go some way towards encouraging all those who, in a spirit of perhaps excessive optimism, opted to speed up Turkey' s advance towards Europe and would help to shorten the long and difficult road - to quote Mr Morillon once again - of Turkey' s admission to the European family.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like first of all to thank Mr Morillon very sincerely for the good work he has done and for his persistence in pushing through the demands and the most important amendments.
I am able to support him on behalf of my group, and I believe it must be possible to reach an agreement with the Council.
We are keen to use this instrument to promote economic and social development in Turkey.
Naturally, we hope that, parallel to this - and perhaps even as a result of it - political development in Turkey towards democracy and respect for human rights, in particular respect for its own Kurdish population, will also be strengthened, and the death penalty abolished.
However - and I have to say this again and again in this Chamber, and I also say it in Turkey- we are very dissatisfied with the pace of political development.
We could of course say that it is not our problem, and the fact that it is not prepared to make progress in this area more obvious and is not creating the political institutions for doing so is indeed Turkey' s own biggest problem.
Not so long ago, Turkey elected a new State President - a judge, and a highly respected one at that, and in fact with the support of the government.
And what does the government do as one of its first acts?
Over the summer, it sends its new State President a kind of emergency decree with a view to restricting some of the rights of people in government service. Then it wonders why, as a former high court judge, the President rejects the decrees he has been sent and says that the matter in question is one which Parliament must deal with, as is in fact fully to be expected in a democracy.
Now, I have as little sympathy for Islamic militants as many others in this House, especially when they adopt the fundamentalist approach much in evidence in these regions and also manifested today in the debate between the Presidents of the Israeli and Palestinian Parliaments.
The issue in question is one which has to be settled on a legal basis.
It is just not on, using an emergency decree suddenly to remove all Islamic fundamentalists from office, as the government wants to do.
Is there really a problem here?
Then it is one for Parliament to deal with.
The Kurdish problem has already been mentioned.
In that area too, scarcely any progress has been made.
Again and again, we see first positive, then negative signs.
Those who know that this is a crucial problem lack the courage to do anything about it.
You mentioned the Corsican problem.
I have to say that, in France too, the necessary courage is called for to tackle the problem after so many years.
I should like to see just a little of this courage in Turkey with a view to finding a real solution to the Kurdish problem too.
Of course, there are also other problems involving minorities.
The death penalty was mentioned.
How many times have we heard the conviction voiced that it must be abolished, and how long will it be before the relevant steps are taken?
The fact that Turkey is not taking these steps is something which cannot but disappoint those in this House - and I count myself among them - who would dearly like to see Turkey become a member of the European Union.
I nonetheless believe that, if we persist, we shall achieve what we have pledged. Our pledges can, and will be, fulfilled, and precisely on the issue of promoting economic and social development.
We are now waiting with bated breath to see whether Turkey will push ahead with political development on its own initiative.
Mr President, our relations with Turkey should promote democracy, stability and consistency.
The path to those goals is partly by way of social and economic development, and the way to social and economic development is partly by means of foreign investment.
The Union' s finance package will be an incentive to further investment in Turkey and, in the process, will also promote and consolidate democracy and human rights.
We have seen this strategy succeed in former dictatorships in Southern Europe, we shall see it work in Eastern and Central Europe, and it ought also to work in Turkey.
Parliament should support this strategy, and we should, at the same time, insist that, before there can be any question at all about membership negotiations, the Copenhagen criteria should be met as these relate to democracy and human rights.
Finally, I would emphasise the need to rebuild the thousands of Kurdish villages razed to the ground.
This ought to be an express priority in our policy on Turkey, and we must insist that the Turkish Government too make it a high priority.
In the same way, we must insist that the rights of the Kurdish minority are respected, just as the rights of minorities are respected in the countries of the Union and in the other candidate States.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his recommendation for second reading.
He is very familiar with the situation in Turkey.
He is aware of the problems of this country and of the people who live there.
It is no secret that Turkey cannot be democratic in our sense of the word until such time as the economic and social problems there have been solved.
It is also widely appreciated that Turkey will not be able to get on top of these problems alone and without our aid.
The demands contained in the rapporteur' s amendments - he talks of the protection of minorities, rightly demands the abolition of the death penalty and calls for a solution to the Kurdish problem - are in no way conditions designed to stand in the way of aid. Instead, they are valuable proposals for the necessary democratic reforms in Turkey.
At the very end of the day, Turkey will benefit from these reforms being put into practice.
To that extent, we support the rapporteur' s recommendation and thank him again for the work he has done.
Mr President, just nine months - or perhaps I should say already nine months - have passed since the Helsinki resolution granting Turkey candidate status.
At the time, we predicted that this resolution would not help, as many maintained, to bring about democratisation and improved living conditions for the Turkish people and that it would only encourage the regime to exercise ever greater oppression.
Nine months later, we are sorry to say that we were right because, to tell the truth, we would have preferred to have been proven wrong.
Now the Council has proposed releasing EUR 135 million for the economic and social development of Turkey.
We fear that a substantial proportion of this sum will be used, despite any controls carried out, to strengthen the machinery of oppression.
Allow me to give you some facts and figures.
As we all know, despite promises made from time to time, the constitution is still seriously undemocratic, the death penalty remains, Turkish jails currently house over 15,000 political prisoners in inhumane conditions, which are now being modernised with the introduction of solitary confinement, provoking outrage in Turkey, including in the Law Society of Istanbul, which has issued a special paper condemning these measures. There were arrests recently during events for world peace day on 1 September, Cyprus continues to be occupied and, as we are preparing to release funds, Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit has said that the Cyprus question was resolved in 1974, i.e. with the barbaric invasion and continuing occupation, demonstrating his disdain for UN resolutions.
And, I would add, Mr Gem says the same about Greek-Turkish relations.
Some people would do well not to boast and brag because these Greek-Turkish relations constantly result in the Greek Government' s backing down and that in itself is a source of further tension.
So do you want to use this money as bait so that you can penetrate the Turkish economy even further, so that you can plunder the Turkish people' s wealth even more?
We do not intend to say give it or withhold it, we simply want to point out the conditions under which and the reason why this money is being given.
Mr President, I fully support Mr Morillon' s excellent work, as presented by him and supplemented by Mr Swoboda.
I do not therefore intend to repeat arguments which I accept overall.
However, I should like to make a few comments.
The strange nature of relations between the European Union and Turkey, which we have experienced for many years, from the beginning and throughout, is due to the political problem which we call Turkey.
Thus, 9-10 months ago, Helsinki set a procedure in motion, essentially with an eye to resolving the problem which we call Turkey.
In this sense, and because Commissioner Verheugen, the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, is here with us, and given that there is a whole atmosphere surrounding the text which will shape the partnership between the European Union and Turkey, a text which we shall receive at a later date, I am certain that he will advocate incorporating everything included in the Helsinki resolutions on human rights, on Cyprus, on the Aegean and on crises in the text of the Treaty rather than in the preamble.
Take a look at Turkey. It is a law unto itself.
It radiates crisis on every side.
Those of us who live in the region are sick and tired of crises.
It is because of its political system that Turkey radiates these crises.
We recently heard statements by Turkish-Cypriots in Cyprus, who have at last come forward and condemned Turkey as an occupying force.
Only yesterday on the BBC I heard the head of a party of Turkish-Cypriots - Turkish-Cypriots, not settlers - half of whom have remained in Cyprus, appealing to the Turks to let them join the European Union. Turkey wanted to join and he felt that it should let them join earlier.
