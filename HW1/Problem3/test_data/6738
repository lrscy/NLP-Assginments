I think the Intergovernmental Conference is turning out as could have been expected.
I am not at all surprised by the developments in the Conference.
I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that I think that the Italian Presidency is doing well in some areas.
I think good progress is being made on certain subjects, such as the social clause.
This was something we did not succeed on in the Convention.
I think it would be a positive step if your Presidency succeeded in putting this on the agenda, and we could then see how many Socialist governments support the idea.
I also think that there are other matters on which you will manage to obtain reasonable agreements â the question of a European Public Prosecutor, for example.
If your proposal entailed a European Public Prosecutor who would deal with matters affecting the Unionâs financial interests, I think this House could accept it, provided that the Public Prosecutor was appointed using the ordinary legislative procedure rather than by a unanimous decision.
You have a consensus proposal here which, I think, will allow us to move forward.
There are, however, some other issues where the Italian Presidency has not sought to find a compromise solution, and I do not understand their reasoning.
Take the question of double majority, for example.
I do not see why the Italian Presidency has refused to come up with any alternative proposal to the Convention text when they have done so in several other cases.
Time is marching on.
I believe there is only one more ministerial meeting scheduled before the definitive Council meeting, and I am not sure we will achieve a result that will be acceptable to all parties.
Obviously, in political terms, this is not really the best time to be addressing the subject, since the breakdown of the Stability Pact seems to suggest that there are two different standards in use in the European Union â and I would appreciate it if you would pass these comments on to Mr Tremonti â which is not really helping to create a climate conducive to obtaining a consensus.
Unlike a previous speaker, however, I do feel that we have to complete our work by 13 December.
I do not think that having more time to consult our grandparents â to use the words of my fellow Member, who is not here at the moment â will lead to a better result.
I do not think it will work.
In my view, the situation is cut and dried: we are all familiar with the solutions that have been put forward, we know what alternatives are available, and I think we now have to give a political signal by approving the Constitution on 13 December.
That is the political signal we need to give.
I think enlargement is another reason why we need to do so.
Enlargement is the big gamble for Europe and for this Parliament, and has to go hand-in-hand with the political recasting embodied by the Constitution.
It would be very hard to explain if enlargement were completed on 1 May 2004 but for some reason there was no Constitution.
I therefore urge you to persevere, and call on the national governments to demonstrate pride in the European Constitution, to forget national interests and consider that what we need at the present time is a Constitution for a Union of both States and citizens, which will allow us to work together in the exciting period the coming years represent.
So, keep up the good work, President-in-Office of the Council.
Keep on trying to reach agreement.
Keep on working towards completion on 13 December.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the very outset, I would like to give the Italian Council Presidency credit for its intensive efforts, in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, to keep as close as possible to what the Convention produced and also to offer solutions that go beyond that.
Let me give two examples: the explicit reference to equal opportunities for women and men as being among the values of the European Union was not of the Conventionâs doing.
That you should propose it, and that it should be accepted, amounts to progress, and that is something we should make clear.
Your proposal that decisions in specific areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy should, subject to certain conditions, be reached by qualified majority voting, goes beyond what the Convention came up with, and that is something I explicitly underline in order to make clear the extraordinarily positive role you play in this.
I do, however, have to tell Mr Brok, who is now no longer present, that what you have proposed with regard to the European Central Bank does not interfere with the Bankâs independence.
It goes no further than what we want for other areas, that being that decisions on specific technical issues should be capable of being taken by a simplified procedure, and that means that if the Heads of Government want to change something, they have to do so unanimously.
Unanimity remains in place; the only thing is that, if we want to sort out technical issues, we do not have to set the whole process of revising the Treaties and the Constitution in motion.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we all see this as a quite crucial point, and I would ask the Council Presidency to see it in that light too.
As regards Parliamentâs budgetary rights, both in medium-term financial planning and in the annual Budget, we cannot and will not accept less than what we have already.
Such a thing cannot be acceptable to a democratically elected parliament, and we will resist it with all the means at our disposal.
I might add that I welcome the unambiguous stance taken up by the Commission on this point.
We may well not always be on the same side, but, in this instance, Mr President of the Commission, we are glad of your support, for our allies are thin on the ground where this is concerned.
I am glad that you are numbered among them, as also is the Presidency of the Council.
There is one final point that I would like to address.
I, too, have my criticisms of Naples.
Like Mr Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, I came away from Naples more depressed than I was when I went there.
My worry is that we are leaving open many issues that will then be squeezed into the package for the Heads of State or Government, and that we will then end up with a repeat of this ânight of Niceâ and its compromise, not merely on the lowest common denominator, but with a collection of compromises, completely unrelated and mutually contradictory.
The danger of a repeat performance of Nice in Brussels on 13 December has become greater since Naples.
My fear is that we will then end up with this peculiar ârendezvous clauseâ.
For over ten years, ever since Maastricht, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that really has been the customary flight response of the Heads of State or Government.
At Maastricht, we said that we needed the political unification of Europe.
We postponed it, deciding that we would do it later.
Then we had Amsterdam, and then its celebrated leftovers.
They were then deferred until Nice, where you could not sort it out, and so we passed it on to the Convention.
Now the Convention has come up with a proposal.
Please, I beg you, Mr President-in-Office, do not do the same thing again!
The situation is getting no better.
If there are more leftovers from any decision taken on 13 December, then the European public as a whole will see that as a failure on the part of the European Unionâs Heads of State or Government.
Mr President-in-Office, I urge you to prevent such a failure.
They will be judged not only on their ability to achieve a result, but also to propagate a solution â and so will you.
Â Â  President, this Friday, 5 December 2003, the parliamentary members of the Convention will meet up again to consider the progress of the Intergovernmental Conference, to speak with Mr Frattini and Mr Giscard dâEstaing, and to make joint proposals to the IGC.
The main thrust of our deliberations will be to support the work of the Italian presidency in defending the work of the Convention, but I fully agree with Mr HÃ€nsch that we will fight the notion of clauses on key elements of the package.
Procrastination will not make tricky decisions simpler to solve: the time to act decisively is now.
Nor will we approve proposals to inflate the size and distort the shape of the Commission - or indeed this Parliament - to avoid concessions to the self-esteem of Member States.
Such ploys do not contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of those authorities, and to ignore the settled will of this Parliament is certain to jeopardise the prospects of the new settlement being brought into force.
It will sour the political atmosphere and wound the democratic legitimacy of the Union.
The Presidents of the Council and of the Commission should be absolutely clear that the IGC cannot take our consent for granted.
Â Â  Mr President, of course the workers, the peoples of our countries, do not expect the Council summit to talk to them about the reality they experience on a daily basis as the result of the policy of the centre right or centre left governments of the European Union.
They experience on the ground the increase in unemployment, shrinking incomes, the campaign against and even the abolition of the eight-hour day and their other rights as a result of the famous Lisbon agenda, the application of which is to be assessed by the Council.
They know that all this is being promoted in the name of competitiveness and productivity, with the sole objective of increasing the profits of big business in the European Union.
This is also the more general objective of the constant reduction in labour costs, even where we have increased rates of growth, such as in Greece, where the workers are the most productive and the worst paid in the European Union.
As with all the other issues which will be discussed, such as the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Constitution, which institutionalises capitalism, the further militarisation and autocracy of the European Union, the strengthening of repressive anti-labour mechanisms, the â as far as the peoples are concerned, negative â enlargement with ten new countries and immigration and asylum policy, the sole aim of the Council summit is to safeguard and increase the profits and the power of big business in the European Union.
The continuing occupation of Iraq is also resulting solely in increased profits and is continuing to claim victims among the Iraqi people, as well as among the conquerors and their allies as a result of the justified resistance of the Iraqi people.
So the European Council in Brussels will not only not change these political orientations, but will also take measures to reinforce and legally safeguard them.
In my opinion, the only way to change this situation is develop resistance and counterattack by the peoples, which fortunately are burgeoning constantly.
We shall do everything within our power to strengthen this prospect.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by associating myself with Mr Watsonâs determined protest against the grave and ongoing violations of human rights in the USAâs prison camps.
Let me now turn to the Intergovernmental Conference.
I ask myself why in fact the governments summoned a Convention, when, even without one, they could still have had the age-old spectacle of the nations haggling over their interests.
While the governments are turning the Convention draft inside out, we in this House have gone back to drafting resolutions, repeating ourselves, protesting against the eternal sameness of things, but to no avail, with neither a response nor even a serious debate to show for it.
The question we should be asking ourselves is what we should be doing.
The governments think they know what our response is going to be; we gave it to them after the partial failure of Amsterdam.
It was, âthis is better than nothing.â
Then, after Nice, where the failure was complete, we gave it to them again: âthis is better than nothing.â
Now I have come to believe that a bad constitution is not better than nothing.
We should make it plain to the governments that it is not they who are the masters of the treaties, but the parliaments and the people they represent, and that it is these who can bring this constitution down.
We are then told in tones full of emotion that the dignity of every single Member State must be safeguarded.
What about Europeâs dignity?
Nobody said a word about that.
I cannot imagine that the dignity of any single Member State demands that the principles of the separation of the powers and of the public nature of lawmaking be violated, or that the legislative council â the Conventionâs big idea for greater democracy â be done away with.
I cannot imagine that the dignity of a Member State demands that the undoubted legitimacy of dual majority be traded for the lottery of Nice.
I cannot imagine that the dignity of a Member State means that more laws have to be passed in Council, or that more offences against parliamentarianism and the public nature of lawmaking are called for.
That has nothing whatever to do with national dignity, which does not require an attack on Parliamentâs budgetary rights.
In the last debate, and in the corridors and behind the scenes, I have heard people calling for compromise.
To hear Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo speak about it, you would think it was about this House renouncing its loyalty to the Convention and setting out on the treacherous ice of compromise.
We are offered compromises only when we are in retreat.
We are offered negotiations only when democracy and the rights of Parliament are disputed.
Nobody seems to me to be offering to negotiate concerning our demands over and above the Intergovernmental Conference.
This time, we should make it plain that a bad constitution is not better than nothing.
Â Â  Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, like MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, I also take the view that there is no hurry, because the Nice declaration, which started the entire process, scheduled the Intergovernmental Conference for 2004 and I believe that a good and long-lasting agreement which takes a long time to reach is better than a bad agreement reached quickly.
I must, however, acknowledge the merits of the Italian Presidency and the progress that appears to have been started in Naples.
Naples represents a very positive step in the development of the Intergovernmental Conference, on which I heartily congratulate the Italian Presidency, and which has given rise to positive expectations in many areas.
It would be extremely damaging now to disappoint these expectations.
Progress was also made on enshrining the rule of one Commissioner per Member State with full and equal status.
The limits imposed on the powers of the President of the European Council is to be welcomed, as is the creation of a diversified and versatile system for the rotating presidencies of the various formations of the Council, replacing the unnecessary elimination of the rotating presidency system.
I welcome the rejection of the so-called âsimplifiedâ methods of revising the Treaties, which would constitute an abuse of the traditional model of international and constitutional law.
Having said this, however, some points still present cause for concern and on these I would appeal to the common sense of Europeâs leaders and to the imagination of the Italian Presidency.
Firstly, the principle of the primacy of Community law must be clarified and in a way that does not destroy the very principle of national sovereignty.
Secondly, the transparency and openness of the legislative workings of the Council must be guaranteed, since the prospect of our having a legislative Council appears, unfortunately, to have been abandoned.
Thirdly, there must be considerable caution and limitations imposed on the passerelleclauses: these must not be seen as a means of re-establishing so-called simplified methods â which are also irregular, in my opinion â of revising the Treaties.
Next, there is no need to use this too âforward-lookingâ vocabulary, including âministerâ or the word âconstitutionâ itself.
A solution must also be found to the issue of recognising the heritage of Christianity, of the Judaeo-Christian religion, together with other components of Europeâs historical and spiritual inheritance, and the secular nature of the institutions must be confirmed.
One would have to be extremely intolerant and prejudiced not to accept the proposal of the Italian Presidency.
I wish to say a few words on the issue of qualified majority voting, which Spain and Poland appear to see as an obstacle: we are in favour of parity (60% plus 60%).
Spain must understand that it is the largest of the medium-sized countries and not the smallest of the large countries.
Europe needs more medium-sized countries, not more countries obsessed with the idea that they are large.
This is extremely important for the development of Europeâs common interest.
Â Â  â Mr President, the comments made by the President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Antonione, concerning the progress made at the Intergovernmental Conference give us great hopes of the final outcome of the proceedings in terms not only of adherence to the timetable but, above all, in terms of content.
There has been no backsliding over the text adopted by the Convention, and the Italian Presidencyâs resolve not to brook any compromise merely for the sake of having the Treaty signed has therefore paid off.
Mr President, Parliament, which, this week, has the task of encouraging the Member States to reach an agreement that will, at last, give Europe its first constitutional charter, cannot but agree with the position adopted by the Presidency.
President Cox has rightly insisted on the need to act effectively with due haste.
We fully support his comments and share his sentiments completely, but we do not identify with the comments of those pessimists who appear to want to throw in the towel at the sight of any difficulty.
I therefore support, President Antonione, your comments in favour of abandoning national particularism.
Europe cannot miss this extraordinary opportunity.
I am certain that no State will want to be held accountable for shattering a dream.
Finally, as a member of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I call on the Intergovernmental Conference once again to insert in the preamble an explicit reference to Europeâs Judaeo-Christian roots.
Lastly, Mr Watson, a word on the Guantanamo question: you speak Italian well, you understand it very well and I hope you read it too, because, according to the reports I have read in the Italian press, it appears that, on more than one occasion, the Presidency of the Council has called on the US authorities to respect human rights in Guantanamo as well.
Â Â  â Mr President, foreign policy discussions at the Brussels Summit will take place in two contexts â that of the constitutional debate and that of concrete foreign policy problems.
Taking the constitutional debate first, I would like to wholeheartedly endorse what President Prodi had to say.
We have to become actors on the international stage rather than spectators.
And, as this is not just about the content â although it certainly is that too â but also about the name, I would also like to speak in support of Mr Antonione, who stated plainly that this is â and must be â about a foreign minister.
We are not talking here about a High Representative or an ambassador, but about a European foreign minister, not supplanting the national foreign ministers, but supplementing them and organising their work more effectively.
Secondly, while I am on the subject of foreign policy, let me say that we have a problem, and â if I may discuss it briefly with Mr Antonione, let me say that the problem is the Middle East.
In recent days, we have seen an agreement reached â known as the Geneva accord â which is a private agreement by two people and many others from Israel and Palestine, and the Council wants to consider this matter actually only one and a half weeks after the event.
Never before though has a private agreement been given such prominence by the media, never before has an agreement called forth such high hopes, and never before has an agreement been so perfectly in line with European foreign policy, so I hope that the Council will indeed turn its attention to this Geneva initiative and will indicate our support for it even more strongly than Secretary of State Colin Powell â thank God! â has done, because, although it could be a European initiative, it is even more valuable by reason of its originating from the region itself, from men and women who know what continued suffering would be like, and without whom there would be no accord.
If it is Europe that has to be the base for the decisive campaign against terrorism, that has to do with the fact that terrorism will spread â as it has done in recent weeks â for as long as the problem in the Middle East is no closer to a solution â a solution which, it must be conceded, can be arrived at only step by step.
With this in mind, we profoundly regret the terrorist attacks in Istanbul.
Like New York, Istanbul is not only a city of many ethnicities, it is positively symbolic of how they can cooperate, and terrorism of course militates against such association and relationships across ethnic lines.
I also think we have to give Turkey solidarity and support, but that does not mean that terrorism brings with it some sort of bonus, and, like the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, I am very much in favour of us proceeding exactly as we have done before, with criteria that are objective and subject to scrutiny.
Terrorism must not be allowed to affect Turkeyâs position either for the worse or for the better.
In closing, I would like to mention something to which many other Members have referred.
I rarely concern myself with budgetary matters, but, whatever our nationality or whatever the social or political grouping to which we belong, all of us in this House are aware of the importance of every parliamentâs rights when it comes to drawing up budgets, and I just want to support you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
This Houseâs position is clear.
We are not just drawing up a resolution.
One may ask, as Stalin once asked the Vatican, âwhere are your armies?â, but how is a European constitution to be brought into being on the back of referendums and by national parliaments if it meets with massive resistance from this House?
This is what I ask you to accept: no curtailments, at any rate not of the rights of this House, Europeâs freely elected and democratic institution.
Â Â  â Mr President, Europe still rates opportunism more highly than it does formal agreements.
Large countries can apparently get away with more than small ones.
French and German flouting of the rules of the Stability Pact has delivered a serious blow to the confidence of the Dutch people in the European Union.
The man on the street wonders why he should support a new treaty if it is uncertain that it will be observed.
It is important that discussion of the Stability Pact should not be avoided, particularly in the light of the referendums about the Constitution.
The referendum will be more about context than about the text of the treaty.
It will be a yardstick for confidence.
We set great store by the Convention's proposals concerning the voting procedure in the Council and Parliament's full budgetary rights.
As far as we are concerned, however, the Member States may retain their fully-fledged Commissioners.
If legitimacy is to be enhanced, then they must be directly elected by the European Parliament, without any nominations by the European Council.
However, only when in Europe, agreements are more important than political opportunism will public confidence have a real chance of growing.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to address a theme raised by the President-in-Office of the Council which nobody else has yet spoken about but which, for more than one person in this House, is of great moment and significance.
The President-in-Office mentioned that the question is being raised as to whether the minimum number of MEPs per state is too low.
Is it wrong to retain a relatively low basic membership in a new and enlarging Union?
Let us pause and reflect upon this.
At the moment, in Britain which is composed of three nations, England, Scotland and Wales Wales is currently represented in this House by five Members.
After the new Constitution comes into effect, if it does, the number of Members representing Wales in this House will drop to four.
Malta will have five.
I do not object at all to Malta having five Members: it is a fine thing for small countries to have proper representation.
As a Scot, how could I think otherwise?
We must not forget, however, that the principle of degressive proportionality has a deep justification.
Degressive proportionality says that every state in this Union must be represented in this House by a sufficient number of MEPs so as fully to express the political diversity of that state.
Rightly, therefore, even the 400 000 citizens of Malta should have at least five Members, but perhaps no more.
If you insist, rightly, on keeping a maximum ceiling of membership, the upshot of increasing yet further the degressive proportionality threshold above five will be to cut the representation of significant parts of existing Member States.
In the debates we had about the competences of the Union, Mr Lamassoure reminded the House of the importance of partner regions, countries like Flanders, Galicia, Euskadi and, indeed, Scotland.
These are significant parts in the Union.
If you cut their representation you deny them the degressive proportionality on which you rightly insist for countries such as Malta or Cyprus.
Do not do that.
This is not a trivial point.
At the Convention, as a Member representing Scotland, I tried many times to alert colleagues to the significance of entrenching certain aspects of the common fisheries policy that are unacceptable to us.
I was not heeded.
The upshot of that is that it will be impossible for me, as a strong supporter of this idea of a European Constitution, to persuade my political colleagues in Scotland to back ratification of the text because I now know that on that point it will not be changed.
My appeal was neglected.
Had I been representing a larger force I might have been heard.
What a pity!
Do not neglect degressive proportionality for the of the states of the Union in insisting on it for the states.
Â Â  Mr President, the British Conservatives i.e. the European Democrats do not support the idea that the proposed European Union constitution as discussed currently at the IGC in Rome is merely a tidying-up exercise.
We believe it significantly alters the balance of power between Member States and the European Union institutions.
We believe it is one more stage in the process of setting up a federal super-state with its flag, currency, army and now constitution, rather than a simplifying treaty basing itself on a unique supranational creation between sovereign Member States.
We are concerned at the new, high-profile role of the Council President and the proposed Foreign Minister and EU legal personality, which will enhance the perception that the EU is a state and will shortly be demanding membership of the UN Security Council.
We are opposed to the passerelle clauses which jeopardise our veto rights over taxation, social security and, most worryingly, CFSP, which includes security and defence.
Theoretically, it becomes possible for a new British Government to be out-voted over the deployment of its own troops already committed by a previous administration.
We have also seen concessions over a separate planning headquarters for autonomous EU operations, which will play into the hands of isolationist US strands who will be happy to see Europeans go it alone as they question the need to keep the US tied into NATO, an organisation which in my view has served us well for so long.
We reject the Charter of Fundamental Rights - with its vague rights to jobs, health and social security - becoming legally binding.
It is a recipe for the activism of the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice in its agenda to enforce the social market economy and undermine the Thatcherite economic reforms of the 1980s which made my country a magnet for foreign direct investment.
Lastly, we are adamant that such major constitutional changes require a full public debate in all the Member States.
With particular reference to my country, I call upon Prime Minister Blair to allow the British people a say through a referendum on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Â Â  Mr President, could I issue you with a special invitation?
If, over the Christmas holidays, you are in the wonderful city of Bolton, please come and join me in a visit to my local pub because you will surprised to discover that most people there are not talking about qualified majority voting, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Intergovernmental Conference.
They are talking about other issues.
I mention that point not to denigrate the discussions on the Constitution, which are important but, rather, to emphasise that the endless institutional debate that we have does not bring us closer to the electorate because it does not address the issues which voters regard as very important.
Since I became a Member in 1989 we seem to have had endless institutional debate.
We must stop that institutional debate, because it is vital for the political legitimacy of the EU that we come to an agreement in this IGC quickly but, more importantly, that we come to an agreement that will stick.
I agree with Mr HÃ€nsch that we cannot carry on endlessly with one IGC dealing with the leftovers of another IGC.
When we get an agreement that sticks, we can then start to focus properly on the sorts of issues which concern the citizens of a Europe of 25 Member States.
We need to start making practical progress.
Let us not take it for granted that enlargement is on course to happen smoothly.
We must make sure that candidate countries fulfil the requirements set out by the Commission in its latest annual report.
We must ensure that the accession of these countries to the European Economic Area something people forget about - goes very smoothly, because that has not been the case until now.
We must not lose sight of Romania and Bulgaria, or their objective of joining in 2007.
We must continue our work on Turkey and, as Mr Swoboda says, show greater solidarity with that country, particularly at this time.
We must also look at other issues concerning our citizens: more and better jobs.
We must revitalise the Lisbon process and ensure that we have an active social policy that gets people into work.
As Wim Kok's report has shown, there are too many people excluded from the labour market and we are building a wall between those who have a job and those who do not have a job.
We must do much more with respect to that.
In particular, Member States must stop dragging their feet.
It is the Member States who are dragging their feet on Lisbon and on the European arrest warrant.
Crime is important to our citizens and we need more Member States to actually ratify that.
Member States are also largely responsible for the fact that the European Court of Auditors, in its a yearly reports, tells us that it cannot trace all the accounts because of the way Member States spend the money.
We need to demand much more of Member States.
On security policy, I welcome the progress being made but let us ensure that we focus on capability rather than institutional structures because we will only be judged by how capable we are.
If I could ask for a Christmas present given that I still believe in Father Christmas I should like to see IGC conclusions which are agreed upon, which are upheld and which leave no leftovers.
I would like us to focus on delivery for our citizens, because that is what the European Union will be judged on.
Â Â  Thank you for your kind invitation, MrÂ Titley.
Â Â  Mr President, the President-in-Office of Council said that the European Union will not fail to give a welcome to legal migrants.
This looks hypocritical since the Council agreed a very restrictive text on family reunion rights.
Indeed it is so mean, that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market advises that the European Parliament should seek the annulment of this text in the European Court on grounds of a breach of the family rights provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.
I welcome that.
The Council has been left in no doubt as to the strength of feeling in this House about the internment without due process of Guantanamo Bay prisoners.
As co-rapporteur on this topic, I am helping to prepare a submission from this Parliament to the Supreme Court, but only the Council can make representations on behalf of the EU as a whole.
It has already signed a legal cooperation agreement with the US, so the Americans cannot dispute the Council's legal status.
It would be outrageous if governments such as the UK Government doing bilateral deals frustrated a Council initiative.
Even if we get Europeans back from Guantanamo Bay, we must speak up for the rest of the 650 detainees.
As we are showing on steel tariffs, if the EU punches its weight, the US takes notice.
Â Â  Mr President, as a citizen of the Spanish state, I wish to tell this Parliament that the views of the majority of my fellow citizens are by no means represented by the positions that the Spanish Prime Minister, JosÃ©Â MariaÂ Aznar, is trying to impose. These call for the implementation of the voting system set out in Nice precisely the opposite of the one approved by the Commission, which involves a double majority of States and citizens.
In his attempt to keep this arbitrary power of veto, which was won at serious cost to the Spanish representation in this Parliament, MrÂ Aznar will be representing himself alone and will be confirming his status as the most unhelpful and intransigent political leader in Europe.
JosÃ©Â MariaÂ Aznar is trying fraudulently to hijack the draft European Constitution to block the progress of the national governments of Galicia, the Basque Country and Catalonia in the context of a multinational State, attempting to have things included in the draft that, if accepted, would prevent the future reunification of Ireland, because it would change the borders of the United Kingdom and of Ireland and would also prevent Gibraltar being handed back to the Spanish State.
I will conclude by recalling that yesterday fifteen more immigrants perished off the coasts of the Spanish State and I believe that we should bear this fact in mind in order to implement the political measures necessary to prevent any repetition of such events.
Â Â  Mr President, I trust that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will not satisfy us even less than the outcome of the Convention satisfied us.
I should like to make two or three brief comments about this.
First, the final arrangements for defence and foreign policy are very important.
I welcome any progress achieved.
I should like it to be more substantial, especially as regards the unified assistance clause but, in all events, it is good for us to show that we learned from the war in Iraq.
Secondly, all the Member States should be represented in the Commission.
In Greece, in particular, it would make a very bad impression if the smaller countries were not represented.
Thirdly, it is better for us to have no agreement in December if the agreement is not going to be satisfactory.
Having said which, a few brief comments about the sector which particularly concerns me in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, transport.
Mr Prodi, there is the development initiative to incorporate the programme on priority trans-European networks, Quick Start, which is to be discussed.
The impression has been given that Parliament is being bypassed and that the decision will be taken solely by the European Council at the Commissionâs proposal.
Apart from the fact that this is wrong, it is also contrary to Community law and Parliament is not prepared to accept it.
We are joint legislators as far as the trans-European networks are concerned and we shall claim our rights until the end.
Having said which, there is the question of substance.
We can draw green and red lines on the map and say, âThere you are, new roads and railways!â, but the trans-European networks must be funded.
So there must be the political will on the part both of the Member States and the European Commission, so that, with the public and private sectors working together, we can proceed as quickly as possible in this direction.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by asking you to forgive me for arriving late.
Life penalises those who arrive too late, unlike the Vice-President, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, who has been a bit lenient in still giving me the opportunity to speak, for which I am very grateful.
Speaking on behalf of my group, but also of the German Social Democrats in particular, I want to thank our own government and the Italian Presidency of the Council.
Mr Antonione, my expression of gratitude to the Italian Presidency of the Council may perhaps be rather surprising, but it is very emphatic, as I get the impression that the Italian Presidency of the Council is making a respectable effort when it comes to defending the outcome of the Convention and to keep in check a number of foolish courses of action that are evidently dominating the Intergovernmental Conference.
I know that my own government, that of the Federal Republic of Germany is currently, in the Intergovernmental Conference, making valiant attempts to talk certain Member Statesâ governments out of their belief that they do not have to take on board any of the progressive things that the Convention has decided on for Europe and to lead them into the way of compromise.
For this, we Members of the European Parliament must be especially grateful, for anything else would gravely endanger the European Union both as it is today and as it will be.
I want to pick out two points that we regard as positively essential in their significance.
The first has to do with this Houseâs budgetary rights.
It would appear to be the case that a number of finance ministers have persuaded their governmental colleagues â but not, it is to be hoped, the Heads of Government â to limit unanimity on the Financial Perspective and to change over to mere consultation rather than approval, thereby both restricting a right of the European Parliament and also qualifying Parliamentâs right to give final approval in the Budget procedure â which is actually the most powerful right that this House possesses in the Budget procedure â by making it a right shared between the Council and Parliament.
It would appear that some are determined, as part of the constitution-framing process, to have this core right of the European Parliament in their sights.
The only thing one can say to this is that if you want to give Europe a constitution, you cannot be serious in attacking in this way the right to approve the Budget, which is the prerogative of the future main legislative authority, namely the European Parliament.
So let me tell you that those who would take an axe to our budgetary rights are taking an axe to the constitution in its entirety, so we in this House would be well advised to send an unambiguous signal to the Intergovernmental Conference to the effect that this is something that Parliament takes very seriously indeed.
This leads me to mention a second point.
We believe that we have to compromise on the distribution of votes and on the composition of the Commission, and that both sides can and must live with those compromises.
It is quite clear to me that the smaller Member States fear that they will be outnumbered.
Their fears may or may not be justified; it is not for me to pass judgment on that.
Whatever compromise eventually emerges, this House must not lose sight of the fact that, in the next Parliament, there will be 732 MEPs, and that is quite a lot to start with.
It is quite possible that, between 2007 and 2009, the number of MEPs in this House will increase to 800.
Against the eventuality of further attempts to inflate the number of MEPs, I can tell you that we do not want to become a sort of Chinese Peopleâs Congress; we want to be a working parliament.
To this issue too, I ask the Council, its Italian Presidency â which, I know, is trying to get sense to prevail â and the Intergovernmental Conference, to actually find a solution that will enable this Parliament to keep on working.
I arrived late and I have spoken for too long, so thank you, Mr President, for everything.
Â Â  I am sure that all colleagues will be glad that you finally made it and were able to speak.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when the Convention was set up, it was a unique historic decision, based on the idea that â in broadly based dialogue with the people â elected representatives, governments and EU institutions should, in an open and thoughtful way, prepare the EU for enlargement and the future.
In spite of many sceptics, the Convention proved to be a great success.
A proposal for a European Constitution was put forward that, although deficient in a number of ways, is, in very general terms, a very good compromise.
I think that Altiero Spinelli must have been smiling from beyond the grave when the proposal was put forward in June 2003.
What is going on now is embarrassing.
It is as if the Convention had never been held, and the Council were back in the old Nice routine with all the hullabaloo and horse trading going on behind closed doors.
Do you never learn?
The EU faces huge tasks.
It must grow, reform itself and engage in deeper cooperation.
Moreover, it has major problems of legitimacy.
The row about the Stability and Growth Pact has scarcely improved the EUâs reputation.
People deserve better than a watered-down compromise seasoned with national interests.
They deserve a democratic, dynamic and energetic EU.
They deserve to be taken seriously through having the work done by their representatives in the Convention respected.
I therefore wish to appeal to the Italian Presidency: do not disappoint them.
Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, I understand your enthusiasm but the gallery does not take part in the sitting.
I would therefore ask you please to be quiet.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is Parliamentâs last opportunity to express its mind in the form of a resolution before the Intergovernmental Conference on a new European constitutional treaty, which we hope will complete its work before the end of December.
That the Conventionâs draft was important as a foundation is not in dispute, but nor is there any dispute about the need for various points in it to be improved.
One hopes that all the politicians want to bring the work to completion and to find a compromise with which all parties can live, including on the composition of the Commission, with each Member State having one Commissioner who is entitled to vote.
Public opinion in the EU is one reason why we should not create Commissioners of unequal weight.
Something else to be welcomed is the European Court of Justiceâs monitoring of the decisions of the EU Council, which will make for judicial control and transparency.
There is also a need to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact, not only to make it more solid and substantial, but also to improve its flexibility, for there must be no repetition of what has just happened with Germany and France â bad examples must not be allowed to catch on.
In security and defence policy, a commitment to mutual assistance along the lines of ArticleÂ 51 of the UN Charter should have a permanent place as a self-evident act of solidarity in a shared Europe.
Issues of the weighting of votes in the Council should not be over-valued; after all, in the European Unionâs political practice, it is usual to arrive at a consensus and a compromise in which âsmall or largeâ is not the determinative issue.
The dual majorities â 15 States, 60% of the population â appear sensible, and I agree with those Members who say that Parliamentâs original budgetary rights are important and must not be curtailed.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am concerned about the ungodly practices of our governments, who have first concluded a deal with the European Parliament and the national parliaments â known as the positively rated draft Constitution â and then proceed to carry on as they please, with business as usual, and repeat the very practices that caused Nice to fail.
Citizens stand to gain a great deal by this draft Constitution.
The Constitution offers us more democracy and enables us to achieve more concrete results in areas that matter in Europe.
Neither I, nor the citizen, lie awake at night thinking about the trifling details which everyone seems to get het up about.
One vote more or less, every Member State having its own Commissioner â or even two for the big boys â or a puppet on a string at the helm of the European Council.
These are not the core issues.
I go along with the idea of each country having its own Commissioner.
What matters is that Europe is able to catch criminals who completely ignore national borders, that we speak with one voice in foreign policy and that there are enough good jobs for everyone.
The Heads of Government should finally stop whinging and accept that what we have seen come out of the Convention is â subject to a few minor practical changes â the best solution for all of us and for an enlarged and deepened Europe.
They should not pretend that citizens consider their bickering about power and people as important.
That is for the little boys who compare their brawn in the playground, but not for the citizens.
The public want to see results, and we can obtain those results with the new Constitution.
More rights for Parliament and more codecision in the fields of justice and home affairs, agriculture and budget.
Many of my fellow-MEPs have already said that if the Finance Ministers get their own way, Parliamentâs rights will revert back to what they were before 1975.
That is wholly unacceptable.
We would then cross a line which we would certainly advise against approaching.
That will have an effect on all referendums here in Europe.
We now have to act on behalf of our citizens as a matter of urgency.
Accordingly, information is required in good time, otherwise the citizens will not be able to make their views known in the many referendums that will be held about the Constitution.
Europe needs the Constitution, because on 1 May, ten new countries will be joining, and they should not join without any clear rules.
Such an historic reunification should not founder because Heads of Government behave in a wholly unacceptable manner, throwing their weight around and refusing to accept an adult outcome.
: either you agree to the present proposal as Heads of Government or you are opposed to it.
But beware: less democracy and fewer rights for Parliament means that Parliament will be obstructive.
The governments should not think that the deal can be thwarted only from their end.
They should also realise that they cannot let things get that far.
That would be a God-awful shame, irrespective of the fact whether God is incorporated in the Constitution or not!
On St Nicholas Day, which is nearly upon us, we in the Netherlands always give presents to each other.
The Heads of Government should also push out the boat this year, and give us a Constitution that is worthy of the European citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, in the run-up to the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Naples, pessimism about the likely outcome was evident.
Credit must therefore be accorded to the Italian presidency for the significant progress that it made on very sensitive issues.
In particular, I welcome the agreement that was reached on structured cooperation on defence and the positive signals emerging relating to the creation of an EU Foreign Minister and one Commissioner with full voting rights per Member State, and also the budgetary powers of Parliament.
Despite this progress, much work needs to be done.
To have an effective influence on the world stage, we must end our paralysis in Common Foreign and Security Policy decision-making.
The presidency's proposals for the use of qualified majority voting, and acting on the proposal for an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs, represent a step in the right direction.
However, I would like to see progress in a number of other areas:
The proposal that there should be a full-time President of the European Council has the potential to undermine both the role of both the President of the Commission and the Foreign Minister.
Up to now, the only permanent presidency in existence was that of the Commission.
As the President of the Council will have responsibilities in the field of CFSP, this could conflict with the role of Foreign Minister and could cause confusion as to who authoritatively speaks for the EU in this field.
It would be more sensible to refer to this post as 'Chair' of the European Council and not 'President'.
In congratulating the presidency on the progress made to date, I would also like to issue a warning.
The draft Constitution represents a bottom line compromise.
Agreement at the Intergovernmental Conference is therefore not solely a matter for Member State governments.
If the outcome of the IGC is to be ratified successfully it must also secure the consent of other institutions such as the European Parliament, the European Commission and members of national parliaments.
The Italian presidency would ignore this reality at its peril.
Â Â  Mr President, it is quite clear from discussions that everyone wants to finish in December.
The problem is that everyone wants to make their concessions at the last possible minute - and preferably not at all.
So there is a danger that despite a general willingness to conclude at the December European Council, we end up, as in Nice, with it going on long into the night with last-minute deals cobbled together.
There is a danger that no agreement will be reached at all.
At the moment, Member States to a degree are still posturing.
They are taking rigid and firm positions even though they know they will have to compromise if they want to succeed in December: therein lies the biggest danger facing the Intergovernmental Conference.
I am convinced that a reasonable, acceptable deal can be found on the bulk of the points, but there is one that seems to be extraordinarily difficult: the system of voting in the Council.
The Convention wrestled with the age-old problem of whether we want equality of states or equality of citizens.
It came up with the novel and balanced solution of the double majority, with one vote every state counts equally, and with the other vote states are weighted according to their population: absolute equality of citizens.
What could be fairer?
Poland, Spain and some other countries, however, are insisting on returning to the opaque Nice formula, which is neither very fair nor very logical.
I regret this, and I hope that they will shift their position.
I know too from discussions - notably with Polish colleagues - how difficult the national context in Poland is and how this has regrettably become a , notably for opposition parties - Poland has a minority government.
But how can we compromise, how can we find a way out between two radically different solutions?
Speaking purely personally, and off the top of my head, may I invite the Italian presidency to look at what happened in the early 1990s, before enlargement to Sweden, Finland and Austria?
There was then a big row in the Council about adapting the qualified majority system, then it was about the threshold: what threshold is needed to obtain a qualified majority and what is a blocking minority?
At the time, one state - regrettably and shamefully my own, the United Kingdom - refused to change the system.
It wanted to keep the same blocking minority in an enlarged Union, which would have made decision-taking even more difficult.
There was deadlock.
What happened, in your own country Mr President?
At Ioannina, a compromise was reached the so-called 'Ioannina compromise' whereby the Union switched to the new system, but a declaration was adopted saying that in the future, states that were in the minority, but which would not have been outvoted under the old system could, if they wished, then object to the decision and insist that discussions continue.
In practice, that clause was never used but it enabled face to be saved at the time, it enabled the transition to the new system and perhaps something along those lines is the only way forward on this very difficult point of the double majority.
Perhaps we should switch to the new system, but with a declaration allowing states perhaps for a transitional period to invoke the old system if they found themselves in the minority.
I am sure they would not do this very often, but it would allow them now to save face and go home with an acceptable solution.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, although we are talking about the constitution as a means of making the European Union transparent, comprehensible and more democratic, I see a danger in that the same Council that is to make a decision on the constitution is, when it comes to a decision on the Trans-European Networks, breaking the law as it currently stands and trampling Parliamentâs rights underfoot.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the present Treaties state that decisions on the Trans-European Networks, including the priority list â perhaps the President-in-Office of the Council would be so kind as to listen to me, and the honourable gentleman could perhaps move to one side â according to the present Treaties, the revision of the Trans-European Networks is subject to codecision by the Council and Parliament and is not within the decision-making competence of the European Council.
The European Council exists to set down policy guidelines.
If, though, the Brussels European Council, in the course of revising the Trans-European Networks were to make decisions on the list of actual priority transport projects that had the effect that practically all the funds for the next few years were spent, then that would be a flagrant violation of Parliamentâs right to share equally with the Council in decisions concerning the Trans-European Networks and their revision.
I therefore appeal to the representatives of the Council to take care that the European Summit does not trample upon those rights that the present Parliament already possesses.
I also appeal to the President of the Commission: it would be devastating if you, Mr President of the Commission, having made such a clear statement on democratic and parliamentary rights, were, at the Council, to so tangibly to ally yourself with a Council which defines the priority projects in such a way that the European Parliamentâs rights of codecision are practically nullified.
Let us see to it that this European Council does not take back the rights of codecision on Trans-European Networks that Parliament already possesses.
We want more rights; we want a democratic and more transparent Europe.
I hope, Mr President-in-Office, that you can provide us with them.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much support the joint resolution which my group has signed up to in relation to the Summit and the Social Forum.
The important thing is that once again it seeks to strike the essential balance that was established at Lisbon: the balanced policy mix combining economic, social and employment policies in an overall framework of sustainable development.
I hope governments will not succumb to the temptation to try in any way to skew that policy mix at the forthcoming summit.
There is one element in the resolution that causes me some concern: the second part of paragraph 10.
My Group will request a separate vote on that point and many will be voting against it.
Why would that be?
Are we in favour of needless, additional regulation?
No.
The first part of paragraph 10 which we support makes that absolutely clear.
It is equally true, however, that certain sections of this House, and local employers' organisations outside it, are increasingly calling for ever more stringent, narrowly-drawn business impact assessments as a way of blocking the Commissionâs right of initiative on much-needed proposals.
We cannot allow those calls for cost-benefit impact assessments to be used in that way.
We on this side of the House support the idea of true and honest cost-benefit assessments that take account of all the costs and benefits.
For example, in a debate on the revision of the working time directive last week in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the point was made very forcibly by Liberal Members that we need a full business impact assessment.
I make the point in reply that what we need is a true cost-benefit assessment that takes account of all the costs and benefits.
What, for example, is the cost of a long-hours culture in terms of damage to family life, damage to children and marital dysfunction?
A cost must be imputed to those things as well in such a calculation.
We therefore urgently need to bring forward revisions of that sort.
In relation to paragraph 9 of the resolution, which refers to opening up the market in postal and passenger services, it is important that a true cost-benefit assessment is applied there too.
Finally, I would like to point out that in fact the Treaties are very clear.
In the area of employment and social legislation, there is already a very clear requirement built into the Treaty: 'such directives shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation, and development of small and medium sized undertakings'.
The Commission already applies those tests to every piece of legislation it brings forward in the employment and social field.
That is right and proper.
It is good that it takes place already, but we should not try to narrow it in order to needlessly block much-needed social and employment proposals that will help maintain that overall policy balance established at Lisbon.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why I rise to speak on this point is that the experience of the last few weeks in connection with the handling of the Stability and Growth Pact, that is to say of European law, have made clear how important it is that the Intergovernmental Conference should still include price stability in the list of the EUâs objectives in the European constitution.
Another reason why I have asked for the floor is that the experience of recent days and weeks has shown how important it is that the Protocol of the Stability and Growth Pact should, like other protocols, be appended to the constitution as an annex.
And I have asked to speak also because I believe that the experience of the last few weeks also clearly shows us that the debate on the constitution has been, in part, nationalised, and that we must take care that the nationalisation of a European project does not jeopardise this great project through national referendum.
If there is to be a referendum, then let there be one consultation of the European people, with one Europe-wide result and dual majority of votes and countries.
We have talked about how the Constitution must make Europe more transparent and more democratic and bring it closer to the people, which is what it is meant to do.
So I appeal to the President of the Council to see to it that the Commission is strengthened, that this Houseâs rights of codecision are extended, that Parliament retains sovereignty over the Budget, and nothing is done to aid and abet the attempt by the finance ministers, in their letter to the President of the Council, to force the Commission and Parliament to keep silent about their rights.
The Europe we need is Community-oriented rather than intergovernmental.
The Constitution is the outward expression of strengthened Community institutions, and I ask you to counteract all the attempts made by groupings within the Council to hand back Europe to the nation states.
Â Â  Mr President, I really am very upset that in the Intergovernmental Conference, we have what I would regard as a lamentable failure of political leadership - a retreat into national chauvinism - at a time when we need a democratic, effective, power-sharing Europe.
This is not what we are going to get out of the IGC if things continue as they are.
The Convention, of which I was a member, painstakingly constructed a blueprint for the kind of Europe I have just outlined.
Neutralising that text in the areas of common foreign and security policy, defence cooperation and social policy, stripping out qualified majority voting in relation to these areas and, worst of all, stripping this Parliament of its budgetary prerogatives, is a recipe for defeat.
It is a recipe for defeat for the outcome of the IGC, but it is also a recipe for the defeat of Europe.
Such a defeat would be a victory for the eurosceptics.
It would be a victory for the lamentable fearmongering that we constantly hear in this House from Mr Bonde, with his simplistic, opportunistic clichÃ©s.
I would appeal to the IGC to listen to this Parliament, to the Convention and the 200 parliamentarians - from all sides of the political spectrum, both in government and in opposition right across Europe who produced the Convention document.
Finally, President Prodi, I ask you to read today's , which carries an interview with you on the occasion of your visit to Ireland yesterday.
The headline reads: ' "States that reject the Treaty may have to leave the EU" says Prodi'.
That is an appalling message to give to the people of Ireland, who had to vote twice on the Nice Treaty.
It is disrespectful of the rights of the citizens of Europe and for the dignity of the people of Europe.
If it is not accurately reported, then you should immediately correct it.
If it is accurately reported then you must make it clear that it is your personal view and not the view of the Commission.
In Ireland, such statements quite simply polarise the debate about whether we defend the nation or build Europe.
So you must correct this if it is an incorrect reflection of your views in that interview.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have overrun on the time allowed and, therefore, in order not to eat any further into the time for the next debate, I will attempt to be extremely brief.
To start with, and in view of the fact that Mr Watson and others who wanted to discuss the Guantanamo issue are present, I should like to offer some comments for reflection.
As regards the Italian Presidency, and thus the European Union, I must say that we have made known to the US authorities at every possible opportunity â on the most recent occasion directly to Colin Powell during the meeting held in Brussels â the concerns of the European Union and of the general public regarding this matter which undoubtedly provides us with food for thought and is a cause of concern.
I must also point out that, at the joint press conference, certain journalists put the question to Colin Powell too, who gave a public undertaking to provide a response and to examine the matter, that is to provide a response to the specific concerns raised.
Therefore, I must reiterate that attention has been given to this matter and will certainly continue to be in the future.
On the other hand, as regards the discussion concerning the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, I take this opportunity, which will be the last opportunity for me as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union to address Parliament, to thank the House, to thank all of you for the contribution you have made to the work and the endeavours of the Italian Presidency, a fundamental contribution, containing, of course, a great deal of criticism and many suggestions, but also, I acknowledge, many appreciative comments, which always give much pleasure and help to lighten the sometimes heavy burdens of an overfull schedule we have to bear on some occasions.
As I have said, we do this in the knowledge that the outcome, if positive, will be so not only for the Italian Presidency but for all of us because the spirit which guides us is a spirit consistent with the European spirit.
Should we fail, it will undoubtedly be a failure for all of us.
I am still optimistic and must say that, in the light of the debate held in Naples and todayâs meeting, I believe that we can look to 12 and 13 December with confidence based on the fact that there are signs that some sort of positive solution can be achieved.
As regards individual points, it is difficult for me to go into detail now, but I should like to take up some general points: first, I confirm that we will seek to maintain the greatest possible consistency with the Conventionâs text, which, for us, is the reference point.
As you know, all levels took part in the Convention: national parliamentarians, European parliamentarians, members of governments, representatives of civil society.
The result is clearly a very important document that we are seeking to improve upon but which, as far as we are concerned, is the guiding point of reference for obtaining the final outcome.
We will not accept watered-down compromises and we will avoid any horse-trading, as it has been called in the last hour.
It is normal for negotiations to take place.
I should not like to undervalue such negotiations because the interests that each country represents are undoubtedly worthy and important interests.
The negotiations may be intense, but I believe that the spirit which guides us and which I have seen in all those who have participated first in the work of the Convention and subsequently in the Intergovernmental Conference is indicative of the fact that everyone is hoping for a major result, a worthy outcome.
Further, as regards protecting the prerogatives of the European Parliament and of national parliaments in general, I can confirm that the Italian Presidency considers this to be essential, and even more so when a Treaty having constitutional validity is being constructed because, if there is no connection with the primary democratic source which is bound to Parliament, we will undoubtedly end up doing something which is not positive.
I would like to thank you once again for your contribution, and I hope that Mr Berlusconi, who will be in the House with Mr Frattini to report on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference the week after the Conference ends, will be able to bring you good news and that you will be able, at that time, to voice your appreciation or criticism so that everyone can subsequently, as the wish has been expressed, come together to celebrate a result that we all hope will be extremely positive.
Â Â  . â My thanks to the Italian Presidency and to Mr Antonione, who, in my opinion, has explained in a perfectly balanced, commendable way the arguments and positions that we must uphold at the major meeting in Brussels.
Suffice it to say that I wish him every success in defending these arguments and also call on him not to dismiss any of the issues which have been set to one side for the moment.
I refer, for example, to the matter of the Legislative Council.
This is one of the issues which has suddenly disappeared from sight despite the fact that so much energy and thought was given to it in the institutional framework.
The problem is that when part of this framework is changed the whole framework is affected as a result.
I will reply briefly to Mr De Rossa.
I am not in the habit of withdrawing my statements because I usually consider them at length before making them.
To the journalist of the Irish Times, who made great play of taking these statements out of context, I said that if a country says âno, no, no, noâ, and I said ânoâ four times, it must be recognised that it is not right for that country to be able to paralyse the Union permanently.
I think this is a position which is universally shared.
I added that the instruments do not exist at the moment but the problem cannot be avoided in future. It is pointless for us to hide it.
I said the instruments do not exist but the problem does.
The problem, I added, is not a current problem, but there is no escaping this question.
I believe it is important for the Commission President to raise these matters â even if they are not a current problem â since they constitute a problem which concerns all of us.
There is no point in continually running away from problems because, if we do so, we will never succeed in resolving them.
Â Â  To conclude the debate, I have received 6 motions for resolutions on preparations for the European Council and 7 motions for resolutions on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with Rule 37(1) of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  â Following the IGC meeting in Naples, it is clear that there is relentless pressure from the European institutions to impose the Conventionâs draft Constitution and, thus, a central and supranational power to run the enlarged Europe.
In our opinion, the correct solution would be the opposite of this: accepting the idea of a differentiated Europe, ensuring greater respect for national sovereignty and clearly organising the process of variable geometry.
In other words, the countries, such as Spain or Poland, that are being accused today of slowing the progress of the IGC with regard to the Convention by defending their national interests are in actual fact defending the general interest of Europe, which is to keep free nations and national democracies alive.
With regard to the two major topics of debate that will be discussed once again at the next Council in Brussels â the composition of the Commission and the qualified majority in the Council â we reiterate our unchanging proposal: the key aspect is to recognise a national right of popular opposition, which each population could exercise formally against a European decision.
This innovation, which would give control back to the national democracies and help to compensate for the democratic deficit, would also put all of the discussions on the Commission and the Council into perspective.
Â Â  . The way in which the IGC is developing is increasingly worrying because there it shows a clear trend towards maintaining key aspects approved by the Convention but which we dispute.
These include enshrining and deepening the economic and social model of neoliberal capitalism, extending the militarisation of the European Union and institutionally consecrating the Union as a political and military bloc and also promoting the federalist institutional approach.
Indicative of this trend is the compromise reached between France, Germany and the United Kingdom, under the auspices of the USA, on the militarisation of the European Union, cementing its institutional bases as a more or less autonomous pillar of NATO.
Although some differences remain on institutional issues, compromises are being reached on the idea of a cabinet, with blackmail over Community funds increasingly forcing the small and medium-sized countries to accept a submissive position.
This leaves the fight being maintained by Spain and Poland, who are seeking to have the same weighting in the decision-making process as the other âlarge countriesâ.
The âprimacyâ of the so-called âEuropean constitutionâ and of Community law over the laws and Constitutions of each country is also reiterated, which is equally unacceptable.
It will fall to the peoples of the EU Member States and to the progressive forces within those States to combat this draft, which has been designed to benefit Europeâs economic and financial groups and the ambitions of the elites that, in each country, unashamedly serve these interests.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the Stability and Growth Pact.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to discuss with you at this sitting the economic Stability and Growth Pact.
Allow me to begin by going over the events which led up to the Eurogroup and Ecofin meeting of 24 and 25 November.
During the first half of 2003, at the Commissionâs proposal, the Council sent two recommendations in respect of excessive deficits to Germany and France on 21 January and 3 June respectively, calling for the deficits to be reduced below the reference threshold of 3% by the end of 2004.
It should be noted that the recommendations were adopted on the basis of assumed progressive economic growth during the year brought about by the elimination of negative factors due to the end of the war in Iraq.
In subsequent months, however, it became clear that the actual progress of the European economy was different, being more negative than expected.
Economic growth, lower than that forecast by approximately one percentage point, led to a greater increase in public deficits than expected.
The upshot of this was that it was impossible for Germany and France to reduce their deficits below 3% in 2004, as initially requested.
In the second half of 2003, between October and November, the Commission fully and formally acknowledged this new situation and accordingly proposed two new recommendations seeking to defer the deficit reduction to below 3% until 2005.
Essentially, it is reasonable to assume that, had it been known at the start of 2003 that the progress of the Euro area economy would not be positive, the recommendations would have stipulated 2005 at the outset as the year during which the deficits had to be brought back into line.
On this basis, both Germany and France took measures to incorporate the substance of the recommendations.
As regards Germany, the recommendations have been directly incorporated into the budgetary legislation: for 2004 provision has been made for a structural adjustment of 0.6% of GDP and for 2005 an adjustment of 0.5%, that is to say 1.1% of GDP in total, which is close to that initially requested by the Commission, without prejudice to the reduction below 3% in 2005.
As regards France, the recommendations were incorporated first into the budgetary legislation and subsequently by means of other measures: for 2004 provision has been made for an adjustment of 0.8% of GDP and for 2005 an adjustment of 0.6%, that is to say 1.4% of GDP in total, which is close to that requested by the Commission, without prejudice to the reduction below 3% in 2005.
Furthermore, France and Germany have given undertakings to channel any effects of greater growth into deficit reduction, as requested by the Commission.
In addition to this, it should be borne in mind that, in 2003, France and Germany set in motion an intense programme of welfare state reforms, which had a decisive, positive impact on the sustainability of public finances.
Within the context of the political economy, this is an issue of more than minor importance surrounding the discussion of the Pact which has taken place over the course of this year.
In essence, first in the work carried out during October and November, subsequently within the Eurogroup and, lastly, within Ecofin, a broad consensus has been achieved on the substance of the recommendations formulated by the Commission and on the substance of the adjustments introduced by France and Germany.
Let us move on to procedural matters.
The Commission proposed the two recommendations pursuant to Article 104(9) on the basis that Germany and France had persistently failed to put into practice the Councilâs recommendations.
Germany and France, whilst accepting the substance of the recommendations, for political reasons requested a different format, that is to say that a second series of recommendations be reformulated pursuant to Article 104(7).
The Councilâs Legal Service, when consulted on the matter, said that the Commission could also have taken â and I emphasise the word âalsoâ â this second route.
The Commission excluded it.
At this point a deadlock developed: there was a risk that the most important thing, namely the substance, would be lost for reasons of form.
In order to overcome the deadlock without exacerbating matters, the Eurogroup, on the basis of a broad consensus, incorporated the substance of the recommendations into draft conclusions.
The validity of this procedure was again confirmed by the Councilâs Legal Service.
Subsequently, when Ecofin started its work, the Commission explicitly registered its disagreement, calling for an express vote on the second series of recommendations for Germany and France.
The necessary majority was not obtained.
It should be noted that the vote of the Ecofin Council on the Commissionâs recommendations is explicitly provided for by the rules currently in force and is therefore perfectly compatible with such rules.
After the failure to approve the Commissionâs recommendations, the Council voted on the conclusions drawn up earlier in the Eurogroup.
The conclusions were approved and the discussion resulted in the unanimous adoption of the Council statement.
The contents of the statement may be summarised as follows: stability and growth are the fundamental objectives of European economic policy.
The Pact constitutes an essential means of implementing that policy.
The Pact has been called âstupidâ.
We have shown the opposite, we have shown that the Pact can be interpreted in a flexible, discerning manner.
The Pact can be implemented by adapting budgetary discipline in an even more rational manner to positive or negative economic cycles and by encouraging structural reforms aimed at developing growth potential.
In these terms, the letter and the spirit of the Pact are not dead; quite the opposite, we have worked in the past, are working now and will continue to work within the framework of the Pact and with the Commissionâs support in a cooperative and consensual manner.
In conclusion, we have thus far talked a lot about procedure and said little about the economy.
In the growth strategy, as has been said, it is necessary for the Pact to take into account economic cycles and structural reforms: this is necessary, but it is not sufficient.
Six months ago, at the start of this six-month presidency, we presented an Action Plan for Growth to this House.
The support given to this Plan by Parliament was decisive and now the Plan must be implemented.
Other, new development initiatives must follow.
The Commission, the governments and the markets have a role to play in the growth strategy, but the European Parliament must also play a role as a decisive driving force: indeed, economic policy is either a policy or it is not.
Â Â  Mr President, over the last few months we have seen various developments in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact which have created a serious institutional crisis.
These events are clear proof that we need to strengthen economic governance in the Union.
The difficulties stem from the fact that Germany and France are experiencing serious tax problems which can be summarised as follows: excessive deficits, not only due to cyclical factors; the high deficits could prove harmful in the longer term because they threaten the sustainability of public financing by triggering increased debt levels; in addition, there are negative repercussions for potential growth due to the change in economic prospects.
Against this backdrop and with a view to both countries reducing their deficits, applying the rules laid down in the Treaty, the Council first sent a series of recommendations to Germany and France at the start of the year asking them to adopt measures designed to correct the excessive deficit levels by the end of 2004 at the latest.
In the second half of this year, however, it became clear that the measures adopted by the two countries would not be enough to correct the high deficits in 2004.
The Commission therefore implemented the procedures laid down in the Treaty, submitting new recommendations which take the current situation into account.
As you know, a small number of Member States rejected the Commissionâs proposals in the Council, and in an unprecedented move, a majority agreement was reached outside the scope of the Treaty.
This agreement, formulated as âCouncil conclusionsâ, has very wide-reaching implications which go far beyond the simple application of the Pact in France and Germany.
The Commission deeply regrets that the Council has followed neither the spirit nor the letter of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, both of which were unanimously approved.
We feel that a rules-based system is the only way to ensure that commitments are respected and to guarantee equal treatment for all Member States.
We have to understand that the Councilâs decisions will make it harder to apply the Treaty rigorously.
Proceedings for other countries will be affected.
It will now be very difficult for the Council to adopt formal decisions in line with the procedure for excessive deficits, including the possibility of sending preventative warnings.
The value of the reports on the stability and convergence programmes could be diminished if the Council does not accept a system of rigorous multilateral monitoring.
It could become harder to apply the convergence criteria strictly in the new Member States, given that the euro-zone countries have been allowed to maintain deficits of over 3% for several years running and the procedures laid down in the Treaty and the Pact have not been applied.
The political agreement established in the Council entails using intergovernmental agreements to manage our currency and establishes a dangerous precedent for the future.
The Court of Justice will probably have to clarify whether Member Statesâ governments have the power to create new procedures which effectively replace existing Community structures established in the Treaty for certain aspects of economic policy.
We must, however, bear in mind the fact that the Council declaration made at the end of the Ecofin Council shows that the Member States understand the need for a growth and stability agreement and also the importance of applying the standards in the same way across the board.
Whatever happens, the Commission will continue to apply the Treaty and the provisions of the Pact.
This will allow all Member States to be treated equally and will guarantee healthy public finances in Europe.
The Commission will ensure that the procedures are applied appropriately and fairly.
At the same time, we need to strengthen the economic governance of the Union with a view to ensuring that the single market and single currency work well together.
We think that the decisions taken by Ecofin prove that the real problem is the weakness of the current system of economic governance at European level.
The Commission intends to tackle this problem and will draw up a programme for better economic governance in the Union after careful thought.
We will not, however, be starting our deliberations from zero. Instead, we will continue along the path taken by the Commission in the past.
In line with the Communication of November 2002 on strengthening the coordination of budgetary policies, it seems we need to assess how to combine better discipline and flexibility to ensure greater compliance with the rules.
We think that, among other things, greater emphasis should be placed on sustainability and on debt, so as to allow for the particularities of each individual country and to increase symmetry over the course of the whole cycle, in particular by being very strict in boom years.
In this way, the Commission will carry out the multilateral monitoring in a more effective way, using all available means to publicise its opinions on economic and budgetary policy.
We have to look at the budgetary discussions within the wider context of current low growth potential in the European economy.
We therefore need to pay more attention to the quality of public finances without compromising long-term stability and sustainability.
This means placing the debate on budgetary policy higher on the agenda within the context of coordinating economic policies, with a more prominent role for the economic policy guidelines and the implementation of those guidelines to ensure that the Economic and Monetary Union works well and that the Lisbon objectives are achieved.
Parliamentâs active involvement will be essential to this process.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Solbes, ladies and gentlemen, the decisions taken by the Ecofin Council on 25 November 2003 meant that it was not a good day for Europe.
It was not a good day for European law.
It was not a good day for the European Monetary Union.
It was not a good day for relations between the smaller countries and the larger ones, and it was not a good day for the forthcoming enlargement.
Those who, in the nineties, put the case for the Stability and Growth Pact now bear responsibility for the damage done to it, as do those who helped do the damage.
We, in our group, are fundamentally convinced that we cannot be opportunistic in the way we use European law.
So long as there is European regulation, so long as there is European law, it must be adhered to rather than bent.
We do not believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is dead; it would be wrong to say that it were, for that would enable all those who break it to evade responsibility, both now and in the future.
The Stability and Growth Pact has, however, been seriously damaged.
Speaking very generally, what we need in politics is trust; Europeâs currency, this young European currency, needs a very special kind of trust, and that trust has been damaged.
To you, Commissioner Solbes, I would like to express our groupâs gratitude and appreciation for the way you fought right up to the end.
You may well not have got a majority for what you wanted, but we are convinced that you are right.
Losing can sometimes be an honourable thing, but you have won your case.
We also give our backing to the European Central Bank, and we wish its President, Mr Trichet, every success in continuing in future to be effective in contending for the stability of the European currency.
We have now heard one finance minister in particular coming out with preposterous arguments to justify why this deficit is necessary right now in order for us to achieve growth.
This argument is utterly false.
Todayâs debts are tomorrowâs taxes.
What we owe today we will take away from people tomorrow.
Those who run up excessive debts today are behaving exactly like those who are today despoiling our environment, for todayâs younger generation and generations yet to come will have to pay the price for it.
We therefore demand sustainability not only of a moderate finance and budget policy, but also in environment policy, and these things all belong together.
Debts lead to higher interest rates, and these lead to higher inflation.
We therefore end up without the money for low-interest loans enabling business and small enterprises to invest, and then no jobs are created for lack of finance at reasonable rates.
At the end of the day it will be those on low incomes, it will be what we always used to call the man in the street, who will end up picking up the bill, and so a policy of running up debt is, in essence, anti-social, because it affects most those who have least.
Such a policy also damages relations between the countries within the European Union.
We have seen how Portugal and Ireland were required to adopt stability measures â quite rightly, as it turned out â and if these countries do it and other countries do it, but some think that they are big enough not to have to take these steps, then the ones who adhere to the criteria end up paying the bill for those who do not.
That is why the policy is wrong.
I would appreciate it if you were to listen; I ask you to hear me out.
I would like you to listen to my speech, or prove that you understand my language.
I really do ask that of you.
Today, in my own country â and I am not now speaking as a German, although I am from the largest country in the European Union â many people no longer have any confidence in the ability of the European Council of Ministers to defend the stability of Europeâs currency.
We want Europeâs currency to have a future; if it ends up failing, that will mark the failure of the whole project of European integration.
I am a very frequent visitor to the candidate countries and often speak with our counterparts in their parliaments and governments.
In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, in the Czech Republic, in Slovakia, in Hungary, in Slovenia â the situation is different in Malta and Cyprus â they are asking us how it can be demanded of them, the Central Europeans who want to join the European Union, that they should pursue a policy of moderation in their budgets and work hard at reform when certain countries in the European Union give them such a bad example.
That is a bad, indeed a terrible sign, not only in terms of economic policy but also more generally speaking, and my advice is that we, together, get back on the path of virtue, for it is not acceptable for some larger countries to do things that are not permitted to the smaller ones.
This also has to do with European psychology and with the dignity of states, and so there must be no repetition of what happened on 25 November.
I hope this is the last time that our group will be obliged to criticise this sort of action in such forthright terms.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to express our deep concern about the current crisis relating to the Stability and Growth Pact.
Mr Tremonti, as a respected legal expert, you must acknowledge that the rules cannot be ignored in this way.
When the question of form is raised, we are told we need to talk about policy.
Fine, let us talk about policy, but first of all, if there is a structure, if there are rules, they have to be respected.
One of the gravest problems right now is that Ecofin as a whole does not have a Community culture.
It did not demonstrate any sense of Community when it acted as it did in the meeting on the Stability Pact, nor when it proposed the amendments which disturb the balance of powers between the Council and Parliament, despite having no authority to make such proposals.
Consequently, I think that Ecofinâs first task should be to read the Treaties and respect them.
There are three fundamental issues at stake at the moment.
Firstly, the present and the future of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The Stability and Growth Pact was created before monetary union took place.
Now that we have monetary union, we ought to revise the Pact to include the new elements.
What cannot be allowed, as we have been saying for months, is for the Pact to have been breached in 2000 and a bad precedent established.
What we are discussing here, although this is not a conference of forensic experts, is whether or not the Stability Pact is dead.
The problem is which countries will the Pact apply to now?
What about Portugal?
What is happening with Ireland?
Are they any different?
It is therefore very important to get the Stability and Growth Pact back on the rails and to enable the Commission to make constructive proposals.
The real issue is not whether the Pact is dead or not, but the fact that it is not being respected or applied, which is a much more serious matter at this time.
The second question â and here I agree with Minister Tremonti who raised it with support from Parliament and with whom we successfully revived the Delors plan â is why the European economy is not a driving force even though it has the potential to be one.
This is why we have been in favour of the action plan from the outset.
However, in the current situation, that motor is not even starting, and that in turn is increasingly battering public confidence.
I think that, aside from the need to update the Stability and Growth Pact, we also need to think about a point raised by Commissioner Solbes: economic governance.
We are not calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be included in the Constitution, but we must remember that in the Convention working group chaired by my colleague Mr HÃ€nsch, all the economic representatives were playing very defensively â much like the Italian football team â and seeking to block any progress on economic governance in the Union.
This is extremely serious.
Why is it so serious?
Because at the moment we do not have any stronger instruments.
Compare our situation with that of the United States: we have a central bank which only looks at inflation, and a Stability and Growth Pact which is not being respected and which does not take that element of economic governance into account.
Minister Tremonti talked about factoring in economic cycles.
In the United States, before making a proposal to Congress, the Federal Reserve is actually required to take into account inflation, employment and economic activity.
These are factors which need to be taken seriously and now is the time to raise these issues.
Now is also the time to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact will have a future.
For this reason, Mr President, I think we have a responsibility to respect the Treaties and to make sure that Ecofin follows the same rules as everyone else.
Â Â  Mr President, the obituaries for the Stability Pact have been written before and then held back as the patient lurched on, if only on life support.
What we witnessed last week was finance ministers giving the last rites to rules which were intended to guarantee the long-term stability of our currency and economy.
Of course, the guilty parties deny all responsibility, or claim 'the Pact is dead, long live the Pact'.
But the truth is that the eurozone's two leading economies have sent a message to all the small countries in the eurozone, and to the acceding countries, which reads 'do as we say, not as we do'.
And I should like to point out to Mr Tremonti that the Italian presidency has failed in its duty by acting as an associate in the endeavours of the countries concerned to flout the Pact, rather than ensuring that the rules were respected.
We will pay a heavy price for the cavalier disregard of finance ministers for the rules of the Stability Pact. We will pay a price in terms of damage to the trust between Member States, in terms of lost credibility in the eyes of our citizens, and, in the long run, in terms of higher interest rates, lower growth and currency instability.
Unless our leaders agree on a revised and workable framework for fiscal stability, and inscribe this in our basic law, then we are left with nothing but a broken gentlemen's agreement.
Countries which gave up their currencies on the understanding that they would not be expected to pay for the debts of their neighbours have a right to demand more than that.
That is why my Group welcomes the stand taken by Commissioner Solbes and the Commission's intentions to make proposals to reshape the rules.
If you kill off the Pact in its existing form, you have a responsibility to commit yourself to an agreed interpretation of a set of rules to prevent a borrowing free-for-all.
Liberal Democrats believe that a well-run economy and a stable currency require taxes and spending to be in balance over the course of the business cycle.
The problem is not the 3% deficit limit; the problem is the failure of countries to consolidate their budgets in terms of growth.
My surprise at hearing the leader of the Socialist Group in this House agree with us is matched only by my delight at his conversion.
The revised rules should provide sticks and carrots to ensure that we take advantage of periods of economic growth to run budgets in balance or in surplus and reduce national debt.
Countries which operate a responsible policy in the good times could benefit from more flexibility in bad times to let borrowing take the strain.
These rules should provide for early action against countries which do not control their deficits in periods of growth, to force them to take corrective measures.
A new target for the underlying budget balance could be added, and government expenditure on investment should also be taken into account.
The European Commission should have greater authority to police these new rules, since national governments have shown that they cannot be trusted to do so.
This has been a bad week for the rule of law in the European Union.
My Group hopes that at the summit in Brussels our leaders will recognise their responsibility to salvage, from the wreckage of the Stability Pact, some credibility for Europe's fiscal policy .
Â Â  â Mr President, we very much welcome the political debate that is beginning on the Stability Pact.
Mr Prodi gave the word and it was re-launched by the Ecofin Council.
The Commission is very wrong to put adherence to the rules side by side with political judgment.
The law is flexible when the realities so require and it is then the duty of politicians to interpret it.
This Pact, which is currently being tested by the realities, signed in 1997, at which time, the Commission, the Central Bank and many states heralded an era of sustainable growth.
Having first denied that there was a recession, they then declared that it would be brief and that the economy would soon recover.
Those who were so wrong should not dole out lessons.
Today, the improvement in the situation is fragile.
It must not be compromised, particularly as we are at risk from the fall in the dollar and serious American imbalances.
Some governments make a show of virtue in contrast to the large states that are deemed to be guilty.
However, the behaviour of these critics often appears to be opportunistic.
In fact, on many occasions their inflation rates are above the average â which reduces their debts â they play at fiscal dumping in order to attract capital and they forget about the Structural Funds, of which some of them are major beneficiaries.
There are therefore several good reasons for flexibility in the Pact.
It does not take account of the cycle, it maintains divisions, it seeks to impose penalties without offering encouragement, and it is incapable of responding to the nagging problem of the very poor potential for growth in Europe.
As a result, it would not be an exaggeration if the Commission were still to be portrayed as the guardian of procedures.
We need a political actor in Brussels.
There is no such thing as a European economic policy and we want to create one.
This is a matter of urgency.
The Pact is not dead, as proved by the commitments made by France and Germany for 2005.
However, if the economic recovery were not confirmed or were poor, it would be extremely difficult to fulfil these commitments.
I say again: the reform is essential.
To this end, the method is as important as the substance.
All of the quarrels among institutions and among states highlight a blatant lack of democratic capacity and legitimacy.
The assessment by peers of the discipline and quality of the national budgetary policy is undoubtedly necessary, but it is not enough, as was mentioned previously.
Solidarity and greater participation are required to build an economic policy.
In this respect, I believe that the interactive dialogue between the national parliaments and the European Parliament, as well as the consultation of civil societies, are vital elements.
As far as content is concerned, we need both rules and acts.
We do not reject the principle of a pact for rules that seek to combine stability and growth.
However, we have strict ideas as regards the substance.
We need rules that encourage timely action and improve the quality of expenditure and revenue.
How can we claim to legitimise a budget discipline when the Union shamelessly cultivates fiscal competitiveness?
France and Germany are right to call for the tax harmonisation that a number of other states refuse to allow them.
These rules must guarantee too the capacity to finance projects considered to be in the general interest.
We also need acts.
There will be no successful reform of the Pact if we do not build, as a complement, a European budgetary policy, with a genuine budget to help finance the objectives of sustainable development and cohesion agreed at the Lisbon and Gothenburg summits.
Is it not unfair to prevent at least the countries in the euro zone from having a joint capacity for budgetary action when they share a single monetary policy, but are deprived of a second major economic policy lever?
Unfortunately, there is the risk that the IGC may not open these doors and that the reform of the Pact may be too limited.
You can therefore expect an increase in tensions, to which our debates today are only a prelude.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Stability Pact is dead.
It could be regretted that it was destroyed by the European Council, in relation to the specific difficulties of two large countries, thus violating the credibility of the institutions based on a system of rules accepted by all.
However, as far as its form is concerned, this Pact has always been the subject of an intergovernmental agreement rather than control by our Parliament, the only representative of the sovereignty of the people of Europe.
What âintergovernmentalityâ has done, Mr Karas, is ruin it.
Federalists and Greens will not lament the death of this Pact â a Pact that President Prodi himself yesterday described as stupid â particularly as since the Amsterdam summit we had criticised its content.
It was indeed stupid, doubly so in fact.
In the current situation, it aggravates the recessions by penalising the countries that are seeking to support the actual demand on the Unionâs internal market, especially in the large countries with a particular responsibility from this point of view.
Instead, it would be better to penalise the countries that have deficits in periods of growth.
From a structural point of view, a genuine Stability Pact should shelter future investments and in particular the enormous investments required to respect the Kyoto criteria.
There is no time left to dither now.
A new, intelligent pact must be adopted.
Only a pact of this nature will merit inclusion in the third part of the Constitution.
Indeed, only an intelligent Constitution will merit the approval and respect of the citizens of Europe.
The pact must be contra-cyclic and, at the same time, must not hinder the countries in difficulty. On the contrary, it must penalise the countries that abuse their facilities and in this way, through a sort of climatic golden rule, shelter future investments from the current situation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened carefully to the speeches by MrÂ Poettering and MrÂ Baron Crespo, two Members that I regard highly, and noticed how we sometimes discuss this issue too much from the perspective of our own countries and too much from the perspective of our own political parties.
It is no coincidence that the Commission position is in line with that of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
On the contrary, I believe that we should make the effort to be imaginative as regards this sensitive and complex issue.
Europe has its rulesÂ âÂ and the Pact is a ruleÂ âÂ but, at the moment, we do not need rules any more.
I believe that Europe needs to be imaginative, courageous and dynamic and I do not feel that these issues can be tackled without understanding that, in this House, the Italian Presidency and MrÂ Tremonti are not to be supported for what they have said but rather a Presidency is to be supported for what it does, for taking note of serious issues affecting major countries of this Community.
Furthermore, for the third year running, weÂ âÂ and I am a rapporteur on European public financesÂ âÂ have had to note that the European economy is stagnating.
I also seem to understand from other Membersâ speeches that European politics has some problems, and we were talking about this in committee yesterday with CommissionerÂ Solbes as well.
Therefore, why not make an effort to move from stability to growth, at last?
I believe that this is to be done by people who, rather than being the guardians of rules, want to be politicians, which is what Plato once meant when he talked about the politician and his supremacy.
From this point of view, it seems to me that we are doing exactly what is needed.
Â Â  â Mr President, why should we conclude a new treaty in Europe if we refuse to adhere to existing agreements?
And if we refuse to adhere to the Stability Pact in times when it does not suit us, why do we not simply admit to this?
And why do we not start working on agreements to which we want to adhere?
In my country at least, many people are asking these questions.
Their confidence has been dealt a serious blow.
Why are all countries equal, but certain large countries more equal than others?
The justifiably devastating comments in the media speak volumes.
All of this undermines confidence in politics, and that reflects badly on us.
Why, Mr Tremonti, have you not elected to play your role as independent chairman on the side of the Stability and Growth Pact, as proposed by the Commission?
Do you realise what the role of chairman entails?
I am also reminded of this by certain clauses of the report of the Euro Group and Ecofin Council's meeting.
In that report, Commissioner Solbes indicates that the Commission has given France and Germany recommendations with comparable content, which means that these countries are on an equal footing.
He notes that we have reached a critical moment in time.
The wrong decisions can seriously damage the procedure.
Decisions can create an important precedent and affect interest rates.
This issue concerns the equal treatment of large and small Member States.
Commissioner Solbes goes on to say that if the Commission's recommendations are not followed, there is a considerable risk of France and Germany remaining above the 3% mark even in 2005.
The Commission has already been extremely flexible.
The recommendations currently before us really are as far as we are prepared to go.
Commissioner Solbes also indicates that, pursuant to Article 104(7) of the EC Treaty, returning to an excessive deficit is not an option, because sanctions would never follow otherwise.
Moreover, the Treaty and the Pact do not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries.
As the Guardian of the Treaty, the Commission has no choice but to follow the route it has now proposed.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Ecofin Council of 25 November did not violate the Treaty when it suspended the sanction procedure for excessive deficits against France and Germany.
Rather, it correctly interpreted Article 104, which allows the Council a political margin for manoeuvre throughout the procedure by giving it the choice of whether or not to proceed.
It was the regulations of the Stability Pact that in 1997 hardened these rules by doing away with the Councilâs margin for manoeuvre.
However, in doing so, they did not comply with the Treaty.
I would be curious to know what the Court of Justice would think about it if it looked into the matter.
As far as France is concerned, it violated its Constitution in 1997 when, in spite of our warnings, it adopted a stupid Stability Pact that is now coming back to haunt it and that it is forced to violate in turn, creating a conflict with its partners.
That is a good example of a bad manoeuvre.
I hope that we are not going to make another blunder by approving the draft European Constitution, whose philosophy is exactly that of the Stability Pact: centralisation and rigidity.
Â Â  Mr President, since this Parliament is usually so critical of the Commission, I would like firstly to congratulate it and the Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, Mr Solbes, for the integrity and the dignity with which they have defended the powers conferred on them by the Treaty, as guardian of the Treaties.
I do not wish to blame the Italian Presidency, but, MrÂ Tremonti, the decision by Ecofin is a real botch job.
Because the European Union, Mr President, is a community of values and a community of law, and legal rules â the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are legal rules â only mean something if there is an obligation to comply with them, and that compliance must be demanded equally from the small and the large countries.
Europe cannot be built upon the law of the largest.
We cannot, Mr President, apply the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact to Portugal to the letter and then exonerate other larger countries.
It is one thing to be flexible and apply the rules in accordance with the circumstances, but it is another matter altogether to try to change the rules when the game has already begun, when the result is not favourable or when it does not suit us; and that attitude, Mr President, will have consequences, because a market which is not able to respect its own rules creates insecurity and a lack of confidence in the credibility of the single currency and, as the Chairman of our political group, Mr Poettering, said, today's deficit is tomorrow's debt and the taxes of the day after tomorrow.
And what is worse, this decision comes at a very bad time, precisely on the eve of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference which is going to discuss the European Constitution.
And I wonder with what moral authority certain Member States criticise others for exercising their legitimate rights within the context of qualified majority voting, when they are blatantly defending their national interests in violation of the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, as the Commission has acknowledged.
I would therefore congratulate the Commission, Mr President, on the integrity it has demonstrated in the defence of its role as guardian of the Treaties and I would ask whether, for the sake of coherence, the Commission intends to bring a case before the Court of Justice against the Council of Ministers for violation of the Treaties.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Ecofin Councilâs failure to take a decision on the German and French deficits leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.
It is never wise to by-pass freely accepted rules.
It is a dreadful move to give the public the impression that in the Union some states are more equal than others, that the Federal Republic of Germany and France have the right to special treatment because they are Europeâs driving force.
As far as Socialists are concerned, stability is a public good that must be defended.
However, there will be no stability without growth.
For years, the Socialist Group has called for an intelligent revision of the Pact, which places all its emphasis on stability and none on growth.
The Pact is too rigid.
It is the prisoner of criteria which, although freely accepted, do not take account of the realities of the economic cycles.
I agree with MrÂ Tremonti on this point.
Firstly, there is the âone size fits allâ approach.
Some states operate with a public debt of around 60% while others have debt of over 100% of their gross domestic product.
The Pact does not take these substantial differences into account.
Then there are sanctions that are impossible to impose.
Asking a state in an economic recession to make deposits or to pay large fines is like trying to cure someone of anaemia by bleeding them.
Faced with the German and French deficits, the Commission wanted to ensure that the rules were respected.
It could do nothing else.
Yet now that the rules have been smashed, the Commission cannot continue to brandish the Tables of the Law.
When the real country moves ahead of the legal country, the procedures must be adapted.
In any event, the economic policy cannot be limited to mere observation of the procedures.
This is where I also agree with Mr Tremonti.
For the same reasons, my group is opposed to an appeal before the European Court of Justice.
We are dealing here with a political problem that requires a political solution.
We do not need to resort to the government of judges.
As some of the Pactâs key provisions were clearly made obsolete by the political precedent imposed by the Ecofin Council, the Pact must be improved.
It is unthinkable that if Portugal, Greece or Luxembourg had excessive budget deficits tomorrow, the Commission could put forward proposals going beyond those that were accepted by the Ecofin Council for Germany and France.
The absolute rule of equal treatment of the Member States quite simply prohibits this.
President Prodi has just highlighted the fact that following a serious crisis innovative solutions are needed.
I therefore call on Commissioner Solbes who, after having preached virtue, must now preach intelligence.
After having valiantly defended the principles, now the Commission alone has the freedom to propose a Stability and Growth Pact that is both rigorous and more flexible.
It must be more rigorous in requiring states to maintain a balanced budget when growth exceeds 3% for example.
It must be more rigorous in requiring states to reduce their debt when growth exceeds 3%.
It must be more flexible, however, in times when the situation is not as positive, in particular by enabling states to deduct investment expenditure from the calculation of the budget deficit in accordance with the British golden rule.
According to the Commission, 1% of investment expenditure generates additional growth of 0.6% of GDP.
For example, the United States currently invests 3% of its GDP while Europe only invests a meagre 1%.
If we look at economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic, we see a dogmatic Europe and a pragmatic America.
I am not calling here for American-style deficits âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make some constructive points about how to get out of the present mess.
The first is that there must be a sense of shared responsibility.
Remember that the problem for both Germany and France began because of the budget relaxations, the tax cuts and public spending increases introduced between 1999 and 2002.
In each country that budget easing amounted to more than 1.5% of GDP.
If it had not happened, both countries would today be within the 3% limit.
Yet no institution, neither the Commission nor the European Central Bank, nor any Member of this House, warned those governments against such easing.
The system failed and we are all duty-bound to put it right.
This is important, too, because the Stability and Growth Pact is not a judicial procedure, but a political procedure that relies on the support of the finance ministers for recommendations and, ultimately, sanctions.
Ministers and the Commission must have a common understanding of how the Pact should be applied.
There should be a clear code of conduct on the interpretation of the Pact so that it can be credible for the future.
There must be a reinforcement of discipline in the good years and, in the short term, there must be an agreement on the size and speed of the adjustments necessary for the countries in breach to move back to balance.
The Pact itself recognises that it will not always be possible to remedy excessive deficits immediately if there are special circumstances.
Those special circumstances should now be defined to include the risk of a further prolongation of the recession in Germany and in France which, together, represent half of the euro area.
It is not in anyone's interest to prolong the recession, nor is it in anyone's interest to undermine the credibility of the Pact.
The law must be respected.
With goodwill and imagination this circle can be squared.
We urge the Commission and the finance ministers to do so.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I welcome the fact that we are holding this debate, which I requested in September, before the recent decision of the European Unionâs Finance Ministers not to apply penalties to France and Germany for having breached the provisions of the Stability Pact.
In the end, they actually proved that we were right to condemn the irrationality of the criteria for nominal convergence, which have led to the well-known and disastrous consequences of economic recession, rising unemployment and poverty levels that Portugal is currently experiencing.
We have already said here on more than one occasion that this Stability Pact is useless.
In the debate of October last year we confirmed our agreement with President Romano Prodi and Commissioner Lamyâs observations to the effect that this pact is stupid, like all rigid decisions, and that it is a crude instrument for economic governance, which must be replaced by something more intelligent, since the 3% rule is positively medieval.
Unfortunately, these gentlemen were not consistent with their observations and failed to present a proposal for the pactâs revision.
They were afraid of launching the excessive deficit procedure against France and Germany, as they had done against Portugal.
And then the inevitable happened: Germany and France did not accept the Commissionâs proposal.
Of course, the Commission said it would continue to apply the Treaty and that it reserves the right to look at the consequences of the Council conclusions and to decide on any action it might take.
Does anyone believe, however, that the Commission will do anything to France and Germany if the governments of those countries do not agree?
As we all know, it will not.
The question that remains is: why keep a Pact that is meaningless?
We know that the text approved by Ecofin only imposes rules previously announced by the German and French governments, thereby accepting that these countries have failed to meet the Maastricht criteria for three consecutive years.
There is furthermore no doubt that if they need more time, they could stretch this to four or five years âŠ It is now clear who controls the Stability Pact, who wields power and strength in the European Union even before the new Constitutional Treaty has entered into force.
It should be noted that it was Germany that demanded the Stability Pact, with these unacceptable criteria for nominal convergence.
As we now see, however, it did so in order to enforce compliance on others.
Well might Commissioner Solbes Mira state that the Councilâs decision respects neither the rules nor the spirit of the Stability Pact.
Will he now resign, his authority having been undermined in this way?
France was, of course, more realistic, stating that the Council has another way of implementing the Stability Pact, thereby justifying its non-compliance, whilst advocating changes through what it called the âenrichingâ of the Stability Pact.
This is an approach that others have also advocated here.
Some, indeed, have said that the Pact is not dead; it is merely frozen until the rich and powerful countries decide it can be defrosted because their problems have been solved.
We know that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank also supported adopting the Commissionâs proposals.
Will the Governing Council also resign for allowing itself to be ignored by the Council?
We, who have always been opposed to this Stability Pact have long called for it to be suspended, in order to revise its stupid criteria for nominal convergence, which fail to take account of the real situation in each country and of their different levels of socio-economic development and which confuse productive expenditure with non-productive expenditure when calculating the budget deficit.
One thing is certain, however: the hypocrisy of those people â and they exist in Portugal too â who use the argument of the Stability Pact to justify anti-social policies, now becomes even more striking.
Let us bury this Pact!
Let us seek alternative policies that give priority to employment, to high-quality public services, to sustainable development and to the well-being of the people!
Â Â  MrÂ President, President-in-Office of the Council, CommissionerÂ Solbes, at the point that we have reached and having 114 seconds available, it would be stupid and distasteful to pretend to analyse, in this âvoting machineâ, the Tremonti report and what has happened.
The only thing that we can say to you is that, as far as we are concerned, MrÂ Tremonti, the situation in Parliament is clear.
The communist Members and the left-wing statist social democrat Members back you, they hold you in esteem and they share your way of thinking, and against you are those who represent the stronghold of MrÂ Berlusconi and all his allies in Europe: the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and their satellites.
Let us just say at this juncture that you have taught us a lesson in the Italian spirit that you represent.
Breaking the rules is the art of this Italian ruling class; breaking them according to the rule of emergencies.
Pacts can be respected when those who do not respect them can decide that there are cases of when they do not have to be respected.
We know that you are also a legendary Member of Parliament, even if you were such as a journalist.
At the beginning of the nineties you wrote wonderful things about debt forgiveness, about deficit spending.
For meÂ âÂ a liberalÂ âÂ a little less so since you even brought ethics into it; you said that debt forgiveness and the way the old ruling classes behaved were not very ethical.
I congratulate you because I believe that you are now a pass-master at playing the old ruling class with such a great technical ability, if I may say so, to talk utter rubbish.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council has twice had to preside over an Ecofin Council, which twice in the space of four weeks committed a serious foul against the European Community project; the first instance was your letter to Mr Berlusconi in the aftermath of an Ecofin Council meeting, in which you heaped criticism upon the Conventionâs proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference, and the second came last week.
That cannot be allowed to go uncontradicted, and we cannot simply move on to the next item of business.
Whether one looks at it from the point of view of democratic politics, of economic policy, monetary policy, in legal terms or from the European angle, the way you have gone about things is harmful, unacceptable and deserving of condemnation.
Today, Commissioner Solbes told us that the Council has not kept to the spirit of the Treaty.
On Monday, MrÂ Trichet, the President of the ECB, told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the European Central Bank attaches great importance to the Stability and Growth Pact remaining unchanged whatever happens, for it has proved its worth in terms of economic and monetary policy.
He called on the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Member States to take their own responsibilities seriously.
It is in particular Germany and France whom I urge to refrain from blaming the EU in general, and the Stability Pact in particular, for their domestic difficulties.
Apportioning blame makes no proper contribution to achieving jointly-agreed objectives.
The European Union is made up of all of us.
Germany and France overstepped the mark in the way they interpreted the rules, and what was a Community matter they made merely intergovernmental.
By a political decision, they set the rules aside, but the Community is not an alternative to politics.
The finance ministers have impaired its credibility, shattered confidence and given rise to other problems.
That is not acceptable.
Â Â  MrÂ President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in Ecofinâs deliberations, the intergovernmental method prevailed over the Community method with a purely laxist decision being taken to suspend the procedure, without, that is, placing precise conditions on the extension granted to the Federal Republic of Germany and France to achieve a balanced budget.
This is very serious.
This is a weighty precedent, which could benefit other countries in future and which, as MrÂ Prodi said, is detrimental to effective coordination, to the governance of economic and social policies on the basis of transparent, binding objectives, not just in terms of stability but also, and especially at this time, in terms of growth.
This incident, however, only serves to highlight the shortcomings and contradictions that remain in the management of the Stability and Growth Pact, with the European Parliament still being excluded from any codecision procedure.
This incident highlights the shortcomings in the actual wording of the Stability Pact, which is much more restrictive and mechanical than the text of the Treaty, not least as regards problems of flexibility.
This means that the Union institutions, starting with the Commission, have to take two completely incompatible approaches in managing the two missions that the Union has given itself in the field of economic, social and environmental policy.
I am referring to the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, the latter still without binding objectives, and to the Stability and Growth Pact.
It is these serious shortcomings, which are also present in the Commission initiative, which explain why management which is flexible but not appropriate in terms of compliance with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact has been adopted, without the minimal but specific conditions being established that justify the length of time set for adjusting budgets.
I am referring to the Lisbon strategy, to the binding objectives of the Lisbon strategy that need to be among the conditions to be fulfilled in the implementation of the Stability Pact.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of the various aspects dealt with in this debate, I would like to comment on the following: firstly, there has unquestionably been a serious crisis in the application of the bases of monetary union and the euro, which damage their credibility.
Secondly, I would take up the famous phrase that the European Union has been built on the basis of crisis and we should learn the lesson from this crisis, particularly in relation to an aspect which has already been mentioned by Commissioner Solbes, and which I fully support, which consists of having a genuine direction for economic policy, something that he has called European governance.
We have an asymmetric situation in a monetary policy which is much better defined than the economic policy.
I hope that this crisis will serve to provide us with this economic governance which this Parliament has always called for, and most recently, if you will allow me to be immodest, in my report on the international role of the euro.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we had a debate in Strasbourg on the Stability and Growth Pact as long ago as 21 October 2002.
Even then, I made it plain that there was no argument against limiting statesâ new public indebtedness, provided that this was coupled with the requirement that growth be generated and demand stimulated.
Growth and an increase in demand will not, however, be achieved by cutting wages or by longer working hours, but by taking the tax burden off the low and middle income groups, through public investment, capital-widening investment by businesses and by increasing private consumption.
The decision by the eurozone finance ministers to put the Excessive Deficit Procedure against Germany and France on ice and grant these states a reprieve, allowing them until 2005 to achieve the 3% limit for new annual indebtedness is a lazy compromise, one that does not alter the false basic premise, according to which, in economically tough times, strict adherence to the 3% limit has an expansionary rather than a contractionary effect.
In order to reinvigorate investment across the board, any reform of the Stability Pact must go hand in hand with more European economic, social, employment, fiscal and environmental policies.
It must be possible to use loans to fund public investment, even if this does, for a period, take the deficit over the 3% limit.
Such would be, in my judgment, an honest and proper course of action, without which we would lose all credibility and the same problem would rear its head in more countries every year.
You may think otherwise, but my view is that we should correct mistakes rather than try to cover them up with new ones.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Solbes, ladies and gentlemen, I have noted how, regarding the Stability and Growth Pact, exaggerated statements were made and hasty conclusions were drawn in some cases.
I am also referring to MrÂ Poettering: I do not think that MrÂ Tremonti invited the Member States to run up debts, but rather to look more at the substance than the procedures of what has happened.
Nor do I agree with MrÂ Watsonâs speech when he talks of a watered-down Pact.
The Italian Presidency has taken it out of the water in which it was drowning.
Even less do I feel that I can agree with those who claim that the Pact is dead.
If, instead, we look at the facts, we have to agree that, on the contrary, the Pact is still alive and that the Italian Presidency has succeeded in saving it, even in a situation where there were very real difficulties.
The Presidency has succeeded in obtaining the unanimous adoption, including, therefore, endorsement even from the most rigorous States, of conclusions which contain important commitments on respecting the Pact, budgetary discipline and implementing structural reforms.
This has not been discussed in the Member States, still less in the European Parliament.
As regards the Commission recommendation, the issue is a simple one: the Commission presented recommendations which, while fully respecting the Treaty, were put to the vote in the Council.
The Council rejected them since the majority required by the same Treaty was not reached.
What should the Italian Presidency have done?
Taken note of the rejection of the Commission recommendations without adopting any other act?
Left France and Germany free to act?
Rendered the whole process to date invalid?
I believe that, in this case, there really should have been talk of a dead Pact and of the Councilâs irresponsible behaviour.
Instead, the Italian Presidency chose the only way to save the Pact.
Faced with the impossibility of adopting the Commission recommendations, it proposed to adopt the Conclusions in which France and Germany committed to updating the measures for reducing the deficit and to temporarily suspend the procedure.
Â Â  â Madam President, today is not a day for delivering eulogies, nor is it a day when we should be saying that the law â European law â has been broken.
The procedures are clearly described in the Maastricht Treaty, and they are echoed in the Stability Pact.
Each has its part to play â the Commission just as much as the Council of Finance Ministers.
The fact that they do not absolutely have to agree in their assessments has something to do with the way in which everyone stresses the need for the Pact to be adhered to and our need for rules, without it being clear how effective a pact of this kind can be when it deals only with sanctions for when things are going badly and makes no provision for the Commission to have a role when things are going well.
The Pact is defective not only in that the Commission has no role when things are going well, but also in that it highlights only the difficulties that the Member States face in times of recession.
Are not, though, the effects of a three-year period of stagnation, which has shaken and battered Europeâs major national economies in particular, ultimately every bit as bad as a recession?
Today, I believe, we also have to emphasise that the Pact has, indeed, demonstrated its effectiveness and so we can set about reforming it without qualms.
Any reform must involve the Commission abolishing its rigid procedures for cyclical adjustment and allowing itself to be judged using the methods chosen by the International Monetary Fund.
If it did, perhaps our debates would be quite different, as we also have to bear in mind that the figures at issue between the Council of Finance Ministers and the Commission in the cases of France and Germany, even with the error rates in our statistics, relate only to a gap of 0.2%.
What we really need now, I believe, is an in-depth debate on the reform of the Stability Pact; above all else, I believe that we have to combine a genuine definition not only of monetary stability but also of financial soundness, with growth and with social stability.
That, rather than austerity alone, is the challenge that Europe faces.
Â Â  â Madam President, on 25Â November the procedures were adhered to in a formal sense, but everyone is well aware that there is a deterioration in the Community spirit.
There are passages in force that are admissions of weakness and the oxygen of confidence has become scarce in the European Union since that day.
We do not have sanctions, but the obligation to reduce deficits remains.
Indeed, one of the Councilâs conclusions highlights this.
We must therefore save what may be left of the Pact today, in other words its spirit, the quest for stability and growth, using the one to achieve the other.
What has happened also raises the question of the Franco-German relationship.
It is not a question of its necessity as regards moving Europe forward but its credibility in ensuring that the steps forward are accepted.
The Franco-German relationship is a driving force, but this driving force must not turn into a detonator that would cause Europe to explode.
Â Â  Madam President, the crisis in which the Stability and Growth Pact finds itself shows very clearly the instability of the EUâs currency union.
We can see how an economic crisis is very quickly also transformed into a political crisis, given the way in which the currency union is at present constructed.
We can see how, in practice, there are quite different rules for large countries such as Germany and France and for small countries such as Portugal and Ireland.
This crisis is not only due to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact not being fulfilled.
At root, there are significantly deeper problems.
Germanyâs and Franceâs problems are basically about low growth and unduly low employment.
The problem is that, in practice, the EUâs currency union and Stability and Growth Pact have nothing to offer in terms of getting growth under way and creating higher employment.
In that way, the crisis is in danger of deepening.
We also see clearly that different countries in the eurozone are now most likely doing well for having different policies.
Countries with quite different rates of growth and inflation need different interest and exchange rates.
It is no coincidence that those Western European countries that are not part of the currency union enjoy, on average, very much stronger economic development than the eurozone countries.
The euro is part of the problem.
It must be realised that the Stability and Growth Pact no longer works, but must be altered.
It must be able to allow a more expansive economic policy in times of crisis so that it is possible to escape from the economic crisis.
A very large majority of Swedes voted against the common currency in a referendum in September.
The crisis in the Stability and Growth Pact is further proof that it was a clever decision to stay out of the EUâs currency union.
It is now time to go further and, in the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference, to confirm the Swedish ânoâ in a legally binding exemption that is at least as comprehensive as the British one.
Â Â  â Madam President, I believe that, if you follow the debates in this House, the very substantial differences of opinion that exist here become apparent, and seldom have I heard anything more nonsensical than the statement that the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has just given us, in which she accused the Commission of using rigid procedures as a method of cyclical adjustment.
Mrs Randzio-Plath, I can only shake my head at that.
If you are capable of accusing the Commission of such a thing, then which Europe, which euro zone, are you living in?
We can do no other than back Commissioner Solbes to the hilt and urge him to take the Heads of State or Government to court, for such a breach of the European Stability and Growth Pact cannot be accepted without protest.
When this House is told that the Italian Presidency of the Council has managed to produce some tremendous conclusions, I ask myself whether this piece of paper is worth more than an international treaty such as the Stability and Growth Pact.
Why should Germany and France see themselves as bound by this piece of paper when they could not keep to the rules?
The leading German daily paper, the , spoke of Germany and France as a ââ, as digging the European Unionâs grave rather than acting as examples to its other Member States of how to do things.
The Pact is flexible enough as it is.
It is not the case that there has to be a 3% deficit; instead, the term used in the Pact is âbudgetary compensationâ.
The difference between 0% and 3% gives the Member States EURÂ 250 billion in reserve to deal with difficulties caused by the economic cycle, the management of international crises and natural disasters, so the problem is in fact that Germany and France already had no room for manoeuvre left when things started to get difficult.
It follows, Commissioner, that it is the reforms that you have to get to grips with rather than growth alone.
That is why we are firmly opposed to the Stability and Growth Pact being altered.
It has to be adhered to, and the Commission must be given more powers in its dealings with the Council.
Â Â  â Madam President, I am surprised that in this debate we are talking only about the Pact.
The problem is not so much the Pact.
The problem is that we are in a monetary union and we do not have an economic union.
Some people have called the Pact stupid.
I believe nonetheless that the Commission has demonstrated a certain degree of intelligence in its ability to interpret it.
I am surprised, however, that some people are talking about referring the matter to the Court of Justice and that no one has ever considered referring to the Court of Justice other violations of the Treaty committed on an ongoing basis by practically all of the members of the euro zone, when they did not consider their economic policy to be an issue of common interest, as the Treaty suggests.
That is the root of the problem before us.
The Stability Pact is only the rule at the end of the process that allows the points to be counted.
The Stability Pact never describes how to play the game, and the game can only be a team game.
The Stability Pact is called stupid or rigid.
It is much less so than the competitive devaluations that prevailed before the transition to the euro.
However, it is not enough on its own.
Thus, I believe that we must look at three aspects.
From the point of view of the economic policies, we have the strategic tool we need to ensure new growth in Europe: the Lisbon strategy.
We do not have the tool for its implementation and it is certainly not the Stability Pact that will be used to implement this strategy.
This is what we must consider.
Some people have proposed a strategy for major work.
However, the ministers for the economy and finance have yet to decide to finance it.
Everyone is talking about coordination but it only comes to the forefront when it enables France and Germany to unite against the Commission.
That is not coordination, which is the coordination that should enable the maximum benefit to be derived from the euro zone.
The second aspect relates to the dialogue with the Central Bank.
When the Central Bank talks, over and over again, about structural reforms, the governments do not listen to it; another form of dialogue with the governments must be found.
Finally, we must look to the work of the Convention in order to make progress in relation to the results in the IGC and consolidate the Commissionâs power as regards the implementation of an economic union.
Â Â  Madam President, most of what I had in mind to say has already been said and I endorse the speech made by Mr Poettering, who unfortunately has left.
I should like to focus our attention on the following: the rules we freely accept and subscribe to, big and small, weak and strong, must be respected by everyone, whether we like it or not.
Woe betide if the principles and regulations of the European Union were considered to apply and that, if they were in our interest we respected them and, if we did not like them, we ignored them.
The most fundamental principle of democracy is respect for the law by everyone.
If it does not satisfy us, we change it.
If the Stability Pact does not satisfy, let it be abolished or amended.
However, under no circumstances is it allowed for us to consider that it applies, but is not adhered to by those who do not like it, as is happening now.
When it was discovered that the terms of the pact were being infringed by small Member States of the European Union, such as Portugal, they were obliged to proceed to apply harsh measures and spending cuts in order to reduce their deficit to below 3%, and none of the big Member States now in violation asked for the pact not to be applied.
Now that the problem has unexpectedly hit their economy, they have discovered that the pact is anything from unsuitable or unacceptable.
Dual standards.
The reaction is therefore reasonable on the part of the small countries, who see that âsome are more equal than othersâ, as George Orwell said.
Thus their lack of faith in the new arrangements of the draft Constitution is being reinforced, with the possible danger of it not being ratified and of the European Union finding itself in a terrible impasse.
Â Â  Madam President, 'sticks and carrots' quoth Mr Watson: there were plenty of sticks and carrots in the Stability Pact - sticks for the workers and carrots for the managers, sticks for the unemployed and carrots for the financiers.
Not only was the Stability Pact socially unfair, it was totally unworkable, and the tragedy about breaking it is not that we did not wish it to be respected, it is that it was ever set up.
That was the real tragedy.
If we had stuck to the Maastricht criteria with the same severity that the Stability Pact asks us to stick to the three per cent, would there be a euro today?
Would there be a euro, Commissioner?
I ask everybody here to put their hand on their heart and answer that question honestly, like honest people who want rules to be respected.
The second point about this is that the Commission tells us that it will continue applying the Pact.
If the same case happens again, how will the Pact be applied?
I hope with the same latitude that was shown to France and Germany.
It would be unfair for a different standard to be applied to a small country in the future.
It has also been suggested that the deficits of today are the taxes of tomorrow.
How very simple!
The deficits of today can also be the investment of today, which will produce the higher income of tomorrow, from which higher taxes can easily be paid.
So I suggest we stop making virtuous speeches here and go and enrol in a good course of elementary macroeconomics, which some of us here seem to need - of course, I am not including the Minister in this comment.
He seems to know about it - or has learned about it - and I am grateful to him for that.
The substance of the matter is that today we need expansionary, rather than contractionary, economic policy.
Just as there is inflationary stability, there can also be deflationary stability.
From that point of view the demise of the Stability Pact is good for stability.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by quoting AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva, the Professor of Economics and former Prime Minister of my country, under whose leadership Portugal joined the euro.
His words might be harsh, but they are right: âthe Stability Pact was a stab in the back for the Franco-German axis, which changed from being a boost for a Community-based Europe to a factor for instability.
The Stability Pact is now dead, at least as regards its power to impose penalties.
This is an indication that the Community-based Europe has lost its directionâ.
I do not wish to contribute to the debate as to whether or not the Stability Pact was stupid.
We saw how, in the space of a few days, those who considered it to be intelligent decided not to comply with it and those who believed it to be stupid protested when it was ignored.
I admit that other indicators are needed and that mechanisms that apply to periods of growth might need to be qualitatively different to those that must be complied with in periods of recession.
There is one thing I am sure of, however: we need mechanisms to discipline public finances in the interest of the euro and of Europe.
What we cannot accept are the double standards of the criteria: some countries are obliged to comply with things that others are allowed to get away with.
What is damaging to European unity is the feeling that the small countries are not allowed to act in ways that the large countries can.
What is unacceptable is seeing those that have acted improperly making contemptuous and crude remarks about those who have honoured the commitments they have given.
One example is the deplorable attitude of the French and German Finance Ministers towards the Portuguese Governmentâs courageous budgetary stance.
What is worrying is that the backsliding on complying with the rules of the Pact could lead to an increase in interest rates, as MrÂ Solbes admitted.
This is a worrying scenario for highly indebted families and individuals.
Madam President, our aim should be to strengthen the instruments for European integration, not to weaken them, especially in the context of the debate on the new Constitutional Treaty and on the completion of enlargement.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently devoting a great deal of effort, and attaching a great deal of weight, to discussion of a new constitutional treaty, whereby we provide ourselves with a new legal framework for the future, at the same time as we do this, the larger countries demonstrate their indifference to the law as it stands.
I hope you will not mind if a Bavarian like myself draws a parallel.
At the time of the Austrian elections, when the coalition came into being, we accused this law-abiding country of illegality and sought to use all our powers to get our own way, and the same is happening now.
The larger countries are demonstrating that European law is of no interest to them.
I cannot do other than encourage the Commission to subject what has happened to critical scrutiny, including by their lawyers, because the Council has not only rejected the Commission proposal â as it was entitled to do â but has also disregarded the Commission and simply set new parameters.
This is not something that the Council is competent to do and so I cannot do other than offer the Commission encouragement.
Of course, the way the big boys play the game within the European Union has a seriously prejudicial effect on the accession countries, who, as we are aware, will, all ten of them, followed by another two, be signing up to the euro, and all the while we have had one debate after another about the need to keep to the criteria.
On what arguments will the Commission or the Council rely in future when telling these countries that they have to stick to the criteria?
We ourselves do not, so we can expect that they will do likewise.
The only thing I can actually do is give the Commission my backing.
This is where the Commission must proceed with rigour and consistency, and let me issue a warning against negotiating a new Pact; the current situation in Europe being what it is, any new Pact would not be worthy of the name, but would end up as a hotchpotch of wishful thinking and aspirations towards flexibility that bear no relation whatever to what the economy demands.
Europe is paying the price for Germanyâs failure to do its homework over the past few years, and, at the end of the day, what we are aiming for is to keep the European single currency as a guarantee of economic stability.
Thank you.
