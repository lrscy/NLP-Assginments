The new Amsterdam situation means that when we pass amendments and resolutions in this Chamber we have to be more aware of the legal consequences as well as the political consequences of what we are deciding.
We need to enhance the legal advice we have as a Parliament to support us through the conciliation and other procedures.
Finally, I should like to make it clear that I am not asking Parliament to spend massive amounts of new money.
However, to spend one or two per cent more in order to ensure that we remain effective is worth it, and we should look at prudence in the context of the wider demands of this Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ferber, I should like to make a point of congratulating you on your report.
Of course it is not the Commission' s job to evaluate individual proposals, but I would like to welcome the fact that Parliament is endeavouring to ensure that, in future, the buildings policy will reduce the burden on the budget from interest payments.
Of course, I also welcome, from the point of view of interinstitutional relations, that your proposal has remained, as it were, within category 5 of the agreement.
The agreement makes provision here for this joint estimate of personnel and administrative costs to be distributed between the institutions on the basis of a specific ratio and you have based your proposals on that distribution.
I think that again shows that many aspects of the financial perspectives facilitate work and planning, especially where firm agreements are concluded between the institutions.
Above all, however, what is important is that you have paid a great deal of attention in your report to the question of enlargement and staff policy in the translating and interpreting sector and, of course, the question of what measures are taken here is a highly political one.
More importantly, preparations do, of course, have to be made and you have pointed out - even though the question looks somewhat different from the point of view of the individual institutions - that it should be a matter of interinstitutional concern to address the subject and find a solution.
In this respect, congratulations once again on your report, especially on the fact that the report on the Budget 2001 looks beyond the Budget 2001.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Presentation by Commission of preliminary draft budget for 2001
The next item is the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft budget for 2001.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in February, the Commission debated the priorities for the European budget for next year and had the opportunity to discuss these priorities in detail with the European Parliament both here in plenary and, more importantly, in the Committee on Budgets and in the various trialogues between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council which have taken place since.
The Commission has used this debate as the basis for its preliminary draft budget for 2001, which it now has pleasure in presenting to you, as adopted by the Commission.
As it is the first preliminary draft budget which I have presented, allow me to comment on the procedure and the timing.
I think it makes a great deal of sense to debate priorities intensively first, before getting down to specific numbers. More importantly, I think it is most helpful to present the preliminary draft budget so early, thereby allowing time for intensive discussion.
Now to the budget proper: as with every national budget, most of the figures in the European budget for a given year are determined by contracts, by previous decisions in past years and by legal bases in past years.
This is particularly true of agricultural expenditure in the area of the organisation of the markets, the largest item in the budget, including in the Budget 2001, and of the Structural Funds and multiannual programmes, be they in research, youth measures or foreign policy.
Despite the fact that figures are determined by previous years, the Budget 2001 also sets clear political priorities and, following discussions over recent months, I think I can say that the priorities in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget tally to a large extent with Parliament' s priorities.
Take, for example, the priority under the second pillar of agricultural policy; the highest rate of increase in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget is for promoting the development of rural areas and I think that this in fact highlights that the Commission considers that we need to focus on the second pillar of agricultural policy.
Secondly, economic policy prioritises the need to develop and promote Europe as a knowledge-based society, which is why the Commission' s preliminary draft budget has set a very large plus against research and a new edition of the programme to promote small- and medium-sized enterprises and, more importantly, contains a proposal to combine them with the promotion of technology, which was also a matter of concern to the rapporteur, Mrs Haug.
Access to new technologies is not very well developed in small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Of course, with the economic structure which we would like to have and which is strongly supported by small- and medium-sized enterprises, and which we want to use to push Europe forward, it is necessary and it makes sense for Europe' s development in information and communications technologies to combine these two aspects.
The preliminary draft budget also contains a new focus on foreign policy.
We have already had the opportunity to debate this in great detail, especially assistance in the Balkans.
Another priority which I should like to mention is the need for budgetary rigour in the European budget and the Commission' s preliminary draft budget is in line with this objective.
So now a few figures on the overall budget.
Without agricultural expenditure, the preliminary draft budget makes provision for an increase in commitment appropriations, i.e. the financial commitments which can be entered into, of 1% in comparison with last year.
I think that this figure clearly illustrates that the preliminary draft budget is in keeping with the overall policy of budgetary rigour, and that the rate of increase in payments as a whole, without agricultural expenditure, is 3%.
I should point out that the average growth forecast for the budgets of the Member States is 3.1%.
I stress this because it will certainly play an important part during the debate with the Council.
However, we have included a considerable increase in agricultural expenditure in the preliminary draft budget, namely 7.6% or, in absolute terms, a total of EUR 3.12 billion.
This is mainly as a result of the resolutions passed by the Heads of State and Government at the Berlin Summit last year and these agreed financial perspectives form part of the interinstitutional agreement concluded last year between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
I should point out that this figure for agricultural policy actually makes provision for the draft budget for agricultural policy to remain under the ceiling decided in Berlin because the Commission proposal includes shifting EUR 300 million from the agricultural budget to foreign policy, yet still there is such a high rate of growth for agricultural policy.
To sum up, the preliminary draft figures as a whole make provision overall for a rate of increase of 3.9% in commitment appropriations and 5% in payments.
The rate of growth of payments is higher because we have a large backlog of payment commitments and the Commission currently takes the view that this should not get any bigger; on the contrary it should be reduced, which is precisely why the rate of growth for payments needs to be higher.
What does this mean for the European state quota?
By that I mean what proportion of the total gross national product of the European Community is absorbed by the European Union budget?
In other words, how high is the European state quota based on the strong growth in gross national product expected in the countries of the European Community next year?
There are very positive growth prospects here.
Is the change in the ratio of gross national product to budget from 1.11% in the year 2000 to 1.07% in the year 2001 a step backwards?
I highlight this - we also have extremely intensive debates in the Member States on state quotas, which are between 40 and 50% - in order to illustrate the fact that the European budget accounts for 1.07% of the total gross national product.
This clearly illustrates that the budget of the European Union is worth its weight in gold.
The European Union acquired a new remit following the war in Kosovo and the resolutions on the Stability Pact in the Balkans.
The Council stressed the importance of this remit once again in Lisbon.
Now we have to provide the funds and so the Commission has presented a proposal in its preliminary draft budget which reflects the importance of this remit.
EUR 815 million have been earmarked for aid to the western Balkans in 2001, following on from EUR 540 million this year.
This is the aid which has been earmarked in order to reconstruct the civil society, i.e. it does not, for example, include expenditure by Member States for KFOR troops.
Is expenditure of EUR 815 million for the entire region too high an estimate?
We have already discussed whether these countries are able to absorb this figure in the trialogue debate with the Council.
I think that, to an extent, this debate is somewhat cynical because requirements are, of course, extremely high. But of course the political decision as to how much aid the budgetary authority wishes to provide from the European budget rests with the budgetary authority alone.
I should point out that the proposal for Serbia for the year 2001 makes provision for a fixed sum of 40 million.
The Commission has proposed that, if the political situation changes in Serbia, additional funds will be provided from the flexibility reserve.
But I should like to stress once again that the Commission has made provision for a very large sum for Serbia in its proposed amendment to the financial plan for the period up to 2006, and I think that we should send a signal to Serbia, to the political opposition in Serbia, that the European Union is prepared to come up with large sums of aid if and when political democracy becomes a reality.
This is the Commission' s first budget in the form of activity-based budgeting; in other words, all budget expenditure has been allocated to political areas.
Now we can see at a glance how much is being spent on which political areas.
I think that it is an important step in the direction of greater transparency and stronger public political debate to stop talking in categories, because apart from us here in this House and a handful of officials in the Member States and a few well-informed journalists, who knows what internal policies are, for example?
I think that ABB, i.e. this proposal, this new structure, will really make public political debate much easier.
What is the European Union spending its money on?
This is therefore a very important step, not a technical step, but an important political step.
I should briefly like to point out that the Commission proposal includes a proposal for a letter of amendment on the Budget 2000.
More importantly, it also includes a whole series of technical adjustments and, in particular, the consequences of the annual accounts for 1999 for the European Union budget.
The European Union budget for 1999 closed with a large surplus of EUR 3.2 billion.
In other words, EUR 3.2 billion will be refunded to the Member States.
These refunds will be offset against the contributions for this year.
Of course, all Member States will be included and the money will be refunded in the ratio to which the Member States finance the European Union budget.
There was some confusion in relation to Great Britain in the report.
I should point out that the refund was offset but a different figure was obtained because of the rate of the euro to the pound.
Great Britain' s contribution in euros appears to be higher than in the plan, but if the calculation is carried out in pounds, it appears to be different.
So we need to take a good look at the question of exchange rates in the European budget.
I have highlighted this balance in order to illustrate - and this very point was raised in your debate on the European Parliament budget - that the term budgetary rigour is certainly not a concept which is foreign to the European budget and it is being applied.
The next step is for the Council to examine the Commission' s preliminary draft budget and to draw up a draft budget for the year 2001.
Of course this will be followed by intensive debate.
I trust that the rest of the procedure will be marked by less harping on about principles and more joint endeavour to use the funds in the European budget efficiently and for the benefit and in support of the objectives of the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your presentation. I should like to pick up straight away on your closing words.
I do not think that we should harp on about principles during our discussion of the Budget 2001.
But I also think that this is a call directed at the Council rather than a call directed at us, notwithstanding what has been submitted to us parliamentarians so far from the preliminary draft budget for evaluation.
This leads me to say that, first and foremost, the Commission has taken account of the Council' s wish that it present as economical a budget as possible.
You, yourself, said just now that the Budget 2001 is only 1% higher than the Budget 2000 without agricultural expenditure and we all know that agricultural expenditure accounts for a huge part of our budget.
To then talk of rigorous financial management to us alone is, of course, completely misplaced, especially as we here in Parliament are in favour of economical financial management.
The debate and the budgets which we have voted in the past demonstrate this and that is the way it should stay.
Allow me to remind the House: agricultural expenditure for the organisation of the markets is to rise by 7.6%.
Expenditure on rural development - and you stressed that we of course set great store by rural development - is to rise by 10.1%.
On the face of it, these relative figures alone, i.e. the percentages, are highly satisfactory.
But we all know that market expenditure in the current budget is over eight times higher than expenditure on rural development and that market expenditure in the next budget will be over nine times higher than expenditure on rural development.
This may take account of the wishes of the Council and of Council' s decisions, but it does not take quite such good account of the wishes of Parliament.
It is through Category 3, which encompasses all our priorities - not only Category 3, Category 4 also of course - but it is mainly through internal policies that all citizens perceive the European Union.
When you see that the budget has been set at around EUR 6.13 billion and then you compare that with market expenditure, then you see that market expenditure is six times higher than the whole of Category 3.
Knowing that four-fifths of all expenditure is tied in with multiannual programmes, and that, of course, 80% of all these multiannual programmes are decided under the codecision procedure, then the 1.4% increase proposed by the Commission is purely and simply the effect of the increase in research expenditure.
Nevertheless, you want to increase this expenditure by 8% and research expenditure accounts for over 60% of Category 3.
I know that the Commission is endeavouring to take account in the budget of the priorities it has accepted, namely creating a knowledge-based society and improving the quality of life of our citizens.
So far so good.
We can support that.
But what about Parliament' s priorities?
We discussed our priorities well in advance both among ourselves and with the Commission, and we adopted our guidelines well in advance, including for Category 3.
You have just picked out a few points but when we see that education and youth policy are to rise by 1.2% then we must say - looking at the entire heading - that that is because next year is the European Year of Languages and the expenditure for it will rise by 275%.
That is perfectly normal and we have supported that.
If you look at the Culture and Audiovisual Media heading, there is a 2.7% increase.
I would have expected it to be higher. Information and communications have risen by 4%.
But what about social dialogue and employment - down 4.7%.
What about energy policy, which we have fought for tooth and nail time and again?
You have cut it by 8.2% and you have cut environmental policy by a hefty 28.2%.
To my mind, the preliminary draft budget, as it now stands, takes no account of Parliament' s priorities.
Mrs Schreyer, what I personally hold dear to my heart, namely innovation and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises - yes, you have put a figure in the budget for this, but you have cut what we still had in the last budget by nearly 70%.
We urgently need to discuss this so that the budget also clearly sets out our priorities.
I have just this to say about Category 4: I think it is asking for trouble to support Serbia with such a small amount in 2001 and, at the same time, to say that once Serbia has democratised we can again use our flexibility instrument.
And one last comment which cuts across both Categories 3 and 4: what about the timetable on the legal framework for the offices for technical and administrative support or transformation promised by you and Commissioner Kinnock?
You wrote to us last December saying that a proposal would be submitted in the middle of April.
We are all dying to see it.
It is now the middle of May and we hope that it will make an appearance shortly because it is also important for our budgetary procedure.
Thank you, Mrs Haug.
Remember that you will have many months ahead to discuss this matter and to speak at length.
Furthermore, this is simply a dream on the part of the Commission.
The serious discussion will begin in July with the Council' s draft.
Mr President, Mrs Haug attended the Detlev Samland school of speaking to the clock and just carried straight on, as Detlev always used to.
Though we are talking about a PDB for the year 2001, it is somewhat difficult not to link it to the revision of the Financial Perspective.
I know we should not do so, but there is that link between the two which makes me want to comment on both.
For the Commission proposals to be successful three factors will be crucial.
The first is the assessment of needs for the western Balkans.
In a couple of weeks' time, Parliament will send an ad hoc delegation to Kosovo to try and make an assessment.
We will need to opt for the Commission proposal of EUR 5.5 billion in total or move towards the Council which is proposing a somewhat lower figure.
The second factor will be Parliament's attitude to redeployment, especially in Category IV, not just for 2001 but for the whole of the Financial Perspective.
That is why I say they have to be linked.
I will give you an example.
One area of great interest for me - I make no secret of it - is South Africa.
The proposal to take EUR 2 million per year away from South Africa for six years may not seem much.
But EUR 12 million is a lot of money for the projects in South Africa.
I would not be happy with that and I am sure other people in other areas of interest in Category IV would adopt a similar attitude.
Then we have Parliament's attitude towards redeployment in Category I. Similarly, we have to consider our approach to the use of the flexibility instrument if it was invoked for Serbia, as you suggest.
We have to bear in mind what the Interinstitutional Agreement says about a rule not being used for the same things in consecutive years.
Once again that would be a challenge for Parliament.
The third factor, and probably the most important one, is the attitude of the Council.
If they reject what you are proposing, especially as far as the revision goes, the question remains: what will you do next?
I know we have a trialogue and a conciliation before their first reading but it is a problem we have to resolve before the Council's first reading.
What happens if the Council is adamant and rejects the Commission's proposals?
Mrs Schreyer, you are something of a juggler and an illusionist at the same time, with the proposals that have been made.
You have to keep several balls in the air and, at the same time, because of what is proposed after 2003, you have to make more appear.
One of the great mysteries in your proposals on the revision is where the money will come from after 2003.
But that is not for next year.
That is for the future.
In the meantime we await developments on those three factors.
Hopefully, at the end of this process, we will get a satisfactory outcome.
Protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud
The next item is the report (A5-0116/2000) by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the 1998 annual report by the European Commission on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud.
Mr Dell'Alba has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, I should like to ask a preliminary question, pursuant to Rule 143.
The fact is, I think that tolerance can only be taken so far, and that it is no longer acceptable for a parliamentary committee to set itself up as a public welfare committee, going into anything and everything with every report, setting forth considerations which are far removed from the subject under consideration.
Some 80% of this report entitled "report on the 1998 annual report by the European Commission on protecting the Communities' financial interests" , on the legal basis of Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure, refers to OLAF, the White Paper, the reform, all sort of subjects covered by other reports, and even other committees, but has nothing to do with what Mr BÃ¶sch was supposed to be dealing with.
According to my rights under the Rules of Procedure, I should like my preliminary question, which is a question of principle, to be put to the vote.
The Committee on Budgetary Control must stop meddling wholesale, as has been the case recently, with the subject areas of other committees.
We have seen rapporteurs, particularly Mrs Theato, obstructing documents outside their own area of competence for weeks at a time.
Some of us are starting to become annoyed.
In this specific instance, I move that this report be deemed inadmissible and that we move on to the report which is the next item on the agenda.
I request that this be put to the vote.
Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba.
Allow me to remind the honourable Members by quickly reading Rule 143(1) out loud: "At the beginning of the debate on a specific item on the agenda, its inadmissibility may be moved.
Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately."
According to the Rules of Procedure, one person may speak for and one person against the motion, after which it is put to the vote immediately without further debate.
Mrs Theato, are you speaking against Mr Dell'Alba' s motion?
Mr President, I am somewhat surprised because this report was duly and unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I would have expected such matters to be clarified in committee, rather than here in plenary.
The report has been available for some time and I therefore see no reason why we cannot debate and vote on it.
Secondly, I would be obliged if Mr Dell'Alba could tell me what he means by saying that I have blocked documents for weeks.
I fail to understand Mr Dell'Alba' s choice of words and assertion and I would welcome an explanation.
As no one wishes to speak for the motion, the vote shall now take place.
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
Mr President, allow me to start with a few comments on the judgement of the Court of First Instance of 2 May on the rights and duties of the members of this House vis-Ã -vis OLAF.
I welcome this judgement.
It clarifies that, as elected representatives of the people, we may rightly claim a special status and that, in the event of doubt, protecting our independence takes precedence.
That was my position from the outset, incidentally.
That was why, during negotiations with the Commission and the Council, we made all the sensitive passages in the OLAF regulation subject to the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities.
That was why we suggested last autumn in the Committee on Budgetary Control that the provisions for members should be kept separate from the provisions for officials.
Unfortunately, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs did not subscribe to this view.
I said from the outset that members' offices were off limits for OLAF.
Obviously, the Commission' s legal service took a different view.
Now it has been taught a lesson by the Court.
However, the court judgement has put us in a position of inequality, because only the plaintiff can cite this judgement.
This state of affairs may last for a ridiculous amount of time, perhaps until a judgement is returned on the main issue, which may not be for two years.
I have therefore taken recourse to Rule 181 of the Rules of Procedure and proposed an amendment to the Rules of Procedure.
The text which I have proposed is in line with the original proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
It keeps to the letter of the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission and the Council and takes full account of the stipulations of the Court of First Instance.
I urge you to support this initiative to amend the Rules of Procedure.
It would allow the matter to be clarified as quickly as possible and, I think, would even allow the members who took recourse to the Court to withdraw their action.
If the proposed amendment to the Rules of Procedure is implemented, their action would, as a matter of course, be pointless anyway.
This too is perfectly clear from the Court' s judgement. Parliament' s internal decision was out of order, but the Parliament and Council regulation of 25 May 1999 on the work of OLAF is here to stay and is not open to question.
This is why I fail to comprehend why a number of proposed amendments to my report claim that the Court' s judgement has strengthened the position of the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank in their opposition to the regulation.
It is true that both banks maintain that the Parliament and Council regulation cannot under any circumstances be applied to them because this would encroach upon their independence.
I totally fail to understand that; we have no intention of interfering in the banks' work.
What we do want is to guarantee that they have a minimum degree of protection against fraud, or do they want us to end up using private detectives to carry out this work?
The European Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors have duly implemented the provisions of the OLAF regulation in corresponding internal decisions.
They certainly would not have done so if they had felt that their independence was being jeopardised.
Neither bank has a plausible explanation as to why they do not accept what the independent judges of the European Court of Justice have accepted.
Three points on the content of my report.
Point number 1 concerns OLAF as an investigation unit which identifies and investigates suspicious cases quickly and efficiently.
The legal basis for this is in place.
Together with the Council, we have done everything within our power.
The development of OLAF is well under way.
Point number 2 concerns the European financial public prosecutor who, in the initial stage, has the right to support the national courts in prosecuting criminal offences committed by officials or employees of the Union.
Point number 3 concerns really effective disciplinary procedures.
The Staff Regulations and Financial Regulation have long made provision for the competent decision-makers to pay for damage for which they are responsible out of their own pocket in cases of gross negligence or intent.
This provision has never been applied.
The Commission is planning even now to delete it from the Financial Regulation.
That would be precisely the wrong signal.
We urge the Commission to reconsider such a move.
What is wrong with the present disciplinary procedures is that, of necessity, they lead to huge conflicts of interest.
In the case of senior officials, the College of Commissioners decides whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be instituted and it is the Commission which passes the final judgement, at the proposal of a disciplinary board on which senior officials have to advise on the fate of senior officials, i.e. colleagues sit in judgement on colleagues.
That cannot work and it does not work.
As long as this system is maintained, the accusation will be made time and again, rightly or wrongly, that proceedings are open to manipulation.
Nor will this change once the disciplinary board becomes an interinstitutional board, i.e. a board of officials from various institutions.
It will only change if the Commission takes up the proposal of real externalisation, as agreed by the House in the vote on the Hulten report on 19 January, in which Parliament called for disciplinary proceedings in the case of infringements of the Financial Regulation to be referred to an external chamber of the Court of Justice or the Court of Auditors so that proceedings are objective and fair beyond doubt.
We even stipulated in this report that the Chamber should form part of the Court of Auditors, with the Court of Justice sitting in appeal.
The report also includes a number of points from the White Paper on the reform of the Commission in connection with OLAF.
And yet I have just heard from some quarters that we should postpone a decision on these points and not take a stand on them just yet.
Except that the Commission wants to implement all the points addressed here before the summer recess.
If we do not take a stand on them now, then we can spare ourselves the trouble altogether.
One last word to Mrs Schreyer: I know from conversations last week with the members of the OLAF Supervisory Committee that the recruitment and appointment procedures for OLAF are proceeding too slowly.
Clearly one reason for this is that the Commission is obviously proving to be too inflexible, despite the fact that, on paper, it has transferred full powers to the director of OLAF in a decision in due and proper form.
I can only urge you to stand by your own decisions and not create difficulties where none exists.
(Applause)
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I am standing in for the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee, my colleague Mr MacCormick, who is unable to be here today.
In our Community, there is hardly anything worse than fraud to undermine public confidence in the activities of the Union, and so the views of the rapporteur deserve our full support.
Fraud, of course, affects only a small fraction - i.e. just over 1 % - of the EU' s total budget, but it is a very serious problem which seems to extend to almost all political sectors.
The EU budget, however, is largely administered within the Member States, and this is where huge potential for fraud exists.
We must also remember that applicant countries, i.e. the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, should be involved in this fraud prevention process for the very reason that such a large share of the Community budget is administered within the Member States.
So far, fewer than half of the Member States have ratified the protocol on protecting the Union' s financial interests. This process should therefore be speeded up considerably.
Furthermore, some Member States are particularly unwilling to undertake the mutual exchange of information concerning fraud. Therefore it is important for Member States to have a direct obligation to report cases of VAT fraud, for example, to the Commission.
It is quite appropriate to examine the possibilities of creating the post of public prosecutor, expressly from the point of view of the fight against fraud, and this should be done, but even that will be to no avail, if the Member States lack the political will to protect the Communities' financial interests.
As far as OLAF' s position is concerned, it is important to protect its independence and equally important for the European Parliament to come to an agreement with OLAF with regard to the conditions on which Parliament can obtain information about its operations.
. Mr President, in the time available, I wish on behalf of the Economic Committee to stress three issues that we considered to be of cardinal importance when we examined the annual report on the Community's financial interests and the fight against fraud.
First was the issue of definition.
It is the case that the Commission have come under a significant amount of attention in recent years from Parliament and from the European public at large who want the Commission to deal with allegations of fraud, but it is also important that we should know what we are talking about when we define fraud.
The annual report itself indicates that for the first time there has been an attempt made to try to assess what amounts to fraud and what is general irregularity, and I am of the view that it does not help the reputation of our European institutions if we are lax with definition.
It is important that the work being undertaken by the Commission should be expanded because, in a situation in which 20% of irregularity amounts to fraud, the fact of the matter is that by referring to it as fraud and irregularity, European citizens can often be left with an impression that all of the claims are fraudulent ones.
The second point that I want to make is about the commitment of Member States to deal with fraud.
The fact of the matter is that Member States have a high responsibility here.
They are responsible for administering some 80% of the EU's budget and they must recognise that they are, at the very least, partners if not prime movers in attempting to address this important issue, and the report indicates that the performance of Member States has been mixed to say the least.
My final point concerns the accession countries.
We must demand that the accession countries also endeavour to work in conjunction with the European Union and to the highest standards.
Mr President, Commissioner, when deciding here in Parliament whether or not to grant discharge to the Commission, we check that there is no irregularity in expenditure by the administration.
In the past - as we are now all aware - there have been irregularities within the Commission.
Each report by the Court of Auditors also highlights the decisive role of the Member States in distributing Community funds.
A number of errors for which the Member States are to blame occur during the distribution of funds, which makes us apprehensive, especially as a considerable percentage is the result of fraud.
Consequently, it is not just within the Commission that we need to wield an instrument to fight fraud, which we call OLAF.
OLAF is the outcome of the modus operandi of the Member States and the Commission and should take on an objective role precisely so as to get to the bottom of these errors and prevent them from arising.
The EU must use European measures such as the introduction of the euro to prove its European competence to the outside world, because the accompanying counterfeiting industry, to name but one example, is an external matter.
Nevertheless, deeper causes for error rates clearly lie in the different handling systems in the Member States.
Right from the outset, legislative texts are often worded differently and allow perfectly legal but differing definitions of fraud.
This opens the door to fraud.
Just think of the example of the collection of value added tax.
Under no circumstances should OLAF become nothing more than a help desk.
OLAF is not one of your broadcasts for DIY enthusiasts, along the lines of "How can we build a model railway?"
The issue should not be taken lightly.
Protecting the financial interests of the Union and fighting fraud are a necessity, pure and simple, which call for a uniform instrument which can act independently, preventively, efficiently and as a deterrent, and which depend upon transparent regulations both internally and externally, so that everyone knows where they stand.
I would like this financial instrument to have an additional name such as prosecutor, a broad-shouldered European financial prosecutor.
This prosecutor must be accepted by the Member States, take on an active role and, at the same time, be integrated into the national jurisdiction of the Member States.
I would remind you at this point that Parliament called for an external chamber for budgetary discipline in its resolution of 19 January.
In my view this is a good idea and is not only worth considering, it is indispensable if we are to create a comprehensive area of justice and law.
A neutral, objective judgement will serve the cause and the individual concerned, condemnation of colleagues by colleagues will not.
OLAF is no Big Brother Ã  la Orson Welles, but is limited in its remit by the rule of law.
The immunity of members, for example, will of course continue to be protected.
I call on the Intergovernmental Conference to take our concerns on board.
We are fighting here for technical measures which, hopefully, will not turn into a long-running saga.
We must concentrate once again on European values so that, for example, our money is not misappropriated for the drawing up of military measures.
I know it is difficult to impart ideals and virtue to another person.
But that is where our efforts should be concentrated.
Because worthlessness soon turns into helplessness.
- (PT) Mr President, the current year is the first in which OLAF is fully operational.
It needs to be pointed out here that this is a decisive step in protecting the financial interests of the Union, the impetus for which came from this House and, in particular, from the Committee on Budgetary Control and from the present rapporteur, our colleague, Herbert BÃ¶sch.
With an increase in staff, with a new structure and independence, all the conditions are now in place for OLAF to concentrate on fighting fraud in an area where the objective and verifiable figures point to a more serious situation.
Fraud and other irregularities in the traditional own resources reported by Member States reached a total of EUR 538 million in 1998, an amount unparalleled in any other area of Community expenditure, either in absolute or relative terms.
Special report No 9 of the Court of Auditors on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests in the area of VAT on intra-Community trade points to an even more serious situation.
According to the Court of Auditors, the gap between actual receipts and their theoretical amount is EUR 70 thousand million.
Unlike the main areas of expenditure, which the Commission monitors and on which it imposes a system of sanctions, there is nothing comparable in these two vital areas of the Community' s own resources.
The Commission, specifically in its recent reports on administrative cooperation and on procedures for collection and taxation, describes a situation which is characterised by the maintenance of a system for VAT collection, which was only intended to be used on a temporary basis but is being used permanently. This system is also characterised by the increasing complexity of the system and by the widespread shortage of human resources and monitoring materials compared to the volume of transactions.
Despite the fact that there is widespread agreement on the need to overcome the problems of fighting fraud which result from restrictions imposed by national legislation, or to the lack of a legal basis in Community legislation, the Commission' s proposals have not, until today, met with any response and the anti-fraud sub-committee in the area of indirect taxation has found it impossible, in the words of the Commission "to achieve meaningful progress and cannot take the necessary decisions to improve the fight against fraud" .
What is more serious than this is the fact that the Commission' s reports on VAT collection have been scandalously disregarded by the other institutions and have not been followed up to any degree by the Member States.
Compliance with Article 280 of the Treaty, specifically where it requires the effective and equivalent protection of the Community' s financial interests will be dead letter unless we overcome the situation of there being a loophole in the law in the area of traditional own resources and VAT.
The protection of the Community' s financial interests, and particularly those of the taxpayers, who comply, cannot continue to be disregarded when it comes to indirect taxation.
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mr BÃ¶sch on his relentless efforts to turn OLAF into a success.
There are many points in the present resolution which the Liberal Group can endorse.
Firstly - and this cannot be repeated enough - we think that at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, a decision should be made in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor, which in its capacity as an independent body, will work to safeguard the financial interests of the European Union.
We would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect as soon as possible.
Also, the date mentioned in the report is important, in our opinion.
We also endorse the proposal for an external chamber to enforce budget discipline, which will mainly be concerned with examining the financial liability of officials.
In our opinion, it is important that this task is taken from the Commission, so as to take away any semblance of nepotism and such like.
OLAF starts its first full working year this year.
We will all have to wait and see what the outcome of that will be.
Expectations are naturally very high.
One aspect, however, could be improved on, namely the Supervisory Committee, as Mr BÃ¶sch calls it in his report.
Everyone has a right to a defence, including those who need to be investigated by OLAF.
We must see to it that these investigations are carried out as independently and fairly as possible.
I would call on the Commission to submit proposals to this effect too.
There has been a lot of publicity lately surrounding the issue as to whether or not OLAF should be able to investigate the European Investment Bank regarding the use of European funding, as well as the European Central Bank.
The Liberal Group is of the opinion that this should clearly be the case as these are European institutions too.
They cannot remain outside OLAF' s general scope of investigation.
We support the Commission so as to make this possible.
Finally, over the past few years, the European Court of Auditors has become increasingly aware that fraud and irregularities in structural funds are on the increase, whilst those in agricultural funds are still excessive but are dropping.
This is diametrically opposed to the opinion held by the Commission, which believes that fraud and irregularities occur far less in structural funds than they do in agricultural funds.
This anomaly must be resolved without delay.
The structural funds are gaining in importance all the time and form a large area of investigation for OLAF and the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I too would first of all like to congratulate Mr BÃ¶sch on his sound report and, unlike Mr Dell'Alba, I think that Mr BÃ¶sch has indeed drawn the right lessons from OLAF' s annual report which was published late last year.
We might as well admit it, there are a great many money-grubbers active within the European Union, and organised crime no longer concentrates solely on drug smuggling, the arms trade, trafficking in humans, meat fraud, alcohol and cigarette smuggling, VAT merry-go-round fraud and oil fraud, and has not done so for a long time.
They are all forms of crime which cause serious harm to the EU' s budget, both on the revenue side and the expenditure side.
We may have had a single market since 1993 which accommodates the free movement of goods, services, people, capital, as well as organised criminals, but this single market does not exist - and this is so unfortunate - for police services and magistrates alike.
On my own behalf, I will therefore stick my neck out and endorse all paragraphs of the BÃ¶sch report which call for the setting up of a European Public Prosecutor' s office.
I know it is a controversial issue, even within my own group.
Despite this, I believe that such a European Public Prosecutor' s office should be set up.
I would therefore ask the European Commission, as a matter of extreme urgency, to meet the request of the BÃ¶sch report to add an extra clause to the present OLAF regulation before 30 June, providing for a kind of trial project in which a European Public Prosecutor is appointed from within OLAF who can only act on behalf of members and staff of the European institutions.
I entreat Commissioner Schreyer to give very specific answers to this request and would ask her whether she would be prepared to take any initiative in this matter before 30 June.
Mr President, Mr BÃ¶sch's report deals clearly and relevantly with the problems bound up with protecting the EU' s financial interests and combating fraud.
Fraud is a scourge as far as the EU is concerned.
I do not know how large a percentage of the Member States' budgets disappears due to fraud and irregularities.
In my own country, it is close on zero per cent, and I think that what we have noted in recent years in the EU' s accounts reflects the fact that common funds are not handled so carefully and meticulously as money which the States regard as their own.
Mr BÃ¶sch's report goes a very long way towards representing the positions adopted by my group, most especially in its observations concerning the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank.
We have a problem in relation to appointing a European Public Prosecutor, whose office we would regard as an integral part of the federal EU we do not wish to see.
We think that the problems highlighted can be solved at national level.
We are quite clear about the fact that these provisions are aimed especially at the new Member States whose legal arrangements differ from those of the EU countries. We think, however, that this ought to be an incentive to engage in negotiations designed to promote cooperation between the legal systems.
However, it is not, of course, by means of the present report that we are to decide this matter and, against that background, I should like to inform you that my group is voting in favour of Mr BÃ¶sch's report because we think that there are clear demands which Parliament is making here and with which the Commission must comply.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to emphasise the point I raised to the effect that, out of the 19 recitals and the 30 paragraphs of the BÃ¶sch report, there were only 11 recitals and 6 paragraphs to do with the subjects that Mr BÃ¶sch was supposed to be discussing.
The other paragraphs are about something completely different.
Important matters, I do not deny, but matters which have already been dealt with in the van Hulten report and the Theato report, or matters which will be dealt with when we come to discuss the White Paper, the reform and OLAF, with the judgement and the ruling of the Court of First Instance.
I am astounded that Mr BÃ¶sch is pleased with this because he was one of the people who thought that Parliament' s text was fine and that OLAF was entitled to poke its nose in everywhere, though this is not the case.
The European Central Bank was thus quite justified in saying that it was not very sure what authority OLAF actually had in this area.
My criticism of the BÃ¶sch report, then, is the very simple reason that we have other instruments.
A situation whereby the Committee on Budgetary Control' s many reports keep bringing up the same subject is not normal.
Let us take the proposal for an independent Prosecutor.
Mrs Theato attempted to have this adopted as a legislative initiative.
She did not succeed.
The Committee on Budgetary Control tried to do so, and Parliament rejected it.
This is not a proposal for a legislative initiative.
What, then, is the point of harping on all the time about something which is, obviously, a problem area?
Even though the fraud problem primarily affects the Member States, you wish to set up a special court, ad hoc courts.
You know, Mr BÃ¶sch, in the past, in Italy and other countries, they had special courts.
Probably in your own country too, and these were not exactly models of democracy.
So I would adopt a more cautious approach.
I think this report is a waste of a lot of paper.
Mrs Stauner might well write another letter asking why so much money has been spent in order to repeat things that have been said already, Mr BÃ¶sch, but which it was not worth repeating.
What is more, many of the amendments seek to remove paragraphs.
We shall readily vote in favour of these because we must confine ourselves to the points included in the reports and it is high time that this practice, which is common to all the committees, were adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control too.
Mr President, Mr BÃ¶sch has prepared a good report on protection against fraud.
We agree with the way in which the problems are described, but I do not believe that crime and theft are combated by establishing a common public prosecution service and common penalties and by appointing more inspectors within the EU.
I believe that it is through transparency that irregularities can most effectively be cleared up: complete openness about the budget procedure, complete openness as to who has been involved in deciding upon an appropriation, complete openness about who the recipient of the appropriation is and complete access to all documents for the ombudsman and for the European Parliament' s and the national parliaments' auditors and supervisory committees.
If it can always be seen who has obtained what, fraud will be revealed by journalists and a critical public - perfectly free of charge and with far greater preventative effect.
I would therefore ask the Commissioners to promise us that, in future, Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the ombudsman will be allowed to see any document.
What are we not allowed to see?
What is the ombudsman not allowed to see?
When will we be given a complete overview of all the committees and working parties, together with their members?
Will our rapporteurs be allowed to check on any payment from the funds?
Lack of transparency is the fraudsters' best friend and makes it more difficult to clarify matters.
It is due to a lack of transparency that the new Commission too will, unfortunately, be concealing fraud instead of bringing every instance of it into the light of day and so deterring anyone else who might have the same idea.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with the first report sent to us by OLAF and I would like to thank Mr BÃ¶sch for the excellent work he has presented to us.
The most interesting parts of his work are surely those which refer to the subject of the report, that is to say 1998, and OLAF, the body which is presenting its first piece of work.
I agree that this report perhaps prejudges certain aspects which should be subject to further debates in the Committee on Budgetary Control and in this House, but I would like to highlight the positive aspects of its contribution.
With reference to 1998, I believe that we should recognise that, after having intensified the task of control, which should be initiated by Parliament and which OLAF carries out, the number of cases of fraud and irregularities has stabilised.
Without relaxing our efforts to control expenditure - of which we have shown signs in the past - we can see that this stabilisation has been the result of an increase in control.
We should therefore be pleased about this and hope that this work continues, so that cases of fraud can be reduced rather than merely stabilised.
It is clear that, in fundamental fraud, there are discrepancies between what the Court of Auditors says and what OLAF says.
In OLAF' s judgement, it appears that it is not in the Structural Funds that fraud and bad management prevail.
It is other expenditure that we should be concerned about.
In any event, returning to OLAF, by means of this report, we should, in my view, ask for OLAF to be provided as soon as possible with the officials which have been allocated to it.
However, I think it is very important that, in this first stage - precisely because we are interested in control - we do not increase OLAF' s scope of activity so soon after it has begun its work.
I understand that there are and there will be - although we hope that this is not the case - great problems with the counterfeiting of currency, trademarks or VAT.
It is essential that we allow OLAF to continue to pursue its scope of activity little by little and that we expand its role at a later date.
Finally, we should not duplicate responsibilities.
In order to use resources correctly, one body should be responsible for each issue and we should not have a situation where everybody is responsible for everything.
I therefore believe that we should clearly separate objectives and not allow confusion to reign.
At the end of the day "he that too much embraceth, holds little", as we say in Spain, so if we want to manage control, we cannot all have the same objective.
Mr President, I would like to join the many speakers who have congratulated Mr BÃ¶sch on his report.
As usual - and as has already been mentioned - the annual report shows that in 1998 too, an excessive proportion of the European resources was not spent according to the rules.
As usual, most irregularities pertain to expenditure in the Member States and vary in nature.
The irregularities are partly caused by deliberate abuse of the regulations, partly due to errors in the implementation of European legislation or simply down to bad policy.
I would like to distance myself somewhat from what Mr Mulder said on this score.
The fact that so much fraud is being committed using agricultural funds is a sign that something is wrong with the way in which we organise our support for agriculture and this needs to change.
The steps required to fight fraud have been mentioned on countless occasions, including today.
I would like to highlight two.
Firstly, there are still Member States that have not signed the Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the EU.
My own country is one of them and I hereby call on the Dutch Parliament to ratify the act which ratifies the Convention and which has been with the Chamber since October.
In addition, it is also important that steps are being taken within the Intergovernmental Conference to appoint a European Public Prosecutor. To my amazement, I noticed that in one of the amendments to this report tabled by the PPE-DE Group, an attempt was made to limit the mandate of this public prosecutor, whilst I was under the impression that the PPE-DE was actually in favour of it.
The PPE-DE Group would like to limit the European Public Prosecutor' s mandate to the European institutions only, while we have just seen that most fraud takes place within the Member States.
The PPE-DE Group had better have a good explanation for this.
We have made a new start with the independent OLAF.
In my opinion, it is rather important for the functioning of OLAF that its work be open to public scrutiny, and for there to be set rules governing investigations, which are available for perusal by Parliament too. This will prevent us from running behind the facts in future, as is now the case with the 1998 discharge procedure.
Mr President, my last point concerns the European Parliament itself.
As you know, the Court recently decided in an initial ruling that OLAF only has limited access to the European Parliament.
I regret that the Court has reached this decision and hope that it will arrive at a different decision in the final ruling.
Meanwhile, however, I would like to make it clear that immunity for parliamentarians does not mean that we are above the law.
If the Court' s final ruling stipulates that OLAF has no access to Parliament because the rules will not permit this, we must adapt our rules rather than overrule the decision, so as to grant OLAF access to Parliament, including parliamentarians, because, I repeat, we are not above the law.
Ladies and gentlemen, this report is an excellent illustration of what should be done and what should not be done.
As far as we are concerned, combating fraud is more than a priority, it is a commitment we have to the people who elected us.
This principle has been emphasised all the more by the revelation of inefficiencies within the Community institutions.
In this respect, our determination to implement sound management procedures beforehand that are capable, subsequently, of being monitored must be absolutely foolproof.
In order to do so, we must focus on the effectiveness of the procedures set in place, particularly under OLAF.
So, I beg you, please, do not try, for ideological reasons, to come and complicate matters, adding yet more structures and procedures.
This is the reason why we are not in favour of creating a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.
We must be able to have confidence in relying on the national structures.
In fact, the proposal to create a European Public Prosecutor' s Department is unacceptable since this requires us to be effective immediately.
In the same spirit, we shall support Amendment No 13 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which will prevent us creating a budgetary discipline body just for show.
These declarations of intent are more than anything motivated, I fear, by the determination to establish a European sovereignty on the pretext of protecting the Community budget, which, I must remind you, is made up of contributions from our Member States.
From the point of view of the effectiveness of the fight against fraud, these creations are no more than fresh grounds for sterile conflicts.
In conclusion, I feel that the Commission' s watchwords must be rigour, discipline and proper collaboration.
I sincerely believe that the rest can be achieved by adhering to OLAF' s prerogatives, combined with proper cooperation between national and European audit authorities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published a survey which showed that an overwhelming majority of my fellow countrymen were in favour of a more common approach to judicial matters.
No other area attracted nearly as much support for new initiatives at European level.
Other surveys in the past have always confirmed that this applies both to Germans and to the citizens in most other Member States of the Union.
We are therefore responding to the expectations of the people in tabling proposals on how to strengthen effectively the protection of the European Union against fraud.
There are without doubt more pleasant topics of conversation than fraud and corruption, I grant you, but discussing them demonstrates clearly that we are not sweeping this tricky question under the carpet; on the contrary, we are setting ourselves this challenge, in precisely those cases which affect the institutions of the Union itself.
This is why the BÃ¶sch report deserves particular attention and support.
It was not adopted unanimously by the Committee on Budgetary Control for nothing, as I have already explained.
Allow me to congratulate you on this report.
It clearly illustrates that creating the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF is an important step, but is only a step on the path towards the European prosecutor which I have called for time and again both in a personal capacity and as rapporteur.
A public prosecutor' s office to protect the interests of the Union against fraud would be the only really effective instrument to counteract the threat from organised crime.
Organised crime has identified the institutions of the European Union as a particularly easy target.
I am delighted that both the Commission and Parliament have included this question in the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has gone one step further in this report.
We want an even more proactive approach and are therefore waiting for the Commission to present proposals for the first stage of a European public prosecutor' s office on the basis of the current Article 280 and I really do hope, Commissioner Schreyer, that you will revise your unfortunately somewhat wait-and-see attitude and accommodate us here.
Mr President, allow me to refer to what was indeed said earlier but could not be answered.
My question is to Mr Dell'Alba; could the honourable Member explain what I, as chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, allegedly blocked for weeks.
I require an answer and I should like it recorded in the minutes.
Mrs Theato, you know perfectly well what I am talking about.
The matter was discussed at length in the Conference of Presidents.
In your capacity as chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, not in a personal capacity, you were assigned to assist the Conference of Presidents and the President, Mrs Fontaine, in drawing up the Parliament' s position on the code of conduct for relations with the Commission.
I contend, together with the group chairmen, who have, moreover, disclaimed you, that on the 13 April you informed the Conference of Presidents that on the whole you were in agreement with the spirit of Annex III on the exchange of information with the Commission.
I contend that twenty days later, to the outrage of your partner, Mr Napolitano, you sent a letter in which you said you could no longer agree to this annex.
You mentioned points in German which no one had checked, causing uproar among the group chairmen who thanked you, saying that they would take the dossier back because in effect the situation was no longer tenable.
One group chairman even left the room on an occasion when the matter came up on the agenda one day.
Do not pretend that you know nothing, you know perfectly well what happened.
There are perhaps some of my fellow Members of Parliament who do not know, but I am stating this for the benefit of the House, so that it can be entered in the Minutes: for several weeks Mrs Theato obstructed an agreement with the Commission, thereby putting the President of Parliament and the chairmen of the political groups in an awkward position.
That is the truth of the matter.
I do not wish to interfere in the debate but the issue of OLAF and Napolitano was of course a highly controversial one in the entire House and we are all aware of the problems associated with it.
That has now been cleared up.
Mr President, today we are debating a report which goes much further than the figures on alleged fraud or errors in the Community accounts. It demands that the Members of this Parliament act responsibly.
We must address the lack of moral responsibility on the part of bureaucracies, which was condemned in such a masterly way by Kafka.
This lack of moral responsibility is perversely able to involve people in a labyrinthine quest for their exact legal position and subject them to phantom judgements regarding unknown crimes. These situations have happily been overcome in Europe.
The creation of an effective and transparent office to fight fraud is a task with which all Members of this Parliament agree, and I hope that all the institutions agree.
The creation of an omnipotent mechanism, designed to pursue officials on the basis of secret denunciations, accusations and lists of suspects, riding roughshod over the individual guarantees, statutes and regulations which provide basic legal security for people working in the institutions, is a form of irresponsibility which this Parliament or any Community institution should have nothing to do with, because such a climate of suspicion would only benefit the eurosceptics.
The Socialist Group, which is interested in combating fraud as well as protecting the rights of citizens, including officials, and the construction of a Europe based on the principles of fair play, democracy, proximity to the citizens, transparency, efficiency and solidarity, has presented an amendment to paragraph 29 of this report, which lays down the principle that combating fraud should not take precedence over the basic rights of officials.
To demand lists of suspects, as suggested in the report, would be a form of McCarthyism which is beneath the dignity of this House and, furthermore, it may possibly be illegal.
I would like to remind you that claims have been made that no action has been taken against this type of action and that OLAF' s monitoring committee, in relation to these appeals, is aware that certain aspects are not functioning properly within this body.
While accepting that, with the dynamic of European construction, the increase in the budget and the growth of the administration, there may be more fraud and errors, we must not fall into a kind of policing paranoia, or at least this Parliament must not.
The immunity which we enjoy as MEPs must not be confused with impunity.
It is important that this report does not simply create a Kafkaesque type of system, but that it also provides a guarantee for officials.
Mr President, I have to depart a little bit from what I intended to say.
I have some sympathy with the last speaker: sometimes the Committee on Budgetary Control gets so involved with the important work they are doing, that they are unable to see the wood for the trees.
I also welcome the presentation on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which took a balanced approach to the major and indeed legitimate concerns of the Committee on Budgetary Control about fraud.
I heard Mr van Hulten's reference to the fact that OLAF should have the right to investigate Members of Parliament.
He has a point and a minority of people in this Parliament agree with that.
But before we embark on such a radical decision, we should look at the history, particularly in the United States, of the relationship between security authorities and public figures and recognise that we could overstep the mark by giving such powers to OLAF.
In the end, OLAF might have the political leverage and power to demand as much money and staff as it wanted.
We should not throw staff, money or powers at an organisation just because problems exist.
Those problems exist and we have dealt with the solution to the problem.
Mr BÃ¶sch has rightly dealt with the problem of identifying and prosecuting fraud when it occurs.
I do not agree with all of his report.
There are a number of paragraphs I have doubts about - 14, 15 and 16 for example, regarding the legal basis and whether it is necessary to involve both national and European responsibility to resolve problems of fraud that affect national states more than they do the European Union.
I have run out of time without saying what I wanted to say but I wanted to respond to some of the points already made.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a very good report. The very fact that my Italian colleague is opposed to it means that it really is a report of very high quality.
Even though there was a slight decline in fraud and irregularities between 1997 and 1998, there is nonetheless still a need for more effective supervisory mechanisms.
Reform of the Commission is now under way.
Mr Kinnock has submitted a timetable, and it is now up to us to applaud it. I am very impressed with the reform plan.
In general, it is both visionary and realistic.
There are nonetheless a number of sticking points, and these are what we ought to draw attention to and criticise.
Parliament has already proposed, in the Van Hulten report, that an external court should be established under the aegis of the Court of Auditors. This would deal with disciplinary matters and help recover money which has been paid out unlawfully.
This idea is one we should stick to, I think.
If such a body were to be established, this would mean that disciplinary matters would be taken away from the Commission.
We have had a lot of bad experience with internal disciplinary councils.
At present, officials who have had actions brought against them by the disciplinary council have colleagues of theirs sitting in judgement over them.
That is indefensible.
Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs.
I also agree with the rapporteur when he criticises setting up an advisory panel to deal with irregularities.
We have, of course, established OLAF to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities.
Another panel would serve only to undermine OLAF' s powers.
I cannot, however, vote in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor' s office.
I can well understand people' s being tired of all the fraud and therefore demanding that we have a common public prosecutor' s office. It would, however, be a colossal enterprise to set up when the problems are, in reality, elsewhere.
In actual fact, there is a need for a fundamental staffing reform.
It is, for all that, only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences.
Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.
Instead, there is a need for public, internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people.
We need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure, as also proposed in the report.
I would also point out that I had three minutes in which to speak.
I spoke for only two, but I am very disciplined.
I am happy to let someone else use my time.
You should also, of course, be allowed to make mistakes from time to time.
Mr Blak, allow me to apologise officially.
You are quite right, you had three minutes.
I was not wearing my glasses.
Do you wish to add anything else?
No?
Well that puts the friendship between Denmark and Bavaria back on terra firma.
Thank you Mr Blak for overlooking my error.
Mr President, this is just the sort of issue which gives rise to lofty declarations.
But I should like to go into a few points which, as far as I am concerned, are relatively unclear.
Problem number one: every year the media present the refusal to issue a declaration of assurance as an indication of the alleged or actual state of corruption in EU finances.
At the same time, however, both the Court of Auditors and the Council of Ministers grant this refusal to issue a declaration of assurance the status of a mere water-level report, while we here in Parliament and the media see it as an indication of the poor state of the Union' s finances.
I think we need to amend and clarify the basis of the matters about which we are talking.
Otherwise we shall find ourselves in a situation in which every year we regularly and hence permanently, as it were, negligently cast an air of general suspicion over the state of EU finances, if this state of affairs is allowed to continue.
Problem number two: of course further investigation may show that some financial irregularities are in fact cases of fraud.
Nonetheless, these two points need to be kept apart both in terms of how they are defined and how they are measured, because otherwise they will both be lumped together and this will give the impression of a huge level of fraud which is not justified to that extent.
Problem number three: clearly - and I am grateful to Mr BÃ¶sch for pointing this out - the findings of the Court of Auditors differ from those of the Commission as to the extent of financial irregularity which has occurred in relations between the agricultural budget and the Structural Funds.
Clearly there are measuring problems, statistical problems which we must solve so that we know what we are talking about when we start investigations or conduct further investigations.
Mr President, I also congratulate Mr BÃ¶sch on his report.
He is the acknowledged expert within the European Parliament and, to a large extent, was the architect of the new OLAF.
One thing that is certain to create a stir in terms of the EU is big stories about fraud.
They always get big coverage.
That is quite right too because any fraud is unacceptable.
The figure that is being attached to it is about 5% of the EU budget.
But there are two important points to remember, which have been touched upon several times here today - and Mr Cunha has just raised them again.
The Court of Auditors does not distinguish between fraud and administrative and financial irregularities; that is, administrative mistakes and people who set out to cheat the EU of money.
To give you an example, a farmer may fill out a form incorrectly.
That is not to say that he means to defraud.
It may be that he measured his land incorrectly.
And then there are the big fraudsters: the people who, for example, import cigarettes illegally, avoiding tax.
There is a huge difference between these two things.
We need to have them distinguished much more clearly.
Let us not forget that 80% of the fraud takes place within Member States.
Yesterday the Commission made a commitment to us that they want to cut irregularities by 2%.
We want to know whether the Member States will follow that lead.
It is clear that a lot of the problems lie there, in particular with the Structural Funds.
To take up Mr Dell'Alba's point, the Socialists will be voting against a number of paragraphs in this report, not necessarily because we do not agree with them, but because it is not the right context in which to discuss these points which relate to the White Paper.
Finally, I want to read out a list of shame - Member States which have not yet ratified the Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the EU: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland and France.
It is about time they signed up.
They have had five years to do it.
Let us see them ratify it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against fraud and protecting the financial interests of the Community are among the top priorities of the new Commission.
The fight against fraud includes activities such as preventing, uncovering and prosecuting customs and subsidy fraud or tax evasion, as well, of course, as uncovering and prosecuting irregularities within the institutions of the European Union.
But I am most pleased that numerous contributions to the debate have stated that we need to make a distinction between financial irregularity and fraud.
When we talk of the Court of Auditors' report, this covers the whole spectrum of financial irregularities.
We are talking here of the UCLAF or OLAF report on fraud, i.e. deliberate damage to the financial interests of the European Union.
The report before you, which is the subject of Mr BÃ¶sch' s report, is the last report drawn up by UCLAF on the fight against fraud in 1998.
Although UCLAF only had 120 employees at the time, this annual report illustrates the considerable success of their work, in my view.
There were 5,318 cases of suspicion of irregularity or fraud investigated by UCLAF in 1998, in cooperation with the Member States, and around 20% of these cases were classed as fraud following the investigation.
I should also point out in connection with the question as to why the findings in the Court of Auditors' report are different, that it has been ascertained that the number of irregularities is falling in the area of agricultural policy, while it is clearly highlighted here that regulations as to which cases of fraud or suspicion must be reported to the Commission differ from one Member State to another, and this explains the difference between the two reports.
Mr Blak stated in his speech that the citizens of the European Union are sick and tired of fraud.
Unfortunately, I must point out that duty- or tax-free cigarettes still sell like hot cakes and tax evasion is often regarded as a national pastime.
In this respect, we face a situation in which we must acknowledge that we cannot completely eradicate fraud which damages the European Union's financial interests.
We must of course do everything within our power to fight customs offences and offences in connection with subsidies and taxation which damage the Community' s financial interests.
I should like briefly to go into the individual proposals in the BÃ¶sch report which now come within a wider context; this applies, for example, to the proposal on disciplinary procedures or the chamber at the European Court of Auditors.
The Commission explained in its statements on Parliament' s demands in connection with the 1998 discharge procedure that it did not think that the right way forward was to call in a chamber of the Court of Auditors or the Court of Justice to issue orders in disciplinary proceedings against employees on the grounds of irregularities in connection with the budget, because the European Treaties had granted each of these bodies its own specific remit.
It is precisely the European Court of Justice to which employees can take recourse if they wish to appeal against a judgement in disciplinary proceedings.
As a result, such a move cannot be reconciled with the present Treaties.
The Commission therefore decided to take up the proposals contained in last year' s independent experts' report, which are extremely comprehensive and relate to overall financial management, fraud prevention and disciplinary procedures.
The Commission explained that it also shared Parliament' s view that confidence in the objectivity of disciplinary proceedings would be enhanced by involving an outside agency.
It explained this in its White Paper tabled on 1 March and will also make detailed proposals on reforming disciplinary law in the paper on the overall future disciplinary procedure to be published by the Commission in October.
Naturally we shall include Parliament' s considerations in the overall procedure and in our proposals during discussions.
It was rightly pointed out in numerous debates and in the report that good cooperation and the involvement of the Member States are essential if the fight against fraud to the detriment of the financial interests of the European Community is to be efficient.
Article 280 of the Amsterdam Treaty also makes this clear.
The complaint was also rightly voiced that the corresponding agreement between the Member States has only been ratified by a few Member States.
I should like to thank all the speakers who wrote home calling for the necessary steps to be taken at long last.
OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, is itself working intensively with the Member States and, in certain areas, with other countries, in order to conclude cooperation agreements.
Since the UCLAF report was filed, the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF has succeeded, for example, in concluding an agreement with the Anti-Mafia in Italy, the aim being to achieve good cooperation at all levels and with all organisations dedicated to fighting fraud.
A conference on this subject is to be held in Ancona at the end of the week.
The Commission welcomes the fact that some enlargement countries are already taking steps to set up and activate structures similar to those set up by the European Anti-Fraud Office.
In Poland, for example, it has been decided to set up a Polish OLAF.
I should like briefly to go into the subject of "What happens next in the legislative area?" and point out that the Commission has proposed for the Intergovernmental Conference, which is responsible for revising the Treaties, that the present system for protecting the financial interests be supplemented by a legal basis creating a European Public Prosecutor and allowing provisions on the criminal prosecution of cross-border fraud to be adopted.
The Member States have indicated that they will not amend the Treaty in this area.
However, the Commission does not intend to give up on this and we are continuing to refine this proposal and will ensure that it is on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.
I should like to comment briefly on the complaints filed by the Commission against the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank.
The aim is to implement precisely what was introduced into the OLAF regulation by the European Parliament, namely that OLAF is responsible for fighting fraud in all the institutions of the European Community.
Unfortunately, neither bank has made a move over recent weeks.
They too have probably been waiting for the outcome of the litigation pending as the result of the proceedings instituted by a number of members against the amendment of the European Parliament' s Rules of Procedure.
I think that the summary procedures of the Court of First Instance have in fact made it clear that what is at issue is not the legal bases for OLAF - in this respect neither bank can withdraw or hide behind this - the issue is, of course, the need to safeguard the independence of the institutions.
Not that this was ever disputed for the European Central Bank.
Of course, the other issue is that it needs to be made clear that the immunity of members is a democratic achievement and cannot be interfered with under any circumstances.
I should like to thank you for calling for account to be taken of the principles of the rule of law in all procedures, including the work of OLAF.
I think that the new director of OLAF defends this view very vigorously, including in a personal capacity.
We shall have the opportunity of debating other reports on the subject of fighting fraud this year.
The OLAF Supervisory Committee, which monitors the independence of OLAF, will soon submit its report, which we shall also have the opportunity to debate.
I should point out that the Commission is currently working on a fundamental strategy paper on the fight against fraud.
This too will certainly lead to further intensive and fruitful debate.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶sch, for his report and, above all, I should also like to thank the House for supporting the introduction and the work of OLAF so unwaveringly.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 p.m.)
Vote
Madam President, the following problem has arisen in connection with the report by Mrs Schierhuber now being put to the vote: the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European United Left filed a motion for a split vote on a number of points.
However, for some technical reason, the services did not receive it.
Now we have the following problem: either you now allow an oral motion for a split vote on the article in question during the voting procedure and we vote today or, if that is not possible, then I move that we postpone the vote until tomorrow.
The services have, however, said that we have a tightly-packed voting programme tomorrow, so that it would perhaps make sense to vote today.
We would be happy to vote.
The vote is not the problem, the problem is that you did not receive the motion for a split vote in time.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, indeed, I checked the situation: it was only this morning that we received the request for split voting, which was therefore not within the time limits set by our own rules.
In Parliament we have certain rules that are applicable to everyone.
They must be observed, and I cannot make any exceptions.
I must be frank and tell you that, even though I appreciate the problem.
We shall then proceed to the vote, unless you are going to propose postponing the vote, which is a proposal I would, of course, put to the vote.
Madam President, in that case - I understand your position - I should like to move that we postpone the vote until tomorrow or Thursday.
I would like to hear the opinion of our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber.
Madam President, I am sorry that the Socialists' voting list was not received by the services in time.
I should like to state unequivocally that I personally, as rapporteur, have no problem in accepting this split vote, even during today' s vote, and it would be good if we could vote today because, as you know, the Council of Agricultural Ministers is meeting today and tomorrow and it would be good if the agricultural ministers knew what we had decided here.
Unfortunately, if we vote tomorrow, it will be too late.
Mrs Schierhuber, let us be clear on this.
Personally speaking I would not have any objection to split voting either, but, once again, there are rules, and I cannot make exceptions.
This would establish a perfectly dreadful precedent and then there would no longer be any rules to govern the tabling of split voting requests.
You have just expressed your view to the effect that you prefer to have the vote today.
I shall give Mr Goepel the floor and then we shall proceed to vote on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s proposal to postpone the vote until tomorrow morning or Thursday morning.
Madam President, I should like to explain on behalf of my group that we too have nothing against this oral amendment and I should like to support Mrs Schierhuber again here. The Council of Agricultural Ministers is waiting for our decision and a postponement would not be a good idea.
(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)
Following the vote on legislative proposal No 1 and adoption of the Commission proposal as amended
Madam President, I should like to ask the Commission if it has changed its opinion in the last twelve hours on the proposed amendments adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture.
Mrs Schreyer, can you give our rapporteur an answer in the affirmative?
Mrs Schierhuber, the Commission has not changed its opinion.
The Commission presented this proposal as the outcome of experience in past years.
We discussed a report on the fight against fraud on a previous occasion and that has a direct bearing on this.
I can only repeat that, if the question of the division of land is again discussed in the Council - and this was an important issue in the Committee on Agriculture - then the Commission is of course open to suggestions.
However, as the Commissioner for the budget, I am bound to say that a solution must be found which does not affect the budget.
Madam President, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are also very keen to put a stop to fraud in all areas in the Union.
We still do not have any right of codetermination in agriculture, which is why our only option is to refer this report back to committee and I urge the House to vote in favour of my motion.

Our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, proposes referral to committee.
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of referral to committee?
Madam President, I should like to speak for the motion.
The groups have agreed that this is the only way of exerting any influence.
To put it plainly, including to Commissioner Schreyer: I think that the Commission and Parliament are at one on the question of the fight against fraud; the question here is what methods will be chosen.
If the method now being chosen takes hold, it will kill off flax and hemp cultivation, which are an ecological form ideally suited to disadvantaged areas.
We must prevent this and Parliament and the Commission must join in the discussion to find a compromise.
(Parliament decided to refer the first part of the report to committee) - Following the vote on legislative proposal No 2 and adoption of the Commission proposal as amended
Madam President, exactly the same applies to this second decision as what you said for the first decision.
Two proposed amendments in this second file are of fundamental importance to the Committee on Agriculture, namely Amendments Nos 28 and 29.
I therefore again ask the Commission if it has perhaps revised its opinion here.
Madam President, my colleague Mr Fischler made a statement on this yesterday.
The Commission has not changed its position.
Madam President, in that case may I again ask the House to vote to refer the report back to committee.
(Parliament decided to refer the second part of the report to committee)
Report (A5-0116/2000) by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the 1998 annual report by the European Commission on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud (COM(1999) 590 - C5-0058/2000 - 2000/2032(COS))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES
Rothley report (A5-0130/2000)
Madam President, I voted for this European Parliament directive regulating insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles which may injure citizens who come from States other than the State in which they are insured, but I would have liked the report to have been more audacious.
Many pensioners, with whom I often discuss matters in Italy, say to me "Mr Fatuzzo, I have had a serious car accident.
I was the victim of a road accident.
The insurance company asked me my age, and when I replied that I was 80 years old, they said 'You are worthless, you count for nothing, and so we are not going to give you any compensation.' "
Now, it does not seem right to me for a person who is 70 or 80 years old to be considered worthless, and I therefore call for care to be taken that morally acceptable payments are made when the victims of road accidents are elderly.
- The proposal for this directive deals with situations in which a traffic accident occurs in the country of residence of the person causing the accident or in a third country.
The objective of this directive is to ensure that the injured party has a right of action against the insurer of the person who caused the accident.
We must remember that we live in the European Union where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is in operation.
This directive which streamlines the issue of civil liability in respect of accidents involving motor vehicles is a logical extension to directives which have been put in place over the last 13 years to complete the European Single Market.
It is only right and proper where there is a system of wholesale freedom of movement of persons and cross-border traffic that a streamlined and structured procedure is in operation so that recourse is available to injured parties in the case of accidents.
To that end every insurance undertaking operating within the European Union must now appoint a representative within each Member State to be responsible for settling claims on its behalf if an accident occurs involving an EU national.
This proposal would also involve information centres being set up so as to enable victims to identify appropriate claim representatives.
A compromise has been reached between the institutions at a recent Conciliation Committee meeting which was held last March.
The most complex problem concerns the directive's territorial application.
This matter is now resolved.
The directive will apply to accidents involving nationals of a Member State of the Union on Union territory or in any third country operating the Green Card system.
The Conciliation Committee has also agreed to enable Member States to retain and implement more favourable arrangements in respect of the victim than the provisions required so as to ensure compliance with this directive.
I fully support this proposal and would like to commend Mr Rothley for his work in bringing these proposals to this stage.
The European Union, as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam, has greater powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer rights.
This legislation governing the issue of civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and accidents in Europe will ensure that the rights of the 370 million consumers in Europe will be enhanced in the case of accidents taking place within any of the territories of the European Union.
- I welcome my Socialist colleague, Willi Rothley's recommendation on protecting motorists abroad.
We are sadly all too familiar with the high figures of road accidents across Europe.
As many as 500 000 drivers in the European Union are victims of road accidents abroad every year.
This is 500 000 too many.
We must put safety first and ensure that as much as possible is done to protect our citizens whilst travelling abroad.
The proposal extends current EU directives on the handling of motor insurance claims to cover cases where a person visiting another Member State is the victim of an accident caused by a resident of that country.
Every insurance company will, therefore, need to appoint a representative in each Member State.
The European Parliament has gone even further, calling for cover for accidents which take place in non-EU countries, provided that the vehicles involved are registered in the EU.
Under the compromise, the directive will apply to such accidents in a certain number of countries outside the European Union.
Thousands of British holidaymakers travel by car or hire cars every year in France, Spain, Portugal and many other countries in Europe.
Surely we owe all of our citizens the right to ensure that things are made as easy as possible for those involved in car accidents abroad and for their families.
This is not about high-and-mighty insurance companies hindering claims, it is about the European Parliament driving forward a lifeline for our citizens.
For my own constituents and for all of Europe's citizens, I give the green light to this proposal.
MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez report (A5-0114/2000)
Madam President, I also voted for the measure tabled by Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez confirming aid for development cooperation with South Africa, but, also in this case, with some reserves.
Why do we not make one of our inspectors responsible, one of our Commissioners, whenever - every year - we give financial aid to South Africa?
Why do we not monitor, firstly, the use to which this financial aid is put, and, secondly, the human rights situation in South Africa?
The situation is not, of course, as bad as it was - there have been improvements - but even I have received news of all sorts of appalling acts of delinquency perpetrated in South Africa as well as elsewhere.
We should take this into account whenever we provide aid to any third countries, including South Africa.
Madam President, the situation in South Africa is difficult - and it is by no means an easy country to run.
Yet South Africa presents itself as a beacon of hope in an otherwise turbulent continent.
We should therefore be doing everything possible to assist the economic, social and democratic development of that country.
That is why I regret that the Council proposes only EUR 787.5 million for South Africa, which is effectively a 10% cut on the amounts we agreed five years ago.
Parliament, in its Amendment No 2, proposes that we give EUR 885.5 million to South Africa, EUR 98 million more than the Council.
EUR 98 million is not an insignificant sum of money in South African terms.
In terms of the European budget it is not something we would struggle to find.
I would urge that we be generous to South Africa, that the Council finds this EUR 98 million, does not go to conciliation but accepts Parliament's amendments and gets on with implementing this new regulation with South Africa.
Thank you, Mr Martin.
In future, I shall ensure that the Commission remains in attendance during explanations of votes. They may then hear some interesting information.
The most scandalous aspect of what they are daring to call an agreement on "development cooperation with South Africa" is that this cooperation is subject to the trade agreement with South Africa and that the Council is using it as a means of blackmail in order to foist its own terms on Pretoria.
Such cynicism borders on candour: the European Union grants aid to South Africa on condition that it is able thereby to make a commercial profit.
Although Parliament' s proposals are, financially, better than those of the Council, we have not voted in favour of the amendments, as we do not wish to sanction this farce.
The only reason why we are not voting against the amendments, however, is to affirm our conviction that cooperation between Europe and the whole of Africa is essential.
While, however, it is designed and implemented to profit merchants, bankers and industrialists, it is of benefit only to them and, incidentally, to a select class of privileged Africans.
In these circumstances, "combating poverty" and "achieving development objectives" as mentioned by the Council is nothing but gross untruth that could not be counteracted by any vote here.
Thank you, Mrs Cauquil.
I am given to understand that Mrs Laguiller and Mrs Bordes are also involved in the explanation of vote that you have just given.
Jeggle report (A5-0115/2000)
Madam President, I voted for the measure tabled by Mr Jeggle on the Commission proposals on the prices for agricultural products.
This measure deals, once again, with the European Union' s common agricultural policy.
I welcome our action to support farmers, but I feel that we need to change direction, in some cases completely and in others only in part.
For example, this measure does not contain any initiatives to support the small-scale, family-based elderly mountain farmers who operate, particularly, in the furthermost parts of Europe.
This land is increasingly being abandoned and the European Union' s vast expenditure does not go far enough towards meeting the needs of the farmers.
In future, we must pay more attention to the needs of elderly family-based farmers.
My vote is intended to support the rapporteur' s efforts but prevent the proposed reduction in the monthly increments for cereals.
The European Council stated clearly in its resolutions following the Berlin summit that the monthly increments should be maintained at the current 1 euro per tonne and frozen at this level for the entire period, i.e. from 2000 to 2006.
The planned reduction in the monthly increments would therefore clearly be breaking our promise to the farmers.
Given the worrying economic situation of the rural population, further erosion of their income is unjustifiable.
The income of people working in farming has fallen by a total of nearly 10% in real terms since 1996.
A reduction in the monthly increments would further exacerbate the economic situation of farmers.
- (SV) A transformation of agricultural policy is a prerequisite for enlargement of the European Union.
We Swedish Social Democrats (Pierre Schori, Anneli HulthÃ©n, Jan Andersson, Maj Britt Theorin, GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm and Eva Hedkvist-Petersen) therefore believe that the EU' s agricultural subsidies should be considerably reduced and we welcome the Commission' s proposal for a progressive reduction in the monthly increases in the intervention price of cereal.
Because the report opposes a reduction in the intervention price of cereal, we are voting against the Committee' s proposal.

With regard to the proposal for a Council regulation fixing certain sugar prices and the standard quality of beet for the 2000/01 marketing year, we would make the following point. The reconstruction of Kosovo is an important issue for the EU and something we wholeheartedly support.
The extra resources required for Kosovo should be obtained from general reductions in subsidies for the whole of the common agricultural policy and not only through reductions within the sugar sector.
- (DA) Agricultural aid is a heavy burden for the European Union.
It is indispensable to undertake a radical review of this aid, especially when enlargement to include the Eastern European countries is to become a reality.
I am very pleased that the first step to be taken towards such a review entails a long-term plan for a certain reduction in agricultural aid.
It is problematic, however, that there is not the courage to engage in a full and candid discussion of how our agricultural sector is, in the longer term, to cope under quite different conditions and with a quite different aid scheme than that which is in place at present.
We are forced to reduce aid to the absolute minimum, and we should have the discussion now.
On the other hand, the reduction in agricultural aid should be gradual and carried out at such a pace that there is no risk of EU aid being replaced by national schemes designed to compensate for its disappearance.
It would also be problematic if the Commission were to withdraw aid from agriculture with a view to using the resources for another purpose.
Aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons.
Schierhuber report (A5-0124/2000)
Madam President, I voted against this measure on the European policy on flax and hemp.
This is because I feel that we should change the way we support and provide aid to agricultural products in the European Union.
We should start to let go of the policy of giving a sum of money to the producers of a particular agricultural product which we want to support, and endeavour, instead, to reduce the burdens of production costs, burdens which are mainly the result of national State policies and which push up the cost of labour, tying the hands of those who wish to work, produce and increase the number of jobs in their sector.
Basically, we must start to change the way we provide aid to agriculture in Europe.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs Schierhuber' s report.
I consider proposed Amendments Nos 28 and 29 to be particularly important.
She rightly points out that any limitation on maximum quantities must correlate with actual processing capacities.
Introducing national maximum quantities as proposed by the Commission would create a system which fails to take account of national processing capacities.
The 50 tonne per annum limitation would exclude many Member States from cultivation in advance.
The aim must be to develop a flexible system which also takes account of regional sales potential, thereby allowing all Member States to cultivate on an equal footing.
.
(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats (Pierre Schori, Anneli HulthÃ©n, Jan Andersson, Maj Britt Theorin, GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm and Ewa Hedkvist Petersen) believe that the EU' s agricultural aid ought to be considerably reduced and we are therefore also opposed to aid for hemp production.
Furthermore, the mechanisms for supervising the cultivation of hemp are problematic because it is not possible, with the naked eye, to distinguish hemp grown for fibre from hemp grown for the production of drugs.
It is, therefore, difficult to guarantee that there is no cultivation of hemp for the purpose of manufacturing drugs.
We therefore believe that hemp production ought not to be promoted through increased aid, and we are abstaining from voting on Mrs Schierhuber' s report.
.
(SV) Regarding the proposal for a Council regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to include flax and hemp grown for fibre, we would state the following. As liberals, we believe that agricultural policy should be adjusted to the market and de-bureaucratised.
If Parliament is serious about eastward enlargement, there must be a drive extensively to cut back on the costs of agriculture.
All direct forms of support for agricultural production ought gradually to be abolished.
BÃ¶sch report (A5-0116/2000)
Mr President, I have taken the floor for the last time to declare, once again, that it was with no reservations that I voted against the BÃ¶sch report on the 1998 report on the fight against fraud.
This is not because I do not approve of fighting all types of fraud - of course I do!
Naturally I support this fight. However, I feel that in order to genuinely fight fraud in the European Union we need to change Europe' s expenditure system.
The same report states that these EUR 1 019 million which have disappeared as a result of fraud are only the tip of the iceberg.
Now, we know that 10% of an iceberg is visible but the other 90% is underwater and therefore hidden. Therefore, the European Union is being defrauded of something in the region of EUR 10 000 million.
It is absolutely essential that we change the way we spend our money.
Madam President, you have just congratulated the rapporteur on his work.
I do not see what reason there is to congratulate him as many of his original paragraphs have been dropped, particularly because of his own Group which, in its wisdom, decided to table a great many amendments to delete sections, and these were adopted.
These particularly concerned all the sections to do with the White Paper.
Consequently, many amendments which went beyond the report and the content of the report that Mr BÃ¶sch was supposed to be drawing up have been dropped.
I therefore ask the following question: why did we waste money making Mr BÃ¶sch draw up texts that have nothing to do with his work and which Parliament has, quite rightly, rejected.
You can discuss the matter with Mrs Stauner, who is very interested in other people' s reports, and whom you should really meet, and ask her if she is not interested in knowing why the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control are undertaking work which has nothing to do with their assigned tasks.
All honour and tribute, then, to the wisdom of this Parliament for restoring order.
- (DA) We have voted today in favour of Mr BÃ¶sch' s report on the more effective combating of fraud and irregularities involving EU resources.
Even though there was a slight decline in fraud and irregularities between 1997 and 1998, there is still a great need for more effective supervisory mechanisms.
Mr Kinnock' s reform plan is, on the whole, both visionary and realistic. There are, however, a few sticking points.
Parliament has already proposed, in the Van Hulten report, that an external court should be established under the aegis of the Court of Auditors, part of whose task would be to deal with disciplinary matters and which would help recover money which had been paid out wrongly.
If such a body were to be established, this would mean that disciplinary procedures would be taken away from the Commission.
We have had a lot of bad experiences with the internal disciplinary council.
At present, officials who have had actions brought against them by the disciplinary council have colleagues of theirs sitting in judgement over them.
That is indefensible.
Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs.
We ought likewise to criticise the proposal in the white paper to the effect that an advisory panel should be set up to deal with irregularities.
We have established OLAF to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities.
Another panel would serve only to undermine OLAF' s powers.
We have voted against establishing a European public prosecutor' s office. It would be a colossal enterprise to set up when the problem, in reality, lies elsewhere.
In actual fact, there is more need for a fundamental staffing reform.
It is, for all that, only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences.
Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.
Instead, there is a need for public, internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people.
We need changes to staff regulations and to the disciplinary procedure, as also proposed in the report.
- The British Conservatives abstained on the BÃ¶sch report overall because we are unhappy with the concept of a European Public Prosecutor, believing that this could well lead to corpus juris.
We were also unhappy with the references to VAT made within the report.
- (FR) I abstained from the vote on the resolution on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud.
I did not wish to vote against the resolution since I fully share the rapporteur' s objectives of intensifying the combating of fraud against the financial interests of the Community.
I did not vote, however, because of the establishment of a new control body.
The Community is not going to achieve the desired goal by creating a tangled multiplicity of such bodies.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
The next item is the report (A5-0117/2000) by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down rules for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0025/1999 - 1998/0323(COD)).
Mr President, our discussion today on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, transmissible diseases which include BSE or scrapie, is one of the many follow-up reports or one of the follow-up discussions to the final BSE report and I think that it is also of great interest to the visitors in the gallery.
We have a report here before us which the Commission promised together with its final report on the 1997 BSE report at Parliament' s request.
It has now presented it.
We have drafted a report on it, although not as quickly as we would otherwise have done, due to the break last year.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr BÃ¶ge have drafted opinions on it.
In other words, we have been able to keep the BSE team going well.
I should like to tell you briefly how I, as rapporteur for the committee responsible, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, assess the proposal.
The Commission' s proposal is a good one; like so much of what the Commission has presented on BSE and follow-up problems and has satisfied us in previous years, we are also satisfied with this proposal but, like most things, it still has room for improvement, Mr Byrne.
I said that your proposal on BSE testing had room for improvement and I say so again here today. The involvement of the European Parliament certainly needs to be improved.
We must ensure that the European Parliament can act in the codecision procedure as the real guarantor of consumer and health protection in the European Union.
Only then will we have a high standard and only then will you be able to work in proper collaboration with us, because the Council of Ministers, the individual Agricultural Ministers have not exactly been at the vanguard of the movement over recent years, as we here in the House are only too aware.
It is also important, and here too another proposal needs improvement, for us to hold further discussions on the rapid BSE tests.
You tabled a proposal after this TSE proposal which you then needed to adjust, but the proposal is still inadequate.
If we are to be able to make a real appraisal of the BSE situation in the Member States, we must make it clear that fallen stock are also to be tested for human health safety in a screening process.
So far you have presented no proposal on this.
What we also need, and we have tried to achieve this in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is to strengthen the Member States' obligation to inform the Commission and to give the Commission information and data on incidents in their countries, on BSE problems or on suspicious circumstances.
Here too we need to take the Member States to task more.
Here, too, I repeat: mistrust is always shown of the Member States, including my own, and rightly so.
Mr BÃ¶ge rightly pointed out - as I am sure he will again in his presentation - that we need a Community definition of geographical areas.
The definition here is clearly inadequate and the Commission must explain - and I call on you to do so Mr Byrne - how it intends to deal with derogations for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other medicinal products.
I am convinced of the need for the Commission to make proposals in order to close any loopholes in current legislation.
Allow me to make a few comments on the proposed amendments and then, thanks to the speaking time for my group, I shall still have time for a comment at the end of the debate.
I agree with nearly all the proposed amendments, but there are some and here I would ask how you evaluate them, Mr Byrne.
This applies in particular to proposed Amendment No 50, which includes cat food in the proposal tabled by Mr BÃ¶ge, who I know takes a very careful approach to everything.
But you have said that you have a problem with cat food.
Please say something about the risk of infection from cats.
Mrs Attwooll and others have proposed a number of amendments, specifically Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 55.
These proposed amendments limit the present proposal and do not represent any improvement, not even for the situation in the United Kingdom, which I would have understood.
For example, no distinction is made between breeding and fattening; that is a completely inadequate proposal.
I sympathise with the suggestion in the second part of proposed Amendment No 56 that certain materials should be removed if a Member State has a specific and efficient system, but I must also say unequivocally that, at the present stage of the discussion on special risk materials, it is a dangerous signal to Member States such as my own, which are very reticent.
Allow me to repeat quite clearly: the repercussions on the Member States have obviously been overestimated by some members in the House.
In countries which have a good, operational system and a high level of protection, this regulation will not cause any deterioration.
But in countries which do not, it would at long last force them to buckle down and give priority to safety and health protection.
That is why I fail to understand much of the mistrust of many members, but perhaps we can clear that up in the debate.
Mr President, I shall have another three minutes at the end of the debate, which I shall use to comment on some of the interventions by the honourable Members.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also welcomes in principle the Commission proposal, which is in line with the promise made by the Commission to Parliament.
I should also like expressly to praise the excellent collaboration between the committees and the rapporteurs.
We pointed out on a previous occasion that it is strange that there are still no common provisions for fighting scrapie, despite the fact that scrapie and BSE have somehow been linked since the beginning.
We think it is important to seek a differentiated approach to preventive consumer protection by achieving an understanding of the facts and without panicking.
In addition to what the rapporteur has said, we felt it was important that the Commission had incorporated the principle of regionalising the fight against TSE in order to reconcile strict measures and a sense of proportion.
I should also like to point out that we feel it is important, in the case of the livestock affected, to have a proper discussion on how data on age can be adapted for the purpose of measures to fight TSE.
I would also add that, when we talk of the possibility of introducing tests, for example in the event of dispute between the Commission and Member States or in the event of dispute between the Commission and third countries, carrying out tests can also help to decide if a country belongs in risk category I, II or III if, for example, certain statistics cannot be organised differently.
However, I will not conceal the fact, Commissioner, that the problem of third countries in general will continue to remain an issue for us, as will the question of including pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
We also expect the Commission to quickly submit legal provisions on animal waste, on meat meal, so that we can define safety keys, thereby ensuring that there is a future for a responsible recycling system and guaranteeing preventive consumer protection.
One issue will continue to remain on the agenda and that is the difference between some Member States and the majority of Member States in their approach to the question of what is more important: to define risk materials or to remove entire stocks from the food chain in the event of one case of BSE.
Even scientists have so far avoided committing themselves on this point.
Mr President, if the BSE crisis taught us anything, it is that health takes top priority over all other policies.
This is essentially the basis on which this proposal for a regulation has been drawn up and we really must use this opportunity to make a concerted effort to prevent, control and eradicate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
We have been well aware of this problem for many years now. Unfortunately, however, we have still not managed to eradicate the disease, nor have we managed to identify all the causes for it, hence all the concerns, restrictions and irregularities in the production and marketing of products of animal origin.
It is therefore essential that action be taken throughout the Community so that firstly: we can effectively guarantee public health protection and, secondly, we can restore consumer confidence which, in turn, will help the internal market to develop and operate properly.
One of the important measures recommended in the regulation is the establishment of rapid diagnosis tests, because rapid detection is one of the keys to combating this disease.
Consequently, these tests, which produce results within a relatively short period of time, will most certainly help us to take immediate and appropriate action.
Three tests have already been proposed, although we predict that we shall see future improvements in this area, together with rapid diagnosis tests on live animals, so that we can monitor better how the whole epidemiological picture of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is developing in the European Union.
A second key measure is to establish an ongoing epidemiological study based partly on laboratory tests using an established protocol.
The introduction of uniform procedures and truly comparable results from analyses by national and Community reference laboratories will help us to monitor the situation closely and to create reliable scientific data and methods of diagnosis which include rapid diagnostic tests.
It would be a good idea if, at the same time, we monitored scientific progress on the new variant disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which, as we all know, attacks humans and is caused by food from animals contaminated with BSE.
Finally, the slightest suspicion of any form of spongiform encephalopathy in any animal must be notified to the competent authorities so that we can take appropriate action.
I should like to stress at this point, that in my view, we will in fact only eradicate the disease effectively if we destroy the whole herd, regardless of how much this would cost both in economic and sentimental terms.
That is why the compensation paid by the Commission to beneficiaries must be quite substantial.
Of course, it is hard when just one animal out of a whole herd is sick, as it is very difficult to discern if there are animals which appear healthy but which may fall ill later on. That is precisely why we are proposing this measure.
"Prevention is better than cure" , as Hippocrates said all those years ago, thereby paving the way for preventive medicine. This is particularly true today, given that there is no cure either for BSE or for the equivalent human disease, the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
In closing, I should like to commend and thank both Mr BÃ¶ge, the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment. Thanks to their cooperation and with the help of all their other colleagues, I feel this is truly a much better regulation, and is a vast improvement on what the Commission originally presented to Parliament.
Mr President, I also wish to endorse and praise the work of Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr BÃ¶ge on this issue and the initial proposals from the Commission.
Safety must be a priority and we all understand that if we are to have equal precautions throughout the Member States, we need a variety of measures in place which have not so far been instituted.
Commissioner Byrne is to be congratulated on moving that closer.
These proposals take us a good deal further down the line in the field of diagnostic testing, in a more sceptical attitude to animals which ought to have been under suspicion but in some Member States were not, and in terms of the general prospect of fallen stock being tested for the possibility of BSE.
I want to say something, however, coming from the Member State which first suffered the full rigours of BSE and which has also, as a result of that, been in the vanguard of cleaning up this problem.
We have now had for a considerable period of time in the United Kingdom an over-30-month cull of all animals which have been taken out of the food chain.
We have been able to tackle the problem of the possibility of maternal transmission by also taking out those animals that might be at risk because of their ancestry.
From our position, given the measures we take, we do not see any reason at all why we would need to introduce, additionally, whole-herd slaughter of the kind done in some other countries.
We are being asked not just for a belt-and-braces policy but also to buy a new pair of trousers just in case.
This would cost a great deal of money.
It would not remove a single additional suspect case of BSE.
I would remind those present that, with our additional safety measures, we in the UK are only exporting to the Community de-boned carcasses which have gone through maximum checks and security.
In the circumstances, therefore, there are a number of amendments tabled by a variety of Members in the United Kingdom which I would commend in this debate.
I should be very glad to hear whether the Commissioner feels he can accept that in some circumstances - particularly in view of the over-30-month cull in the United Kingdom - for those countries which are admittedly very high risk but also with a very high level of precaution now in place a certain number of derogations are necessary and would be satisfactory to him.
I sincerely hope so.
Mr President, I would first of all address the Commissioner and say that I naturally welcome the present proposal.
Secondly, I want to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on a very good piece of work.
I also want to thank Mr BÃ¶ge.
I wish to support in principle all the amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
Nowadays, we know a very great deal indeed about the living world.
Life is not, however, complete, as it were, but is evolving all the time.
It is evolving not only in a positive way, but also in a negative way.
As time goes on, we are faced with new viruses and new problems.
The BSE crisis is an example of such a phenomenon.
There are, however, also many more examples.
There are therefore two things which must be done.
The first is the matter with which we are occupied at present, namely trying to ensure that we get the better both of BSE and of TSE, which is, of course, a broader concept.
We must make sure that the situation does not occur again.
However, we must also find ways of overcoming similar tragedies in the future.
Such tragedies will clearly not occur in precisely this area but will crop up elsewhere.
This illustrates what the present debate teaches us: that we must have comprehensive regulations for the whole of the common market constituted by the EU.
We must have the same rules, monitored in the same way.
Everyone must be treated the same.
Understandable differences in attitudes have emerged in the course of the debates which we have conducted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the party groups and which are also being conducted here and now in this Chamber.
I am thinking of the last intervention.
The United Kingdom has been affected badly.
I can well understand why people there have points of view as to how it might perhaps be possible to make savings.
Allow me, however, to say something which is extremely important. We must never suffer for having looked to short-term economic gains at the risk of long-term security.
There is a danger of the short-term economy' s taking over at the expense of reason and caution.
To my party colleague, Mrs Attwooll, I have to say that I understand the current amendments very well but that I cannot support them.
That would mean our becoming unclear and sending out false signals.
I believe it is extremely important that when, in this context, we decide about this report, we send out a crystal clear signal about the firmness of our judgement on the issue of food safety.
This is important prior to the forthcoming debate on the whole project entailed in the white paper which has been announced.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, according to a Flemish saying, prevention is better than cure, and I assume that this pearl of wisdom is used in each of our Member States and regions.
I would like to expressly congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report.
My group has not tabled any amendments and is in full agreement with you.
We give you our full support and have every confidence in you.
After all, the proposal follows on from a pledge which was made previously regarding the follow-up committee.
This is therefore to be welcomed.
I would like to home in on the following issues.
Firstly, it makes sense to include regionalisation and regional differentiation in the goal-oriented fight against TSE.
If you are in any doubt about this, just ask my Scottish and Welsh colleagues.
Secondly, there are tests for a rapid diagnosis and to identify TSE in cattle.
We, as Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection want to make these methods available so as to improve our monitoring procedures, and rightly so.
As it happens, we all know that these tests are not yet scientifically accurate and that when these tests are applied, we do not know precisely whether infection actually occurs at each stage of the disease.
I believe that these tests are at least heading in the right direction and that we should support the scientific research carried out in this field.
Thirdly, I welcome the requirement to destroy or remove the entire herd on farms where the disease has broken out.
Fourthly, there is indeed a need for additional legislation for products such as cosmetics, medicines and pharmaceutical preparations which are excluded from the present proposal.
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a number of amendments which actually provide for a number of points to be lifted from the appendix and included in the body of the text.
I think that it is important to bring about more democracy, to get away from comitology, and to increase parliamentary control.
These are cardinal amendments, to my mind.
Mr President, the proposal for a regulation under discussion does not aim to address the problems, as the Commission hypocritically claims, but to cover up the problems which have arisen in certain countries, thereby generalising them and making them everybody' s problem.
This is why this proposal needs to be changed, particularly where it specifies classifying countries into categories.
If the Commission really wanted to protect public health from spongiform encephalopathies, it would have proposed rules to prevent such risks a long time ago, but it did not.
It would have made provision for the necessary procedures and penalties.
But the interests of multinational food corporations, which have subjugated everything to the rationale of excessive profit, precluded any such action.
So, this Commission initiative only made its appearance once the situation had got out of control - with dioxin for example - and is now endeavouring to show that it has some control over the situation.
The conclusion which we draw from this draft regulation is that it is probably an attempt to cover up the situation.
That is the direction in which things are heading with the classification of countries, which, rather than taking into account the most basic factor, which is the existence or non-existence of cases of encephalopathy in their raised cattle, takes account of other factors when allocating countries to a particular category.
The worst thing about this is that, theoretically, if a member state in which cases of encephalopathy have been reported can prove that it has established systems for monitoring production, it could be placed in the same category as a country in which no cases have ever been reported.
This same spirit, this "lowest common denominator" approach, pervades the rest of the proposed measures, such as the mandatory removal of various organs (spleen, brain, spinal cord, etc.).
Such measures will blacken the reputation of meat-producing countries in which there have been no cases of encephalopathy and will also discredit sheepmeat and goatmeat, since there is no substantial scientific evidence as to whether this meat is sensitive to spongiform encephalopathy pathogens.
At the same time, the proposal to remove the aforementioned organs and tissues is a recipe for disaster for sheep- and goatmeat, which will be impossible to market; in other words, this measure will indirectly oust sheep and goat meat from the market, demand will be met by other types of meat from larger animals and traditional recipes using offal such as intestines and spleen will be banned.
We therefore oppose the Commission proposal.
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution to this debate and I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.
Parliament has certainly devoted considerable time on behalf of its citizens to addressing the important agenda of food safety, while at the same time ensuring that our farmers can operate within a production framework of traceability which is the only way to fully restore consumer confidence in the wide range of quality food products produced by European farmers.
For this reason, the creation of a uniform legal basis for controlling and preventing the spread of BSE and scrapie is paramount and there is still, as other speakers have suggested, a lack of consistency in relation to the application of the regulations within individual Member States.
I would urge Commissioner Byrne to prioritise introduction of that level of consistency which is the only way that we can convince our consumers that we have a common policy in relation to ensuring public health.
As I have said in previous debates, farmers are the victims of circumstances beyond their control and those responsible for the manufacture of animal feed which puts public health, our entire livestock sector and indeed farm incomes at risk, have much to answer for.
This House must be vigilant in ensuring that it can never again be repeated.
I welcome the availability of rapid diagnostic testing for improved detection of TSEs in cattle and believe, Commissioner, that further consideration should be given to its use as a means of establishing the health status of animals in Member States.
For my country, Ireland, food exports and in particular beef are of paramount importance to our economy and the income of farmers.
I can say that we have left no stone unturned in tackling this problem, including the removal of entire herds where an infected animal has in fact been diagnosed.
May I say in conclusion that farmers have always responded in a positive way to the introduction of regulations governing public health and the health status of animals raised for food production.
Their task as guarantors of food security and quality is, as everyone in this House knows, becoming increasingly difficult.
Far too often their contribution to society has been taken for granted and certainly not always adequately rewarded with a reasonable income.
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr BÃ¶ge, Commissioner, we have before us a proposal for a regulation on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which is to say degeneration of the brain in bovine animals, sheep, primates, antelope, cats and even humans, since there have been 53 cases of atypical Creutzfeldt-Jakob in Great Britain, all fatal.
So now we are going to adopt regulations to prevent an epidemic that we have known about since 1986, i.e. for fourteen years.
It is rather late in the day to react, but even so over the last fourteen years we have done a great deal. Last month, for example, we decided to stick labels on meat to warn consumers.
The Commission told us that it was impossible to enforce such labelling before 2002, sixteen years after the outbreak of the disease, but we have done something all the same.
We have had discussions with Mr Delors, with Mr Santer, with Mr Prodi, with Mr McSharry, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, then Mr Steichen, and Mr Fischler.
We have set up a committee of inquiry chaired by our fellow Member, Mr BÃ¶ge, a temporary monitoring committee; we have even tabled a motion of censure, against Mr BÃ¶ge' s wishes. We have heard expert opinions from Mr Dirringer, the German virologist, Mr Picoud, Mr Dormont, Scottish specialists, our Portuguese fellow Member, Garcia, was a specialist.
We have had debates, topical and urgent questions on the embargo, etc.
After fourteen years of discussion, there are few survivors of this war of nigh on twenty years - Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, Mr Cunha, Mr BÃ¶ge, and myself. Mr Happart left us and Mr Pagel died.
So I think it would be useful for the more recent Members, in the end, if I gave a sort of debriefing on the subject, quite apart from the problems with the legal basis under Article 100 A or BSE monitoring problems.
The starting point for this business was the 1984 milk quotas.
To improve their milk reference, our British friends drove their cows like some sort of engines, overfeeding them, and, in order to save on the cost of fodder, they fed their cows on meal made from carcasses.
Then, again, to save fuel oil when manufacturing meal, they reduced the cooking temperature, thereby enabling the pathogen to survive.
BSE is the tragic product of the race for profits and the British farm model.
The disease has been identified since 1986, but nothing much was done until 1996.
Why not?
The public could not be thrown into a panic because the Maastricht Treaty had to be sold to them.
So the press, the Commission and the European Parliament all knew about it, but did not say a word.
So when, in March 1996, the British, via the British Ministers for Agriculture and Health, admitted that the disease could be transmitted to human beings, the necessary measures were not taken.
Why?
Because this time the reason the public could not be thrown into a panic was no longer to sell the Maastricht Treaty but the Treaty of Amsterdam.
So, met first with silence and then with lies, the epidemic spread and we all know what the outcome of that was.
In the first place, BSE has not been eradicated in Great Britain, and will not be eradicated.
Secondly, the belated ban on meal did not serve to eradicate contamination.
Thirdly, either contamination crossed over to the meal fed to poultry, or there is a third transmission route.
In addition to maternal contamination, there may be transmission via the fields, the grazing land, the grass, and there may be badlands, as in the case of ovine scrapie, where the prion would be encysted and would return as soon as bovine animals were put to pasture there.
Fourthly, Great Britain and the industrialists causing the contamination have not, as polluters, paid.
It is innocent farmers, grain farmers, who are paying the price, in the same way that the farmers are paying for Kosovo.
All in all, then, the directive and the regulation are all well and good, but they are somewhat hypocritical.
We all agree that we need regulations on prevention, we are all agreed on adopting the amendments from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to whom the matter should have been referred.
We all agree that scientific measures are needed, methods to be used in abattoirs to remove the ilia, the ganglia, the duodena, the inguinal, medial, lateral, renal, prefemoral and cervical lymph nodes, but this is not the key issue.
In the BSE crisis, at the moment of truth, when protective action had to be taken, it was taken by the national states.
That is the main lesson to be learnt from the TSE business.
Firstly, protection is always led by the states.
Secondly, the precautionary principle means safeguarding nations.
This is no obstacle to the construction of Europe but, like children making tree houses, it is just a game.
That is what we are doing here, Mr President, all playing out together.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rationale of maximising profits leads to all sorts of aberrations, including feeding herbivores on meat-based meal.
It is not just the cows that went mad, and as a result, ovine scrapie spread to bovine animals in the form of BSE.
Consumer welfare demands that we use every means possible to prevent and vigorously combat these diseases and their vectors.
The action taken in 1997 is now proving even more inadequate as scientists are today talking about a third transmission route.
We must therefore provide ourselves with effective means to eradicate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies once and for all, if at all possible. This means coordinating and dealing with the sector as soon as waste is used in animal fodder, destroying at-risk materials if there is suspicion, banning the inclusion of animal protein in cattle fodder, demanding traceability by labelling the animal' s site of birth and rearing, and, at Member State level, setting up the local monitoring systems which are the only ways to guarantee that the campaign will be effective and that monitoring will be transparent, setting in place a fast, systematic screening procedure and also in-depth checks, if necessary.
Finally, the whole herd must be slaughtered if one beast is found to be infected.
This is the price of food safety, but it must not be used as an excuse to cast doubt on the transportation of live animals.
Mr President, in stressing the excellent quality of the work carried out by Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr BÃ¶ge, I would like to dwell on one aspect and take advantage of the presence of Commissioner Byrne.
Clearly, our goal has to be total elimination, but we feel that this would be extremely difficult as the costs of incinerating the large numbers of animals which die on farms are objectively huge.
Consequently, the economic burdens and the amount of technical organisation involved could be extensive, and so could the environmental impact of such large-scale incineration carried out at extremely high temperatures.
In this sense, we ought to ask the Commission - and insist on a reply - whether realistic estimates of the quantities of material to be incinerated are already available to us, whether they have already been made or whether this still remains to be done, according to the various classification procedures of the States, together with an evaluation of the resulting organisational economic burdens, with subsequent referral to Parliament.
It is therefore essential to prevent the adoption of different, uncoordinated paths by individual Member States from causing substantial distortion of competition and disproportion in the treatment reserved for producers.
It is necessary to provide for the adoption of harmonised financial support measures, lay down common organisational guidelines and use applied research measures to develop new disposal technologies with less environmental impact which allow the use of forms of materials recycling which respect consumer safety requirements.
The development of common guidelines should allow firmer, more balanced and, therefore, more effective responses.
For example, we consider that setting up mandatory disposal consortia according to the model already laid down by the legislation of some Member States could be a practical response to the need to limit the economic impact of disposal operations on breeders and, at the same time, thanks to the increase in the degree of social control over the proper use of the service, to the need to consolidate consumer and environmental guarantees.
We conclude that the adoption of the excellent regulation in question will require the development of a combination of initiatives, research and analysis, but also regulation and standardisation, and we hope that Parliament will associate itself with these measures.
Mr President, we have before us a very important directive, aimed at creating a uniform legal basis for the prevention and control of TSEs.
The objective is to gather into one dossier all regulations relating to TSEs to date.
If we are to restore consumer confidence, it is essential that we do all we possibly can at all levels.
I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for the vigour she has shown in her approach to this matter - many of her proposals deserve agreement.
Mr BÃ¶ge, for his part, has ensured that these views will gain wide support in this Chamber.
I agree that the Commission for its part has done a good job, a job that Parliament can endorse, whereas Member States must eventually be made to understand that this matter is important and that we must gain consumer confidence.
I should, however, like to draw your attention to one more issue: those countries and farms, which have escaped the animal diseases, must also be able to ensure that they will not have these problems in future.
It is therefore essential that the withdrawal period relating to the transfer of animals from one farm to another be increased from two years to six years.
On the whole, we must firmly hold to the notion that within the internal market, too, human health is the most important thing, and that principles of free competition only take second place.
It is imperative that we bear this in mind, particularly when dealing with these food matters, which are all-important to consumers.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report and to thank her for her openness to discussion on the issues involved.
She will appreciate even better than I how far scientific opinion on TSEs has developed.
For example, the Scientific Steering Committee has recently established that it is necessary to regard the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglion as specified risk material in the UK only for bovines over 30 months and in Portugal only for those over 6 months.
That is why some of us seek an Amendment No 56 to allow adjustments in this area on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee rather than requiring fresh legislation to implement them.
Similarly, certain measures in combating TSEs have already proved effective.
I refer to the exclusion of animals over 30 months from the food chain, the slaughter and disposal of suspects and offspring of BSE cases, a fully effective feed ban and the removal of a wide range of specified risk materials.
Where such measures are in place, in seems unnecessary to impose the more technical requirement of the date-based export scheme and the certified animal scheme to the domestic market; hence, Amendment No 53.
In addition, given that there is no evidence of horizontal transmission of TSEs, there would seem to be no scientific requirement for whole-herd slaughter.
While accepting that some Member States may wish to engage in the practice, I would submit that it should not be compulsory.
Indeed, we take TSE and BSE very seriously in the United Kingdom.
We are committed to the safety of the public and to animal welfare.
We only ask that given that we have taken these measures which we believe to be effective, you do not ask to us to take additional measures which have no scientific justification for them.
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report seeks to strengthen consumer protection measures but also to extend Parliament' s scope of action, by ensuring that all issues crucial to the prevention of TSEs are included in the regulatory instrument, not just in the annexes which are not covered by the codecision procedure.
This twofold concern seems to be particularly justified today, as French experience shows.
