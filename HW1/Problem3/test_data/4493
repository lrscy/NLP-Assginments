Children need high-quality facilities in order to learn cognitive and social skills.
Good and stimulating daycare for children is an important, necessary and valuable supplement to their upbringing in the family context, and that is what parents want.
We must not be content with 'care lite'.
Another reason why it is so important is that, in many states, the reality of the situation is that not all children's interests are best fostered within the family, and that many children are growing up without siblings.
Such children find in the crÃšche and the daycare provider a safe place, stable relationships and encouragement from various quarters to learn language and other skills.
Studies all around the world have shown that children benefit from being supported and taught in a daycare facility or by a daytime carer.
I am sure that we will, with your support, benefit from new impetus in the areas I have named and that we have set in motion an important debate in the European Union.
Mr President, honourable Members, five years have passed since the European Council set targets for pre-school childcare availability in the context of the European Employment Strategy.
In March 2002, the European Council of Barcelona agreed that Member States should strive to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90% of all children between three years old and the mandatory age for starting school, and at least 33% of all children under three years of age, in an effort to remove disincentives to female labour participation.
The European Council reiterated the need to achieve these targets in the European Pact for Gender Equality adopted in March 2006.
These targets are a long way from being met, however.
The provision of affordable, accessible and quality childcare is vital if Europe is to meet its agendas of growth, employment and gender equality.
Childcare is needed to unleash the productive potential of the European workforce.
It allows women and men with young children to enter and stay in paid employment, while improving their quality of life.
It eliminates a major constraint that restricts the free choice of individuals to reconcile their professional and private lives.
It also offers children an excellent start in life.
Accessible, high-quality childcare is a vital prerequisite to achieving genuine gender equality.
Women continue to carry most of the responsibility for the care of children.
At the same time, women are affected by the gender gaps that persist in employment, unemployment and pay.
The provision of decent and widely accessible childcare contributes to the economic independence of women.
It also gives single parents, most of whom are women, the opportunity to improve their living conditions.
Childcare also contributes to addressing the demographic challenge of a falling birth rate, by supporting the individual choices of women and men, including decisions on the number of children they wish to have.
If affordable, accessible and quality childcare is provided, having more children will not hinder labour market participation.
The Commission is committed to supporting the achievement of the Barcelona goals.
In last year's roadmap for achieving equality between women and men in 2006-2010, the Commission committed itself to supporting the achievement of the Barcelona targets on childcare and the development of other care facilities through the Structural Funds and the exchange of good practice.
The current rules for the Structural Funds already allowed for this use.
In this context, the Commission pointed out that services and structures are adapting too slowly to a situation where both women and men work and where women continue to be regarded as the main carers of children and other dependants.
The implementation of the Barcelona targets is monitored in the framework of the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs.
The Annual Progress Report in December noted that while there has been some progress in Member States to develop childcare facilities, progress towards the Barcelona targets remains slow.
The Commission has therefore invited Member States to focus in 2007 on 'increasing the availability and affordability of quality childcare in line with their own national targets'.
In the Annual report on gender equality for 2006 published last month, the Commission pointed out that Member States should step up their efforts to meet the Barcelona targets and support the development of care for older and disabled persons.
It also underlined the qualitative aspect of childcare and the fact that families and parents working on a full-time basis require appropriate opening hours and flexible access.
The Commission welcomes the establishment of an Alliance for Families, which was announced in the conclusions of the European Council.
The 'Alliance for Families' will serve as a platform for the exchange of views and knowledge on family-friendly policies as well as of best practices between Member States.
The Commission also invited Member States to make full use of the potential offered by the Cohesion Policy to support the promotion of equality between women and men, including improving access to affordable childcare, through programmes cofinanced by the Structural Funds.
The Commission believes that childcare should be viewed as an essential part of a comprehensive approach to reconciling work and private life.
Men should be encouraged to take an equal share of family responsibilities, in particular through incentives to take leave entitlements and by developing innovative and adaptable work patterns.
The need for care services for school-age children and other dependant persons should also be addressed.
I am pleased to announce today that I intend to submit, in 2008, a Communication on Childcare in which I will make concrete proposals to increase the availability, quality and affordability of childcare.
We believe that this will be an important stimulus to Member States to meet the Barcelona targets.
Mr President, I welcome the commitment made by the Commission and the Council to do more to reconcile people's family and professional lives and to increase the provision of affordable childcare.
However, I cannot hide my disappointment regarding the very mixed results obtained in the wake of the 2002 Barcelona Council.
As the study by your Directorate-General for Employment concluded in September 2005, the insufficient number of affordable childcare structures represents not only a barrier to the economic and social integration of economically-disadvantaged families, but also, and above all, a major obstacle to the equal participation of women and men in the labour market and to the balanced division of tasks between women and men in family life.
It emerges from a very large number of studies that Europeans cannot have children, as they would like, or have as many children as they would like.
Furthermore, given the way in which the needs and demands of the labour market have developed, the Member States should work towards establishing more flexible and more diverse childcare services so as to broaden the range of choices and to respond to the specific preferences, needs and circumstances of parents and families.
There are people who wish to care for their children themselves; we cannot let these people down or penalise them since they are helping to maintain the social cohesion of the family unit.
As for those men and women who care for dependents on a permanent or temporary basis, they should receive a recognised status granting them, among other things, social security and pension rights, and, just like those who are gainfully employed, they should be able to benefit from lifelong learning so that they can fulfil the demands of the job market.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as has just been said, we have ambitious targets from the Barcelona Summit when it comes to the development of childcare.
A number of countries have achieved these already.
Other countries are still a fair way from doing so, which is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.
Why is child care important, then?
It is important for families with a view to their being able to combine family life and working life.
It is important in terms of gender equality because it has traditionally been women who have had to accept responsibility for childcare and so have not entered the labour market.
It is important for children to have access to high-quality childcare as an important stage in their progress towards, for example, school and the adult world.
It is also important for employment and growth as, if we look at those countries that have made good progress in developing childcare, they also have high levels of employment, including women's employment, and thus higher growth too.
Looking at demographic development, we see the need to have women - indeed, everyone - in the labour market.
The method we have is that of best practice.
Many of the decisions are taken in the Member States, at local and regional levels.
I have to say, however, how satisfactory it is that the debate has now been extended.
I am following, for example, the debate in Germany, which is extremely lively in a way that it has not been in the past.
It is important to have this ongoing debate in our Member States and for us to see the need for child care so that this development might get under way.
I wish to thank the German Presidency for having invited me, in my capacity as draftsman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the informal meeting taking place in May, when these issues are to be discussed.
I am pleased to accept the invitation.
We hope that we can make some headway in developing child care, for the sake not only of children and families but also of employment.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I warmly welcome this initiative on families and childcare.
Children and young people are the most valuable asset we have for our future.
We have to make the sort of decisions that enable them to live a full and secure life, and these decisions need to be made now.
I myself have been privileged in that, when my children were small, I was a house husband in Finland for five years.
In our society there was the option of staying at home, and that is also true today.
I can therefore state looking back that the five years I spent as a house husband looking after two boys were, without doubt, among the best years of my life.
It seems to me that when we speak of parenthood today, we still conventionally try and place the burden of responsibility solely on the shoulders of mothers and women.
Parenthood means that fathers too have to take full responsibility for their children.
We also need to ensure that work and family life can be reconciled so that families can choose which of the parents goes out to work if it is impossible for both to do so.
On the other hand, we should develop forms of day care so that children are provided with good, first-rate care if both parents are gainfully employed.
Childhood is an important time, as the data from research shows.
The first four to five years in a child's life are reflected in the rest of that child's life.
The decisions made then, the care and love received and the security that a child has felt will be conspicuous throughout a person's life.
I am therefore in favour of these aims to try and promote the status of families and children.
I hope that something concrete will come of them and that they will not merely remain aims.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to point out to you, to the Commission and Council representatives, and to all those present in the Chamber that Europe's demographic situation will not improve unless politicians really take children's interests to heart.
This can only really happen if children are granted political rights.
I refer to voting rights for children, rights to be granted to children and entrusted to their legal guardians, namely their parents.
An attempt to do just this has already been made in the German Parliament, the Bundestag.
The Bundestag debated a bill to grant voting rights to children from birth.
The rights would be vested in the children's parents and legal guardians.
Of course, significant legal changes would be needed to bring this about, but it does seem that it would be more conducive to righting Europe's demographic situation than the current legal arrangements.
Unfortunately, it was because of the changes that the bill was rejected during debate in the Bundestag, even though it had the backing of many leading politicians and the support of the committee in which it had been discussed.
I just wished to point this out.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, the most important reason for making women and men equal is to give women the right and the opportunity to provide for themselves. It means giving them not only the right, but also the opportunity, to work by making good, high-quality childcare available to them.
Unless society helps all children have access to good childcare, with fair financial costs for the parents, and accepts responsibility for bringing about such a state of affairs, women will be forced to rely on others providing for them.
As the Presidency did, I wish, however, to highlight children's rights and the child's perspective in this connection.
It is incredibly important for children to be able to associate with other children, to meet with and otherwise encounter adults other than their parents and to have access to the educational experiences necessary to children's development.
Children who have the advantage of childcare involving both other children and adults trained as educators obtain a better start in life and increase their social skills.
Good childcare is just as important, then, for children themselves as it is for gender equality and economic growth.
I think that it is time for the EU institutions and, above all, the Member States to put at least as much commitment into children's rights as they have hitherto put into the internal market for goods and services. Otherwise, we shall not even achieve the Barcelona targets.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Commissioner, I rely heavily on child and adult special care to be here and to make my contribution to this debate today.
It is important for a woman to have the right to pursue a career if she chooses and good, affordable childcare is essential in ensuring this.
But, having worked at home and raised a large family, I know the important part I played in the development of my children.
I consider myself fortunate to have been able to stay home with my children and my children fortunate to have had me.
What is the debate about?
It is important that we are honest.
Is this debate about children?
My first grandchild was born this morning.
If we could ask him, he would say that he would choose to be cared for by his mother.
Is the debate about choice for women?
If it is, we would, on the one hand, financially support childcare and flexible working conditions for mothers who choose to work and, on the other hand, financially support mothers who choose to work at home caring for children.
If the debate is about the EU economy, then in the short term providing an extensive childcare system and a network of legislation that actually gets women into the workplace, whether or not they want to be there, makes sense.
But in the long term, given EU demographics and the intricacies of child development, channelling the vast majority of mothers into the workplace during their children's young years is a policy that I am convinced we will someday regret.
I am sure the European Parliament would like to join me in congratulating you on the birth of your grandson today.
(SK) The problem of placing children in pre-school care facilities is also closely linked to the matter we were discussing here in Parliament last night, that is, gender equality and equal opportunities.
Besides her desire to be an equal partner at work, a woman also longs to become a mother.
The inadequate care that the state provides for children of pre-school age is one of the reasons why women are less likely to secure roles at decision-making levels.
For that reason, specific targets were set in 2002 at the European Union summit in Barcelona.
It was envisaged that by 2010 all Member States of the Union would ensure childcare for at least 90% of children aged from 3 to 6 years old, as well as for 33% of children under 3 years of age.
It is generally known that at this age children grow and develop particularly rapidly, and therefore it is essential to make the best use of this time and to prepare them not only for school but also for life.
The attainment of these targets will facilitate the social integration of children from problematic population groups.
The state should see to it that children from all social classes are given an equal opportunity to benefit from basic training for life, and to ensure that this opportunity is not determined by the wealth of their parents.
Facing decreasing birth rates in Europe and ominous demographic statistics, we should take a moment to ponder why young families are not motivated to have children.
We will all agree that a combination of short maternity leaves, taken immediately after a child is born, followed by part-time work and high quality child care facilities is the most effective mix possible.
This will put the conditions in place for the healthy growth of the young generation and for the fulfilment of their parents' ambitions.
(SK) I sincerely welcome the statement of the European Commission and Council drawing the attention of Member States to the obligations that they assumed in 2002 in Barcelona, because we no longer have much time left for them to be fulfilled.
As we heard, not even a quarter of the Member States have achieved the targets.
While in different Member States the situation apparently varies, in many of the new Member States it is deteriorating instead of improving.
It would be a real shame if we were to continue to waste time and to declare in 2010 that the targets were illusory and unattainable, as there is no excuse for the lack of preparedness and in this particular case time is unforgiving.
There is no doubt that providing adequate childcare is one of the basic conditions for a better work-life balance.
I am convinced that we cannot increase the employment of women and decrease unemployment among young people, which is very high indeed, without putting the conditions in place for proper childcare as well as care for dependant family members.
It is also sensible to demand that these services adapt to more flexible work patterns and better adapt to new requirements and changing conditions.
It might be worth considering whether this area should not be included in the notion of flexicurity, because without flexibility and the adequate social security and legal certainty associated with these services, flexicurity is not feasible.
In expanding the network of these facilities the question arises as to who should assume not only the start-up costs but also the operational costs.
There should be no doubt that responsibility rests with the Member States in this regard.
Mr President, five years ago the EU set targets for childcare.
Member States should strive to provide childcare for at least 90% of children aged between three and the mandatory school age, and for 33% of children under the age of three, by 2010.
On the fifth anniversary of the Barcelona targets, we are here to evaluate the progress made in this area.
Sadly, these targets have not yet been reached.
Only five countries meet the 33% target: Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Sweden.
We must look at how the other Member States are performing.
I wonder if the Commission has been monitoring the situation regarding these targets.
Is the Commission preparing an analysis?
Are there common standards in order to monitor childcare?
What are the consequences for those Member States not implementing the targets?
Why should Europe invest in childcare?
It is not by chance that a childcare campaign was launched by the Party of European Socialists, who pleaded for accessible, affordable and good quality childcare.
We did so because we strongly believe that investing in childcare means investing in our future; putting our children first gives them a good start in life and ensures equal opportunities when later entering the labour market.
It allows the EU to deal with demographic challenges in order to make the EU market a more competitive one, as well as making Europe more social.
It allows greater participation by women in the labour market and makes it possible for men and women to reconcile family and working life, as the Commissioner mentioned in his speech.
Clearly, by investing in childcare, we can make equal opportunities a reality and maximise life's opportunities for all children.
This can contribute to the elimination of poverty, irrespective of the socioeconomic background.
Therefore, I ask Member States and the Commission to work together and to commit to achieving these targets.
Hungary is a good example: the Minister for Social and Legal Affairs recognised the importance of childcare and is committed to increasing childcare, particularly among children aged 0-3 years, from 8% to 33% in five years.
Mr President, our children are by far the most valuable of our assets.
However, at the same time they are also the most vulnerable, not just because of their sensitive somatic and psychological needs while growing up, but also because of the numerous perils encountered in modern living.
For these reasons, amongst many others, our children unquestionably need and deserve our utmost care and attention.
However, in a world in which both parents may be frantically fighting their way into a busy career rat race, a world in which both parents may be consumed in the daily fight of earning more, a world in which the forces of social strain may have destroyed family cohesion, a world in which geographical separation may have diminished the invaluable assistance of grandparents and other close family members - in such a world parental childcare may suffer severely.
This is the world that Member States must assist promptly and comprehensively.
There should be encouragement of initiatives to create a greater number of and better-suited childcare services; provision for special leave flexibility for parents; and the establishment of working environments adapted to the needs of parents.
These are just some of the main necessities.
In addition, innovative measures should also be encouraged and improved upon, such as parent counselling services or even schooling for parents, whereby parents may be given greater knowledge and support on how to be better parents and how best to cope with the problems of parenthood.
In conclusion, let us never forget that no childcare services, however good they may be, can replace parental love and affection.
Along with all other measures, perhaps we should also encourage people to re-evaluate their priorities in life.
Is it better for a family to have a higher income but less child-parent contact?
Is it in the best interests of a family to have two full-time career-chasing parents who rarely meet up at the family dinner?
Every parent should perhaps consider these questions and try to answer them honestly for their children's sake.
(PL) Mr President, our eyes and ears tell us that Europe is getting older.
Fewer and fewer children are being born in the Member States of the European Union.
Why is this?
Do we not love children any more?
That is certainly not the case.
What has happened is that we have become more aware of the difficulty of bringing up children.
Furthermore, women in Europe put off starting a family for longer and longer, if they actually decide to have children at all.
One of the reasons for this situation is the provision of childcare during working hours.
Women can only focus on their professional commitments if suitable childcare is provided.
Female unemployment is lowest in the states that provide proper care for women during pregnancy, at birth, and whilst they are feeding and later bringing up their children.
The provision of appropriate treatment for citizens irrespective of their gender or origin, and ensuring their proper development and protection from the moment of birth to advanced old age is a principle that simply must be respected in the contemporary world.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing is extremely important and places the spotlight once again on social Europe.
For some time we have been pressing for this objective and it is therefore worth stating that investing in and expanding high-quality childcare, providing better training, good day care and new advantages for children would be an unmistakable signal of the political will to move in the right direction.
It is very clear that getting behind children with appropriate social and economic policies means not only thinking seriously about their future, but also helping to create new economic and social conditions for families; it would make it possible for many parents and, above all, many women to enter the employment market.
After all, as has already been said, this could be a response to one of the challenges that Europe has to tackle - that of demographic change - in fuelling the employment market in a positive way, improving European competitiveness and making our societies richer.
Commissioner, what is therefore needed is more courage and farsightedness, to overcome the delays that exist in the individual Member States, and thus Parliament and the Commission must show commitment and display vigour and determination to achieve the objectives set out.
(PT) First of all I welcome the communications from the Council and the Commission.
We all agree that there will never be true gender equality until there is a way to reconcile work and family life, both for women and for men.
It is essential that men should share family responsibilities and that women should be able to have a career.
For that to happen, the Member States must urgently establish networks of high-quality, affordable childcare facilities available at appropriate times.
It is lamentable that in 2007, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, we are still a long way off the Barcelona targets, and yet, with our ageing population and falling birth rates, the European Union needs as many adults in the job market as possible, and that means more women.
We are eagerly looking forward to the document on this subject that Commissioner Å pidla announced here for 2008.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am most warmly appreciative of your contributions.
If I have not misunderstood any of them, there is a great deal of agreement in this House as to the goal that we have set ourselves, which, indeed, we did a number of years ago, when we also accepted certain obligations.
We have also seen that we have not yet succeeded in achieving these objectives in all the Member States, and that relatively little time remains to us to discharge those obligations before 2010.
It is also important that the debate on the Alliance for Families should be revived, and I will say quite deliberately that this needs to be done not only in Germany, as Mr Andersson said in the opening words of his speech.
Different views were expressed on the particular subject of whether it might be made obligatory that children be put in childcare facilities, so what we are talking about is freedom of choice.
Freedom of choice is a very important thing to aim for.
Nobody is stipulating in whose care children should be placed or how many children people have to have.
That is not what we are here to debate.
It has to be said, though, that there are special cases in which there is no such freedom of choice, because the specialised care facilities are not there, and that is why it is important, as has been said by the Commission, by you in your speeches and also by the presidency, to hold fast to this goal when there are so many different aspects to be considered.
Some of you have spoken about equality of opportunity, and others about the balance between work and family life, demographic change or children's education.
Something else that is important is that we have undertaken to increase the proportion of women at work, using flexicurity as one of the means to that end.
It follows that diverse considerations have been taken into account in this debate.
I would like to reiterate how very glad I was to hear Commissioner Å pidla announce his intention of submitting a document next year in order to find out what will have resulted from the debates in the Council and in your House and what will have been done about achieving these objectives.
In thanking you for the frankness of this debate, let me also say that it is for every one of us, in any Member State in which the targets have not yet been met or in which there is a risk of them not being met by 2010, to take appropriate political steps in order that the goals we have set ourselves may - as we indeed hope - be achieved before that date.
Honourable Members, I feel it is abundantly clear that the Barcelona targets are appropriate and that the debate has confirmed that there is broad consensus on this issue.
There is also no doubt that a number of countries are a long way from meeting the targets and that we must do all we can to encourage the Member States to rectify this.
The advantages of the Barcelona Strategy are clear but I should like, if I may, to go over them once again.
Firstly, without responsible childcare structures, it is not possible to achieve basic targets on gender equality.
Secondly, without such arrangements the issue of demographic ageing cannot be addressed in a responsible manner.
Two questions clearly emerged from the debate: the first of which was whether the Commission has followed up the Barcelona Strategy.
As I stressed in my report as part of the Lisbon Strategy, the answer is yes.
The second question concerned measures with which to compare individual countries.
Individual countries are currently compared on the basis of data that they give on an individual basis and, concerning methodology, it is difficult to compare these data.
It is easy to monitor development in one's own country but comparing one country with another is extremely difficult.
This situation is unsatisfactory, and we are therefore working on ways of making the various individual viewpoints ready for assessment, which should be completed by the end of the year.
There was also a third question that came through, which was whether or not, in the framework of the Barcelona Strategy, we are aiming for parental choice.
Yes, in accordance with the objectives as they are formulated, this is clearly the case.
The Member States should endeavour to provide childcare by 2010 for at least 90% of children from three years up to school age; that is, to provide care or to give parents the choice of whether or not to take up this opportunity.
In this regard the purpose of the objective is abundantly clear.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate.
I feel it is clear that there is still a great deal still to do, but that we are capable of accomplishing a great deal.
The debate is closed.
Commission Question Time
Marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less (debate)
The next item is the report by Bernadette Bourzai, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged twelve months or less C6-0330/2006.
Mr President, before going into the details of the report, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Bourzai and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their very good work carried out on this fairly sensitive issue, namely the marketing of bovine meat at an age lower than 12 months.
The report is a response to the request made by the Council in the middle of 2004 towards a harmonisation of the definition of veal within the European Community.
It follows a lengthy consultation process involving different stakeholders and Member State experts, during which the Commission has demonstrated its readiness to take into account, to the greatest extent possible, traditions and habits in different Member States.
The Commission has also considered the main feature of the consumption and the production of veal within the European Union.
It allows the main problems as regards the marketing of the meat of these young animals to be addressed, and I think it offers a balanced response to most of the concerns that have been raised.
For the first time, it is now possible to reach an agreement on this difficult issue.
Many of the amendments that have been proposed or introduced aim to simplify the Commission proposal in order to try to cut red tape, to reduce the administrative burdens and the cost as much as possible, and in principle these amendments should not raise any problems.
I am looking forward to listening to the discussion, and hopefully we can find a solution.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first of all to thank you all for your contributions, and also to congratulate the officials of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and of the European Commission who gave me the necessary technical support.
This is a sensitive matter on which the Member States and the European Commission have been seeking an agreement since the beginning of the nineties, as the Commissioner has just reminded us.
The crux of the problem is that usually, when meat from calves is sold, no reference is made either to the type of feed the animals are given or to their age at the time of slaughter, although production practices differ greatly from one Member State to another.
Consequently, because of differing interpretations, traders and consumers find themselves faced with very different products, but sold under one and the same description: veal.
As the European Commission has emphasised, this practice could disturb trade and encourage unfair competition.
Studies show that the term 'veal' is a sales description that adds value and some traders make use of it to benefit from substantially higher market prices, when in fact they are marketing meat from young bovine animals with very different organoleptic qualities.
It is at the request of several Member States and of the European beef sector, who want clarification, that the Commission has set out its initial proposal, which I think is entirely appropriate.
The Commission proposal is to lay down precise sales descriptions according to age at the time of slaughter, a criterion that is significant enough and easier to monitor than the feeding regime.
It proposes the introduction of two categories and the use of a letter to identify them: 'X' for animals slaughtered up to the age of eight months and 'Y' for animals slaughtered between the ages of nine and twelve months, letters that Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has chosen to replace with 'V' and 'Z' in order to avoid confusions linked with gender.
For the first category, the sales description will continue to use the term 'veal'. For the second, a different term will be used:'jeune bovin' in French, 'vitellone' in Italian, etc.
On this subject I refer you to Annex II(B) of the regulation.
There is an exception for trade carried out on the domestic market in four countries, Denmark, Greece, Spain and the Netherlands, where, in order to take account of local customs and cultural traditions, it will still be possible to use the term 'veal' in the second category.
The terms 'veal', 'veal meat', or any other sales description defined in the proposal may no longer be used in the labelling of meat obtained from animals aged more than 12 months.
Traders who wish to supplement the sales descriptions laid down in this proposal with other, optional information, such as the feed used, will, of course, be able to do so.
Therefore, coming from Limousin, I could speak to you about 'white veal'.
I was keen to propose changes to the European Commission's initial proposal to make this legislation more coherent and restrictive and I thank my colleagues for having supported me.
In particular I asked for a system of penalties to be introduced in the event of failure to respect the rules, and I proposed amendments to include within the scope of the regulation meat-based products intended for human consumption, prepared, processed or cooked products.
I also insisted that the sales description should be used at each stage of production and marketing.
I think, however, that certain points are not acceptable and could spoil the balance of the proposal for a regulation.
I am talking about Amendments 8 and 12, which were adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Amendment 8 suggests that designations and IGPs (protected geographical indications) registered after the publication of this regulation could be exempted from it, and this is not consistent with the legislation as a whole.
Designations of origin and protected geographical indications that have already been registered are not affected, but it is important that new AOCs and IGPs should be subject to the provisions of this regulation, otherwise they could be completely bypassed.
Amendment 12 calls into question the proposal for a regulation based on the criterion of age.
In fact, as Annex II shows, the United Kingdom has chosen to give the description 'veal' to the first category, and the description 'beef' to the second category.
This country's specific requirements have, therefore, been taken into account.
Furthermore, I do not support the two new Amendments 26 and 27 presented to plenary.
These two amendments introduce a new derogation that, in my opinion, is incompatible with Article 3 of the Regulation, as they allow a given Member State not to apply the regulation if its production of animals in the first category, aged less than 8 months, does not exceed 3% of the total production of animals aged less than 12 months.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to support me and to reject these four amendments which would reduce the scope of the Regulation, which is supposed to apply to the whole of the European Union and the scope of harmonisation of the first category 'up to eight months', which has been very difficult to attain.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less was in need of clarification, and so I should first of all like to praise the Commission's proposal.
Laying down precise sales descriptions according to age at slaughter - an easier criterion to monitor than type of feed - to be used by all Member States will make it easier for consumers to understand and will prevent any possible unfair competition.
It is particularly important that the term 'veal' and other terms defined in the Commission proposal should not be used in labelling meat from animals aged over 12 months.
Another point that I consider vital is that meat imported from non-EU countries should be subject to this regulation, thus preventing any risk of unfair competition.
In common with the rapporteur, Mrs Bourzai, whom I should like to congratulate on the excellent work she has produced and on the dialogue she initiated, I believe that the Commission's proposal is a good one and that this subject has been calling out for a solution for a long time.
In addition, we both think that the letters considered by the Commission for identifying carcasses are not the most appropriate, since they may give rise to confusion with the sex of the animal.
This and other aspects of the draft regulation were improved by amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and included in the report that we are debating here.
I have to say that any possible reservations regarding particular traditions that call the new provisions into question should not be taken to the point of jeopardising the work carried out by the Commission and Parliament.
Finally, I would remind Members that the descriptions proposed by the Commission were arrived at after consultation with organisations from the various Member States, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, and that the draft regulation allows for the possibility of amending the list of descriptions in Annex II in the future.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I straightaway congratulate Mrs Bernadette Bourzai, substitute member of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whose commitment and involvement deserve special mention.
I shall also congratulate the Commission on its excellent proposal, which should bring more clarity into the marketing of calf meat and enable the consumer to be better informed.
This proposal is the result of a long process of negotiation within the Member States and the relevant professional associations to give clearer information to consumers and allow fairer competition between the different producers.
Most of the latter were actually penalised by a designation that applied to a product, veal, whose physiological development resulted in great differences within a few months because of its rapidity.
A veal calf develops, within a few weeks, from being a monogastric mammal, during the time that it feeds almost entirely on milk, to being a ruminant mammal with four stomachs as soon as it moves on to fibrous foods such as grass, hay and cereals.
It is not difficult to imagine the consequences of this development on the dietary and nutritional composition of the meat, including a different vitamin content and the white, pink or red colouring of the meat resulting from the fact, in particular, that there is no iron in milk but there is in plants.
Therefore, to treat as equal and call 'veal' meat from an animal up to the age of six or eight months that has been fed on milk and meat from an animal aged 14 to 16 months that eats, grazes and ruminates, allows neither the consumer nor the producer to determine what he is actually eating.
Within the European area, this harmonisation which makes it possible to differentiate between calf meat and that of young bovine animals, and I say this without in any way prejudging the quality of one or the other, is an important step in terms of respect for the consumer and the producers and reflects our concern for healthier and more balanced nutrition for more responsible consumers.
Mr President, Commissioner, that is a step in the right direction.
In the past, there was veal when the farmer's wife was in her confinement.
We used to call that 'fasted veal'.
It was distinguished by being white meat, because the calf had only ever drunk milk.
Then some people got the idea of penning the animals in and depriving them of natural food because the meat produced that way was considered good and expensive.
They were then fattened up to 170 to 200 kg.
Those calves still had white meat because they did not get any feed containing iron.
That is not changed by this directive.
However, because that meat fetched a particularly good price on the market, the practice was in that way indirectly supported.
If you ever saw how calves locked in their stalls started to gnaw at the gates to get something of what they really needed, then you will know what I am talking about.
Incorporating the time factor has not put an end to that, but it does now indirectly support species-appropriate animal husbandry.
Mother cows are kept at pasture, and the calves drink milk for several months but are also already eating grass, which contains iron, making their meat pink or red.
What the directive still does not contain, although it may encourage it indirectly, is the quality of animal husbandry and the process of the animals' growth.
An end - or at any rate the beginning of an end - is now put to the practice of paying a high price for meat that comes from animals that have been tortured, and we will soon have nice pink veal from happy animals.
That does not mean that the farmer's wife will no longer get white meat in her confinement, but that meat really will be from calves that have 'fasted'.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for once it is a pleasure to read Mrs Bourzai's report.
It is clear, well written, well documented and comes with a good proposal.
With the veal market, once again, we come face to face with the distortions of competition, indeed frauds, brought about by the single market in all fields.
We shall be called upon to speak about it again in relation to wine, Commissioner, with countries that have a land registry and others that do not, with the composition of wines that can vary depending on the country while the description remains the same.
There is also the area of VAT, with the intracommunity frauds that the single market allows, with fiscal dumping and our Baltic friends who benefit from their 'flat tax', to give themselves an advantage.
There is, of course, the veal market, where, if there is not fraud, there is unfair competition.
Forgive me, Mr President, but they say that our Spanish or Danish friends have old calves more than eight, nine or ten months old, sort of grandfather calves, that they still call 'veal'.
Obviously, with a price difference of two or three euros on leaving the abattoir, according to whether it is a real calf or an extremely old grandfather calf, it is sure that the added value can be extremely profitable, even though 800 000 tonnes of calves are not all involved - thank God! - since 80% of the production and 70% of the consumption takes place in countries that have harmonised the definition of veal or of vitellone.
The distortion of competition is, therefore, limited, but it does exist.
Commissioner, after almost 20 years in Parliament, for once I congratulate the Commission, which proves that you should never give up hope about anything.
The system that has been proposed to us is excellent.
First of all defining the age of veal according to a fixed limit of more or less than eight months old is very clear, just as it is very clear to distinguish them by two letters, X and Y. In this respect, there was an ambiguity, hormonal or sexual or something, and the rapporteur did well to propose the letter V as veal and the letter Z as, we do not quite know what, but it is better.
Providing for a system of penalties is excellent and extending the legislation to meat based preserves, that is very good.
Excluding AOCs and IGPs, everyone can only be delighted about that.
After all, Mr President, Commissioner, perhaps all that offers us a good example: if one could define right or left wing politicians according to their age, according to their diet, according to whether they are monogastric or according to whether they are mammals, it would make it easier for electors to know whether they are dealing with a left wing calf or a right wing calf.
Maybe our rapporteur is proposing this as an avenue for us to explore.
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to welcome the Commission's proposal as well as the report prepared by Mrs Bourzai.
By supporting the Commission's proposal as modified by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's report, we can put an end to the further spread of the abuse of competitive advantages stemming from inadequacies in regulation as well as of confusing market information about beef.
Unfortunately, the diversity of regulations used in Member States provides opportunities for abuses, and therefore in numerous cases there have been requests for clarification of the definition of 'veal' and for its harmonisation among various States.
Since the manner of producing and marketing the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less varies from one country to the next, therefore the finished manufactured products can also differ significantly amongst each other.
As a result, they come to market under different names and their selling prices can also differ significantly among each other.
I consider important the Council's proposed directive appearing on the agenda of this sitting, which is to regulate the market and provide more precise consumer information than is presently available.
In this way we will be able to rule out market distortions in marketing, and provide the opportunity to solve the resulting problems with nation-wide measures.
The harmonisation and identification of trade names in the various Member States can contribute to market transparency.
In addition, we would thereby make it possible for consumers to be properly informed about meat originating in any Member State.
At a later stage we will need to devote attention as well to ensuring that the end users receive information on the trade names that will be introduced, especially if this would differ in a Member State from the customary and commonly used names.
Those who stand to gain most from such harmonisation processes are the consumers and the manufacturers, since a transparent system of labelling offers a higher level of consumer protection and more reliable control.
It is precisely for this reason that I would like once more to welcome the systematic effort shown by the Commission here and in similar matters, to create appropriate regulations, and I would like in particular once again to congratulate Mrs Bourzai for her report.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I am grateful for the contributions made to this debate towards finding a solution on how to label these bovine animals of less than 12 months.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf called them 'happy animals'.
As I said at the outset, the majority of these amendments should not create any difficulties.
I think we are all along the same lines in trying to simplify our legislation as much as possible without jeopardising the system.
However, there are amendments that cannot be accepted.
This is the case for Amendments 2, 11 and 16 in particular, concerning the display of information on commercial documents.
This would put an additional burden on the sector.
Similarly, Amendments 1 and 9, regarding the extension of the field of application to cover cooked products, are not indispensable.
Finally, Amendments 8 and 21 would not clarify the approval procedure for PDOs and PGIs and would also overly complicate the amendment procedure of the different annexes in the proposal.
With regard to Amendment 12, aimed at marketing the use of sale descriptions established for meat of the second category of these animals -those between 8 and 12 months - I am prepared to try to find a solution with the ministers on the usefulness of this option.
Finally, even if this bovine issue has been a difficult one, I think we would face even more severe difficulties to try to find a label for Mr Martinez!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) For ten years now, different initiatives have been taken to harmonise the rules for marketing of meat from cattle aged less than 12 months, without success.
Until now, France and other Member States that favoured the quality of meat by fixing the age of cattle at time of slaughter at less than eight months and by feeding them on milk were disadvantaged by the lack of harmonisation in relation to the designation of veal.
The consumer could be misled, because two meats that were different in age, taste and quality could bear the same description and the same labelling.
I am very pleased, therefore, that we have at last found a compromise, and, what is more, a compromise that has not been reached at the expense of tradition, nor of quality.
Indeed, this report takes into account considerations linked with the internal market but respects traditions, by preserving IGPs (protected geographical indications) and AOCs (registered designations of origin).
I am glad to see that Europe is not only concerned with the safety standards, which beef and veal meet, and that these difficulties have been overcome.
It remained to promote the quality and the information for the consumer, which is the purpose of the report on which we are voting today.
Ratification of the ILO's 2006 Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention (debate)
The next item is the report by Mary Lou McDonald, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision authorising the Member States to ratify, in the interests of the European Community, the 2006 Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation C6-0241/2006.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the International Labour Organisation has adopted the ambitious Maritime Labour Convention, which lays down minimum standards for working conditions on board: employment conditions, accommodation conditions, social security protection and welfare, not forgetting provisions for implementation.
The added value of this Convention, a real beginning for a code for international maritime labour, lies in that it makes the existing standards more effective, that it adapts them to globalisation, and above all that it makes it possible to increase the number of ratifications by States.
The Commission, like the ILO (International Labour Organisation), considers that the goal of a level playing field is fundamental.
We are convinced that the Maritime Labour Convention will contribute to that, eliminate shipping that does not respect minimum standards and make careers at sea more attractive.
The Convention must, however, be ratified speedily in order to produce these positive effects.
A decision authorising Member States to ratify the Convention is legally required given that the ILO's current rules do not allow the Community as such to ratify the text, even if it includes provisions that fall within the competence of the Community.
In order to avoid delaying the ratification procedures, the Commission has endeavoured to present its proposal for a decision hard on the heels of the adoption of the Convention.
In its proposal, the Commission anticipates the principle of authorisation to ratify and suggests 31 December 2008 as the target date for depositing the instruments of ratification.
Consequently, the Commission wishes to retain a strong wording on the commitment to ratify the Convention and rejects any editing that could weaken this principle.
Mrs McDonald, I should like to thank you and to give you my full support for your report, which upholds the target date of 2008.
Taking into account the level of European standards, one may think that third countries will be much more affected by the Convention coming into force than the Member States, who already apply more exacting standards.
When the Convention comes into force it will reduce the disparities between the standards of most of the third countries and those of the Community, which should encourage fairer conditions for competition.
Whole sections of the Convention are already covered by equivalent provisions in Community law.
Member States, therefore, will not have to review their legislation entirely and will be able to accelerate ratification.
The Commission can understand the internal constraints of Member States and, in this context, can be more flexible about the time limit, but on the principle of a definite time limit without conditions attached.
It would be very sad to lose the momentum we had during the negotiations in Geneva by weakening the principle of depositing the instruments of ratification.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your attention and once again I give my thanks to Mrs McDonald.
rapporteur. - Mr President, 'the ILO Maritime Labour Convention is the best thing that has ever been developed in the maritime labour field.'
These are not my words, but the words of Dierk Lindemann, who was the spokesperson for shipowners during the negotiations on the Convention.
The Convention brings together 65 previous ILO conventions into one consolidated document.
It sets minimum requirements for seafarers, with provisions on employment conditions and recruitment, working hours, wage protection, leave and repatriation, accommodation, recreation, food and catering, health and medical care, welfare and social security.
It will immeasurably improve the conditions of the millions of workers in this sector worldwide.
Because the maritime industry is global, it is important that global standards be adopted in order to limit the negative effects of globalisation, in particular social dumping.
The Convention, when ratified, will apply to all ships, even those flagged by countries which have not individually ratified.
It will shift the behaviour pattern of the whole industry by creating minimum standards, avoiding social dumping.
Immediately following its adoption in February 2006, Chris Horrocks, Secretary-General of the International Shipping Federation, said, 'This landmark decision is just the beginning.
Now we have to ensure that every government ratifies this Convention as soon as possible and applies it in full.'
In July 2006, the European Community Shipowners' Association and the European Transport Workers' Federation confirmed their full support for the Convention in a letter to EU transport ministers.
In their letter, they strongly recommend that Member States ratify the Convention and engage in processes to that end as soon as possible.
The representative of the ILO, Cleopatra Doumbia-Henry, speaking at the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, where it was discussed, said that a delay in ratification could slow down the extraordinary momentum which has built up in support of the Convention.
Strong words indeed for a representative of the ILO!
The Commission, having invested much in the negotiations on the Convention and ensuring that it was compatible with EU law, is also on record as supporting ratification of the Convention by the end of 2008.
Ratification by that date would enable the Convention to enter into force by 2009, almost ten years after negotiations began.
It seems to me that the only people who do not want the Convention to be ratified by 2008 are the Member States, who want, in their own words, 'to make efforts to ratify the Convention, preferably before 31 December 2010'.
The reality is that without the Convention, shipping in Europe will find it difficult to compete, as it is increasingly being undercut by ships flying flags of convenience.
I would urge Members to endorse the Convention overwhelmingly and, in adopting this report, send a message to the Member States that the shipping industry, and particularly workers within that industry, cannot wait.
Member States should stop dragging their feet and ratify this Convention speedily.
I should like to make some additional remarks about other measures that could be undertaken by the EU.
The Commission's excellent communication on strengthening maritime labour standards provides a good starting point, and I hope that my report makes some small contribution to doing just that.
The EU needs to look at areas not fully covered by the Convention and, in particular, the regulation of recruitment agencies.
The EU should look at how to strengthen, complement or extend the standards of the ILO Convention and to go further in protecting the rights and interests of seafarers.
The EU should look at adopting measures to reduce the risks of different interpretations of the Convention between EU Member States.
Proposals should be brought forward to allow for family-friendly facilities to be available on ships.
The EU should try to enforce minimum employment standards and wages for all vessels operating in its waters and, in particular, I would say that the Commission should retable the proposal for an EU ferries directive.
However, the first and the most important step is the ratification of this ILO Maritime Labour Convention.
There is no time to be wasted in this matter and there can be no delay.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (EL) Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur on her work and to welcome the fact that we are very close to signing the Maritime Labour Convention, which both safeguards social rights and decent living conditions for seafarers and promotes careers at sea, because with education and by organising labour, we can safeguard the necessary quality in maritime labour, which the European Union needs for its competitiveness.
Apart from the quality of work of our seafarers, careers at sea may become more attractive, which we welcome, given the need for seafarers for the competitiveness of our shipping industry.
This convention is also very important for global shipping, because certain standards for the organisation of maritime labour will be applied uniformly.
Today the various states apply fragmentary provisions already in existence through this convention but, apart from that, conditions of healthy competition are also safeguarded; with the clause precluding more favourable treatment, protection will be provided to the fleets of the states that ratify the convention, thereby preventing social dumping, to which the rapporteur referred just now and which is unfair to our seafarers and shipping companies, given that, as things stand, numerous companies already have the opportunity to recruit seafarers from countries with no social standards of the level which the international convention wishes to impose and to which the European Union aspires.
The other important issue is that it introduces the maritime labour certificate and the maritime labour declaration.
This system comes under the control of the port state, in which case it is possible for ships to be inspected and detained in the event of doubt as to whether these standards are being complied with.
I believe that the principles that we wish to disseminate throughout the world, over and above the application to our political entity, are expressed in this convention and it is a good thing that all the Member States are endeavouring to ratify it soon.
In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we had amendments for deferral to 2010, because we know that there is not the same type of ratification in the various Member States and we believe that it would be possible for sufficient time to be allowed to prepare such ratification properly.
In any event, the prevailing opinion is that we must have completed the procedures by 2008, meaning that we need to hurry up and set a good example of proper integration and application, starting in the European Union.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, I congratulate Mrs McDonald, because with her report the European Parliament is agreeing to the Council's proposal to authorise the Member States to ratify the International Labour Organisation Convention on Maritime Labour in the interest of the European Union.
Thus it is acknowledging how important it is for the status of seafarers to be safeguarded within the framework of globalisation and for exploitative practices to be prevented.
It also safeguards the existence of a Community regime coordinating the social insurance systems.
In ratifying the convention, the Member States will primarily be strengthening the global social framework, because they are aiming for decent conditions worldwide.
We consider it necessary to strengthen maritime safety, so that careers at sea attract young Europeans and so that 17 000 vacancies for Community seafarers can be filled, especially vacancies for bridge and engine officers.
This is an opportunity, Commissioner, for us to emphasise how very important it is to strengthen maritime education and the pan-European campaign for career guidance in careers at sea.
Current progress in technology allows direct daily contact between seafarers and their families and complements safe working conditions.
A campaign to attract people to careers at sea should include employment prospects for disabled seafarers in activities on shore or parallel alternative employment between sea and shore.
We also need to strengthen maritime jobseekers offices, so that there is optimum management of the available workforce.
It is a good thing that, at European level, social dialogue is to start between seafarers and shipowners and we hope that it will result in agreement.
The proper application of the ILO international convention also makes provision for monitoring by a tripartite committee with the participation of representatives of shipowners, seafarers and the state.
Finally, I would remind you that the European Commission quite rightly withdrew the proposal for minimum employment standards and wages for seafarers working on its waters in 2001.
Plans for equal treatment of Community and non Community seafarers are good, but in practice a Community directive on car ferries cannot be applied as all voyages are international.
We call on the European Commission to be especially careful when it comes to the compatibility of its proposals with the international law of the sea.
Mr President, I also welcome the report and indeed I welcome the work which Ms McDonald has put into this issue.
There is no doubt whatsoever that this consolidated Convention on the working conditions of seafarers is an extremely important step forward.
It is an attempt to bring up to date some conventions which go back as far as 1920, and it seeks to put in place some global standards which hopefully will lead to more humane conditions on board ships.
As has already been pointed out, however, even the higher minimum standards which the Convention will set out will still not reach the standards for employees and employment in the various EU Member States.
It is regrettable, therefore, that EU Member States are resisting a rapid ratification of this particular Convention.
In my view, it is part of the race to the bottom which many Member States have resisted.
For instance in Ireland, there was the manning of ferries directive, and the experience was that Irish Ferries sought to sack their entire staff and subsequently employ cheaper labour at less than half the legal minimum wage rate in Ireland.
In conclusion, I think that the blocking of the manning of ferries directive and the attempt to slow down the ratification of this Convention is symptomatic of some Member States' attitudes.
I agree with everything that Ms McDonald has said with regard to the need for Europe-wide regulation.
However, I say to her that in order to make this regulation, we need QMV in this area of work, which we do not have at present.
In order to get QMV we need the proposed European Constitution and I suggest that Ms McDonald ought to review her opposition to that Constitution if we are serious about making progress as regards implementing common labour standards across Europe.
(FR) Mr President, we are currently in the middle of the Erika trial.
The Erika case is typical of those disasters that are avoidable but that nonetheless happen because the gains of a handful of individuals must necessarily take precedence over everything.
That is the outcome of liberal logic, of profit pushed to the extreme, according to which, for the sake of making a few euros more, everything is permitted, including disregarding the most elementary safety rules to the point of catastrophe.
It is this same logic that we have seen at work in the miserably famous case of Irish Ferries, which soon will have nothing Irish about it except its name. In the name of profit, the entire staff complement of a company, which is nonetheless operating correctly, can be thrown overboard.
Again it is this same logic that pushes some shipowners carrying out intracommunity cabotage to operate ships with insufficient crew and in conditions that put both the crew and shipping as a whole at risk.
These miserable working conditions go so far as to jeopardise seafaring traditions and expertise because the image they give of the sector is such that it has become more and more difficult to recruit European seamen.
Of course, this pursuit of profit is never mentioned.
It is better to put forward the argument of international competition, which is essentially Asian and obviously unfair, to justify these practices, even when this competition does not exist.
Has anyone ever seen Chinese companies operating ferries in the Baltic or in the Channel?
There is no question of denying this competition.
It does affect part of the sector and it also has its merits, but it must be controlled and it must be fair.
It is possible to choose the basis on which it should operate. And if, sadly, social dumping is a reality in the maritime sector, it is not inevitable.
There are, of course, those who accept it and seek to profit from it, but one can also reject it by pushing for a general rise in social standards in the world as a whole so that, in the end, everyone can find themselves on an equal footing in terms of international competition.
That is, as you will have realised, the way that I would like Europe to go.
In Europe, as we know, competitiveness will not be achieved through minimising costs and lowering social standards.
It can only be achieved through quality.
The quality of vessels, the quality of crews, safeguarded by means of decent working and training conditions.
The ILO Convention that is being discussed this evening offers us the opportunity to make that choice.
It does not solve all of the problems, but it represents a step forward.
And it offers European shipowners and the Member States an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to defending certain values enshrined in the European Union and in its social model.
On signing it in February 2006, they were signing a statement of intent in that regard.
We now expect them to move on to actions.
As far as shipowners are concerned, I can only welcome the fact that they have given their firm and willing commitment to entering into social, European dialogue, with their trade union partners, with a view to signing, by the end of the year, a collective European agreement that would include the relevant provisions of this Convention.
An initial cycle of negotiations has ended today and the climate seems very constructive.
This is a good thing and I think that we can also welcome the constructive role played by the European Commission in facilitating this process.
As for the Member States, they hold the key to bringing this Convention into force.
It has been said, if the European Union and the European Free Trade Association ratify it, then the Convention will come into effect and will apply everywhere.
If Europe ratifies speedily, other nations will follow, and Europe will have been the driving force, in showing that another way, apart from exploitation and dumping, is possible, and that competition can go together with responsibility.
It is essential, therefore, if we believe in the unique quality of the European model, to see to it that this Convention is ratified speedily.
It is also essential to keep to the target date of the end of 2008 proposed by the ILO.
Mr President, first I shall again thank Mrs McDonald.
I should also like to say that the ILO Convention is an initial response.
By raising working standards, its effect will be to allow fairer competition.
In addition, the Commission has undertaken a very in-depth study on the ferries sector.
The Commission will assess subsequently whether a new proposal for a directive on this subject would be relevant and appropriate.
I would like also to say that we are aware that the target date of December 2008 is ambitious, but it is realistic.
The ILO has worked out a plan of action that relies on the Maritime Labour Convention coming into force in 2010 and, at the latest, in 2011.
The Commission, in proposing the depositing of instruments of ratification before the end of 2008, guarantees that Member States will be in line with this timescale.
Taking into account the ILO's own rules, if Member States deposit their instruments of ratification at the end of 2008 at the latest, the Convention would come into force before the beginning of 2010.
You see, therefore, that it is essential that we stick to that date.
I shall also answer Mr Navarro and Mrs Panayotopoulos.
Alongside the European Parliament's work in relation to the opinion on the draft decision authorising ratification of the Convention, the social partners have come together to negotiate a possible joint agreement on the basis of this same Convention.
I would remind you that the method of joint dialogue is a good thing for the European Union and it is true that I myself had the opportunity to express to the social partners, that is, both the shipowners and the unions, my wish to see them sign an agreement on this Convention.
The social partners who have the existing text do not have to renegotiate it but rather to select the relevant provisions to add to Community law.
It seems now as if the prospect of a joint agreement by the end of 2007 is really plausible.
As soon as it has an agreement from the social partners, the Commission will propose a directive to ensure that the provisions of the agreement will be respected in the whole of Europe.
Thanks to Parliament, we can expect the necessary ratification of the Convention and, thanks to the social partners, we have a joint agreement that will make it possible to speedily introduce the new provisions into European law.
I think that in this way we shall have worked well together for seafarers' conditions and for a very important social advance, which will encourage, as you pointed out just now, the recruitment of young seamen, seamen whom the European Union needs in order to develop its maritime transport.
I warmly thank Parliament, Mr President, for its extremely determined action in support of this great Convention.
I am happy to see that Europe is leading the movement and, in some way, helping to advance that globalisation with a human face that we need.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs McDonald.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Annex - Commission Position
McDonald Report
The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2 and 3.
Written statement (Rule 142)
in writing. - (ET) Maritime fields of activity provide work for 5 million people in the European Union.
The Baltic Sea is our inland sea, the Mediterranean and Black Seas hold a central position in our foreign policy, and the Northern Dimension expands our area of responsibility to Arctic waters.
It is time we began to see the European Union also as a union of maritime states, and took a corresponding position in the world.
My homeland, Estonia, has been a maritime country for centuries.
Ernest Hemingway noted that one could find an Estonian in every port in the world.
In the last ten years, however, we have lost 57% of jobs in shipping.
Cargo ships have begun to operate under flags of convenience, and the people employed on them come from third countries that are willing to accept poorer working conditions.
In total, there is a shortage of 17 000 people in European maritime transport.
This is mainly due to the poor working conditions that prevail in this area.
We cannot permit the elimination of maritime-related jobs, especially when that leads to a reduction in the standards of maritime labour.
We cannot withdraw from a strategic sector that guarantees 90% of the world's shipping and 40% of shipping within the European Union.
The ratification of standards for maritime work by our Member States would be a great step forward towards making those standards more universally accepted.
By helping to create fair competition in the global shipping business, we would essentially also be achieving the objectives of the Lisbon process by raising the European Union's competitiveness on the seas.
Competitive advantage that has been obtained at the expense of human life and health cannot be justified by any economic considerations.
Standards that are dangerous to seamen and nature have no place in the 21st century.
Illegal bird hunting in Malta (debate)
The next item is the oral question (Î-0013/2007) by Marcin Libicki, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, to the Commission on illegal bird hunting in Malta (Î6-0015/2007).
author. - (PL) Madam President, I chair the Committee on Petitions.
For quite some time now, this committee has been dealing with the issue of reprehensible hunting of birds on Malta.
We have received a petition from a number of bird protection associations with a combined membership of several hundred thousand individuals.
This hunting activity is reprehensible for three reasons.
Firstly, because it takes place in the spring.
Secondly, because traps are used.
Thirdly, because it is done from motorboats on the sea.
There is very strong opposition to the hunting and the Committee on Petitions has recently received two thick volumes detailing the latest infringements of the principles on which hunting is supposed to be conducted.
As you can see, there is a photograph of an osprey on the cover.
The osprey is an endangered bird in Europe, yet it is being hunted and killed in Malta.
It should be borne in mind that the hunting expeditions described only target migrating birds.
This is because no birds spend any length of time on Malta.
These are all birds that fly enormous distances, often from southern Africa up to northern Europe or back.
They land on Malta simply to rest a short while, only to die at the hands of the hunters.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have ascertained that most of the inhabitants of Malta are opposed to this hunting.
The Committee on Petitions undertook a special fact finding mission to Malta last year to report on the situation.
We formed the impression that only a small proportion of the population is involved in hunting.
These people are, however, drawn from many different political parties and therefore enjoy the support of various politicians on both sides of the political divide.
This means that although the hunting fraternity is only a small minority, it is in a strong position because it knows all the political parties will protect its interests.
In other words, all the parties are prepared to back these hunters who are intent on killing birds.
We have learnt recently that the government now wishes to grant licences for spring hunting once again.
It is the spring hunts that have the most detrimental effect on Malta's bird population, and in fact on the bird population of the whole of Europe because migratory birds are involved, as I said earlier.
The repercussions are felt by bird populations across the whole continent.
Malta is actually the least affected as no birds are permanently resident there.
Accordingly, I have addressed a question to the European Commission.
The substance of the question is as follows. Despite the fact that the Commission has opened proceedings against Malta for failing to meet its obligations and despite the recommendation made by the Committee on Petitions following its fact finding mission in May of last year, the Government of Malta is preparing to award licences for hunting wild birds in the spring of 2007.
This is consistent with the practice adopted by Malta every year since its accession to the European Union in 2004. The question is: what urgent action does the European Commission intend to take to convince the Maltese authorities to impose an effective ban on hunting wild birds, especially in the spring migration season?
It should be remembered that many of these birds are threatened with extinction, including predators such as the osprey.
How does the Commission intend to oblige the Government of Malta to honour the commitments it entered into?
How does it intend to ensure that the directive on wild birds is adopted and suitably implemented in Malta?
I look forward to your response, Commissioner, as does the Committee on Petitions and indeed the whole House.
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Libicki for giving me an opportunity to formulate the Commission's position on bird hunting in Malta.
This is a question of compliance with Community law.
The directive on the conservation of wild birds clearly bans the hunting of migratory birds returning to their rearing grounds, as contained in Annex ÎÎ to the directive.
As Mr Libicki also said, this spring hunting is the worst form of hunting.
Article 9 of the directive makes provision for the facility for derogation on the part of the Member States.
Nonetheless, this facility only applies under exceptional circumstances, subject to compliance with the very strict criteria laid down in that article. In such cases, there is basically only a facility to derogate if there is no other satisfactory solution.
In 2004, the Maltese Government decided to exercise the right to apply a derogation for hunting quail and turtle doves during their spring migration.
Nonetheless, according to information passed to the Commission by the Maltese authorities, the derogation in question does not appear to comply with the preconditions laid down in the Birds Directive.
More importantly, the Maltese authorities were unable to substantiate that there was no other satisfactory solution or that spring hunting was being carried out under conditions of strict surveillance.
For these reasons, the Commission came to the conclusion that the derogation for 2004 was in breach of Articles 7 and 9 of the Birds Directive.
In July 2006, infringement proceedings were started in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty and the Commission has not yet received an official response from the Maltese authorities.
The matter under discussion concerns the derogation for the year 2004.
Nonetheless, the Commission knows that Malta allowed spring hunting during the following years also, in other words in 2005 and 2006, and it would appear that it allowed it during this year, in 2007.
The continuation of spring hunting in all these years, in breach of legislation, constitutes a systematic case of poor application of the Birds Directive.
For this reason, in order to extend the subject of the current infringement proceedings, we intend to send the Maltese authorities a supplementary warning letter about what is now standard practice on the part of the Maltese authorities over the years since 2004.
The Commission decision is expected to be taken at its meeting on 21 March.
If Malta does not comply with the Birds Directive, the Commission will pursue the legal proceedings provided for to the end.
Despite this, we have not yet reached this stage and I still hope that the Maltese authorities will comply with Community legislation.
Within the limits of its competence, the Commission is taking and will continue to take the necessary measures, so that Malta, like every other Member State, complies with the Birds Directive.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (MT) I would like to begin by reminding everybody present in this House, and in particular the Commissioner, that, during the negotiations between Malta and the European Union, the European Commission recognised in writing that, following accession to the European Union, Malta would make use of a derogation to allow spring hunting.
In fact, here in front of me I have the document dated 27 September 2002, proving this.
The Commission is well aware that the negotiations with Malta were not easy because the decision on whether or not Malta should accede was one that concerned the whole country, yet, even so, Malta did not pursue its right to a derogation capriciously.
I do not, therefore, expect the Commissioner to come here and say, on the first occasion that Malta applies to make use of its derogation, 'now you cannot use it'.
How can the Commission have accepted in writing the use of a derogation during the negotiations and then, the first time it is to be used, say that this is not allowed?
Moreover, how can the Commission say that there are alternatives to spring hunting?
Why was this not said during the negotiations?
These are the answers we expect from you, Commissioner.
I thoroughly agree with you that this derogation does not give hunters free rein, and I would like to inform you of a few measures that Malta is taking to deal with those who violate the hunting rules.
First of all, only two species are allowed to be hunted in the spring.
Before Malta's accession, 32 species were allowed to be hunted at that time of year; so we have reduced the number from thirty-two to two.
Secondly, the spring hunting season has been shortened by 18 days.
The third and most important point is that the penalties for those who break the rules have been increased to a fine of â¬ 14 000, two years imprisonment and the permanent confiscation of hunting licences for repeat offenders; in other words, the second time round they are shown the red flag and sent off.
I hope that the Commission acknowledges that these are positive steps forward.
Unfortunately, the Commissioner has made no reference to them.
So let us condemn abuse of the rules, but those who do not break the rules should not be placed in the same camp as offenders.
That is why I am opposed to those who, at the other extreme entirely, would like to ban hunting altogether.
Moreover, and to conclude, the Commission must be careful, despite intense political pressure, not to ignore what was agreed on during the negotiations.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Commissioner, as a Belgian Socialist Member of the European Parliament, taking part in this evening's debate means a great deal to me, not least because this debate is being held in response to a petition by the Belgian Royal Association for the Protection of Birds, which collected more than 20 000 signatures on the subject of the bird hunt on Malta.
This really is an international problem.
In Malta, thousands of migratory birds are shot dead or captured every year.
This is particularly bad since Malta is one of the few resting places for migratory birds when they cross the Mediterranean.
After all, what is the use of European countries investing money and energy in protective measures in the framework of the Habitat and Bird Directive if those self-same birds are shot dead on their journey in other countries?
To my Maltese opposite numbers, I should like to say that, although it is true that Malta has acquired, until 2008, a number of transitional measures in the accession treaty, these measures only pertain to the capture of birds with a view to breeding them for the purpose of preserving the species.
These amount, in other words, to animal protection measures.
Under no circumstances does this transitional measure allow for migratory bird hunting in the spring.
In its notification, the Commission has made it clear that Malta is, in this case, riding roughshod over the Bird Directive, and that exceptions cannot be made for it.
Moreover, Mr Libicki's report of June 2006 of the inquiry task force of the Committee on Petitions denounces the way in which migratory birds are hunted down on a large scale, and concludes that the derogation from the Bird Directive, which Malta decided on off its own bat, should lapse.
I therefore think that it is of the utmost importance for this House to support the Commission in the procedure and to convince Malta to respect the Birds Directive and therefore not allow migratory bird hunting to take place this spring.
This case could, in fact, prove vital should the Birds Directive be found to be being infringed elsewhere in the European Union.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, we are dealing with an issue that is very important in terms of protecting the environment, but also in terms of ensuring the proper application of Community law.
Today we are practically in the spring and hunting is still going on in Malta.
Illegal hunters have taken over a significant portion of the country's territory.
The Directive on wild birds is blatantly being violated while the Maltese authorities remain entirely passive.
The hunters, protected by the government, are even resorting to violence.
Three Maltese journalists have been hospitalised after being brutally attacked by hunters while simply doing their jobs alongside people who were protesting against this illegal practice.
However, the majority of Maltese society is opposed to spring hunting.
According to a recent poll, more than 80% of Maltese people are against this illegal practice.
Even Malta's hotel and restaurant owners are against it, because they say that it is bad for tourism and bad for the economy.
Why is the Maltese Government determined to protect this illegal and barbaric practice?
Only the Maltese 'Democratic Alternative' party - the Greens - is defending Community law in Malta.
The Maltese Government is demonstrating a scandalous lack of adherence to the European Treaty that it signed very recently, before joining the European Union.
How can that be?
We call upon the Commission to act firmly and decisively in the face of this challenge to Community law.
(MT) The resolution before us today threatens to set a very serious and dangerous precedent.
It suggests that an agreement already approved by the European Union, this Parliament and the Maltese people in a referendum and general election should be broken.
This resolution has implications beyond support for, or opposition to, hunting because, if it goes through, we will then be sending out the message to all Europeans that the European Union does not keep its word.
Resolutions of this kind undermine the credibility of the European institutions.
What guarantee do we have, as Maltese, that the European Union will keep its word regarding the rest of the negotiations?
What guarantee does any European have that the European Union will continue to honour the outcome of the negotiations carried out with his or her country?
Parliament's political groups have every right to put forward their agendas.
However, this has to take place within the correct parameters, and no agreement can be broken for the simple reason that there are some people with different political agendas.
If there is anyone opposed to illegal hunting, that person is myself.
I am also the first to condemn the violent acts that took place in the protest march in Malta.
However, if we are going to talk about barbaric acts committed in European Union countries, I need only mention what goes on in Spain or Italy, which are examples of countries elsewhere in the European Union in which illegal hunting takes place.
I therefore say, let us fight illegal hunting in the European Union by all means, but let us fight it in the whole of the European Union and not just pick on Malta.
What was promised to us during the negotiations must remain valid, and I urge all my fellow Members, including those who are not members of my political group, to commit themselves to protecting that which, by right, belongs to the European citizen.
I would like to quote my fellow Member, Mr Schultz, Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament who, this very morning, albeit in a different context, stated that we must honour every agreement that we sign.
This must also apply in Malta's case.
We must therefore respect what was agreed on.
(MT) We believe that all the Member States' governments, including Malta's, are obliged to ensure that environmental regulations, including those on hunting, conform to the Union's directives, accession treaties and every other treaty that was signed.
We also agree that the authorities' duty is to ensure that these directives and laws are observed by everyone, and we cannot in any way condone the practice of illegal hunting.
To this end, one of the amendments proposed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament requests a more transparent approach and proposes that the Commission and the Maltese Government publish their technical positions on the subject, including the minutes of the decisions taken in meetings that have taken place or that will take place.
This becomes more relevant if one recalls that, before Malta's accession to the European Union, the Maltese Government had stated that, together with the European Commission, it had negotiated a derogation regarding the issue of spring hunting.
Although other political forces and the civil society sector had expressed serious concerns regarding the Maltese government's interpretation of the use of this derogation, the European Commission chose, for reasons known only to itself, to keep silent and adopt an ambiguous stance.
Unfortunately, this has only added to further confusion over the matter.
Had there, at the time, been more transparency on both sides, this would have led to less ambivalence and less likelihood of Maltese society being unjustly burdened with financial repercussions.
This is also a credibility issue.
(MT) It is clearer than ever before that the Maltese Government deceived environmentalists, hunters and trappers when, prior to Malta's accession to the European Union, it tried to give the impression that it had managed to achieve everything for everyone.
Environmental regulations have to conform to the directives of the European Union and to the terms of the accession treaty.
This is clear and we, for our part, have been stressing this for a long time.
The Maltese Government, I repeat, has misled the people.
However, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, before you nod in agreement, it must be said that the blame is partly yours.
Before the referendum took place, when the Maltese Government went around proclaiming loudly that it had an agreement with you regarding spring hunting, you chose to keep quiet.
When the Labour Party, ourselves and a few environmentalist and hunting associations expressed doubts about this so-called achievement, you remained silent - although many of you had been to Malta.
The least the Maltese government and the Commission can do now is to publish their technical positions because it is not enough simply to claim that everything that was discussed was made public.
There are certain documents that, up to this day, we cannot find, search as we may.
There are references to them, but it is like trying to tackle an enormous maze.
These documents must be made available to everyone, and the minutes of every meeting, past and future, must be published, including those of the recent meeting in Brussels, from which everyone emerged claiming victory.
I simply cannot understand how everybody can emerge victorious from the same meeting.
Ultimately, however, if these minutes are not published, then those who have been misleading people will continue to do so.
(MT) Undoubtedly, even now, the Commission is clearly stating that there is a breach of European law.
My fellow Members from the other party are claiming that there is a letter stating that the government can make use of a derogation.
It is therefore little wonder that everybody is feeling rather confused, considering that we are only a handful of people in this House and yet we cannot agree on the facts.
As my two colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament pointed out, there is a need for more transparency and, at the very least, a need to agree on the facts.
The problem is that, in actual fact, there is ambiguity and confusion.
However, this was not caused accidentally.
Rather, I believe that this state of affairs has remained muddled because, although, for hunters and trappers, hunting is a passion and, for BirdLife Malta, it is the subject of a mission, at the end of the day it is a political issue.
It is about who will get the votes from those sectors that could actually decide the outcome of a referendum or a general election.
Like my fellow Members who spoke before me, I therefore ask that the facts of the negotiation agreements between Malta and Europe be set out and explained as clearly as possible and in such a way that all the parties involved are aware of them.
To conclude, I would like to say that, if we cannot even agree on the facts, there is little hope of our agreeing on a solution to the problem.
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Madam President, even though votes have wings and fly from one party to another, I am interested in the question of illegal hunting rather than in the question of votes.
I think that it is impossible that the honourable members do not know the answers to the questions they have already asked.
They know that whatever has been agreed for the integration of countries into the European Union is public knowledge.
There are no secret agreements and I am certain that the honourable members know this full well, because they have been in the European Parliament for two years now.
Consequently, I cannot understand exactly what these secret documents are.
There is no mystery here.
Everything that has been agreed is public knowledge.
For Malta it was agreed that there would be a transitional period on the question of bird trapping.
There is no agreement on anything else.
As far as the derogations are concerned, the right to request a derogation is granted in Article 9 to all the Member States.
Malta too can request a derogation under the provisions of Article 9.
Malta did not request a derogation, it simply made a derogation on its own, we took it to Court and we have been waiting for it to respond since July 2006.
It has still not sent us a reply.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes the active intervention of Parliament's Committee on Petitions.
The visit by the members of the Committee on Petitions to Malta in May 2006 was fruitful and the report on the visit confirms that, in this instance, the Commission and the European Parliament are of the same opinion.
The Commission used the infringement procedure because the Maltese authorities are still allowing spring hunting, in breach of Community legislation.
Malta is clearly behaving in breach.
It started with the derogation in the 2004 hunting season and continued in subsequent years and, to all appearances, it is continuing this year.
For the Commission, the priority is to prevent systematic and generalised infringement of Community legislation on birds.
That is why we intend - as I said earlier - to extend the existing infringement proceedings pending for the 2004 case to the general infringing practices of Malta.
In this way, we shall be in a position to address and prevent future infringements; this will happen at the Commission meeting on 21 March.
As far as the present situation is concerned, on 28, 29 and 30 March a Commission delegation will travel to Malta to discuss the case in greater detail.
Explanations will be requested from the competent national authorities and it will be made clear to them that they must comply with Community legislation without delay.
If the Maltese authorities stick to their guns, the Commission will proceed to the next state of the procedure, which is to issue a reasoned opinion, and it will be able to take recourse to the Court of Justice straight afterwards.
The procedure which the Commission can follow - for any case, I am not just talking about Malta - is, within the framework of the main referral and, once the reasoned opinion has been issued in accordance with Article 228, to seek an injunction ordering the Member State to stop its infringing behaviour.
The Court may issue an injunction if it finds that there is an urgent need to prevent irreparable damage as a result of blatant infringement of Community law for which there is prima facie evidence.
In Malta's case, the Commission would have been unable to seek an injunction before now, without first extending - as I said earlier it was going to do - the subject of the 2004 case so that it also covered subsequent years (2005, 2006 and, possibly, 2007).
The Court would have dismissed the request, given that the risk of irreparable damage would already have passed.
The application for an injunction would have been dead letter, given that it would have only referred to the infringement in 2004.
It is for precisely this reason - from a legal point of view and in order to prevent future infringements - that we felt it advisable that the current proceedings should be extended at the Commission meeting on 21 March.
I trust that, with the visit by senior officials from the Environment DG, the Maltese authorities will be persuaded to comply fully with the provisions of Community legislation.
I have received seven motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 108 (5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12.30 p.m.

Berlin Declaration (debate)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Berlin Declaration.
I should just like to start by making a brief statement myself, as requested by the Chairman and coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The Declaration on the future of Europe to be adopted on 25 March 2007 in Berlin could represent an important milestone on the road to a stronger, forward-looking Europe.
The Conference of Presidents has instructed me to represent the European Parliament in the negotiations on the Berlin Declaration.
Whilst doing so, I have been exchanging views intensively with, and continually informing, the Bureau of Parliament, the Group Chairmen and, in particular, the Chairman and coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
In addition, I am having my third meeting with the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the coordinators today to discuss these issues.
The aim of today's plenary debate is to discuss the issue with all the Members of this House, and also with the Council and the Commission.
It is also very important that I take away from today's debate some suggestions and comments for the coming talks with the German Presidency.
The Berlin Declaration, which is still being negotiated, is to consist of four chapters.
The first of these is to pay tribute briefly to the achievements since 1957, with particular mention of the key achievements of peace, prosperity and stability, the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law in the course of enlargement, and the ending of the division of the continent.
The second chapter is to be dedicated to the main features of European integration and cooperation: equal rights and obligations in the Member States, and also transparency and subsidiarity as fundamental elements of the Community method.
The third chapter will be of crucial importance as regards the core values on which European integration is founded.
It should be emphasised in particular that human beings, whose dignity is inviolable, are central to all policy-making.
I emphasised this also during the discussions over dinner last Thursday evening at the Summit of Heads of State or Government.
Human beings are the beginning and end of politics.
The principle of solidarity should also feature prominently: this is an essential element of European integration and, from the current perspective, represents a current challenge also in the field of energy.
Finally, the fourth chapter is to set out the challenges for the future, such as energy policy, the fight against climate change, the common foreign and security policy, internal security, civil rights and the preservation - by means of greater economic success - of a societal outlook characterised by social responsibility.
With regard to the Berlin Declaration and the subsequent discussion on the future of the Constitutional Treaty, Parliament must leave no doubt in anybody's mind that the European Parliament supports the Constitutional Treaty.
We want to see the substance of the Constitutional Treaty, including the section on values, become a legal and political reality.
(Applause)
I should like to conclude by emphasising that the Berlin Summit is not merely a gathering of governments, as was the case 50 years ago, but a conference at which both the European Parliament and the Commission will participate.
All three institutions will be represented by their Presidents, who will sign the Declaration on the future of the Union and each make a speech.
The achievements of the last 50 years have been exceptional; but, 50 years on, Europe needs a new departure.
Together we must summon up the courage and will to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure and a great honour to address you today for the first time as representative of the Presidency at the plenary session of the European Parliament.
As the President has pointed out, on 25 March, the European Union will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome.
This is a special day, a day on which we should pause for a few hours in our day-to-day political business to look back at the story of European integration - a unique success story, in my opinion - and also to look forward and ask ourselves how we Europeans can find answers to the pressing issues of our time.
We can be proud of what the people of Europe have achieved in the past 50 years, and so 25 March should be a day of confidence, above all.
The European Parliament has made a vital contribution to shaping the process of European integration.
Many successes would not have been possible without the persistence and commitment of the Members of the European Parliament in standing up for more integration, for more democracy and transparency within the EU.
Our Presidency supports constructive cooperation with the European Parliament based on trust.
Thus far, Parliament has supported us to the best of its ability, and for this I should like to express my most particular thanks at this point.
This support also applies to the preparations for the Berlin Declaration to be adopted on 25 March as a joint declaration by the three European institutions: the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and the European Commission.
Parliament and the Commission have made a committed, active contribution to drawing up this Declaration from the outset.
I am obliged to the President and all the Members of this House for the confidence you have shown in the Presidency in this important matter.
I am also obliged to you for endorsing the procedure we suggested: I know from my talks and discussions in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs how hard it has been for some of you to do so.
I really am, then, most grateful for your confidence in the procedure.
Our Presidency has resolved to strengthen public confidence in and support for Europe.
To this end, we need dialogue, and to this end we have been listening very carefully to the public in recent weeks and months.
We invited citizens selected at random to what proved to be highly successful national conferences in Berlin, with the aim of learning what they hope for from the EU.
As I see it, one thing is clear: if we want to win people over to Europe, we must give specific examples showing how they stand to benefit from European integration.
We must work to ensure that the EU takes up the challenges of the future, and we must offer convincing solutions.
As the President has just pointed out, the European Council on 8 and 9 March showed that the EU is capable of action even with 27 Member States, including in the fields in which the public particularly expects it to; for example energy and the fight against climate change.
The success of the Spring Summit gives us confidence as we continue our Presidency.
We wish to take advantage of this tailwind for the Berlin Declaration, too.
The Summit rightly sent out the message that, if we Europeans find the strength to act together, we can actively shape the future.
At the dinner for the Heads of State or Government on 8 March - which Commission President Barroso and you, Mr President, also attended - Chancellor Merkel described our ideas, as developed in the course of detailed discussions with representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the national governments.
The text of the Declaration is yet to be finalised, of course, and I can assure you that what I have heard in today's debate here will of course be included in our deliberations on the final version.
As I have already told the committees, we want the text of our Declaration marking the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome to be brief and coherent, using language accessible to citizens.
What should the key points be?
We want to start the Declaration by paying tribute to the common achievements of the past 50 years in Europe; which include, of course, peace, stability, prosperity and the ending of the division of the continent.
These would not have been possible were it not for the desire for freedom of the people of Central and Eastern Europe, to which we should like to pay tribute specifically in the Declaration.
(Applause)
As I see it, the successes of European integration also include the forms and principles of our cooperation in Europe: democracy and the rule of law, equality of rights and obligations in the Member States, transparency and subsidiarity.
These principles are a model for regional cooperation in other parts of the world - in this, too, we can take a little pride.
The subsequent part of the Declaration will contain a joint declaration of commitment to the key values: human dignity, freedom and responsibility, mutual solidarity, diversity, and tolerance and respect in our dealings with each other.
After all, we know that the EU is more than just a common economic space.
It is also a community of values, and this basis in common values, possibly along with a common outlook on life, is an important precondition for Europe's remaining capable of action as a political entity.
The challenges that we in Europe will have to take up and overcome together in the 21st century will of course lie at the heart of the Declaration.
These include energy and the fight against climate change, they include a functioning common foreign and security policy, and they also, of course, entail our countering the threats posed by terrorism and organised crime effectively without restricting human and civil rights in the process.
Of course, these also entail our finding common solutions to deal with illegal immigration.
One message strikes me as particularly important, however, if we wish to reinforce the confidence of the people of Europe once again: Europe stands for a social model that marries economic competitiveness with social and environmental responsibility.
Freedom to conduct a business and worker rights and participation are equally part of the European experience.
The EU has a social side, and we feel that the European social dimension, too, should be highlighted in the Declaration.
The European Heads of State or Government made an express declaration of commitment to this also in last Friday's conclusions.
We all know that the EU must continue its process of reform and renewal.
In some two years' time, the next elections to the European Parliament will be taking place, and the electorate is entitled to know what instruments and means of action the EU will have at its disposal.
Consequently, we should like to see the Declaration include a common commitment to working on the necessary preconditions for this.
Allow me to say a few words by way of conclusion.
The 50th anniversary represents an opportunity for us all to build up strength for the challenges that lie ahead.
On this day, let us emphasise the things that unify us.
Let us take advantage of the symbolism of this day to send out a signal of unity.
Our Presidency's motto is 'Europe - succeeding together'.
The people of Europe expect European politicians to show the will, courage and resolve to act together.
This is the spirit in which we intend to proceed to the second half of our Presidency; and for this I ask your continued support.
(Applause)
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, President-in-Office, honourable Members, the meeting in Berlin on 25 March is an important occasion.
Fifty years of European integration is certainly worth a celebration.
It is an occasion to highlight all that unites us and to emphasise our common values and principles.
But we can make it even more important by looking forward as much as we look back.
This is an opportunity to put forward our shared objectives and ambitions, to underline our mutual respect and solidarity, and to reiterate our determination to build a better and stronger Union for the benefit of all Europeans.
That is why the Commission took the initiative in May last year to suggest an Interinstitutional Declaration on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signature of the Treaty of Rome.
The German Presidency has been working hard to find a text which meets a number of different goals.
We all agree that the text should be short and accessible, and that it should be an easy read with a shelf-life of more than a few days or weeks.
We all agree that it should celebrate the achievements of 50 years of European integration, but also look ahead to inspire Europeans for the future.
We all want to see reflected in the text what it is that makes Europe special for us, in what we value and in how we work.
This is not an easy task, but we are in excellent hands with Chancellor Merkel, Foreign Minister Steinmeier and their competent staff.
I think that the decision to directly involve both the European Parliament and the European Commission has proved fully justified.
The discussions that we have had between the Parliament and the Commission and with civil society representatives have provided valuable food for thought that can contribute to the overall reflection and to the essential work of the Presidency.
The bilateral discussions and the exchange at the European Council last week have pointed to a broad consensus on the purpose, scope and flavour of the Declaration.
The end result will be a truly European commitment to move forward.
Much of the discussion in these final days will be centring on how to give the right flavour to the text on the Union's future ambitions.
In January President Barroso set out in this House our thinking on some key points.
Last week's European Council should give us renewed confidence that we need not be shy.
We can be both ambitious and credible.
The European Union can and will continue to be a motor for positive change in Europe and across the world.
We believe that the text should be concrete without being too specific.
It should reflect the genius of the European Union in striking the right balance between the general and the particular, the common and the individual.
We promote growth and economic development within a strong social framework.
We enhance security and we promote individual rights.
We work hard to support the interests of Europeans, but with a keen sense of responsibility to the global community, as Minister Steinmeier also just explained.
This is sometimes misunderstood as recipe for a lowest-common-denominator Europe.
This is wrong.
It is rather a practical recognition of the fact that in a complex, fast-moving world we have to be light on our feet and we have to find new solutions to deep-seated challenges.
This is exactly what we are now doing on climate change and energy.
It is also important to give a sense that the European Union is defined not only by what Europe does, but how the Union works.
Democracy, transparency and accountability are important guiding principles for the Union of today.
It would be an important signal for the Member States and the institutions to underline the Union's commitment to a democratic way of working.
The Berlin meeting comes exactly half way through the German Presidency and represents an important stepping stone on the path to a relaunch of the treaty review to strengthen the institutions of the European Union.
It follows an exceptionally successful European Council meeting last week, a European Council which has proven doomsayers wrong and has demonstrated that a European Union of 27 is just as strong and bold as its earlier incarnations.
Enlargement has added purpose and dynamism to our work and I am convinced that it can continue to do so.
As we look ahead, the June European Council will provide the other key test.
Can we agree an outline on the way forward for the constitutional and institutional debate?
Last week's work will certainly help.
It has surely helped to put to rest the myth that the European Union is in some way obsessed with navel-gazing and detached from citizens' real concerns.
The message should come out loud and clear that, if we are concerned about our institutions, it is because we want them to work well so that we can deliver on our citizens' expectations and meet high standards of democracy.
To conclude, I believe we are on track for a Declaration in Berlin on 25 March which meets the goals sketched out by the Commission last May, endorsed by the European Council and backed by this House.
It will bring a momentum and urgency to the efforts to settle the constitutional and institutional debate.
It will mobilise the efforts of all-round core priorities, it will show a European Union united in its commitment to meet the aspirations of our citizens and to bring to the future work of the Union the same dynamism and achievement that we have enjoyed for 50 years of the European adventure.
(Applause)
Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has discussed the Berlin Declaration three times.
We have sent you a written copy of the results for your negotiations with the German Presidency.
I believe it is quite possible to reach agreement on three of the five chapters.
The successes and achievements of the past speak for themselves.
The EU is a major project for peace, a major project for freedom and a recipe for prosperity and security for citizens - and this should be expressed in the Declaration.
It should also be easy to agree on our values; after all, they are laid down in the Constitutional Treaty.
Besides the classic values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, we consider solidarity and equality particularly important.
In this connection, the Berlin Declaration should not talk of a 'European way of life', but of the European social model, which we wish to retain and continue applying in future.
This particular model of individual freedom coupled with collective security is the specific aspect that defines the social models in Europe.
I think that the challenges for the future are also obvious.
These have been mentioned, and there is no need to specify them all.
We are confronted with a handful of huge problems of significance; and indeed an excellent response was given at last week's Summit to the issue of climate change.
It is more difficult when it comes to describing the EU's distinguishing features.
In this regard, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the European Parliament would like to see the Berlin Declaration contain a declaration of commitment to the Community method.
The Community method distinguishes the EU from all other international organisations, as it gives Parliament, the directly elected representative body of 500 million citizens, the same right of codecision as the Council of Ministers whenever we make laws, standards or rules for the people of our Member States.
We should like the Community method to become the standard method, including in the second and third pillars, so that laws are no longer made by governments without the involvement of the citizens' representative body.
The litmus test of the Berlin Declaration will be the fifth part of government commitments.
This part will show whether everything that has been set down in writing previously was meant seriously, and the public will be paying particular attention to this.
I believe that we need an affirmation that the previous Treaties are insufficient, and that the EU needs a new basis, putting new means at its disposal.
We must declare our commitment to the new Treaty.
Anything less than this global compromise would be insufficient.
The Council President showed courage at last week's Summit on climate change.
I hope she will show the same courage when it comes to the Berlin Declaration, as this courage in March will pay off at the Summit in June.
I wish the German Presidency every success.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, ever since it was formed, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always advocated a more integrated, more united Europe.
We have always worked to strengthen Europe and to create a political, ambitious Europe.
What has always united us is the safeguarding of values and the promotion of freedoms, not least the freedom to do business, to work and to benefit from the fruits of one's work, as well as the guarantee of security.
The Treaty of Rome is the foundation for the European structure.
It is what has ensured that war between our countries is from now on not only impossible, but also unthinkable.
For me, as a child, war was simply a reality.
I am pleased and proud that, in our part of the world, and because we wanted it to be so, war has become an abstract concept.
As I say to our young people, nothing is ever won forever, just as nothing is ever lost forever.
However, we are not all equal where this success is concerned.
While all the nations of Europe fought for freedom, peace and prosperity, a number of them had to endure 50 years of dictatorship, loss of freedom and insecurity under the yoke of Communism.
The countries of central and eastern Europe did not rest until they had bridged this artificial gap, their aim being to re-integrate their birth families and to allow Europe finally to operate at full strength.
I should like to pay an admiring and affectionate tribute in this House to the nations and citizens of these countries.
Without them, without the 1956, 1968 and 1980 revolutions, Europe would never have been able to experience that 'velvet revolution' of the end of the 1980s.
And the Berlin Wall would no doubt still be the disgrace of our continent.
We should also remember that the year 2007 marks not only the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, but also the 60th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.
Without the help of the Americans, without their decisive commitment to help Europeans, the Schuman Declaration and the Treaty of Rome would have encountered further obstacles.
The last 50 years have been a success, and this story has had a happy ending with the reunification of the continent.
Nevertheless, I believe that, if we so wish, this century can also be a largely European century.
As the foundation of the European Union, the Treaty of Rome is history's most successful undertaking in terms of encouraging people to live together.
Our continent has thus become a place not of division, but of similarities and reconciliations.
Indeed, the European Union involves more than just the export of goods and services.
It also conveys our values.
We act as a stabilising force.
Was it not the prospect of closer cooperation that led to peace being restored in South-East Europe?
The next 50 years will, however, be full of fresh challenges for all our countries.
We are not starting from scratch, far from it.
The first condition of success is to restore our confidence, to be aware of our strengths and to draw on our resources.
The second condition of success, in an unstable, globalised world, is to be realistic, to make firm, enthusiastic efforts to adapt and to do so without delay.
However, adapting does not mean grovelling and giving up on who we are.
Reforming does not mean grovelling and letting ourselves be deprived of our identity.
Europeans have a highly developed sense of human dignity and of respect for the individual.
Moreover, with the social market economy, Europe is presenting an idea for organising society that is very far removed from the 'every man for himself' approach and from the excesses of a consumer society.
The decision adopted during last week's European Council is to set common and ambitious objectives in the field of energy and climate change.
The current context is characterised by five key challenges: demographics, globalisation, multipolarity, energy and global warming, without forgetting the fight against terrorism.
In a globalised world in which new focal points are emerging rapidly - I am thinking of Asia, and also of Brazil - Europe must react by means of economic and social reforms.
Europe must make the most of its history and develop its social model.
In an uncertain world, in which terrorism has become an everyday reality, Europe must show both firmness and determination; it cannot be held hostage by terror.
Ladies and gentlemen, those are the values that we are handing down after 50 years of European integration.
Those are the challenges that we have to address from a fresh perspective.
As far as we, the PPE-DE Group, are concerned, it is only by having faith in their abilities to create and adapt that future generations will be able to develop and thrive in this new world.
Our role is modest, admittedly, but it is demanding too.
In this period of transition, let us avoid standstills, let us take the right path and, together, let us lay solid foundations.
A task such as this requires not only clear thinking, but also political courage.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not yet know the text of the Berlin Declaration, and so it makes sense to discuss not the text, but the context of this Declaration.
Listening to the speeches by the President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and even Mr Daul or Mr Leinen, we can all tell that a degree of uncertainty surrounds this text, as expectations of it are very high.
Why is this the case?
Why are so many expectations vested in a text that may just be one among many?
The answer is quite simple: because we all have the feeling that we are at a crossroads.
European integration may continue as successfully as it has in the last 50 years, or we may take a different path leading away from European integration and into an uncertain future of renationalisation and the risks this entails.
We all have a feeling of uncertainty, and so this Berlin Declaration needs to do something that may be possible with a very short text, namely send out a message of hope, that what we have tackled successfully in the last 50 years will continue to be possible in future.
One thing is certain, however, and that is that we shall no longer be able to content ourselves with describing the successes of the last 50 years.
That is regrettable but true.
I shall illustrate why I think this is regrettable with reference to the words of Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg.
In his acceptance speech for the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, he said that Adolf Hitler was as remote to his children as William II was to him.
This is the danger.
As history marches on, the risks increasingly fade: the risks of intolerance, hatred, ethnic exclusion, all the dangers of territorial aspirations that we believed had been overcome but have not been - they are all still there.
They are even here in this House: those propagandists of this demon.
Nevertheless, we must ask ourselves why the younger generation is not fighting as enthusiastically for the integration responsible for overcoming this hatred as is Joseph Daul.
The reason is that it is history.
If we want to prevent history repeating itself we must say to the younger generation, in particular, that these are our achievements, and it is all right to make the demands they are making of us and to take peace for granted - but we need new methods if we are to guarantee it over the long term.
Guaranteeing it over the long term will mean protecting the earth's climate.
If ever more areas of this earth become uninhabitable, there will be ever increasing migration flows, which will increasingly destabilise peace.
In the past, securing peace meant integration.
In the future, securing peace will mean reversing climate change.
Social stability entails young people being safe in the knowledge that they have a real chance of finding decent work with a decent income, enabling them to live a decent life.
The members of the younger generation are like the older in that they do not entertain hopes of becoming millionaires.
Whilst that is a nice dream, what people really want is to be able to marry or cohabit in a long-term relationship and have children in the knowledge that they will grow up in peace and have social prospects as we do.
They want Europe to offer them this in our globalised world.
There is a third thing they want, and that is education and qualifications, as we all know that whereas, in the past, securing a decent pension and decent health insurance were seen as essentials in life that needed to be safeguarded, the access to education and qualifications will take on this role in the future.
If Europe wants to become the most competitive knowledge-based continent, it cannot succeed in this without well-educated people who undergo lifelong learning.
Thus, education and qualifications become the building blocks of a secure social future.
This means that what integration - territorial and geographic, economic and social - has been in the last 50 years, climate change, education, qualifications and decent work must be in the next 50.
This can be summed up in a short text.
The shorter and more concise the text, the easier it will be to convey the message.
The success of the last 50 years came about in its own way; the success of the next 50 will require new methods.
If, supported by the desire for integration of 27 countries, we succeed in expressing this in the Declaration, we shall be taking the right direction at the crossroads at which we are now standing.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, a significant birthday is always a good occasion to take stock.
Fifty years ago at the signing of the Treaty of Rome, what was in the minds of Europeans?
Well, hope, undoubtedly; optimism, perhaps; but the certainty of success - far from it.
And yet the European Union is at the base of the security, prosperity and opportunity which our people now enjoy.
We live in a Europe of freedom and security, of prosperity and opportunity and of societies and economies more open than ever before.
Our generation has aspired to, and achieved, more than our parents could ever have dreamt of.
But the Berlin Declaration must reflect less our pride in the past, more our determination for the future.
President-in-Office, the process is depressingly opaque.
Everybody likes a surprise on their birthday, but to debate a declaration without even a draft is bizarre!
You hinted at what it might contain, President-in-Office.
You assure us that the spin doctors in the Bundeskanzleramt are still hard at work, and yet the chance to debate the text will be limited at best, so do not be surprised if many of us feel we are being bounced.
We want a declaration that looks ahead to the challenges we face, that gives us an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the values, the aims, the future of the European Union - one which will bring our citizens back on board the European project at a time when more than ever our nations must act together.
An enlarged and open Europe needs greater solidarity between its nations and its citizens; economic reform, as recognised at the European Council; and a wider mission to project our values in the world.
Faced with the global challenges of world population growth and migration, of climate change, of internationally-organised crime and terrorism, the Declaration gives Member States the opportunity to explain to citizens why now, more than ever, the EU is so important, why we have to engage with countries beyond our borders and cultures beyond our ken.
Europeans should not be afraid of this.
What has made Europe strong is its openness.
A retreat into fortress Europe, the anachronistic idea of nation states and protected economies, or Christian fundamentalism, would only catapult us back in time: a time when Europeans had only one citizenship, only one national identity.
Our advice to the German Presidency is: keep it short and simple - the kind of text one might nail on to the door of a church in Wittenberg.
Or if the Chancellor is too busy to go that far, at least on the Wittenbergplatz!
I hear that the draft is currently running to two pages.
If that is true, it is already one page too long.
My Liberal and Democrat colleagues in the Committee of the Regions have produced a one-page mission statement for the European Union, which I commend to you.
Nine points says all that needs to be said: that European integration has been a success and that we must continue.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 9 May 1950, in his historic declaration to the press in the Salon de l'Horloge in Paris, Robert Schuman said: 'Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity'.
The fifty years since the signing of the treaties have witnessed many achievements and common policies.
Political Europe is lacking, however, despite the ever more evident need to create it, whilst respecting the national States.
Without a foreign and defence policy the Union will remain weakened: its negotiating power in international relations does not correspond to the size and importance of our economy.
Today, our first objective remains the relaunch of the debate for a new treaty - for the new treaty - without forgetting the refusal by two founding States and the ratification achieved by the majority of the Member States.
A Union of 27 cannot operate with rules that were already restricting for the Fifteen.
We must improve the legislative function, resolve the gridlock on decision-making and the excessive complexity of the laws, and clarify roles.
In addition, the issue of our values and their historical and cultural roots, from Greco-Roman history to Judeo-Christian traditions, to the establishment of the secular and liberal State, must be re-examined and reaffirmed.
Guarantees for the future can only grow from dialogue between cultures, but in order to dialogue with others we must first know and recognise ourselves.
The future of Europe cannot escape the realisation that the present is different from that of fifty years ago.
The problem of immigration, particularly illegal immigration, reaches dangerous limits and has changed the face of our cities.
The presence of different cultures requires that we make additional efforts to ensure dialogue and to demand respect for the rules.
A common policy is needed, together with willingness on the part of the Member States to guarantee borders, internal order and respect for human rights.
The problem of immigration must be tackled in the context of democracy and legality, in respect of human dignity and with common rules: without the recognition of human dignity there is no true civilisation.
Another aspect of our future is that of mutual respect for trade rules.
Problems of forgery and dumping, the question of origin marking and mutual respect for the rules are issues that must be tackled and resolved decisively, if we want to prevent an unfair market from destroying the Union's production sectors and doing long-term damage to emerging or developing countries also, with disastrous consequences in terms of unemployment and social policies.
The liberalisation of world trade must go hand in hand with the guarantee that welfare policies, acquired by European workers, will be maintained and may be applied gradually but inevitably even in those countries that lack them today.
'The contribution that an organised and living Europe can bring to civilisation is indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations', Schuman declared in 1950, saying: 'world peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers that threaten it'.
The threat of terrorism, fed by jihadist fundamentalism, hangs over the whole world: more than ever, our efforts must be courageous and creative.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know the basis for your confidence, Mr President-in-Office, but I do know that it is possible to talk of confidence without having any.
We are discussing Europe's successes, yes, but, if we talk about wealth and stability, we must also talk about poverty - which does exist in Europe.
I have heard nothing about that so far today.
Also, when we talk about the rule of law, we must also talk about those citizens who have no rights in Europe.
This is often forgotten, and I shall come back to it.
On the subject of confidence in the procedure, well, I belong to the political group of those who have no confidence in the procedure.
Secretiveness does not square with dialogue and democratic openness - it is impossible.
I tell you: I do not believe in these sherpas, or in confessionals, or in all these antics, as it must ultimately be revealed to the public where the contradictions between individuals in Europe lie.
We have seen it with the French referendum; we have seen it in the Netherlands.
If we do not carry the European people with us - that is, hold public discussions about problem areas - they will not come on board.
I tell you: the text should be short and simple, but without being banal.
That is the danger of your strategy: the banality that will result from it.
This is my advice.
You have talked about the climate, so be bold about it.
Formulate the objectives quite clearly so we can understand them. The objectives are as follows.
A climate target of no more than two degrees of warming must be included for the next 50 years, as must a more efficient use of resources - not just energy but also water, paper, copper and aluminium - and, in 50 years' time, the EU should be generating 100% of its energy from renewable sources.
These are objectives that would make people say: Aha! You really have plans.
I am eager to see what is in your text.
Furthermore, when you talk about the climate, you must say that we need a stability pact.
We must enable the Commission to intervene when countries fail to abide by the rules - as with the Stability and Growth Pact for the single currency.
Binding targets without sanctions do not exist even in my educational theory - and that is really liberal.
These are the only way of ensuring compliance.
There was one thing that made me wince, Mr President-in-Office.
You said that one of the points was the fight against illegal immigration.
Before saying a word about the 50 million legal immigrants living in Europe, who need the same rights as all Europeans, you went straight to the illegal immigrants.
That is Europe's problem - we do not recognise these people, we always subsume them under the heading 'illegal'.
Do not think that this is a minor problem.
There is a small European country that is so proud of the French Revolution, yet one of the leading presidential candidates has just proposed the creation of a ministry for immigration and national identity.
That is the danger threatening Europe, namely our viewing immigrants as a threat to our European identity.
You are shaking your head - but rather than just travelling to ministries, you should listen to the discussions on this subject in Europe's cafÃ©s and bars for once.
That is where the people of Europe are to be found.
We are wrong if we only ever speak about illegal immigration rather than about the people who can be integrated into European life.
I winced at this, as I thought, 'Oh lÃ  lÃ , what is he going to say now?'
I should like to conclude by making one thing quite clear. Let us take pride in the fundamental values we have set down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This includes taking pride in those values: freedom of sexual orientation, freedom for minorities, freedom for human beings.
These are the things I want to see in the Berlin Declaration, rather than some reference to God or anyone else who does not concern us here.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the fact that the Union has decided to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its construction is not only normal, in my opinion, but may also prove useful, since we are seizing this opportunity to look clearly at the progress made and are learning inevitably contradictory lessons from this experience.
On the other hand, if this anniversary were to take the form of a simple celebration of a jubilee designed to extol all the decisions that governed the EU's construction and to glorify all of its results, without distinction, then, as far as historical analyses are concerned, it would be of very little importance and, in terms of political effectiveness, it would be a complete waste of time.
Well, all the signs are that the famous Berlin Declaration, in the spirit of its initiators, opts for the latter, starting with the method used to draft it: where there should have been a consultation that was largely open to the citizens, it was decided that leaders would debate more or less behind closed doors.
In my view, this is a mistake.
A second element concerns the very substance of the declaration.
It would seem, in actual fact, that what is in store for us is a very general text, focusing on an inevitably brilliant and exemplary review of 50 years of European integration, on naturally very generous common values and on inevitably ambitious objectives, particularly in the social sphere.
Do you really believe that the reality experienced by our fellow citizens is as flawless as that?
For my part, I firmly believe that no debate whatsoever on Europe will have a real impact today if it is not accompanied by a good dose of criticism regarding the causes of the crisis of confidence that has been raging for some years now in virtually all circles of public opinion and throughout the European institutions.
It is no longer just my group that is finding this.
It is eminent political officials involved in overseeing the Union's affairs who, in private or in small groups, recognise that a problem exists, between Europe as it is developing today and Europeans.
The last such person to recognise this was none other than your colleague, Mr President, the President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, Mr SteinbrÃŒck, who recently referred to the risk - I quote - 'of a crisis of legitimacy of the European economic and social model', and he is right.
We therefore need to talk about this if we are to restore meaning to the great European adventure.
Thus, because I want the Union to provide itself with the means to come out of this crisis on top, I, together with my group, call for a shake-up, so that, when we come to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, talk will turn to the changes needed to pave the way for a genuine revival of the European project.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, it is a fairly typical morning in Euroland: everybody is busy slapping themselves on the back and saying what a fantastic success the last 50 years have been.
There is almost a religious belief that these institutions can deal with the world's problems, so much so that one or two speakers here think that the Berlin Declaration may even be able to control the weather in the future!
However, I have noticed a slight change of emphasis: you are all talking much more now about freedom, democracy, rights and values, as if it was the European Union that had invented these very things.
I suspect you are doing that because you do not want to do the real critical analysis of whether this project is working.
Just think of the economics.
The United States of America reached the EU's current level of GDP per capita in 1985.
